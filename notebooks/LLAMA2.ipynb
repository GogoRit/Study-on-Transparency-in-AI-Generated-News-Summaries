I AGREE ENGLISH FOR AFRICA Programs Cardinal Tong calls for promoting a culture of life CHURCH Hong Kong protecting life science and technology Coronavirus Hong Kong Cardinal advocates for promoting a culture of life In his message for Pro-Life Day 2020, Cardinal John Tong of Hong Kong urges Christians to promote a culture of life, as the Church marks the 25th anniversary of the encyclical Evangelium Vitae. By Vatican News Cardinal John Tong, the Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong, has invited Christians to revisit the notion of the culture of life. His invitation came in a message ahead of Pro-Life Day 2020, which this year coincides with the 25th anniversary of the promulgation of Pope St. John Paul IIs 1995 encyclical, Evangelium Vitae The Gospel of Life. In the past seven months, noted Cardinal Tong, the pandemic Covid-19 has claimed the lives of over 810,000 persons and infected more than 23.5 million persons worldwide. This disaster drives us to reflect on the values and meaning of life and treasure them more. The encyclical, The Gospel of Life, is meant to be a precise and vigorous reaffirmation of the value of human life and its inviolability, and at the same time, a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God respect, protect, love and serve life, every human life! said Cardinal Tong, citing Evangelium Vitae. Cardinal Tong also explained that the fourth Pro-Life Day was postponed to 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of our Lady, because its original day - the feast of the Visitation - fell on 31 May 2020, which was also Pentecost Sunday. Covid-19 and the culture of death Cardinal Tong noted that, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some countries adopted some policies and attitudes that treated the pandemic lightly like the common flu or by handling it with the approach of herd immunity. These attitudes, he said, devalued our vulnerable brothers and sisters, caused us to neglect our responsibility to care for our brothers and sisters properly, and intensified the impact of the culture of death. Contrasting this with the encyclical Evangelium Vitae, Cardinal Tong said that St. John Paul II invited us to contemplate the meaning of life, its greatness and fantasy, respecting that everyone has a right to life. This reflection should, in turn, lead us to do goodlove and care for others, as the value of a person is not determined by any categories but simply because heshe is a person irrespective of any disability or incapability. He hailed the sacrifice of many priests who, in spite of infection rates, continued to visit coronavirus patients often at the risk of getting infected themselves. They live our Jesuss words, he said, no one has greater love than this, to lay down ones life for ones friends John 15 13. Promoting a new culture of life To foster a new culture of life, the Cardinal stressed on the importance of obeying Gods commandment Thou shall not kill. Obedience to this commandment, he further explained, includes not being angry with our brother, preaching the Gospel of life and supporting all the programmes, organizations and teachings that promote the values of life and serve the gospel of life. In this regard, human life is to be respected and treated as a gift from God, sacred and inviolable from conception to the time of natural death. Consequently, abortion and euthanasia are absolutely unacceptable as the value of life is based on giving and accepting love with the understanding that the conjugal acts of married couples are oriented to the procreation of life. Important also is the formation of conscience, noted the Cardinal, especially as our societies and mass media today are deeply influenced by the culture of death. He pointed out more education needs to be done to nourish a correct conscience in the face of a culture that causes confusion between good and evil, precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life. The role of family Cardinal Tong highlighted the important role of family as a sanctuary of life and the place where the couple welcomes a new life the gift of God. The family is also a place for daily individual and family prayers, to live out the gospel of life and for the special care of the elderly and the sick. In these capacities, he noted, the family has an indispensable role in fostering the culture of life. Science, technology in service of human life Cardinal Tong said that science and technology can be used in the service of human life and its integrity, insisting that advancements in biotechnology need to be understood in order to be used for the promotion and protection of life. In this regard, he acknowledged the role of the Bioethics Resource Center of the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Theology and Philosophy, the Diocesan Pastoral Commission for Marriage and Family, and Catholic schools which identify life as one of their core educational values. He also recommended the Creighton Model Fertility Care System for couples who are having difficulties in achieving pregnancies and natural family planning services for couples preparing to have children. Pointing out that contemporary society is torn between a culture of life and a culture of death, Cardinal Tong called for critical thinking that is capable of discerning true values and authentic needs to build a culture of life. In conclusion, he urged everyone to love and respect every human life, walk forward patiently and courageously, to foster the culture of life which is the fruit of truth and love.

To help address issues, like overpopulation, high rates of teen pregnancy and the rise of HIV, the Philippines is gradually implementing sex education and accessibility to contraceptives. Reproductive Health Act The Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 RH Act after a 14-year wait. Through the act, the government integrated sex education into the public school curriculum for students ages 10 to 19. The Philippines also gave funding for free or subsidized contraceptives at health centers and public schools. The government passed the RH Act in response to the many health issues impacting the country, such as infant mortality, pregnancy-related deaths and a rise in HIVAIDS cases. Moreover, teen pregnancies in the Philippines are common, where 9 of women between the ages of 15 and 19 start child bearing. Lack of knowledge about reproductive health is significantly associated with poverty, especially in regard to overpopulation. Therefore, the RH Act aims to help the population make informed decisions about their reproductive health. It provides more equal access to sex education, while also ensuring that the government reaffirms its commitment to protecting womens reproductive rights, providing accessible family planning information, and hiring skilled maternal health professionals to work in both urban and rural areas of the Philippines. Opposition from the Catholic Church Around 80 of the Philippine population identifies as Roman Catholic. Accordingly, the Catholic Church largely influences the state of sex education in the country. The Catholic Church opposes sex outside of marriage and fears sex education will increase sexual relations. The Catholic Church consequently remains critical of the RH Act, increasing difficulties in putting the RH Act into concrete action. Additionally, the Catholic Church opposes implementing sex education in schools as well as the distribution of contraceptives. The Church prefers to rely on parents to teach their kids about reproductive health. However, many families are either unequipped to do so or will not address the subject directly with their children. The Implementation of the RH Act In an effort to reduce the countrys rate of poverty, Philippine President, Rodrigo Duerte, ordered the government to provide access to free contraceptives for six million women in 2017. Duerte aimed to fulfill unmet family planning needs. This came after a restraining order was placed on the RH Act in 2015. However, the government appealed to lift the restraining order to continue applying the RH Act and addressing issues due to overpopulation. In 2019, Save the Children Philippines an organization with the purpose of supporting Filipino children advocated for the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention bill. The organization also fought for requiring schools to fully integrate Comprehensive Sexuality Education CSE into their curriculum. Save the Children Philippines hopes to combat the countrys high rate of teen pregnancy. CSE in the Philippines includes topics such as consent, sexual violence, contraceptives and others. The bill would also advance access to reproductive health services, further supplementing the goals of the RH Act. Increased Conversation Surrounding Sex Education In addition to greater governmental action, there are various organizations that are working to increase access to sex education and services in the Philippines. The Roots of Health is a nongovernmental organization that provides sex education to women in Palawan and Puerto Princesa. Started in 2009, the founders, Dr. Susan Evangelista and Amina Evangelista Swanepoel, initially provided reproductive health classes at Palawan State University in Puerto Princesa and have since expanded into free clinical services for young women. The Roots of Health provides services that assist with birth, reproductive healthcare, contraceptives, prenatal and postpartum check-ups, and ultrasounds. By 2018, they served 20,000 women and adolescents in the Palawan and Puerto Princesa communities, demonstrating that there is a growing grassroots movement towards reframing reproductive health in the Philippines. Sex education will remain a controversial subject in the Philippines. Nonetheless, it is a developing matter that is expected to evolve with continued conversations between governmental, faith and nongovernmental actors.

She had been feeling so great that she hadnt felt the need to bring her husband along to her 20-week scan in late November of last year, a few weeks after they publicly announced the pregnancy.But as the scan went on, St.Michel, who is a chiropractor, started to suspect that her fetuss arms looked a little off.

Now they want to punish traveling for abortions Moira DoneganRead moreThen St.Michel waited. And waited. She took a look at the fetuss vitals, still displayed on the screen, and many of the measurements were below 1. St.Michel started to get worried.Around 20 minutes later, the fetal medicine specialist walked in, along with someone else. The specialist introduced herself, and then told St.Michel that her colleague was a genetic counselor.Thats when St.Michel knew something was very, very wrong.The providers recommended that St.Michel call her husband to come to the appointment. After he arrived, they delivered the news the couples fetus had multiple severe genetic and developmental conditions affecting multiple organ systems. If the fetus survived to birth, the baby would immediately need palliative care.St.Michel could consult more specialists, continue the pregnancy a decision that, she later learned, could threaten her health or get an abortion. But she could not get the abortion in the state the procedure is banned in almost all circumstances in Idaho.Basically, all they could do was hand us a sheet of paper with abortion clinics in nearby states, St.Michel told the Guardian in an interview, as she started to cry.St.Michel is one of four women who, on Tuesday, sued Idaho in an attempt to clarify the states abortion ban and allow doctors to perform abortions in cases like hers. Two doctors and the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians have joined the lawsuit, which was brought on the plaintiffs behalf by the Center for Reproductive Rights.Idahos abortion bans have sown confusion, fear, and chaos among the medical community, resulting in grave harms to pregnant patients whose health and safety hang in the balance across the state, the lawsuit alleges. While Idahos abortion bans purport to contain medical exceptions, these so-called exceptions simply do not function as such in practice.Since the overturning of Roe v Wade allowed abortion bans across the country to take effect, doctors in Idaho and other states have said that the bans so-called medical exceptions are worded in opaque, non-medical language that they find impossible to interpret. These exceptions, they say, have forced them to merely watch until patients get sick enough that doctors can legally help.Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights also filed legal actions on Tuesday in Tennessee and Oklahoma, which have enacted near-total abortion bans, demanding specificity on how abortions should be handled in medical emergencies. The center has previously sued over the issue in Texas a judge in that case ruled in favor of the women denied care, but that decision has been paused while the case makes its way to the Texas supreme court.Idaho has one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country, Marc Hearron, the centers senior counsel, said on a press call on Tuesday. While some states allow abortions when peoples health may be at risk, Idaho does not. Under its near-total ban, abortions can only be performed when someones life is threatened.Doctors have started to flee Idaho in droves, and the state could soon find itself a pregnancy care desert. At least 13 reproductive health specialists and four fetal medicine specialists have stopped practicing in Idaho, Dr Emily Corrigan, one of the Idaho doctors involved in the lawsuit, wrote in a June article for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Two rural labor and delivery units have also closed.Our medical community here in Idaho is experiencing catastrophic loss that is going to take decades to fix once we get these laws improved. Were still in a terrible downward spiral right now, Corrigan told reporters on Tuesday. I have hope that the legislature will improve the law. Thats why Im still here. But I have to ask myself every single day if its worth it to stay here.After she got the news about the fetus, St.Michel called out of work for the rest of the week, she told the Guardian. She supports abortion rights, but hadnt thought she would ever need an abortion.Still, she decided she wanted one.At that point, I was feeling baby movement, fetal movement, St.Michel said.

During the appointment, she clutched a grainy ultrasound photo of her fetus, she recalled. It is the only photo she has.Among booking flights, a hotel room and a rental car, and the two-day procedure itself, St.Michel estimates that she and her husband spent between 3,500 and 4,000 ending her pregnancy.Im so, so grateful to them, to the clinic and how much compassion they showed me. But it still wasnt fair, she said That I had to be in that room by myself grieving for the loss of a pregnancy that we wanted so badly.Once they returned to Idaho, St.Michel told many people only that her family had experienced a loss.But months later, she no longer feels like she should keep what happened a secret.It wasnt a shameful thing that we did, she said.

Photograph Courtesy of Jillaine StMichelAfter the abortion, St.Michel and her husband debated whether to try for another baby. St.Michel did get pregnant again, and is due in January 2024, but the experience of being pregnant again is nerve-racking.What if something happens again? What if Im put in this situation again? she wondered. What if this time is worse and my life is at more imminent danger? Where does that leave us?St.Michel and her husband have weighed leaving the state. They love living in Idaho, but she cant ignore the burgeoning political climate in the Republican-dominated state. She wants to give her daughter a more compassionate upbringing and shes not sure if life in Idaho can provide that.St.Michel wears a diamond necklace every day, because diamond is the birthstone for April which would have been her due date. St.Michels daughter is too young to understand what happened, she said, but she sometimes picks up the necklace and asks about the fetus that would have been her sibling.Hopefully, when shes of age to comprehend some of this, things will be different here. Hopefully, this little case will be a thing of the past and Ill be able to say, Because of what happened, we were able to make changes for the better in this state, St.Michel said of her daughter.

English Important Links English Donate Your Sexual Health Find Services Get Out Quickly Main navigation About Us Resources What's New Global Work Take Action Campaigns Back Breadcrumb Home Policy Briefs Submissions Prioritizing the Neglected Areas of SRHR in Canadas Global COVID-19 Response by Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights As the world grapples with COVID-19 and an increasing number of countries are being affected by the pandemic, the role of Canada in international assistance remains as important as ever. In the face of this global health crisis, Canadas approach, guided by the Feminist International Assistance Policy FIAP, is crucial in ensuring a feminist and human-rights based response to COVID-19 that recognizes the gendered impacts of the pandemic and the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR at this time. Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights encourages the Government of Canada to ensure an integrated response to the virus that includes SRHR, with a particular focus on the neglected areas of SRHR, including abortion access, comprehensive contraceptive care, SRHR for adolescents and youth, including comprehensive sexuality education, and advocacy for SRHR. Sexual and reproductive health and rights underpin gender equality and are pivotal to good health. Evidence shows that when women are denied access to contraception, safe abortion and post-abortion care, maternal mortality rates rise. SRHR services are essential health care and must be accessible. A continued focus on the neglected areas of SRHR must also be part of the global response to COVID-19. In the FIAP, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of access to SRHR for women and girls in its humanitarian response. In the face of a global health crisis, it is time to action the policy and ensure that the needs of women and girls in the most underfunded and overlooked areas are a priority in the global response. A feminist approach to the pandemic includes addressing the unique impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized groups, including women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, people living with disabilities, the working poor, those already living in emergency and humanitarian settings, and many others who face discrimination and barriers to resources, healthcare, and social services. In times of crisis, these inequalities are exacerbated and compounded by new and additional hardships such as greater economic instability, increased gender-based violence GBV, and higher rates of unplanned pregnancies. Further, with women disproportionately represented on the frontlines of the pandemic as health workers and in caregiving role, women have an increased risk of contracting the virus. Why do the neglected areas of SRHR need to be prioritized in the global response to COVID-19? Access to contraception The demand for contraceptives does not change during times of crisis. However, mass disruptions to supply chains and the diversion of supplies to the COVID-19 response create new and additional barriers to access. Supply chain disruption applies to various forms of contraceptives including birth control pills, condoms, and devices, as well as access to emergency contraception. It is imperative that these basic and essential commodities be available and accessible throughout the pandemic. Without decreased access to contraception, it is expected that unplanned pregnancies will increase in the coming months, putting further strain on health systems and increasing demand for abortion. Other ways to increase access to contraception include easing administrative barriers. This includes not requiring a prescription, allowing contraceptives to be prescribed via telemedicine, allowing pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives, and by providing comprehensive cost coverage. In addition to contraception, supply chain disruption could have an effect on other SRHR related drugs, including antiretrovirals for those living with HIV, medical abortion pills, and antibiotics and other medications used to treat sexually transmitted infections. Safe abortion Abortion is an essential and time-sensitive procedure. However, in emergencies, it is often deprioritized, delayed or not offered at all as health systems are stretched thin and supplies and human resources are directed elsewhere. Lockdowns, social distancing and increased barriers to travel during the pandemic make it even harder for pregnant people to access abortion. Unfortunately, where safe abortion is not readily accessible, people will turn to unsafe abortion. Supply chain disruptions can also affect access to medical abortion also known as the abortion pill. A safe method to terminate pregnancy that requires minimal travel or exposure to the virus, many advocates and medical professionals are pushing for expanded access to medical abortion e.g. by removing legal and administrative barrier, allowing its use up to 12 weeks, and allowing prescriptions via telemedicine. SRHR for adolescents and youth The pandemic has forced the closure of schools in many countries, leaving billions of children and youth without access to education. Learning from past humanitarian crises, these interruptions can lead to increased drop-out rates, which disproportionately affects adolescent girls by furthering gender gaps in education and leading to increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy, and early and forced marriage. Outside of school, the caregiving burdens on young women and adolescents may increase. They may also lose access to health and hygiene services or products that are often offered through schools. The closure of schools also means that young people are being denied life-saving comprehensive sexuality education CSE. CSE is a key intervention to prevent childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence. When delivered properly, CSE can address persistent stigma, prejudice, and discrimination against the LGBTQI2S community and reduce homophobic and transphobic violence. This is critical knowledge that enables children and youth to keep themselves healthy and safe and should be accessible to all, even in times of crisis. Advocacy for SRHR Communities must be central in the COVID-19 response. Local mobilizers and organizations best know their communitys needs, including the unique needs of women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, and other vulnerable groups. Feminist, womens rights and youth organizations should be supported and meaningfully included in policymaking at all levels in the response to COVID-19, and in program design, delivery and monitoring. Amid government efforts to control movement and limit the spread of the virus, there has been an uptick in surveillance, censorship, and criminalization, putting civil liberties at risk. Human rights defenders drawing attention to these abuses, including health care workers, journalists, and other whistleblowers must be protected. Another threat to access to SRHR includes ideological attacks by policymakers using the pandemic to push through laws and restrictions that violate human rights. This includes everything from abortion restrictions to attacks on trans rights. As we face this unprecedented global health crisis, we urge Canada to maintain its global feminist leadership and commitment to SRHR in its international assistance. This means a continued focus on the most neglected areas of SRHR at a time pf heightened inequality to ensure uninterrupted access to these essential and lifesaving SRHR services.

In the face of this global health crisis, Canadas approach, guided by the Feminist International Assistance Policy FIAP, is crucial in ensuring a feminist and human-rights based response to COVID-19 that recognizes the gendered impacts of the pandemic and the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR at this time. Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights encourages the Government of Canada to ensure an integrated response to the virus that includes SRHR, with a particular focus on the neglected areas of SRHR, including abortion access, comprehensive contraceptive care, SRHR for adolescents and youth, including comprehensive sexuality education, and advocacy for SRHR. Sexual and reproductive health and rights underpin gender equality and are pivotal to good health. Evidence shows that when women are denied access to contraception, safe abortion and post-abortion care, maternal mortality rates rise. SRHR services are essential health care and must be accessible. A continued focus on the neglected areas of SRHR must also be part of the global response to COVID-19. In the FIAP, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of access to SRHR for women and girls in its humanitarian response. In the face of a global health crisis, it is time to action the policy and ensure that the needs of women and girls in the most underfunded and overlooked areas are a priority in the global response. A feminist approach to the pandemic includes addressing the unique impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized groups, including women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, people living with disabilities, the working poor, those already living in emergency and humanitarian settings, and many others who face discrimination and barriers to resources, healthcare, and social services. In times of crisis, these inequalities are exacerbated and compounded by new and additional hardships such as greater economic instability, increased gender-based violence GBV, and higher rates of unplanned pregnancies. Further, with women disproportionately represented on the frontlines of the pandemic as health workers and in caregiving role, women have an increased risk of contracting the virus. Why do the neglected areas of SRHR need to be prioritized in the global response to COVID-19? Access to contraception The demand for contraceptives does not change during times of crisis. However, mass disruptions to supply chains and the diversion of supplies to the COVID-19 response create new and additional barriers to access. Supply chain disruption applies to various forms of contraceptives including birth control pills, condoms, and devices, as well as access to emergency contraception. It is imperative that these basic and essential commodities be available and accessible throughout the pandemic. Without decreased access to contraception, it is expected that unplanned pregnancies will increase in the coming months, putting further strain on health systems and increasing demand for abortion. Other ways to increase access to contraception include easing administrative barriers. This includes not requiring a prescription, allowing contraceptives to be prescribed via telemedicine, allowing pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives, and by providing comprehensive cost coverage. In addition to contraception, supply chain disruption could have an effect on other SRHR related drugs, including antiretrovirals for those living with HIV, medical abortion pills, and antibiotics and other medications used to treat sexually transmitted infections. Safe abortion Abortion is an essential and time-sensitive procedure. However, in emergencies, it is often deprioritized, delayed or not offered at all as health systems are stretched thin and supplies and human resources are directed elsewhere.

Bill ClarkCQ Roll Call file photo By Sandhya Raman Posted January 22, 2020 at 600am Facebook Twitter Email Reddit Groups pushing for the advancement of abortion rights and those looking to limit the procedure have an ambitious agenda starting this week, foreshadowing a year that could be critical for advocates on both sides of the debate.In two months, the Supreme Court will hear its first major abortion case since 2016, and both sides are revving up for a major presidential election. States are also eyeing a number of new reproductive health bills as their legislatures come back into session.Lawmakers urge Supreme Court to reexamine abortion decisionsA flurry of legislation timed around the Jan. 22 anniversary of the landmark 1973 abortion rights case Roe v. Wade and the largest annual anti-abortion rally, known as the March for Life, is typical in most years. But with a split Congress and impeachment proceedings pending in the Republican-controlled Senate, this years activity will focus more on motivating supporters to prepare for upcoming fights over state policies, court cases and elections.Kristan Hawkins, president of the anti-abortion Students for Life of America group, envisions renewed energy beginning this week, stemming in part from the 2020 campaign season.Theres a general feeling that most people would agree that this is going to be a pivotal year when we talk about abortion in our country, she said. Loading the player. Upcoming events More than 100,000 abortion opponents are expected to rally for the March for Life on Jan. 24, with a 3,000-person conference scheduled the following day aimed at training abortion opponents to mobilize. In recent years, the president and vice president spoke at the March for Life. Top administration officials are expected to make an appearance this year as well.Last year, the march was timed for the week of a Senate procedural vote to codify a ban on taxpayer-funded abortion, the announcement of a newly formed Senate Pro-Life Caucus and a letter from President Donald Trump to Speaker Nancy Pelosi promising to veto any abortion rights legislation.Anti-abortion advocates want to see movement on their key policy priority legislation that they argue would protect an infant who survives an attempted abortion.Grassroots groups prepare for a post-Roe v. Wade AmericaJeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, expects the call to action this year to be related to a House discharge petition to require a vote on this bill. Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, who sponsored the House version, is slated to speak at the march, as are other GOP lawmakers and Louisiana Democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson, who wrote the law that the Supreme Court will hear in March.Another priority, according to Hawkins, is targeting Planned Parenthood funding.I know several people who have reached out to various people at the administration to talk about debarment of Planned Parenthood, she said.The Department of Health and Human Services is able to temporarily block federal funds to an organization in cases of fraud or other illegal activity. State and court battles Legislative and legal action on both abortion bans and the expansion of abortion rights is also expected to heat up.In 2019, seven states passed near-total abortion bans, none of which is in effect because of litigation. The ACLU said two of those cases, Mississippi and Missouri, could see appeals court arguments in the next couple of months.The million-dollar question is whether the Supreme Court will step in to review one of these cases, said Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Its too late for that to happen this term. So the earliest wed really be looking at is 2021, and its unclear whether the Supreme Court has the appetite to jump into that question right away.Jessica Arons, senior advocacy and policy counsel for reproductive freedom at the American Civil Liberties Union, also sees state policy changes as an often-overlooked issue.While a high-stakes showdown will be playing out at the Supreme Court, we should not take our eyes off of what is happening in the states, she told reporters last week. Already, bills that would ban abortion from the earliest days of pregnancy, like those passed in Georgia and Alabama last year, have been introduced in 10 states, with more likely to be filed in the coming days. This year, there is a genuine risk that at least five more abortion bans could be enacted, Arons said.Arons and other abortion rights supporters are also watching court cases besides the Supreme Court case in March, which will determine whether a Louisiana law that would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital can go into effect.The ACLU is watching at least two other types of cases that could make their way to the high court next year. One type is cases targeting a method of abortion known as dilation and evacuation. Laws in Kentucky, Arkansas and Ohio were blocked by lower courts but have been appealed.The other type challenges restrictions that would ban abortions based on a reason, such as a fetal anomaly. In March, the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on an Ohio law. Election 2020 Both sides are doubling down on grassroots efforts to energize voters who share their beliefs about abortion.A majority of Americans do not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned, according to a poll released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. About 91 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents do not want the decision to be reversed, while 57 percent of Republicans do want it overturned. However, only 6 percent of Democrats and 7 percent of Republicans consider reproductive health to be their top campaign issue, the poll found.Abortion may get more attention this year, though, in states like Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Michigan, which might have ballot initiatives this cycle that could roll back abortion rights.Progressive groups are also on the offense, building on the success of enacting state legislation in places like New York last year. For instance, Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and others are backing a Massachusetts bill that would allow access to abortion later in pregnancy and loosen parental consent restrictions for minors.Last week, Planned Parenthood announced a new voter program, We Decide 2020, that provides voter information about candidates reproductive health stances. The new program launched with a five-figure digital buy in battleground states. Planned Parenthood previously announced plans to spend 45 million on this election.Our country is at a crossroads, but now its time for us to reclaim our power, said Jenny Lawson, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes. In 2020, were fighting back and electing reproductive champions up and down the ballot because our futures depend on it.On the other side of the debate, Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, announced Friday that it would dramatically expand its grassroots efforts. Volunteers were already talking to voters in Arizona, Florida and North Carolina but also will be targeting Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Theyve also increased their budget to 52 million this cycle.Mallory Quigley, national spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PACs independent expenditure campaign, said they will also target traditional Democratic voter groups.Our focused, battle-tested voter outreach method will ensure we reach the voters who can provide President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates the winning margin, she said.You may not always agree with what the president tweets out, Hawkins said. You may not agree with every policy he has, or any other politician, but you always know when we vote, we think about what is the most pressing issue. You have to vote for the candidate thats going to do the most to limit abortion.

Over the past two weeks, more than 100 posters have been distributed in the streets of Szczecin, considered one of Polands most liberal cities, as part of a project by the TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art.On 22 October, Poland's constitutional court ruled that abortion is illegal even in cases where there are severe foetal abnormalities. Almost all of the country's 1,000 legal terminations a year are carried out for this reason under the new law, abortions can only be carried out in instances of rape, incest and when the mother's life is at risk. Andrzeh GolcKruger tells The Art Newspaper she has been riveted by the hugely brave protests in Poland, compelling her to revisit her poster project from many years ago. The US artist says The urgent and brave protesting of marginalised, disempowered and newly empowered bodies is an insistent threat to the dominant and extremist choreographies of religion, power, and politics in Poland. The brazen hypocrisy of the Church and its predictable fist bumping with the political right make for a grotesque dance of male bonding and resolute abuse of power.Kruger originally made the graphic work of a woman with a bisected face for the Womens March in Washington DC in 1989, which had been organised because the Republicans were trying to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 ruling which made abortion legal in the US.Two years later, in 1991, when womens rights were also under attack in Poland, it was translated into Polish and 500 posters were distributed throughout Warsaw. The images only lasted one weekend before being torn down or covered up. Six months later, a Polish feminist group agreed to distribute the posters once more, pasting the works in hard-to-reach spots and ensuring the image became part of Polish history. Andrzej GolcMilada Slizinska, then the curator of the Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw, was instrumental in bringing Krugers campaign to Poland in the 1990s. Speaking to the Gentlewoman magazine earlier this year, Slizinska describes how womens rights were being eroded. She says When Solidarity came to power in 1989, all of a sudden, the rules against sexual education and abortion became stronger and stronger. The political climate had unexpectedly turned against womens rights, so I asked Barbara to work with us. This is where our problems started.Slizinska recalls how the museum's budget came from the minister of culture, and our director was too scared to fund the printing and distribution of Barbaras poster. Furthermore, Kruger refused to let the American embassy pay for her flight, so Slizinska booked the US artist to give a lecture in Warsaw and was able to pay for her that way. Stanislaw Ruksza, the director of TRAFO, also remembers the impact of Krugers project. Back then, I was a teenager, but I remember the posters were one of the first works in the Polish public space of the transformation era that got a reaction from passers-by. It was the beginning ofor perhaps an impulse forfurther important public works in Poland, he says. Ruksza notes how Krugers posters had a lasting impact on Polish artists during the late 1990s including Krzysztof Wodiczko, Artur Zmijewski, Katarzyna Kozyra and Pawel Althamerall of whom have provided a powerful commentary on the Polish reality and, frequently, openly confronted the conservative discourse.As for the seeming lack of progress over the past 30 years, Kruger says she is not at all surprised that the struggle for womens reproductive freedom is constant and ongoing. She adds The need to control minds and bodies and to destroy difference has been horrifically acted out across centuries and continents.

Over the past two weeks, more than 100 posters have been distributed in the streets of Szczecin, considered one of Polands most liberal cities, as part of a project by the TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art.On 22 October, Poland\\'s constitutional court ruled that abortion is illegal even in cases where there are severe foetal abnormalities. Almost all of the country\\'s 1,000 legal terminations a year are carried out for this reason under the new law, abortions can only be carried out in instances of rape, incest and when the mother\\'s life is at risk. Andrzeh GolcKruger tells The Art Newspaper she has been riveted by the hugely brave protests in Poland, compelling her to revisit her poster project from many years ago. The US artist says The urgent and brave protesting of marginalised, disempowered and newly empowered bodies is an insistent threat to the dominant and extremist choreographies of religion, power, and politics in Poland. The brazen hypocrisy of the Church and its predictable fist bumping with the political right make for a grotesque dance of male bonding and resolute abuse of power.Kruger originally made the graphic work of a woman with a bisected face for the Womens March in Washington DC in 1989, which had been organised because the Republicans were trying to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 ruling which made abortion legal in the US.Two years later, in 1991, when womens rights were also under attack in Poland, it was translated into Polish and 500 posters were distributed throughout Warsaw. The images only lasted one weekend before being torn down or covered up. Six months later, a Polish feminist group agreed to distribute the posters once more, pasting the works in hard-to-reach spots and ensuring the image became part of Polish history. Andrzej GolcMilada Slizinska, then the curator of the Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw, was instrumental in bringing Krugers campaign to Poland in the 1990s. Speaking to the Gentlewoman magazine earlier this year, Slizinska describes how womens rights were being eroded. She says When Solidarity came to power in 1989, all of a sudden, the rules against sexual education and abortion became stronger and stronger. The political climate had unexpectedly turned against womens rights, so I asked Barbara to work with us. This is where our problems started.Slizinska recalls how the museum\\'s budget came from the minister of culture, and our director was too scared to fund the printing and distribution of Barbaras poster. Furthermore, Kruger refused to let the American embassy pay for her flight, so Slizinska booked the US artist to give a lecture in Warsaw and was able to pay for her that way. Stanislaw Ruksza, the director of TRAFO, also remembers the impact of Krugers project. Back then, I was a teenager, but I remember the posters were one of the first works in the Polish public space of the transformation era that got a reaction from passers-by. It was the beginning ofor perhaps an impulse forfurther important public works in Poland, he says. Ruksza notes how Krugers posters had a lasting impact on Polish artists during the late 1990s including Krzysztof Wodiczko, Artur Zmijewski, Katarzyna Kozyra and Pawel Althamerall of whom have provided a powerful commentary on the Polish reality and, frequently, openly confronted the conservative discourse.As for the seeming lack of progress over the past 30 years, Kruger says she is not at all surprised that the struggle for womens reproductive freedom is constant and ongoing. She adds The need to control minds and bodies and to destroy difference has been horrifically acted out across centuries and continents. Contestations around gender, race, and class loom larger now than ever.The emergence of Donald Trump in the US signals a consolidation of the forces of rage, shaming, and revenge and speaks not only to the gathering global wave of autocratic rule but also to the failures of some of the lefts weak rhetorical skills and pathetic inability to read the room, Kruger says.And added to these challenges and inequities is the horrific fact that we are living and dying amidst the looming tragedies of a planetary pandemic in which some are more insulated than others.

The poster, which originally appeared in Washington DC during the Womens March, features a woman with a bisected face and the words \"Your Body is a Battleground\" written across her chest. The image has been distributed in the streets of Szczecin, a city in western Poland, as part of a project by the TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art. The article notes that the poster has been re-appeared in Poland at a time when womens rights are under attack, with Polands constitutional court recently ruling that abortion is illegal even in cases of severe foetal abnormalities. The article quotes Kruger as saying that she is not surprised that the struggle for womens reproductive freedom is constant and ongoing, and notes that the emergence of Donald Trump in the US has signaled a consolidation of forces of rage, shaming, and revenge. The article also mentions the impact of Krugers poster on Polish artists in the 1990s, including Krzysztof Wodiczko, Artur Zmijewski, Katarzyna Kozyra, and Pawel Althamer, who have provided a powerful commentary on the Polish reality and frequently confronted the conservative discourse.'}\n","Processed article {'article': 'Abortion \\'practically banned in Turkey\\' Turkey\\'s own independent gazette Podcast Women Economy Human Rights Politics Education Columns Galleries Videos Abortion is practically banned in Turkey, an academic who has been working on the issue has said, adding that majority of the public hospitals don\\'t carry out abortion surgeries.

Erin Grall, House sponsor of HB 5, the 15-week abortion ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis background signed the bill into law April 14, 2022. Credit DeSantis Facebook page. Gov. Ron DeSantis went to church Thursday to sign a 15-week abortion ban into law during a ceremony bearing many of the accoutrements of a worship service. We are there to defend those who cant defend themselves, the governor told an enthusiastic crowd at the Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee. This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation, he said. The American Civil Liberties Union immediately promised to challenge the law in court. Make no mistake If this abortion ban goes into effect, it would have devastating consequences for pregnant people, especially those who are not able to afford to travel out of state in search of the essential health care they need, legislative director Kara Gross said in a written statement. Nobody should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. We will take swift legal action to protect Floridians rights and defend against this cruel attack on our bodily autonomy. The new law HB 5 bans abortions after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest, although they would be allowed in cases of severe fetal abnormality. Abortion rights advocates argue that it is blatantly unconstitutional under existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents including Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The 15-week ban in Florida takes effect on July 1. That gives the justices time to rule in a constitutional challenge to a similar law from Mississippi before they take their summer break around the end of June. That courts new Republican supermajority is widely expected to uphold the Mississippi statute, either by overruling those precedents or trimming them into oblivion. Florida Constitution The Florida Supreme Court is also in play here. It ruled in 1989 that an abortion-consent law for minors was unconstitutional because it violated privacy provisions in the state Constitution. The new state Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, is far more conservative than the court that upheld the right to privacy and hasnt by shy about overturning its own precedents. A large crowd attended the signing of Floridas 15-week abortion bill. The law goes into affect July 1. April 14, 2022. The bill-signing event in Central Florida included a large, enthusiastic crowd that broke into cheers and waved signs saying, Pro Life. It featured witness testimony from women whod undergone abortions and regretted it and others whod refused abortions and did not regret it. The ceremony stood in stark contrast to two years ago, when DeSantis announced that hed signed an abortion parental-consent bill via a press release that tucked it among 14 separate pieces of legislation while holding a public bill-signing ceremony for two water-quality measures. On Thursday, there was much talk of prayer, including from Erin Grall, a Republican representing Indian River and part of St. Lucie counties who sponsored the legislation in the House. She thanked people who prayed for her as the legislation advanced during the recent legislative session and those who are praying every day to end the horrific abortions that plague our country. Grall, an attorney, referred to those U.S. Supreme Court precedents during the bill-signing ceremony. The reality of the Roe decision is that men on the Supreme Court proclaimed that women, in order to achieve equality with men, must be able to kill their own children. As a woman, I refuse to accept such a perverse version of equality, Grall said. no abortions Sen. Kelli Stargel, Senate sponsor of the 15-week abortion ban. Credit Danielle J. Brown. Senate sponsor Kelli Stargel, representing portions of Lake and Polk counties, remarked that were looking at the potential of Roe v. Wade being overturned, adding, hopefully, in the future, there will be no abortions. Also on hand were Senate President Wilton Simpson and House Speaker Chris Sprowls, who called DeSantis the most pro-life governor in America. So, too, was Simone Marstiller, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, which regulates abortion clinics. Sprowls continued Like many of you, I believe that life is a gift from God. And, as I look out into this audience, I see many familiar faces who have been warriors on the front lines of the life movement, whether it is ministering to young women, whether it is helping them as they give birth to their child in pregnancy centers across this state. You have been a part of this as much as every single legislator here and for that we are very grateful. Reaction was swift. Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried, running in the Democratic primary to oppose DeSantis this fall, issued a written statement This law is a despicable and disgusting assault on women. Its an insult to our dignity and our ability to make these deeply personal decisions about our own lives, and it will have a devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of women across Florida, Fried said. Hypocrisy The hypocrisy of Republicans who love to brag about how free our state is while pushing a law that will literally force women and girls to give birth is absolutely outrageous. This law is a direct attack on womens constitutional rights, and its cruel, extreme, and inhumane, Fried said. On Twitter, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, also in the Democratic primary, called the law an unconstitutional attack on women that strips away their reproductive freedom. Women should make decisions about their own bodies, not governors. Id veto this bill and any attempt to restrict the right to choose. Full stop. State Sen. Annette Taddeo, another Democrat running for governor, issued her own written statement. We are less free today than before the session started, it reads. As Latin American countries like Colombia are moving forward and expanding access to health care, were moving backward in Florida. Gov. DeSantis has just signed into law an extreme bill that was made even crueler by the rejections to provide exemptions for victims of rape, human trafficking, and incest. Florida Sen. Lauren Book. WFSU photo Not moderate or fair Lauren Book of Broward County, leader of the Senate Democrats, said DeSantis had forced the women of Florida back 50 years, before Roe.

Erin Grall, House sponsor of HB 5, the 15-week abortion ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis background signed the bill into law April 14, 2022. Credit DeSantis Facebook page. Gov. Ron DeSantis went to church Thursday to sign a 15-week abortion ban into law during a ceremony bearing many of the accoutrements of a worship service. We are there to defend those who cant defend themselves, the governor told an enthusiastic crowd at the Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee. This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation, he said. The American Civil Liberties Union immediately promised to challenge the law in court. Make no mistake If this abortion ban goes into effect, it would have devastating consequences for pregnant people, especially those who are not able to afford to travel out of state in search of the essential health care they need, legislative director Kara Gross said in a written statement. Nobody should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. We will take swift legal action to protect Floridians rights and defend against this cruel attack on our bodily autonomy. The new law HB 5 bans abortions after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest, although they would be allowed in cases of severe fetal abnormality. Abortion rights advocates argue that it is blatantly unconstitutional under existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents including Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The 15-week ban in Florida takes effect on July 1. That gives the justices time to rule in a constitutional challenge to a similar law from Mississippi before they take their summer break around the end of June. That courts new Republican supermajority is widely expected to uphold the Mississippi statute, either by overruling those precedents or trimming them into oblivion. Florida Constitution The Florida Supreme Court is also in play here. It ruled in 1989 that an abortion-consent law for minors was unconstitutional because it violated privacy provisions in the state Constitution. The new state Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, is far more conservative than the court that upheld the right to privacy and hasnt by shy about overturning its own precedents. A large crowd attended the signing of Floridas 15-week abortion bill. The law goes into affect July 1. April 14, 2022. The bill-signing event in Central Florida included a large, enthusiastic crowd that broke into cheers and waved signs saying, Pro Life. It featured witness testimony from women whod undergone abortions and regretted it and others whod refused abortions and did not regret it. The ceremony stood in stark contrast to two years ago, when DeSantis announced that hed signed an abortion parental-consent bill via a press release that tucked it among 14 separate pieces of legislation while holding a public bill-signing ceremony for two water-quality measures. On Thursday, there was much talk of prayer, including from Erin Grall, a Republican representing Indian River and part of St. Lucie counties who sponsored the legislation in the House. She thanked people who prayed for her as the legislation advanced during the recent legislative session and those who are praying every day to end the horrific abortions that plague our country. Grall, an attorney, referred to those U.S. Supreme Court precedents during the bill-signing ceremony. The reality of the Roe decision is that men on the Supreme Court proclaimed that women, in order to achieve equality with men, must be able to kill their own children. As a woman, I refuse to accept such a perverse version of equality, Grall said. no abortions Sen. Kelli Stargel, Senate sponsor of the 15-week abortion ban. Credit Danielle J. Brown. Senate sponsor Kelli Stargel, representing portions of Lake and Polk counties, remarked that were looking at the potential of Roe v. Wade being overturned, adding, hopefully, in the future, there will be no abortions. Also on hand were Senate President Wilton Simpson and House Speaker Chris Sprowls, who called DeSantis the most pro-life governor in America. So, too, was Simone Marstiller, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, which regulates abortion clinics. Sprowls continued Like many of you, I believe that life is a gift from God. And, as I look out into this audience, I see many familiar faces who have been warriors on the front lines of the life movement, whether it is ministering to young women, whether it is helping them as they give birth to their child in pregnancy centers across this state. You have been a part of this as much as every single legislator here and for that we are very grateful. Reaction was swift. Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried, running in the Democratic primary to oppose DeSantis this fall, issued a written statement This law is a despicable and disgusting assault on women. Its an insult to our dignity and our ability to make these deeply personal decisions about our own lives, and it will have a devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of women across Florida, Fried said. Hypocrisy The hypocrisy of Republicans who love to brag about how free our state is while pushing a law that will literally force women and girls to give birth is absolutely outrageous. This law is a direct attack on womens constitutional rights, and its cruel, extreme, and inhumane, Fried said. On Twitter, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, also in the Democratic primary, called the law an unconstitutional attack on women that strips away their reproductive freedom. Women should make decisions about their own bodies, not governors. Id veto this bill and any attempt to restrict the right to choose. Full stop. State Sen. Annette Taddeo, another Democrat running for governor, issued her own written statement. We are less free today than before the session started, it reads. As Latin American countries like Colombia are moving forward and expanding access to health care, were moving backward in Florida. Gov. DeSantis has just signed into law an extreme bill that was made even crueler by the rejections to provide exemptions for victims of rape, human trafficking, and incest. Florida Sen. Lauren Book. WFSU photo Not moderate or fair Lauren Book of Broward County, leader of the Senate Democrats, said DeSantis had forced the women of Florida back 50 years, before Roe. This is not a moderate or fair bill if a woman or girl must live with the consequence of someone elses actions, revictimized by the decisions of Floridas right-wing GOP, she said in a written statement. Without access to safe and legal procedures, a womans life and her liberty are severely endangered. This is nothing more than an authoritarian move by Florida Republicans.
