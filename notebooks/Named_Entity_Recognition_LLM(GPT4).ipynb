AP PhotoMariam Zuhaib By Lisa Mascaro Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print WASHINGTON AP Upending the political debate, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.Grahams own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where MAGA Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.Americas got to make some decisions, Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.The South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Courts ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wades nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, were going nowhere, the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. We welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022. Reaction was swift, fierce and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Grahams legislation as an extreme example of the far-rights hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections. A nationwide abortion ban thats the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans want to force women to stay pregnant and deliver babies. To anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality, she said. Republicans are coming for your rights. The sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Courts landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.In a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Bidens lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races. Tuesdays announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Grahams proposed abortion ban.This bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.While President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy and to take unprecedented action to address climate change Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women, Jean-Pierre said. Grahams legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security and Bidens leadership. The Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the physical health of the mother. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.In particular, Grahams bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Courts ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Grahams legislation. I think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue, McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. So I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.The Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Grahams proposed nationwide abortion ban. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Graham and every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.Her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.In Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted A nationwide abortion ban is outrageous. Bennet pledged to defend a womans right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.His opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe ODea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part A Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumers hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification or conscience protections for religious hospitals.The races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.Pelosi called Grahams bill the clearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans intent to criminalize womens health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.Republican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences. I think that what its attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit, said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.Democrats are implying that all Republicans are for a ban without exceptions, and thats not true, Thune said. There are Republicans who are in favor of restrictions. And I think this is an attempt to at least put something out there that reflects the views of a lot of Republicans who are in favor of some restrictions.Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.\",\n          \"QA Access to Abortion is a Human Right Human Rights Watch Skip to cookie privacy notice Skip to main content Human rights abuses are happening right now start a monthly gift today.

Is abortion a human rights issue? Access to safe, legal abortion is a matter of human rights. Authoritative interpretations of international human rights law establish that denying women, girls, and other pregnant people access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. United Nations human rights treaty bodies regularly call for governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases and to ensure access to safe, legal abortion in certain circumstances at a minimum. What are the human rights consequences of restricting or banning abortion access? Countries have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including those concerning sexual and reproductive health and autonomy. Where safe and legal abortion services are unreasonably restricted or not fully available, many other internationally protected human rights may be at risk, including rights to nondiscrimination and equality to life, health, and information to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment to privacy and bodily autonomy and integrity to decide the number and spacing of children to liberty to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and to freedom of conscience and religion. These rights are set out the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and protected in many international treaties, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR, the Convention Against Torture CAT, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child CRC, as well as in regional level treaties in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. For nearly two decades, Human Rights Watch has documented the human rights harm of restricted or banned access to abortion in countries around the world, including in the US, Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Ireland. What is the Human Rights Watch position on abortion? Human Rights Watch believes that reproductive rights are human rights, including the right to access to abortion. States have the obligation to provide women, girls, and other pregnant people with access to safe and legal abortion as part of their core human rights responsibilities. As Human Rights Watch has stated in amicus curiae briefs to high courts in countries around the world from Brazil and Colombia to South Korea and most recently with partner organizations in the United States international human rights law and relevant jurisprudence support the conclusion that decisions about abortion belong to a pregnant person alone, without interference or unreasonable restriction by the state or third parties. Is the right to life at risk when access to abortion is restricted or banned? Yes. Legal restrictions on abortion often result in more illegal abortions, which may also be unsafe and may drive higher maternal mortality and morbidity. As a result, lack of access to safe and legal abortion puts the lives of pregnant people at risk. According to the World Health Organization WHO, complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for girls and young women ages 15 to 19, and children ages 10 to 14 have a higher risk of health complications and death from pregnancy than adults. WHO has also found that the removal of restrictions on abortion results in the reduction of maternal mortality. The UN Human Rights Committee HRC, which monitors states compliance with the ICCPR, has noted the relationship between restrictive abortion laws and threats to womens and girls lives. It has explicitly clarified that states parties cannot regulate access to abortion in any way that requires pregnant people to resort to unsafe abortions, and that states must provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion to prevent risk to the lives and health of pregnant people, and to ensure that they are not subject to substantial pain or suffering, most notably in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the pregnancy is not viable. Do restrictive abortion policies reduce the rate of abortions? Abortion restrictions do not prevent abortions. Research has shown that when abortion is banned or restricted, the number of abortions does not decrease. Abortions just move underground. This increases the risk both of unsafe procedures and that people will be reported to police or prosecuted for suspected abortions. The rate of unsafe abortions is nearly 45 times higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries where abortion is legal and unrestricted. Restrictive abortion policies push pregnant people seeking abortions, especially those living in poverty or rural areas, out of the healthcare system and into unsafe, unregulated settings. WHO has also stated that lack of access to safe, affordable, timely, and respectful abortion care, as well as the promotion of stigma associated with abortion, poses risks to abortion seekers physical and mental well-being throughout their lives. Who will be most harmed from restrictions on access to abortion? Not all pregnant people are likely to experience the human rights and health harm of restricting abortion equally. Young people and marginalized groups including Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, people living in economic poverty, and sexual and gender minorities are more likely to be harmed. The UN Human Rights Committee has held that lack of availability of reproductive health information and services, including abortion, undermines womens right to nondiscrimination. The UN Human Rights Committee, like the Committee on the Elimination on Discrimination Against Women, has also noted that restrictions on abortion result in the disproportionate practice of illegal, unsafe abortions by poor and rural women or women unable to travel outside a jurisdiction where abortion is banned. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also said that punitive abortion laws constitute a violation of childrens right to freedom from discrimination. Even where abortion is technically legal, heavy restrictions can make it inaccessible to marginalized people. This forces pregnant people, particularly from marginalized groups, to look for unsafe and clandestine abortion opportunities and to risk criminal or civil penalties, even when their circumstances fall within what is legally permissible. Moreover, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has said, a wide range of laws, policies and practices undermine the autonomy and right to equality and non-discrimination in the full enjoyment of the right to sexual and reproductive health, for example criminalization of abortion or restrictive abortion laws. It has also noted that restrictions on abortion particularly affect women living in poverty or without or with less formal education. Similarly, six UN experts stressed in a 2015 joint news release that in El Salvador, the total ban on abortion disproportionately affects women who are poor. What has the UN said about lack of access to and criminalization of abortion? UN human rights treaty bodies, which monitor countries compliance with relevant treaties and that report or advise on human rights related to specific themes or countries, have consistently called for decriminalization of abortion and the full realization of sexual and reproductive rights, including access to safe, legal abortion. Examples of statements from these mechanisms in relation to abortion include the following The CEDAW Committee, which monitors compliance with CEDAW, stated that Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. As such, States parties should legalize abortion at least in cases of rape, incest, threats to the life andor health of the mother, or severe fetal impairment, as well as provide women with access to quality post-abortion care, especially in cases of complications resulting from unsafe abortions. States parties should also remove punitive measures for women who undergo abortion. The committee has made similar recommendations to many governments while reviewing their compliance with the treaty. These recommendations typically call on governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases, legalize abortion in the circumstances noted above, and guarantee access. The Human Rights Committee, which monitors states compliance with the ICCPR, has noted the relationship between restrictive abortion laws and threats to womens and girls lives and has clarified the scope of States parties obligations to protect their right to life. In particular, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives. The committee has frequently expressed concern about criminalization of abortion and has called for expanded access. Like the CEDAW Committee, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights which monitors the ICESCR, and the Committee against Torture, which monitors CAT, have called the removal of penalties for abortion and for the implementation of measures to ensure safe, legal access to abortion. Where safe abortion is not available it can pose risks to mental health, including severe anguish and risk of suicide. The tie between mental health and restrictions in access to reproductive health is so clear that the UN Committee against Torture has expressed concern at the severe physical and mental anguish and distress experienced by women and girls due to abortion restrictions, and concluded that criminalization and inaccessibility of abortion can be incompatible with a governments duty to uphold the right to freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Similarly, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged states to decriminalize abortion to ensure that girls have access to safe abortion and post-abortion services, review legislation with a view to guaranteeing the best interests of pregnant adolescents and ensure that their views are always heard and respected in abortion-related decisions. In many individual state reviews of treaty compliance, called concluding observations, the committee explicitly called for decriminalization of abortion in all circumstances. The UN special rapporteur on the right to health has said that criminal laws penalizing and restricting induced abortion are impermissible barriers to the realization of womens right to health and must be eliminated.

Wade, Yost asked for a court to lift an injunction on the ban By Morgan Trau - June 27, 2022 355 am Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Photo by Justin MerrimanGetty Images The following article was originally published on News5Cleveland.com and is published in the Ohio Capital Journal under a content-sharing agreement. Unlike other OCJ articles, it is not available for free republication by other news outlets as it is owned by WEWS in Cleveland. Shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court Friday, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost confirmed that he filed a motion to dissolve the injunction on Ohios six-week abortion ban, which was granted. Abortion is now illegal in Ohio after six weeks of pregnancy, before many are aware yet they are pregnant. This decision returns abortion policy to the place it has always belonged to the elected policies branches of the governments, Yost said in a statement released on YouTube early Friday. In his tweet announcing the motion, Yost said that the injunction was based on precedents set by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a landmark 1992 case that upheld the right to an abortion established by Roe. Roe was poorly reasoned, a doctrine of shifting sands that invited non-stop litigation, thats exactly what weve had for 50 years, Yost said. The six-week bill, sponsored by state Sen. Kristina Roegner R-Hudson, does not have an exception for rape or incest. It also only applies only to intrauterine pregnancies. It only has two exceptions. The ban allows for physicians to perform an abortion if the procedure is to prevent a someones death or bodily impairment, which is defined as any medically diagnosed condition that so complicates the pregnancy of the woman as to directly or indirectly cause the substantial and reversible impairment of a major bodily function. This includes pre-eclampsia, inevitable abortion and premature rupture of the membranes. It could also be diabetes or multiple sclerosis but it cant be anything related to mental health. To be able to perform the life-saving measure, a physician has to write that the procedure is necessary for the above reasons and must include the medical condition and the medical rationale for it. Also, the written documentation must be included in the pregnant persons medical records and the doctor must have a copy of it for at least seven years. The other exception is if there is no heartbeat. The bill also requires a pregnant person to sign a form acknowledging that there is a heartbeat detected. According to experts, the term fetal heartbeat is misleading and medically inaccurate. At six weeks of gestation, those valves dont exist, said Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN who specializes in abortion care and works at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The flickering that were seeing on the ultrasound that early in the development of the pregnancy is actually electrical activity, and the sound that you hear is actually manufactured by the ultrasound machine. Nevertheless, the form would include statements that say the unborn human individual has a fetal heartbeat, and would include the statistical probability of bringing that individual to term. We knew this was coming, but its still devastating, said Sri Thakkilapati, the interim director of the Preterm Clinic in Cleveland, the abortion provider named in Yosts filing. Were in a situation where somebodys abortion could be legal today and illegal tomorrow. Thakkilapati says she is fully staffed, getting patients in the door as quickly as they can, and ready to refer patients to clinics in other states where they can obtain abortions. Thakkilapati also says she will also continue to fight todays supreme court decision, which she described as a brutal defeat. If someone violates the abortion ban, they are guilty of a felony of the fifth degree. A former pregnant person could file civil action for a wrongful death suit of their unborn child, and they could be awarded court costs and reasonable attorneys fees if they win. The legislation also creates the Joint Legislative Committee on Adoption Promotion and Support, which would be made up of three House members and three Senate members. In addition, it allows the State Medical Board to take disciplinary action for failure to comply with the acts requirements. It allows the board to assess penalties of up to 20,000 for each abortion ban violation. The person who received the abortion would get criminal immunity and immunity from civil liability. The bill doesnt prohibit contraception or birth control. On Friday night, Gov. Mike DeWine signed executive order 2022-11D which permits the Ohio Department of Health to immediately adopt the Heartbeat Bill, which DeWine signed in 2019.

Much of the demonstrators anger has been directed not against the court itself, but rather towards the Catholic church and ruling national-conservative Law and Justice PiS party, who are seen as being behind the ruling. As hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets, many have displayed symbols that have come to characterise the protests. Below, we explain the meaning and history behind six of the most common. Red lightning bolt A red lightning bolt has become the main symbol of the protests. It is part of the logo of Womens Strike Strajk Kobiet, a grassroots womens rights initiative and the main organiser of the current demonstrations. It was originally created by graphic designer Ola Jasionowska, who says that it symbolises a warning. It says watch out, beware, we wont accept that women are being deprived of their basic rights, Jasionowska explained to Newsweek Polska. Nigdy ju adna nie bdzie sza sama. Bdziemy szy razem. Bdziemy walczy o polskie kobiety i przestrzeganie praw czowieka na ulicy i w sejmie. Marszaek Terlecki albo si z tym pogodzi i wprowadzi pod obrad ustaw o depenalizacji i legalizacji, albo bdzie mia rewolucj! pic.twitter.comPsiH9cvJM7 Marcelina Zawisza mmzawisza October 27, 2020 The symbol has been seized upon by critics of the protests, who have tried to claim that it is similar to the insignia used by the SS and other formations in Nazi Germany. Ryszard Terlecki, head of PiSs parliamentary caucus and deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, said it was sad to see opposition MPs wearing facemasks referencing totalitarian symbols. News broadcasts on state TV, which is under the influence of PiS, have this week repeatedly referred to the protesters as left-wing fascists and drawn links between their symbol and Nazism. \"Leftist fascism is destroying Poland\" headlined the main evening news on state TV a government mouthpiece for the second night in a row. They said that abortion protesters have expressed \"approval of cannibalism\" and use a symbol associated with Nazism and Satan pic.twitter.com8Xufk66tih Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 28, 2020 Supporters of the protests point out that the Womens Strike logo is different in colour, shape and style to the SS insignia, and that lightning bolts are a common symbol for an array of different groups. Among those that have used such as symbol were the Grey Ranks, an underground Polish paramilitary organisation that resisted the German Nazi occupation in World War II. Those who link the lightning symbol to Nazism are insulting Polish heroes, said left-wing MP Anna-Maria ukowska. Jasionowska, the designer of the logo, says the claims of Nazi links are absurd It wasnt my intention at all. Everyone looks for interpretations that they find useful. Wypierdala and Solidarity One of the main slogans of the current protests has been Wypierdala, a vulgarity that translates roughly as Fuck off. The word has been chanted by demonstrators, while also appearing on posters and banners. Some quickly began to combine it with an iconic Polish symbol of protests and resistance, the logo of the Solidarity Solidarno trade union that played a leading role in bringing down communism in Poland in the 1980s. A court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland has brought tens of thousands of protesters mostly women onto the streets. We look at the protests through the lens of Italian photographer Luca Aliano Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 26, 2020 Artist Jarek Kubicki then developed that theme further by adapting a famous campaign poster from 1989, when Poland held its first semi-free elections, in which the Solidarity logo appeared behind an image of Gary Cooper appearing as a cowboy in the American Western High Noon. Kubicki recreated the poster, but with Solidarno replaced by Wypierdala and Gary Cooper replaced by female action heroes from Hollywood movies. The idea quickly spread, with many Polish women, including left-wing female MPs, creating similar images with themselves in the foreground. The designer of the original Solidarity logo, Jerzy Janiszewski, has previously said that he has no problem with abortion protesters using his work. As the author, I am opposed to prosecuting and punishing anyone for using the logo during peaceful and, in my opinion, legitimate protests for womens rights in Poland, he said in 2016. At the abortion protests, there have been many signs bearing eight asterisks in the form , in what may be a rather confusing and cryptic message for observers from outside Poland. The symbols widely referred to as eight little stars in Polish stand for Jeba PiS Fuck PiS. They became a widely used meme during this years presidential election campaign, especially after they appeared in the video for a song by Polish rapper Taco Hemingway that was seen as critical of the ruling party. In one famous image, President Andrzej Duda who was standing for re-election as the candidate supported by PiS unwittingly posed for a photo alongside a young man wearing a t-shirt bearing the eight stars.

IMHO ma duo szczcia, e wybory ju w niedziel pic.twitter.comRGu9sojAq3 Micha Pociski michalplocinski July 10, 2020 During the current protests, Jeba PiS has become a widespread slogan, appearing on banners often now without the censorship of asterisks and being chanted to the tune of songs such as Eric Prydzs Call On Me. Around a thousand abortion protesters held a party outside the ruling party's HQ in Warsaw, singing \"Jeba PiS\" Fuck PiS to the tune of \"Call On Me\" by ericprydz pic.twitter.comyU9kRLP95e Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 26, 2020 Black umbrella In 2016, mass protests also took place against an attempt to tighten the abortion law and delegalise prenatal screening. Tens of thousands of Polish women, wearing black to symbolise mourning, came out onto the streets. Some of the largest demonstrations took place in the autumn rain, and as a result umbrellas became a symbol of the Black Protests. Thousands Of Pissed Off WomenWarsaw City in Europe October 2016 ADczarnyprotestblackprotest pic.twitter.com7SfEPJZ7PO Borys Musielak michuk October 3, 2016 Those demonstrations succeeded in forcing PiS to back away from the proposed abortion ban. But afterwards, organisers vowed Nie skadamy parasolek Were not closing our umbrellas. And since then, umbrellas have reappeared whenever a threat to womens reproductive rights is perceived. Earlier this year, another proposal to ban abortion returned to parliament during lockdown. With street protests prohibited, many women placed black umbrellas in their windows or balconies, or held black umbrellas while queuing outside of shops. Jak zaprotestowa, nie ruszajc si z domu?

With new coronavirus restrictions on gatherings going into force today, women in Pozna protested the anti-abortion ruling by going for a \"walk with umbrellas\". It's not raining umbrellas are in Poland a symbol of protests against restricting abortion Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 24, 2020 Coat hanger Coat hangers an international symbol of pro-choice protests have also been widespread during the current demonstrations in Poland, being both wielded by the protesters themselves and also hung on the doors or fences of churches and offices of right-wing politicians. The demonstrations taking place in the city of Wrocaw last Saturday were called the Night of the Coat Hanger Noc wieszaka. Protesters decorated the gate of the palace of the archbishop of Wrocaw with slogans and coat hangers as well as a chemise stained with blood. .ZieloniWro jak zawsze tam gdzie trzeba Dzi wsplnie z wrocawiankami i wrocawianami licznie spacerowali po Ostrowie Tumskim.

In Poland, which has the strictest abortion law in the EU other than Maltas, only around 1,000 legal abortions take place each year. But it is estimated that tens of thousands of women have illegal terminations annually, while many travel abroad for procedures in countries with more liberal laws. Artist Iness Rychlik has produced a self-portrait combining the coat hanger symbol with a blood stain in the shape of Poland. Her work is entitled Granice subtelnoci, with granice meaning both limits and borders and subtelnoci meaning of subtlety or of nicety. The PW Anchor The anchor kotwica is one of Polands most important symbols. Created in 1942 by Anna Smoleska, a member of the underground resistance, it was used as an emblem of the struggle against German occupation during the war. Its shape creates the letters PW, standing for Polska Walczca Poland Fighting.

Much of the demonstrators anger has been directed not against the court itself, but rather towards the Catholic church and ruling national-conservative Law and Justice PiS party, who are seen as being behind the ruling. As hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets, many have displayed symbols that have come to characterise the protests. Below, we explain the meaning and history behind six of the most common. Red lightning bolt A red lightning bolt has become the main symbol of the protests. It is part of the logo of Womens Strike Strajk Kobiet, a grassroots womens rights initiative and the main organiser of the current demonstrations. It was originally created by graphic designer Ola Jasionowska, who says that it symbolises a warning. It says watch out, beware, we wont accept that women are being deprived of their basic rights, Jasionowska explained to Newsweek Polska. Nigdy ju adna nie bdzie sza sama. Bdziemy szy razem. Bdziemy walczy o polskie kobiety i przestrzeganie praw czowieka na ulicy i w sejmie. Marszaek Terlecki albo si z tym pogodzi i wprowadzi pod obrad ustaw o depenalizacji i legalizacji, albo bdzie mia rewolucj! pic.twitter.comPsiH9cvJM7 Marcelina Zawisza mmzawisza October 27, 2020 The symbol has been seized upon by critics of the protests, who have tried to claim that it is similar to the insignia used by the SS and other formations in Nazi Germany. Ryszard Terlecki, head of PiSs parliamentary caucus and deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, said it was sad to see opposition MPs wearing facemasks referencing totalitarian symbols. News broadcasts on state TV, which is under the influence of PiS, have this week repeatedly referred to the protesters as left-wing fascists and drawn links between their symbol and Nazism. \"Leftist fascism is destroying Poland\" headlined the main evening news on state TV a government mouthpiece for the second night in a row. They said that abortion protesters have expressed \"approval of cannibalism\" and use a symbol associated with Nazism and Satan pic.twitter.com8Xufk66tih Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 28, 2020 Supporters of the protests point out that the Womens Strike logo is different in colour, shape and style to the SS insignia, and that lightning bolts are a common symbol for an array of different groups. Among those that have used such as symbol were the Grey Ranks, an underground Polish paramilitary organisation that resisted the German Nazi occupation in World War II. Those who link the lightning symbol to Nazism are insulting Polish heroes, said left-wing MP Anna-Maria ukowska. Jasionowska, the designer of the logo, says the claims of Nazi links are absurd It wasnt my intention at all. Everyone looks for interpretations that they find useful. Wypierdala and Solidarity One of the main slogans of the current protests has been Wypierdala, a vulgarity that translates roughly as Fuck off. The word has been chanted by demonstrators, while also appearing on posters and banners. Some quickly began to combine it with an iconic Polish symbol of protests and resistance, the logo of the Solidarity Solidarno trade union that played a leading role in bringing down communism in Poland in the 1980s. A court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland has brought tens of thousands of protesters mostly women onto the streets. We look at the protests through the lens of Italian photographer Luca Aliano Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 26, 2020 Artist Jarek Kubicki then developed that theme further by adapting a famous campaign poster from 1989, when Poland held its first semi-free elections, in which the Solidarity logo appeared behind an image of Gary Cooper appearing as a cowboy in the American Western High Noon. Kubicki recreated the poster, but with Solidarno replaced by Wypierdala and Gary Cooper replaced by female action heroes from Hollywood movies. The idea quickly spread, with many Polish women, including left-wing female MPs, creating similar images with themselves in the foreground. The designer of the original Solidarity logo, Jerzy Janiszewski, has previously said that he has no problem with abortion protesters using his work. As the author, I am opposed to prosecuting and punishing anyone for using the logo during peaceful and, in my opinion, legitimate protests for womens rights in Poland, he said in 2016. At the abortion protests, there have been many signs bearing eight asterisks in the form , in what may be a rather confusing and cryptic message for observers from outside Poland. The symbols widely referred to as eight little stars in Polish stand for Jeba PiS Fuck PiS. They became a widely used meme during this years presidential election campaign, especially after they appeared in the video for a song by Polish rapper Taco Hemingway that was seen as critical of the ruling party. In one famous image, President Andrzej Duda who was standing for re-election as the candidate supported by PiS unwittingly posed for a photo alongside a young man wearing a t-shirt bearing the eight stars.

IMHO ma duo szczcia, e wybory ju w niedziel pic.twitter.comRGu9sojAq3 Micha Pociski michalplocinski July 10, 2020 During the current protests, Jeba PiS has become a widespread slogan, appearing on banners often now without the censorship of asterisks and being chanted to the tune of songs such as Eric Prydzs Call On Me. Around a thousand abortion protesters held a party outside the ruling party's HQ in Warsaw, singing \"Jeba PiS\" Fuck PiS to the tune of \"Call On Me\" by ericprydz pic.twitter.comyU9kRLP95e Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 26, 2020 Black umbrella In 2016, mass protests also took place against an attempt to tighten the abortion law and delegalise prenatal screening. Tens of thousands of Polish women, wearing black to symbolise mourning, came out onto the streets. Some of the largest demonstrations took place in the autumn rain, and as a result umbrellas became a symbol of the Black Protests. Thousands Of Pissed Off WomenWarsaw City in Europe October 2016 ADczarnyprotestblackprotest pic.twitter.com7SfEPJZ7PO Borys Musielak michuk October 3, 2016 Those demonstrations succeeded in forcing PiS to back away from the proposed abortion ban. But afterwards, organisers vowed Nie skadamy parasolek Were not closing our umbrellas. And since then, umbrellas have reappeared whenever a threat to womens reproductive rights is perceived. Earlier this year, another proposal to ban abortion returned to parliament during lockdown. With street protests prohibited, many women placed black umbrellas in their windows or balconies, or held black umbrellas while queuing outside of shops. Jak zaprotestowa, nie ruszajc si z domu?

With new coronavirus restrictions on gatherings going into force today, women in Pozna protested the anti-abortion ruling by going for a \"walk with umbrellas\". It's not raining umbrellas are in Poland a symbol of protests against restricting abortion Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 24, 2020 Coat hanger Coat hangers an international symbol of pro-choice protests have also been widespread during the current demonstrations in Poland, being both wielded by the protesters themselves and also hung on the doors or fences of churches and offices of right-wing politicians. The demonstrations taking place in the city of Wrocaw last Saturday were called the Night of the Coat Hanger Noc wieszaka. Protesters decorated the gate of the palace of the archbishop of Wrocaw with slogans and coat hangers as well as a chemise stained with blood. .ZieloniWro jak zawsze tam gdzie trzeba Dzi wsplnie z wrocawiankami i wrocawianami licznie spacerowali po Ostrowie Tumskim.

Nie pozwolimy odebra sobie naszych praw OstraJazda StrajkKobiet PiekoKobiet pic.twitter.comd23pT8REnW Magorzata Tracz GoTracz October 24, 2020 The symbol refers to the dangers women face if they are forced to seek illegal, backstreet abortions due to the lack of availability of safe legal ones. In Poland, which has the strictest abortion law in the EU other than Maltas, only around 1,000 legal abortions take place each year. But it is estimated that tens of thousands of women have illegal terminations annually, while many travel abroad for procedures in countries with more liberal laws. Artist Iness Rychlik has produced a self-portrait combining the coat hanger symbol with a blood stain in the shape of Poland. Her work is entitled Granice subtelnoci, with granice meaning both limits and borders and subtelnoci meaning of subtlety or of nicety. The PW Anchor The anchor kotwica is one of Polands most important symbols. Created in 1942 by Anna Smoleska, a member of the underground resistance, it was used as an emblem of the struggle against German occupation during the war. Its shape creates the letters PW, standing for Polska Walczca Poland Fighting.
