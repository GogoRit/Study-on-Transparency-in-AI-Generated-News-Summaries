I AGREE ENGLISH FOR AFRICA Programs Cardinal Tong calls for promoting a culture of life CHURCH Hong Kong protecting life science and technology Coronavirus Hong Kong Cardinal advocates for promoting a culture of life In his message for Pro-Life Day 2020, Cardinal John Tong of Hong Kong urges Christians to promote a culture of life, as the Church marks the 25th anniversary of the encyclical Evangelium Vitae. By Vatican News Cardinal John Tong, the Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong, has invited Christians to revisit the notion of the culture of life. His invitation came in a message ahead of Pro-Life Day 2020, which this year coincides with the 25th anniversary of the promulgation of Pope St. John Paul IIs 1995 encyclical, Evangelium Vitae The Gospel of Life. In the past seven months, noted Cardinal Tong, the pandemic Covid-19 has claimed the lives of over 810,000 persons and infected more than 23.5 million persons worldwide. This disaster drives us to reflect on the values and meaning of life and treasure them more. The encyclical, The Gospel of Life, is meant to be a precise and vigorous reaffirmation of the value of human life and its inviolability, and at the same time, a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God respect, protect, love and serve life, every human life! said Cardinal Tong, citing Evangelium Vitae. Cardinal Tong also explained that the fourth Pro-Life Day was postponed to 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of our Lady, because its original day - the feast of the Visitation - fell on 31 May 2020, which was also Pentecost Sunday. Covid-19 and the culture of death Cardinal Tong noted that, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some countries adopted some policies and attitudes that treated the pandemic lightly like the common flu or by handling it with the approach of herd immunity. These attitudes, he said, devalued our vulnerable brothers and sisters, caused us to neglect our responsibility to care for our brothers and sisters properly, and intensified the impact of the culture of death. Contrasting this with the encyclical Evangelium Vitae, Cardinal Tong said that St. John Paul II invited us to contemplate the meaning of life, its greatness and fantasy, respecting that everyone has a right to life. This reflection should, in turn, lead us to do goodlove and care for others, as the value of a person is not determined by any categories but simply because heshe is a person irrespective of any disability or incapability. He hailed the sacrifice of many priests who, in spite of infection rates, continued to visit coronavirus patients often at the risk of getting infected themselves. They live our Jesuss words, he said, no one has greater love than this, to lay down ones life for ones friends John 15 13. Promoting a new culture of life To foster a new culture of life, the Cardinal stressed on the importance of obeying Gods commandment Thou shall not kill. Obedience to this commandment, he further explained, includes not being angry with our brother, preaching the Gospel of life and supporting all the programmes, organizations and teachings that promote the values of life and serve the gospel of life. In this regard, human life is to be respected and treated as a gift from God, sacred and inviolable from conception to the time of natural death. Consequently, abortion and euthanasia are absolutely unacceptable as the value of life is based on giving and accepting love with the understanding that the conjugal acts of married couples are oriented to the procreation of life. Important also is the formation of conscience, noted the Cardinal, especially as our societies and mass media today are deeply influenced by the culture of death. He pointed out more education needs to be done to nourish a correct conscience in the face of a culture that causes confusion between good and evil, precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life. The role of family Cardinal Tong highlighted the important role of family as a sanctuary of life and the place where the couple welcomes a new life the gift of God. The family is also a place for daily individual and family prayers, to live out the gospel of life and for the special care of the elderly and the sick. In these capacities, he noted, the family has an indispensable role in fostering the culture of life. Science, technology in service of human life Cardinal Tong said that science and technology can be used in the service of human life and its integrity, insisting that advancements in biotechnology need to be understood in order to be used for the promotion and protection of life. In this regard, he acknowledged the role of the Bioethics Resource Center of the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Theology and Philosophy, the Diocesan Pastoral Commission for Marriage and Family, and Catholic schools which identify life as one of their core educational values. He also recommended the Creighton Model Fertility Care System for couples who are having difficulties in achieving pregnancies and natural family planning services for couples preparing to have children. Pointing out that contemporary society is torn between a culture of life and a culture of death, Cardinal Tong called for critical thinking that is capable of discerning true values and authentic needs to build a culture of life. In conclusion, he urged everyone to love and respect every human life, walk forward patiently and courageously, to foster the culture of life which is the fruit of truth and love.

In the face of this global health crisis, Canadas approach, guided by the Feminist International Assistance Policy FIAP, is crucial in ensuring a feminist and human-rights based response to COVID-19 that recognizes the gendered impacts of the pandemic and the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR at this time. Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights encourages the Government of Canada to ensure an integrated response to the virus that includes SRHR, with a particular focus on the neglected areas of SRHR, including abortion access, comprehensive contraceptive care, SRHR for adolescents and youth, including comprehensive sexuality education, and advocacy for SRHR. Sexual and reproductive health and rights underpin gender equality and are pivotal to good health. Evidence shows that when women are denied access to contraception, safe abortion and post-abortion care, maternal mortality rates rise. SRHR services are essential health care and must be accessible. A continued focus on the neglected areas of SRHR must also be part of the global response to COVID-19. In the FIAP, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of access to SRHR for women and girls in its humanitarian response. In the face of a global health crisis, it is time to action the policy and ensure that the needs of women and girls in the most underfunded and overlooked areas are a priority in the global response. A feminist approach to the pandemic includes addressing the unique impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized groups, including women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, people living with disabilities, the working poor, those already living in emergency and humanitarian settings, and many others who face discrimination and barriers to resources, healthcare, and social services. In times of crisis, these inequalities are exacerbated and compounded by new and additional hardships such as greater economic instability, increased gender-based violence GBV, and higher rates of unplanned pregnancies. Further, with women disproportionately represented on the frontlines of the pandemic as health workers and in caregiving role, women have an increased risk of contracting the virus. Why do the neglected areas of SRHR need to be prioritized in the global response to COVID-19? Access to contraception The demand for contraceptives does not change during times of crisis. However, mass disruptions to supply chains and the diversion of supplies to the COVID-19 response create new and additional barriers to access. Supply chain disruption applies to various forms of contraceptives including birth control pills, condoms, and devices, as well as access to emergency contraception. It is imperative that these basic and essential commodities be available and accessible throughout the pandemic. Without decreased access to contraception, it is expected that unplanned pregnancies will increase in the coming months, putting further strain on health systems and increasing demand for abortion. Other ways to increase access to contraception include easing administrative barriers. This includes not requiring a prescription, allowing contraceptives to be prescribed via telemedicine, allowing pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives, and by providing comprehensive cost coverage. In addition to contraception, supply chain disruption could have an effect on other SRHR related drugs, including antiretrovirals for those living with HIV, medical abortion pills, and antibiotics and other medications used to treat sexually transmitted infections. Safe abortion Abortion is an essential and time-sensitive procedure. However, in emergencies, it is often deprioritized, delayed or not offered at all as health systems are stretched thin and supplies and human resources are directed elsewhere. Lockdowns, social distancing and increased barriers to travel during the pandemic make it even harder for pregnant people to access abortion. Unfortunately, where safe abortion is not readily accessible, people will turn to unsafe abortion. Supply chain disruptions can also affect access to medical abortion also known as the abortion pill. A safe method to terminate pregnancy that requires minimal travel or exposure to the virus, many advocates and medical professionals are pushing for expanded access to medical abortion e.g. by removing legal and administrative barrier, allowing its use up to 12 weeks, and allowing prescriptions via telemedicine. SRHR for adolescents and youth The pandemic has forced the closure of schools in many countries, leaving billions of children and youth without access to education. Learning from past humanitarian crises, these interruptions can lead to increased drop-out rates, which disproportionately affects adolescent girls by furthering gender gaps in education and leading to increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy, and early and forced marriage. Outside of school, the caregiving burdens on young women and adolescents may increase. They may also lose access to health and hygiene services or products that are often offered through schools. The closure of schools also means that young people are being denied life-saving comprehensive sexuality education CSE. CSE is a key intervention to prevent childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence. When delivered properly, CSE can address persistent stigma, prejudice, and discrimination against the LGBTQI2S community and reduce homophobic and transphobic violence. This is critical knowledge that enables children and youth to keep themselves healthy and safe and should be accessible to all, even in times of crisis. Advocacy for SRHR Communities must be central in the COVID-19 response. Local mobilizers and organizations best know their communitys needs, including the unique needs of women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, and other vulnerable groups. Feminist, womens rights and youth organizations should be supported and meaningfully included in policymaking at all levels in the response to COVID-19, and in program design, delivery and monitoring. Amid government efforts to control movement and limit the spread of the virus, there has been an uptick in surveillance, censorship, and criminalization, putting civil liberties at risk. Human rights defenders drawing attention to these abuses, including health care workers, journalists, and other whistleblowers must be protected. Another threat to access to SRHR includes ideological attacks by policymakers using the pandemic to push through laws and restrictions that violate human rights. This includes everything from abortion restrictions to attacks on trans rights. As we face this unprecedented global health crisis, we urge Canada to maintain its global feminist leadership and commitment to SRHR in its international assistance. This means a continued focus on the most neglected areas of SRHR at a time pf heightened inequality to ensure uninterrupted access to these essential and lifesaving SRHR services.

Quality sex education can lead to better prevention in STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Furthermore, it decreases the risks of having unsafe sex and increases responsible family planning. To help address issues, like overpopulation, high rates of teen pregnancy and the rise of HIV, the Philippines is gradually implementing sex education and accessibility to contraceptives. Reproductive Health Act The Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 RH Act after a 14-year wait. Through the act, the government integrated sex education into the public school curriculum for students ages 10 to 19. The Philippines also gave funding for free or subsidized contraceptives at health centers and public schools. The government passed the RH Act in response to the many health issues impacting the country, such as infant mortality, pregnancy-related deaths and a rise in HIVAIDS cases. Moreover, teen pregnancies in the Philippines are common, where 9 of women between the ages of 15 and 19 start child bearing. Lack of knowledge about reproductive health is significantly associated with poverty, especially in regard to overpopulation. Therefore, the RH Act aims to help the population make informed decisions about their reproductive health. It provides more equal access to sex education, while also ensuring that the government reaffirms its commitment to protecting womens reproductive rights, providing accessible family planning information, and hiring skilled maternal health professionals to work in both urban and rural areas of the Philippines. Opposition from the Catholic Church Around 80 of the Philippine population identifies as Roman Catholic. Accordingly, the Catholic Church largely influences the state of sex education in the country. The Catholic Church opposes sex outside of marriage and fears sex education will increase sexual relations. The Catholic Church consequently remains critical of the RH Act, increasing difficulties in putting the RH Act into concrete action. Additionally, the Catholic Church opposes implementing sex education in schools as well as the distribution of contraceptives. The Church prefers to rely on parents to teach their kids about reproductive health. However, many families are either unequipped to do so or will not address the subject directly with their children. The Implementation of the RH Act In an effort to reduce the countrys rate of poverty, Philippine President, Rodrigo Duerte, ordered the government to provide access to free contraceptives for six million women in 2017. Duerte aimed to fulfill unmet family planning needs. This came after a restraining order was placed on the RH Act in 2015. However, the government appealed to lift the restraining order to continue applying the RH Act and addressing issues due to overpopulation. In 2019, Save the Children Philippines an organization with the purpose of supporting Filipino children advocated for the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention bill. The organization also fought for requiring schools to fully integrate Comprehensive Sexuality Education CSE into their curriculum. Save the Children Philippines hopes to combat the countrys high rate of teen pregnancy. CSE in the Philippines includes topics such as consent, sexual violence, contraceptives and others. The bill would also advance access to reproductive health services, further supplementing the goals of the RH Act. Increased Conversation Surrounding Sex Education In addition to greater governmental action, there are various organizations that are working to increase access to sex education and services in the Philippines. The Roots of Health is a nongovernmental organization that provides sex education to women in Palawan and Puerto Princesa. Started in 2009, the founders, Dr. Susan Evangelista and Amina Evangelista Swanepoel, initially provided reproductive health classes at Palawan State University in Puerto Princesa and have since expanded into free clinical services for young women. The Roots of Health provides services that assist with birth, reproductive healthcare, contraceptives, prenatal and postpartum check-ups, and ultrasounds. By 2018, they served 20,000 women and adolescents in the Palawan and Puerto Princesa communities, demonstrating that there is a growing grassroots movement towards reframing reproductive health in the Philippines. Sex education will remain a controversial subject in the Philippines. Nonetheless, it is a developing matter that is expected to evolve with continued conversations between governmental, faith and nongovernmental actors.
