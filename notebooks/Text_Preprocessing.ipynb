Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.Graham\\u2019s own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where \\u201cMAGA\\u201d Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.\\u201cAmerica\\u2019s got to make some decisions,\\u201d Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.The South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wade\\u2019s nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, no, no, no, no, no, no, we\\u2019re going nowhere,\\u201d the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. \\u201cWe welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022.\\u201d\\nReaction was swift, fierce and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Graham\\u2019s legislation as an extreme example of the far-right\\u2019s hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cA nationwide abortion ban \\u2014 that\\u2019s the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple,\\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans \\u201cwant to force\\u201d women to stay pregnant and deliver babies. \\n\\n\\u201cTo anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality,\\u201d she said. \\u201cRepublicans are coming for your rights.\\u201d The sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Court\\u2019s landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.In a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Biden\\u2019s lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races. Tuesday\\u2019s announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Graham\\u2019s proposed abortion ban.\\u201cThis bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe,\\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\\u201cWhile President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy \\u2013 and to take unprecedented action to address climate change \\u2014 Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women,\\u201d Jean-Pierre said.\\n\\nGraham\\u2019s legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security and Biden\\u2019s leadership. The Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the physical health of the mother. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.In particular, Graham\\u2019s bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent.\\n\\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Graham\\u2019s legislation. \\u201cI think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue,\\u201d McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. \\u201cSo I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.\\u201dThe Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Graham\\u2019s proposed nationwide abortion ban.\\n\\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Graham \\u201cand every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.\\u201dHer Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.In Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted: \\u201cA nationwide abortion ban is outrageous. \\u201cBennet pledged \\u201cto defend a woman\\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.\\u201dHis opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe O\\u2019Dea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part: \\u201cA Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer\\u2019s hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification or conscience protections for religious hospitals.\\u201dThe races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.Pelosi called Graham\\u2019s bill the \\u201cclearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans\\u2019 intent to criminalize women\\u2019s health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake: if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.\\u201dRepublican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences. \\u201cI think that what it\\u2019s attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit,\\u201d said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.\\u201cDemocrats are implying that all Republicans are for a ban without exceptions, and that\\u2019s not true,\\u201d Thune said. \\u201cThere are Republicans who are in favor of restrictions. And I think this is an attempt to at least put something out there that reflects the views of a lot of Republicans who are in favor of some restrictions.\\u201d___Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

This year\\u2019s theme? Life Empowers: Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman. So of course, a man accused of sexual assault, harassment, and rape by more than 20 women was the obvious choice to be this year\\u2019s headliner. (He has denied these claims.) The rally was founded in 1974 as a response to SCOTUS passing the landmark abortion access case Roe v. Wade the year prior and organizers plan to hold the event every year until it\\u2019s overturned.Related StoryIt\\u2019s Time to Freak Out About Your Repro RightsTrump\\u2019s attendance is unprecedented\\u2014former conservative presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush declined to address the anti-abortion rally in person. Per a New York Times report, these leaders \\u201csaw [attending] as a step too far and instead showed their support in less visible ways.\\u201d His appearance is also an unmistakable tell: The now-impeached president, who is currently on trial in the U.S. Senate for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, spoke to marchers in order to appease his evangelical base and secure their support in the 2020 election. He used this moment as a stand-in for a campaign rally, telling the crowd, \\u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\\u201d (It\\u2019s worth noting that he announced his appearance after the anti-abortion PAC Susan B. Anthony List said it would donate $52 million to anti-abortion Republicans in the 2020 election cycle.)View full post on XIt\\u2019s difficult to believe Trump\\u2019s disdain for abortion is genuine and not simply a gross political play. In a 1999 interview, Trump described himself as \\u201cvery pro-choice,\\u201d even though he claimed he \\u201cpersonally\\u201d didn\\u2019t like abortion. \\u201cI hate the concept of abortion,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still\\u2014I just believe in choice.\\u201dRelated StoryThis Anti-Abortion Bill Could Kill YouThese quotes were even used in attack ads by his Republican opponents during the 2016 primary. It was only when he was under fire did he change his tune. During a 2016 town hall with MSNBC\\u2019s Chris Matthews, Trump said there should be \\u201csome form of punishment\\u201d for women who seek and obtain abortion services. As a presidential candidate, he promised to elect anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court, with the sole purpose of overturning Roe v. Wade. He spread dangerous lies about abortion later in pregnancy during the presidential debates, going so far as to say women have abortions \\u201cdays before giving birth\\u201d and claim, \\u201cYou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day.\\u201d (Spoiler alert: You cannot.)It\\u2019s difficult to believe Trump\\u2019s disdain for abortion is genuine and not simply a gross political play. Since taking office, Trump has doubled down on the promises he made to anti-abortion voters during the 2016 campaign. Upon his swearing in as the nation\\u2019s 45th president, he enacted the Global Gag Rule, which halts international funding to any health care organization that provides, discusses, or refers patients to abortion services. He appointed conservative judges Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, where they now stand to rule on an abortion case June Medical Services, LLC v. Gee, which could gut Roe v. Wade by allowing medically unnecessary barriers to abortion care to be enacted at the state level.Calling this president or the anti-choice movement \\u201cpro-women\\u201d is a joke, as their shared agendas continue to champion anti-abortion legislation that is known to harm women and pregnant people. But Trump employs it with the self-indulgent hope that it will win him another four years in office. During his speech on Friday, he told the crowd, \\u201cTogether, we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to Democrats\\u2014and you know this\\u2014you\\u2019ve seen what\\u2019s happened. Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you can even say for centuries. Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth.\\u201d (This is an absolutely false claim.)\\u201cThey are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice, and we will win because we know how to win,\\u201d he said. Yet Trump neglected to acknowledge that the latest polls show that he trails every Democratic presidential nominee. Or that 77 percent of Americans actually support Roe v. Wade\\u2014and that people will continue to have abortions as long as they are able to get pregnant.Related StoryI Was Shamed by My Town for Getting an AbortionDanielle CampoamorDanielle Campoamor is an award-winning freelance writer covering mental health, reproductive justice, abortion access, maternal mental health, politics, and feminist issues.

Photos by T\\u00e9a Smith.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been attending pro-choice rallies all her life, so she made a point to be at a State House protest on Thursday that drew 100 people.\\nThe 69-year-old Columbia woman said she has held her views on the right to legal abortion since she was 15 when she worked as a candy striper hospital volunteer. Abortion was not legal at the time. On one of her shifts, a woman came into the hospital after attempting a self-induced abortion.\\n\\u201cShe had blood coming down her legs. Her dress had blood. And she literally bled out as soon as she walked in the ER,\\u201d Pressley-Turner said. \\u201cSo I\\u2019ve been pro-choice.\\u201d\\nThe rally, sponsored by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and the Women\\u2019s Right and Empowerment Network, was held to protest two anti-abortion bills pushed by the S.C. Senate. The legislation was referred to the Medical Affairs Committee for discussion Thursday.\\nOne bill, \\u201cEqual Protection for Unborn Babies Act,\\u201d would ban abortion completely unless the pregnant person\\u2019s life is at immediate risk. This means that anyone who performed an abortion could be charged with murder and face the death penalty.\\nThis would only happen if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortions.\\nA second bill would legally require doctors to inform women about an abortion reversal pill if they request abortion medication.\\n\\u201cAbortion is not something to take lightly. It is a fundamental piece of healthcare that is integral to our ability to control our lives and control our futures,\\u201d said Maya Ward, a development and communications associate for WREN. \\u201cBut anti-abortion lawmakers don\\u2019t seem to see it that way.\\u201d\\nThe rally drew people of all ages, some clutching handmade signs or sported pro-choice pins.\\nBob Whitaker, 75, said it was his first time attending an abortion rally.\\n\\u201cI believe in a women\\u2019s right to control their body,\\u201d Whitaker, a Columbia resident, said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a basic thing.\\u201d\\nFor others who had attended the event in past years, it evoked frustration because it felt like legislators weren\\u2019t listening to their concerns.\\n\\u201cWe are having these hearings every year on the State House grounds, right here where a statue of J. Marion Sims still stands,\\u201d said Kim Smith, co-founder of the Soda City Bail, an organization that bails out protesters. He was \\u201ca man that did racist, horrific, medical, gynecological experiments on enslaved black women. I bring this up because this to me is a symbol \\u2013 a symbol of how the ruling class of South Carolina seeks to remind us that they controlled my ancestors.\\u201d\\nWhile the future of the two bills is unknown, those in opposition hope that they will be overturned, keeping abortion legal and safe.\\nThe legislation to reverse abortions remains controversial because of medical risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says science does not support the abortion reversal pill. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a group of about 4,500 physicians, supports the measure.\\nSen. Mia McLeod, D-Richland, called out her Republican colleagues for promoting the legislation.\\n\\u201cBecause of their reckless disregard for women and girls across our state, you\\u2019re witnessing the worst of South Carolina,\\u201d McLeod said. \\u201cBut tomorrow is a new day and hopefully a new opportunity to stop playing God and to try to be more godly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been pro-choice since she was 15 years old.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll abortions would be banned in South Carolina under one of the Senate measures if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nRichland Sen. Mia McLeod said she would continue to fight until \\u201cthe reproductive rights and freedoms of every South Carolina woman and girl are protected.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nABOUT THE JOURNALISTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarson Peaden\\nCarson Peaden is a senior multimedia journalist with a passion for the arts.

Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.Graham\\u2019s own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where \\u201cMAGA\\u201d Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.\\u201cAmerica\\u2019s got to make some decisions,\\u201d Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.The South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wade\\u2019s nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, no, no, no, no, no, no, we\\u2019re going nowhere,\\u201d the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. \\u201cWe welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022.\\u201d\\nReaction was swift, fierce and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Graham\\u2019s legislation as an extreme example of the far-right\\u2019s hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cA nationwide abortion ban \\u2014 that\\u2019s the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple,\\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans \\u201cwant to force\\u201d women to stay pregnant and deliver babies. \\n\\n\\u201cTo anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality,\\u201d she said. \\u201cRepublicans are coming for your rights.\\u201d The sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Court\\u2019s landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.In a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Biden\\u2019s lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races. Tuesday\\u2019s announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Graham\\u2019s proposed abortion ban.\\u201cThis bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe,\\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\\u201cWhile President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy \\u2013 and to take unprecedented action to address climate change \\u2014 Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women,\\u201d Jean-Pierre said.\\n\\nGraham\\u2019s legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security and Biden\\u2019s leadership. The Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the physical health of the mother. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.In particular, Graham\\u2019s bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent.\\n\\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Graham\\u2019s legislation. \\u201cI think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue,\\u201d McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. \\u201cSo I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.\\u201dThe Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Graham\\u2019s proposed nationwide abortion ban.\\n\\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Graham \\u201cand every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.\\u201dHer Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.In Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted: \\u201cA nationwide abortion ban is outrageous. \\u201cBennet pledged \\u201cto defend a woman\\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.\\u201dHis opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe O\\u2019Dea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part: \\u201cA Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer\\u2019s hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification or conscience protections for religious hospitals.\\u201dThe races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.Pelosi called Graham\\u2019s bill the \\u201cclearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans\\u2019 intent to criminalize women\\u2019s health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake: if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.\\u201dRepublican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences. \\u201cI think that what it\\u2019s attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit,\\u201d said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.\\u201cDemocrats are implying that all Republicans are for a ban without exceptions, and that\\u2019s not true,\\u201d Thune said. \\u201cThere are Republicans who are in favor of restrictions. And I think this is an attempt to at least put something out there that reflects the views of a lot of Republicans who are in favor of some restrictions.\\u201d___Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

This year\\u2019s theme? Life Empowers: Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman. So of course, a man accused of sexual assault, harassment, and rape by more than 20 women was the obvious choice to be this year\\u2019s headliner. (He has denied these claims.) The rally was founded in 1974 as a response to SCOTUS passing the landmark abortion access case Roe v. Wade the year prior and organizers plan to hold the event every year until it\\u2019s overturned.Related StoryIt\\u2019s Time to Freak Out About Your Repro RightsTrump\\u2019s attendance is unprecedented\\u2014former conservative presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush declined to address the anti-abortion rally in person. Per a New York Times report, these leaders \\u201csaw [attending] as a step too far and instead showed their support in less visible ways.\\u201d His appearance is also an unmistakable tell: The now-impeached president, who is currently on trial in the U.S. Senate for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, spoke to marchers in order to appease his evangelical base and secure their support in the 2020 election. He used this moment as a stand-in for a campaign rally, telling the crowd, \\u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\\u201d (It\\u2019s worth noting that he announced his appearance after the anti-abortion PAC Susan B. Anthony List said it would donate $52 million to anti-abortion Republicans in the 2020 election cycle.)View full post on XIt\\u2019s difficult to believe Trump\\u2019s disdain for abortion is genuine and not simply a gross political play. In a 1999 interview, Trump described himself as \\u201cvery pro-choice,\\u201d even though he claimed he \\u201cpersonally\\u201d didn\\u2019t like abortion. \\u201cI hate the concept of abortion,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still\\u2014I just believe in choice.\\u201dRelated StoryThis Anti-Abortion Bill Could Kill YouThese quotes were even used in attack ads by his Republican opponents during the 2016 primary. It was only when he was under fire did he change his tune. During a 2016 town hall with MSNBC\\u2019s Chris Matthews, Trump said there should be \\u201csome form of punishment\\u201d for women who seek and obtain abortion services. As a presidential candidate, he promised to elect anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court, with the sole purpose of overturning Roe v. Wade. He spread dangerous lies about abortion later in pregnancy during the presidential debates, going so far as to say women have abortions \\u201cdays before giving birth\\u201d and claim, \\u201cYou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day.\\u201d (Spoiler alert: You cannot.)It\\u2019s difficult to believe Trump\\u2019s disdain for abortion is genuine and not simply a gross political play. Since taking office, Trump has doubled down on the promises he made to anti-abortion voters during the 2016 campaign. Upon his swearing in as the nation\\u2019s 45th president, he enacted the Global Gag Rule, which halts international funding to any health care organization that provides, discusses, or refers patients to abortion services. He appointed conservative judges Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, where they now stand to rule on an abortion case June Medical Services, LLC v. Gee, which could gut Roe v. Wade by allowing medically unnecessary barriers to abortion care to be enacted at the state level.Calling this president or the anti-choice movement \\u201cpro-women\\u201d is a joke, as their shared agendas continue to champion anti-abortion legislation that is known to harm women and pregnant people. But Trump employs it with the self-indulgent hope that it will win him another four years in office. During his speech on Friday, he told the crowd, \\u201cTogether, we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to Democrats\\u2014and you know this\\u2014you\\u2019ve seen what\\u2019s happened. Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you can even say for centuries. Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth.\\u201d (This is an absolutely false claim.)\\u201cThey are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice, and we will win because we know how to win,\\u201d he said. Yet Trump neglected to acknowledge that the latest polls show that he trails every Democratic presidential nominee. Or that 77 percent of Americans actually support Roe v. Wade\\u2014and that people will continue to have abortions as long as they are able to get pregnant.Related StoryI Was Shamed by My Town for Getting an AbortionDanielle CampoamorDanielle Campoamor is an award-winning freelance writer covering mental health, reproductive justice, abortion access, maternal mental health, politics, and feminist issues.

Photos by T\\u00e9a Smith.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been attending pro-choice rallies all her life, so she made a point to be at a State House protest on Thursday that drew 100 people.\\nThe 69-year-old Columbia woman said she has held her views on the right to legal abortion since she was 15 when she worked as a candy striper hospital volunteer. Abortion was not legal at the time. On one of her shifts, a woman came into the hospital after attempting a self-induced abortion.\\n\\u201cShe had blood coming down her legs. Her dress had blood. And she literally bled out as soon as she walked in the ER,\\u201d Pressley-Turner said. \\u201cSo I\\u2019ve been pro-choice.\\u201d\\nThe rally, sponsored by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and the Women\\u2019s Right and Empowerment Network, was held to protest two anti-abortion bills pushed by the S.C. Senate. The legislation was referred to the Medical Affairs Committee for discussion Thursday.\\nOne bill, \\u201cEqual Protection for Unborn Babies Act,\\u201d would ban abortion completely unless the pregnant person\\u2019s life is at immediate risk. This means that anyone who performed an abortion could be charged with murder and face the death penalty.\\nThis would only happen if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortions.\\nA second bill would legally require doctors to inform women about an abortion reversal pill if they request abortion medication.\\n\\u201cAbortion is not something to take lightly. It is a fundamental piece of healthcare that is integral to our ability to control our lives and control our futures,\\u201d said Maya Ward, a development and communications associate for WREN. \\u201cBut anti-abortion lawmakers don\\u2019t seem to see it that way.\\u201d\\nThe rally drew people of all ages, some clutching handmade signs or sported pro-choice pins.\\nBob Whitaker, 75, said it was his first time attending an abortion rally.\\n\\u201cI believe in a women\\u2019s right to control their body,\\u201d Whitaker, a Columbia resident, said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a basic thing.\\u201d\\nFor others who had attended the event in past years, it evoked frustration because it felt like legislators weren\\u2019t listening to their concerns.\\n\\u201cWe are having these hearings every year on the State House grounds, right here where a statue of J. Marion Sims still stands,\\u201d said Kim Smith, co-founder of the Soda City Bail, an organization that bails out protesters. He was \\u201ca man that did racist, horrific, medical, gynecological experiments on enslaved black women. I bring this up because this to me is a symbol \\u2013 a symbol of how the ruling class of South Carolina seeks to remind us that they controlled my ancestors.\\u201d\\nWhile the future of the two bills is unknown, those in opposition hope that they will be overturned, keeping abortion legal and safe.\\nThe legislation to reverse abortions remains controversial because of medical risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says science does not support the abortion reversal pill. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a group of about 4,500 physicians, supports the measure.\\nSen. Mia McLeod, D-Richland, called out her Republican colleagues for promoting the legislation.\\n\\u201cBecause of their reckless disregard for women and girls across our state, you\\u2019re witnessing the worst of South Carolina,\\u201d McLeod said. \\u201cBut tomorrow is a new day and hopefully a new opportunity to stop playing God and to try to be more godly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been pro-choice since she was 15 years old.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll abortions would be banned in South Carolina under one of the Senate measures if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nRichland Sen.

Below, we explain the meaning and history behind six of the most common.\\nRed lightning bolt\\nA red lightning bolt has become the main symbol of the protests. It is part of the logo of Women’s Strike (Strajk Kobiet), a grassroots women’s rights initiative and the main organiser of the current demonstrations.\\nIt was originally created by graphic designer Ola Jasionowska, who says that it symbolises a warning.\\xa0“It says: watch out, beware, we won’t accept that women are being deprived of their basic rights,” Jasionowska explained to Newsweek Polska.\\n\\n\\nNigdy już żadna nie będzie szła sama. Będziemy szły razem. Będziemy walczyć o polskie kobiety i przestrzeganie praw człowieka – na ulicy i w sejmie. Marszałek Terlecki albo się z tym pogodzi i wprowadzi pod obrad ustawę o depenalizacji i legalizacji, albo będzie miał rewolucję! pic.twitter.com/PsiH9cvJM7\\n— Marcelina Zawisza (@mmzawisza) October 27, 2020\\n\\nThe symbol has been seized upon by critics of the protests, who have tried to claim that it is similar to the insignia used by the SS and other formations in Nazi Germany.\\nRyszard Terlecki, head of PiS’s parliamentary caucus and deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, said it was “sad” to see opposition MPs wearing facemasks “referencing totalitarian symbols”.\\nNews broadcasts on state TV, which is under the influence of PiS, have this week repeatedly referred to the protesters as “left-wing fascists” and drawn links between their symbol and Nazism.\\n\\n\\n\"Leftist fascism is destroying Poland\" headlined the main evening news on state TV (a government mouthpiece) for the second night in a row.\\nThey said that abortion protesters have expressed \"approval of cannibalism\" and use a symbol associated with Nazism and Satan pic.twitter.com/8Xufk66tih\\n— Daniel Tilles (@danieltilles1) October 28, 2020\\n\\nSupporters of the protests point out that the Women’s Strike logo is different in colour, shape and style to the SS insignia, and that lightning bolts are a common symbol for an array of different groups.\\nAmong those that have used such as symbol were the “Grey Ranks”, an underground Polish paramilitary organisation that resisted the German Nazi occupation in World War II. Those who link the lightning symbol to Nazism are “insulting Polish heroes”, said left-wing MP Anna-Maria Żukowska.\\nJasionowska, the designer of the logo, says the claims of Nazi links are “absurd”: “It wasn’t my intention at all. Everyone looks for interpretations that they find useful.”\\n\\n“Wypierdalać” and Solidarity\\xa0\\nOne of the main slogans of the current protests has been “Wypierdalać”, a vulgarity that translates roughly as “Fuck off”.\\nThe word has been chanted by demonstrators, while also appearing on posters and banners. Some quickly began to combine it with an iconic Polish symbol of protests and resistance, the logo of the Solidarity (Solidarność) trade union that played a leading role in bringing down communism in Poland in the 1980s.\\n\\n\\nA court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland has brought tens of thousands of protesters – mostly women – onto the streets.\\nWe look at the protests through the lens of Italian photographer Luca Aliano https://t.co/EkqNxOnSrZ\\n— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) October 26, 2020\\n\\nArtist Jarek Kubicki then developed that theme further by adapting a famous campaign poster from 1989, when Poland held its first semi-free elections, in which the Solidarity logo appeared behind an image of Gary Cooper appearing as a cowboy in the American Western High Noon.\\nKubicki recreated the poster, but with “Solidarność” replaced by “Wypierdalać” and Gary Cooper replaced by female action heroes from Hollywood movies.\\n\\nThe idea quickly spread, with many Polish women, including left-wing female MPs, creating similar images with themselves in the foreground.\\n\\nThe designer of the original Solidarity logo, Jerzy Janiszewski, has previously said that he has no problem with abortion protesters using his work.\\n“As the author, I am opposed to prosecuting and punishing anyone for using the logo during peaceful and, in my opinion, legitimate protests for women’s rights in Poland,” he said in 2016.\\xa0\\n***** ***\\xa0\\nAt the abortion protests, there have been many signs bearing eight asterisks in the form ***** ***, in what may be a rather confusing and cryptic message for observers from outside Poland. The symbols (widely referred to as “eight little stars” in Polish) stand for “Jebać PiS” (Fuck PiS).\\nThey became a widely used meme during this year’s presidential election campaign, especially after they appeared in the video for a song by Polish rapper Taco Hemingway that was seen as critical of the ruling party.\\nIn one famous image, President Andrzej Duda – who was standing for re-election as the candidate supported by PiS – unwittingly posed for a photo alongside a young man wearing a t-shirt bearing the eight stars.\\n\\n\\nChyba nikt prezydenta nie pilnuje na tych wiecach.

Tens of thousands of Polish women, wearing black to symbolise mourning, came out onto the streets.\\nSome of the largest demonstrations took place in the autumn rain, and as a result umbrellas became a symbol of the “Black Protests”.\\n\\n\\nThousands Of Pissed Off WomenWarsaw (City in Europe) October 2016 (AD)#czarnyprotest#blackprotest pic.twitter.com/7SfEPJZ7PO\\n— Borys Musielak (@michuk) October 3, 2016\\n\\nThose demonstrations succeeded in forcing PiS to back away from the proposed abortion ban. But afterwards, organisers vowed: “Nie składamy parasolek” (We’re not closing our umbrellas). And since then, umbrellas have reappeared whenever a threat to women’s reproductive rights is perceived.\\nEarlier this year, another proposal to ban abortion returned to parliament during lockdown. With street protests prohibited, many women placed black umbrellas in their windows or balconies, or held black umbrellas while queuing outside of shops.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJak zaprotestować, nie ruszając się z domu?

Protesters “decorated” the gate of the palace of the archbishop of Wrocław with slogans and coat hangers as well as a chemise stained with blood.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n.@ZieloniWro jak zawsze tam gdzie trzeba✊💚 Dziś wspólnie z wrocławiankami i wrocławianami licznie spacerowali po Ostrowie Tumskim.

But it is estimated that tens of thousands of women have illegal terminations annually, while many travel abroad for procedures in countries with more liberal laws.\\nArtist Iness Rychlik has produced a self-portrait combining the coat hanger symbol with a blood stain in the shape of Poland. Her work is entitled Granice subtelności, with\\xa0granice meaning both “limits” and “borders” and\\xa0subtelności meaning “of subtlety” or “of nicety”.\\n\\nThe “PW” Anchor\\xa0\\nThe “anchor” (kotwica) is one of Poland’s most important symbols. Created in 1942 by Anna Smoleńska, a member of the underground resistance, it was used as an emblem of the struggle against German occupation during the war. Its shape creates the letters “PW”, standing for Polska Walcząca (Poland Fighting).\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe ‘Kotwica” sign – the emblem of #FightingPoland – was created in 1942 as a symbol of resistance against German occupation of Poland.#PolishUndergroundState #OccupiedPoland #WWII #WW2 #HomeArmy #Polishhistory #Kotwica pic.twitter.com/boUE5eL2QQ\\n— Institute of National Remembrance (@ipngovpl_eng) January 17, 2019\\n\\nDuring the Black Protests of 2016, some women displayed an adapted version of the symbol, turning the arms of the anchor into breasts and making the PW stand for Polka Walcząca (Polish Woman Fighting).\\n\\n\\nTransparent z \"Polką Walczącą\" nie był zniewagą.

            "The symbols of Polands abortion protests explained Notes From Poland News Insights Po polsku Topics Politics Society Culture Business History Education Energy Climate Law Media Podcasts Notes from Poland Podcast The VoiCEE podcast About us Our story Editorial team Advisory Board Notes from Poland Foundation Contact Newsletters Notes from Poland Newsletter Central and Eastern Europe Newsletter Select Page The symbols of Polands abortion protests explained Oct 30, 2020 Explainers, Politics, Society By Agnieszka Wdoowska Since last weeks constitutional court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland, the country has witnessed eight consecutive days of mass protests that are believed to be the largest since the fall of communism in 1989. Much of the demonstrators anger has been directed not against the court itself, but rather towards the Catholic church and ruling national-conservative Law and Justice PiS party, who are seen as being behind the ruling. As hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets, many have displayed symbols that have come to characterise the protests. Below, we explain the meaning and history behind six of the most common. Red lightning bolt A red lightning bolt has become the main symbol of the protests. It is part of the logo of Womens Strike Strajk Kobiet, a grassroots womens rights initiative and the main organiser of the current demonstrations. It was originally created by graphic designer Ola Jasionowska, who says that it symbolises a warning. It says watch out, beware, we wont accept that women are being deprived of their basic rights, Jasionowska explained to Newsweek Polska. Nigdy ju adna nie bdzie sza sama. Bdziemy szy razem. Bdziemy walczy o polskie kobiety i przestrzeganie praw czowieka na ulicy i w sejmie. Marszaek Terlecki albo si z tym pogodzi i wprowadzi pod obrad ustaw o depenalizacji i legalizacji, albo bdzie mia rewolucj! pic.twitter.comPsiH9cvJM7 Marcelina Zawisza mmzawisza October 27, 2020 The symbol has been seized upon by critics of the protests, who have tried to claim that it is similar to the insignia used by the SS and other formations in Nazi Germany. Ryszard Terlecki, head of PiSs parliamentary caucus and deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, said it was sad to see opposition MPs wearing facemasks referencing totalitarian symbols. News broadcasts on state TV, which is under the influence of PiS, have this week repeatedly referred to the protesters as left-wing fascists and drawn links between their symbol and Nazism. \"Leftist fascism is destroying Poland\" headlined the main evening news on state TV a government mouthpiece for the second night in a row. They said that abortion protesters have expressed \"approval of cannibalism\" and use a symbol associated with Nazism and Satan pic.twitter.com8Xufk66tih Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 28, 2020 Supporters of the protests point out that the Womens Strike logo is different in colour, shape and style to the SS insignia, and that lightning bolts are a common symbol for an array of different groups. Among those that have used such as symbol were the Grey Ranks, an underground Polish paramilitary organisation that resisted the German Nazi occupation in World War II. Those who link the lightning symbol to Nazism are insulting Polish heroes, said left-wing MP Anna-Maria ukowska. Jasionowska, the designer of the logo, says the claims of Nazi links are absurd It wasnt my intention at all. Everyone looks for interpretations that they find useful. Wypierdala and Solidarity One of the main slogans of the current protests has been Wypierdala, a vulgarity that translates roughly as Fuck off. The word has been chanted by demonstrators, while also appearing on posters and banners. Some quickly began to combine it with an iconic Polish symbol of protests and resistance, the logo of the Solidarity Solidarno trade union that played a leading role in bringing down communism in Poland in the 1980s. A court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland has brought tens of thousands of protesters mostly women onto the streets. We look at the protests through the lens of Italian photographer Luca Aliano Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 26, 2020 Artist Jarek Kubicki then developed that theme further by adapting a famous campaign poster from 1989, when Poland held its first semi-free elections, in which the Solidarity logo appeared behind an image of Gary Cooper appearing as a cowboy in the American Western High Noon. Kubicki recreated the poster, but with Solidarno replaced by Wypierdala and Gary Cooper replaced by female action heroes from Hollywood movies. The idea quickly spread, with many Polish women, including left-wing female MPs, creating similar images with themselves in the foreground. The designer of the original Solidarity logo, Jerzy Janiszewski, has previously said that he has no problem with abortion protesters using his work. As the author, I am opposed to prosecuting and punishing anyone for using the logo during peaceful and, in my opinion, legitimate protests for womens rights in Poland, he said in 2016. At the abortion protests, there have been many signs bearing eight asterisks in the form , in what may be a rather confusing and cryptic message for observers from outside Poland. The symbols widely referred to as eight little stars in Polish stand for Jeba PiS Fuck PiS. They became a widely used meme during this years presidential election campaign, especially after they appeared in the video for a song by Polish rapper Taco Hemingway that was seen as critical of the ruling party. In one famous image, President Andrzej Duda who was standing for re-election as the candidate supported by PiS unwittingly posed for a photo alongside a young man wearing a t-shirt bearing the eight stars.

IMHO ma duo szczcia, e wybory ju w niedziel pic.twitter.comRGu9sojAq3 Micha Pociski michalplocinski July 10, 2020 During the current protests, Jeba PiS has become a widespread slogan, appearing on banners often now without the censorship of asterisks and being chanted to the tune of songs such as Eric Prydzs Call On Me. Around a thousand abortion protesters held a party outside the ruling party's HQ in Warsaw, singing \"Jeba PiS\" Fuck PiS to the tune of \"Call On Me\" by ericprydz pic.twitter.comyU9kRLP95e Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 26, 2020 Black umbrella In 2016, mass protests also took place against an attempt to tighten the abortion law and delegalise prenatal screening. Tens of thousands of Polish women, wearing black to symbolise mourning, came out onto the streets. Some of the largest demonstrations took place in the autumn rain, and as a result umbrellas became a symbol of the Black Protests. Thousands Of Pissed Off WomenWarsaw City in Europe October 2016 ADczarnyprotestblackprotest pic.twitter.com7SfEPJZ7PO Borys Musielak michuk October 3, 2016 Those demonstrations succeeded in forcing PiS to back away from the proposed abortion ban. But afterwards, organisers vowed Nie skadamy parasolek Were not closing our umbrellas. And since then, umbrellas have reappeared whenever a threat to womens reproductive rights is perceived. Earlier this year, another proposal to ban abortion returned to parliament during lockdown. With street protests prohibited, many women placed black umbrellas in their windows or balconies, or held black umbrellas while queuing outside of shops. Jak zaprotestowa, nie ruszajc si z domu?

With new coronavirus restrictions on gatherings going into force today, women in Pozna protested the anti-abortion ruling by going for a \"walk with umbrellas\". It's not raining umbrellas are in Poland a symbol of protests against restricting abortion Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 24, 2020 Coat hanger Coat hangers an international symbol of pro-choice protests have also been widespread during the current demonstrations in Poland, being both wielded by the protesters themselves and also hung on the doors or fences of churches and offices of right-wing politicians. The demonstrations taking place in the city of Wrocaw last Saturday were called the Night of the Coat Hanger Noc wieszaka. Protesters decorated the gate of the palace of the archbishop of Wrocaw with slogans and coat hangers as well as a chemise stained with blood. .ZieloniWro jak zawsze tam gdzie trzeba Dzi wsplnie z wrocawiankami i wrocawianami licznie spacerowali po Ostrowie Tumskim. Kto by powiedzia, e pod prawdziw siedzib PiS we Wrocawiu. Nie pozwolimy odebra sobie naszych praw OstraJazda StrajkKobiet PiekoKobiet pic.twitter.comd23pT8REnW Magorzata Tracz GoTracz October 24, 2020 The symbol refers to the dangers women face if they are forced to seek illegal, backstreet abortions due to the lack of availability of safe legal ones. In Poland, which has the strictest abortion law in the EU other than Maltas, only around 1,000 legal abortions take place each year. But it is estimated that tens of thousands of women have illegal terminations annually, while many travel abroad for procedures in countries with more liberal laws. Artist Iness Rychlik has produced a self-portrait combining the coat hanger symbol with a blood stain in the shape of Poland. Her work is entitled Granice subtelnoci, with granice meaning both limits and borders and subtelnoci meaning of subtlety or of nicety. The PW Anchor The anchor kotwica is one of Polands most important symbols. Created in 1942 by Anna Smoleska, a member of the underground resistance, it was used as an emblem of the struggle against German occupation during the war. Its shape creates the letters PW, standing for Polska Walczca Poland Fighting.

Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.Graham\\u2019s own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where \\u201cMAGA\\u201d Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.\\u201cAmerica\\u2019s got to make some decisions,\\u201d Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.The South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wade\\u2019s nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, no, no, no, no, no, no, we\\u2019re going nowhere,\\u201d the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. \\u201cWe welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022.\\u201d\\nReaction was swift, fierce and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Graham\\u2019s legislation as an extreme example of the far-right\\u2019s hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cA nationwide abortion ban \\u2014 that\\u2019s the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple,\\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans \\u201cwant to force\\u201d women to stay pregnant and deliver babies. \\n\\n\\u201cTo anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality,\\u201d she said. \\u201cRepublicans are coming for your rights.\\u201d The sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Court\\u2019s landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.In a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Biden\\u2019s lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races. Tuesday\\u2019s announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Graham\\u2019s proposed abortion ban.\\u201cThis bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe,\\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\\u201cWhile President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy \\u2013 and to take unprecedented action to address climate change \\u2014 Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women,\\u201d Jean-Pierre said.\\n\\nGraham\\u2019s legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security and Biden\\u2019s leadership. The Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the physical health of the mother. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.In particular, Graham\\u2019s bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent.\\n\\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Graham\\u2019s legislation. \\u201cI think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue,\\u201d McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. \\u201cSo I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.\\u201dThe Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Graham\\u2019s proposed nationwide abortion ban.\\n\\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Graham \\u201cand every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.\\u201dHer Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.In Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted: \\u201cA nationwide abortion ban is outrageous. \\u201cBennet pledged \\u201cto defend a woman\\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.\\u201dHis opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe O\\u2019Dea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part: \\u201cA Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer\\u2019s hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification or conscience protections for religious hospitals.\\u201dThe races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.Pelosi called Graham\\u2019s bill the \\u201cclearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans\\u2019 intent to criminalize women\\u2019s health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake: if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.\\u201dRepublican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences. \\u201cI think that what it\\u2019s attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit,\\u201d said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.\\u201cDemocrats are implying that all Republicans are for a ban without exceptions, and that\\u2019s not true,\\u201d Thune said. \\u201cThere are Republicans who are in favor of restrictions. And I think this is an attempt to at least put something out there that reflects the views of a lot of Republicans who are in favor of some restrictions.\\u201d___Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Photos by T\\u00e9a Smith.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been attending pro-choice rallies all her life, so she made a point to be at a State House protest on Thursday that drew 100 people.\\nThe 69-year-old Columbia woman said she has held her views on the right to legal abortion since she was 15 when she worked as a candy striper hospital volunteer. Abortion was not legal at the time. On one of her shifts, a woman came into the hospital after attempting a self-induced abortion.\\n\\u201cShe had blood coming down her legs. Her dress had blood. And she literally bled out as soon as she walked in the ER,\\u201d Pressley-Turner said. \\u201cSo I\\u2019ve been pro-choice.\\u201d\\nThe rally, sponsored by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and the Women\\u2019s Right and Empowerment Network, was held to protest two anti-abortion bills pushed by the S.C. Senate. The legislation was referred to the Medical Affairs Committee for discussion Thursday.\\nOne bill, \\u201cEqual Protection for Unborn Babies Act,\\u201d would ban abortion completely unless the pregnant person\\u2019s life is at immediate risk. This means that anyone who performed an abortion could be charged with murder and face the death penalty.\\nThis would only happen if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortions.\\nA second bill would legally require doctors to inform women about an abortion reversal pill if they request abortion medication.\\n\\u201cAbortion is not something to take lightly. It is a fundamental piece of healthcare that is integral to our ability to control our lives and control our futures,\\u201d said Maya Ward, a development and communications associate for WREN. \\u201cBut anti-abortion lawmakers don\\u2019t seem to see it that way.\\u201d\\nThe rally drew people of all ages, some clutching handmade signs or sported pro-choice pins.\\nBob Whitaker, 75, said it was his first time attending an abortion rally.\\n\\u201cI believe in a women\\u2019s right to control their body,\\u201d Whitaker, a Columbia resident, said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a basic thing.\\u201d\\nFor others who had attended the event in past years, it evoked frustration because it felt like legislators weren\\u2019t listening to their concerns.\\n\\u201cWe are having these hearings every year on the State House grounds, right here where a statue of J. Marion Sims still stands,\\u201d said Kim Smith, co-founder of the Soda City Bail, an organization that bails out protesters. He was \\u201ca man that did racist, horrific, medical, gynecological experiments on enslaved black women. I bring this up because this to me is a symbol \\u2013 a symbol of how the ruling class of South Carolina seeks to remind us that they controlled my ancestors.\\u201d\\nWhile the future of the two bills is unknown, those in opposition hope that they will be overturned, keeping abortion legal and safe.\\nThe legislation to reverse abortions remains controversial because of medical risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says science does not support the abortion reversal pill. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a group of about 4,500 physicians, supports the measure.\\nSen. Mia McLeod, D-Richland, called out her Republican colleagues for promoting the legislation.\\n\\u201cBecause of their reckless disregard for women and girls across our state, you\\u2019re witnessing the worst of South Carolina,\\u201d McLeod said. \\u201cBut tomorrow is a new day and hopefully a new opportunity to stop playing God and to try to be more godly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been pro-choice since she was 15 years old.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll abortions would be banned in South Carolina under one of the Senate measures if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nRichland Sen.

AP PhotoMariam Zuhaib By Lisa Mascaro Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print WASHINGTON AP Upending the political debate, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.Grahams own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where MAGA Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.Americas got to make some decisions, Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.The South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Courts ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wades nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, were going nowhere, the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. We welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022. Reaction was swift, fierce and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Grahams legislation as an extreme example of the far-rights hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections. A nationwide abortion ban thats the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans want to force women to stay pregnant and deliver babies. To anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality, she said. Republicans are coming for your rights. The sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Courts landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.In a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Bidens lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races. Tuesdays announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Grahams proposed abortion ban.This bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.While President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy and to take unprecedented action to address climate change Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women, Jean-Pierre said. Grahams legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security and Bidens leadership. The Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the physical health of the mother. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.In particular, Grahams bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Courts ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Grahams legislation. I think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue, McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. So I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.The Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Grahams proposed nationwide abortion ban. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Graham and every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.Her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.In Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted A nationwide abortion ban is outrageous. Bennet pledged to defend a womans right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.His opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe ODea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part A Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumers hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification or conscience protections for religious hospitals.The races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.Pelosi called Grahams bill the clearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans intent to criminalize womens health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.Republican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences. I think that what its attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit, said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.Democrats are implying that all Republicans are for a ban without exceptions, and thats not true, Thune said. There are Republicans who are in favor of restrictions. And I think this is an attempt to at least put something out there that reflects the views of a lot of Republicans who are in favor of some restrictions.Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.\",\n          \"Donald Trump Speaks at Anti-Abortion March for Life RallySearchThe New C-SuiteJoin Cosmo UnlockedMy StoriesBeautyStyleLifestyleCelebrity NewsTV RecsMovie IdeasSex and RelationshipsSex After 60 A Digital IssueAstrologyOp-Eds and Personal EssaysPoliticsVideosSocialNewsletterAwardsAbout UsOther EditionsYour Privacy ChoicesPrivacy NoticeTerms Of UseSkip to ContentCelebsStyleBeautyLifestyleShoppingSubscribesign inOpinionPoliticsNews Analysis and OpinionTrump Spoke at the March for Life Rally Because Hes Scared of Losing the PresidencyTrump Spoke at the March for Life Rally Because Hes Scared of Losing the PresidencyHe crossed yet another gross line by appearing at the anti-abortion event.By Danielle CampoamorPublished Jan 24, 2020Save ArticleGetty Images Katie BuckleitnerOn Friday, President Donald Trump became the first president in U.S. history to ever speak in person at the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., where anti-choice advocates from around the country gather to protest abortion access.

Yet Trump neglected to acknowledge that the latest polls show that he trails every Democratic presidential nominee. Or that 77 percent of Americans actually support Roe v. Wadeand that people will continue to have abortions as long as they are able to get pregnant.Related StoryI Was Shamed by My Town for Getting an AbortionDanielle CampoamorDanielle Campoamor is an award-winning freelance writer covering mental health, reproductive justice, abortion access, maternal mental health, politics, and feminist issues.

Kathryn FreemanOctober 26, 2020 0100 PM Image WikiMedia Commons Update November 4 John DeBerry lost his state house seat to Democratic challenger Torrey Harris. Editors note This profile is the fourth in a CT series featuring Christian candidates who are running for legislative office in November. John DeBerry insists he is not the one who changed the Tennessee Democratic Party did. The 69-year-old politician and Church of Christ pastor has represented part of Memphis in the state House of Representatives since 1994. But this year, after 13 consecutive victories in Tennessees 90th District, DeBerry was removed from the ballot and prohibited from running for reelection as a Democrat. The Tennessee Democratic Party chair said DeBerry, who has voted according to his pro-life stance on abortion as well as in favor of school choice, demonstrated more loyalty to the Republican Party than to the Democratic Party. DeBerry insists his voters have always known where he stood on abortion and other social issues they sent him to Nashville again and again. Life has mattered my entire career, he told Christianity Today. My principles have not changed, and I am not changing my principles because I have a D behind my name. DeBerrys fight to stay in the race in Tennessee is an example of the precarious political position a dwindling number of pro-life Democratic politicians find themselves in. But DeBerry wants to remain in the party because, knowing his constituents, he believes hes not alone he says they too are Christian Democrats who stand for life. DeBerry has been a Democrat since 1968 when he voted in his first presidential election. His parents were Democrats, but his grandparents had been Eisenhower Republicans. It was Christian leaders taking a stand during the civil rights movementformer president Jimmy Carter, Martin Luther King Jr., and Ralph Abernathythat first spurred his own interest in politics. DeBerry, who is also a pastor at Coleman Avenue Church of Christ in Memphis, sees faith as the foundation for his career in public service and how he thinks through policy issues. He says you cannot fight for what is right based on political labels, but most rely on deeper convictions. Fashion changes, style changes, laws change, but principles which are built on the Word of God don't change, he said. DeBerry believes abortion violates both Gods laws and the American principle that all persons have constitutional rights not based on their place of residencythose rights extend to those residing in the womb too.The Tennessee politician, now running as an Independent, blames state party officials for taking a fundamentally undemocratic action to remove him from the ballot. He was already on the ballot when the party announced their decision, and a few of his colleagues spoke out on his behalf. House Minority Leader Karen Camper, a fellow Memphis Democrat, called the partys actions an attempt to nullify the choice of the people of the 90th District. DeBerrys conservative positions may have frustrated some of his pro-choice colleagues, but they respect his leadership. They voted for him to serve as minority leader pro tempore for the entire Democratic Caucus. Legislators also passed a bipartisan bill to amend the Tennessee election code, allowing incumbents disqualified by their partys executive committee, like DeBerry, to file a new petition under a different party identification past the standard filing deadline. DeBerry has chosen to run as an Independent. On November 3, he will face progressive Democrat Torrey Harris, who would be both the youngest and the first openly gay member of the Tennessee House. When asked why he did not simply run as a Republican, DeBerry stated, If I wanted to run as a Republican, I could have, but the majority of the district consists of Christian Democrats who share my pro-life views. According to Pew Research, young black Protestants have become less rigid in their opposition to abortion than previous generations, in part because they are more likely to view racial justice for those who are born as paramount. Yet DeBerrys assertion that the majority of the black Democrats in his district share his views is borne out by the fact that he has beat out liberal African Americans in primary races twice since his district was redrawn in 2012, including Harris, his current Democratic opponent. DeBerry is among state legislative candidates in ten states who received endorsements from Democrats for Life of America in 2020 the group endorsed just a single candidate for US CongressRep. Collin Peterson of Minnesotathis year. Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life, believes that you do not have to be a Republican to care about life, and as the party of the vulnerable and marginalized, the Democratic Party should take a stand for the unborn. Or at least not exclude politicians for doing so.Day has pushed for an inclusive, big tent party that doesnt rely on abortion rights as the foundation of its platform and wouldnt target pro-life Democrats like DeBerry. On a national level, US Rep. Dan Lipinski, a pro-life Democrat who served Illinoiss 3rd District for 15 years, lost his primary earlier this year to a pro-choice challenger who rallied more funding and support. DeBerry likewise believes that the issue of abortion isnt as starkly partisan as the party elites presume. According to a 2019 Gallup Poll on abortion, 24 percent of Democratic voters and 44 percent of Independent voters identify as pro-life. He says Democrats should not exclude that sizeable minoritymany of them, like him, are religious people whose faith leads them to oppose abortion. In evangelical denominations like DeBerrys Churches of Christ, the Southern Baptist Convention, and Assemblies of God, as well as the historically black Church of God in Christ denomination, most say abortion should be illegal in all or most circumstances, per a Pew Research Center survey. DeBerry cites one of his favorite verses, Matthew 2221, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods KJV, as part of his reasoning for his stance. For DeBerry, only God decides life and death. DeBerry is unsure whether he will caucus as a Democrat or Republican should the 90th District residents send him back to Nashville as an Independent. But he pledges, no matter what side hes on, to always place principles over party and personality.

AP PhotoMariam Zuhaib By Lisa Mascaro Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print WASHINGTON AP Upending the political debate, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.Grahams own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where MAGA Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.Americas got to make some decisions, Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.The South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Courts ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wades nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, were going nowhere, the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. We welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022. Reaction was swift, fierce and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Grahams legislation as an extreme example of the far-rights hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections. A nationwide abortion ban thats the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans want to force women to stay pregnant and deliver babies. To anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality, she said. Republicans are coming for your rights. The sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Courts landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.In a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Bidens lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races. Tuesdays announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Grahams proposed abortion ban.This bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.While President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy and to take unprecedented action to address climate change Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women, Jean-Pierre said. Grahams legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security and Bidens leadership. The Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the physical health of the mother. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.In particular, Grahams bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Courts ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Grahams legislation. I think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue, McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. So I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.The Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Grahams proposed nationwide abortion ban. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Graham and every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.Her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.In Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted A nationwide abortion ban is outrageous. Bennet pledged to defend a womans right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.His opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe ODea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part A Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumers hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification or conscience protections for religious hospitals.The races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.Pelosi called Grahams bill the clearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans intent to criminalize womens health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.Republican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences. I think that what its attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit, said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.Democrats are implying that all Republicans are for a ban without exceptions, and thats not true, Thune said. There are Republicans who are in favor of restrictions. And I think this is an attempt to at least put something out there that reflects the views of a lot of Republicans who are in favor of some restrictions.Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.\",\n          \"Donald Trump Speaks at Anti-Abortion March for Life RallySearchThe New C-SuiteJoin Cosmo UnlockedMy StoriesBeautyStyleLifestyleCelebrity NewsTV RecsMovie IdeasSex and RelationshipsSex After 60 A Digital IssueAstrologyOp-Eds and Personal EssaysPoliticsVideosSocialNewsletterAwardsAbout UsOther EditionsYour Privacy ChoicesPrivacy NoticeTerms Of UseSkip to ContentCelebsStyleBeautyLifestyleShoppingSubscribesign inOpinionPoliticsNews Analysis and OpinionTrump Spoke at the March for Life Rally Because Hes Scared of Losing the PresidencyTrump Spoke at the March for Life Rally Because Hes Scared of Losing the PresidencyHe crossed yet another gross line by appearing at the anti-abortion event.By Danielle CampoamorPublished Jan 24, 2020Save ArticleGetty Images Katie BuckleitnerOn Friday, President Donald Trump became the first president in U.S. history to ever speak in person at the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., where anti-choice advocates from around the country gather to protest abortion access. This years theme? Life Empowers Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman. So of course, a man accused of sexual assault, harassment, and rape by more than 20 women was the obvious choice to be this years headliner. He has denied these claims. The rally was founded in 1974 as a response to SCOTUS passing the landmark abortion access case Roe v. Wade the year prior and organizers plan to hold the event every year until its overturned.Related StoryIts Time to Freak Out About Your Repro RightsTrumps attendance is unprecedentedformer conservative presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush declined to address the anti-abortion rally in person. Per a New York Times report, these leaders saw attending as a step too far and instead showed their support in less visible ways. His appearance is also an unmistakable tell The now-impeached president, who is currently on trial in the U.S. Senate for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, spoke to marchers in order to appease his evangelical base and secure their support in the 2020 election. He used this moment as a stand-in for a campaign rally, telling the crowd, Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. Its worth noting that he announced his appearance after the anti-abortion PAC Susan B. Anthony List said it would donate 52 million to anti-abortion Republicans in the 2020 election cycle.View full post on XIts difficult to believe Trumps disdain for abortion is genuine and not simply a gross political play. In a 1999 interview, Trump described himself as very pro-choice, even though he claimed he personally didnt like abortion. I hate the concept of abortion, he said. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you stillI just believe in choice.Related StoryThis Anti-Abortion Bill Could Kill YouThese quotes were even used in attack ads by his Republican opponents during the 2016 primary. It was only when he was under fire did he change his tune. During a 2016 town hall with MSNBCs Chris Matthews, Trump said there should be some form of punishment for women who seek and obtain abortion services. As a presidential candidate, he promised to elect anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court, with the sole purpose of overturning Roe v. Wade. He spread dangerous lies about abortion later in pregnancy during the presidential debates, going so far as to say women have abortions days before giving birth and claim, You can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day. Spoiler alert You cannot.Its difficult to believe Trumps disdain for abortion is genuine and not simply a gross political play. Since taking office, Trump has doubled down on the promises he made to anti-abortion voters during the 2016 campaign. Upon his swearing in as the nations 45th president, he enacted the Global Gag Rule, which halts international funding to any health care organization that provides, discusses, or refers patients to abortion services. He appointed conservative judges Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, where they now stand to rule on an abortion case June Medical Services, LLC v. Gee, which could gut Roe v. Wade by allowing medically unnecessary barriers to abortion care to be enacted at the state level.Calling this president or the anti-choice movement pro-women is a joke, as their shared agendas continue to champion anti-abortion legislation that is known to harm women and pregnant people. But Trump employs it with the self-indulgent hope that it will win him another four years in office. During his speech on Friday, he told the crowd, Together, we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to Democratsand you know thisyouve seen whats happened. Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you can even say for centuries. Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth. This is an absolutely false claim.They are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice, and we will win because we know how to win, he said. Yet Trump neglected to acknowledge that the latest polls show that he trails every Democratic presidential nominee. Or that 77 percent of Americans actually support Roe v. Wadeand that people will continue to have abortions as long as they are able to get pregnant.Related StoryI Was Shamed by My Town for Getting an AbortionDanielle CampoamorDanielle Campoamor is an award-winning freelance writer covering mental health, reproductive justice, abortion access, maternal mental health, politics, and feminist issues.

The 69-year-old politician and Church of Christ pastor has represented part of Memphis in the state House of Representatives since 1994. But this year, after 13 consecutive victories in Tennessees 90th District, DeBerry was removed from the ballot and prohibited from running for reelection as a Democrat. The Tennessee Democratic Party chair said DeBerry, who has voted according to his pro-life stance on abortion as well as in favor of school choice, demonstrated more loyalty to the Republican Party than to the Democratic Party. DeBerry insists his voters have always known where he stood on abortion and other social issues they sent him to Nashville again and again. Life has mattered my entire career, he told Christianity Today. My principles have not changed, and I am not changing my principles because I have a D behind my name. DeBerrys fight to stay in the race in Tennessee is an example of the precarious political position a dwindling number of pro-life Democratic politicians find themselves in. But DeBerry wants to remain in the party because, knowing his constituents, he believes hes not alone he says they too are Christian Democrats who stand for life. DeBerry has been a Democrat since 1968 when he voted in his first presidential election. His parents were Democrats, but his grandparents had been Eisenhower Republicans. It was Christian leaders taking a stand during the civil rights movementformer president Jimmy Carter, Martin Luther King Jr., and Ralph Abernathythat first spurred his own interest in politics. DeBerry, who is also a pastor at Coleman Avenue Church of Christ in Memphis, sees faith as the foundation for his career in public service and how he thinks through policy issues. He says you cannot fight for what is right based on political labels, but most rely on deeper convictions. Fashion changes, style changes, laws change, but principles which are built on the Word of God don't change, he said. DeBerry believes abortion violates both Gods laws and the American principle that all persons have constitutional rights not based on their place of residencythose rights extend to those residing in the womb too.The Tennessee politician, now running as an Independent, blames state party officials for taking a fundamentally undemocratic action to remove him from the ballot. He was already on the ballot when the party announced their decision, and a few of his colleagues spoke out on his behalf. House Minority Leader Karen Camper, a fellow Memphis Democrat, called the partys actions an attempt to nullify the choice of the people of the 90th District. DeBerrys conservative positions may have frustrated some of his pro-choice colleagues, but they respect his leadership. They voted for him to serve as minority leader pro tempore for the entire Democratic Caucus. Legislators also passed a bipartisan bill to amend the Tennessee election code, allowing incumbents disqualified by their partys executive committee, like DeBerry, to file a new petition under a different party identification past the standard filing deadline. DeBerry has chosen to run as an Independent. On November 3, he will face progressive Democrat Torrey Harris, who would be both the youngest and the first openly gay member of the Tennessee House. When asked why he did not simply run as a Republican, DeBerry stated, If I wanted to run as a Republican, I could have, but the majority of the district consists of Christian Democrats who share my pro-life views. According to Pew Research, young black Protestants have become less rigid in their opposition to abortion than previous generations, in part because they are more likely to view racial justice for those who are born as paramount. Yet DeBerrys assertion that the majority of the black Democrats in his district share his views is borne out by the fact that he has beat out liberal African Americans in primary races twice since his district was redrawn in 2012, including Harris, his current Democratic opponent. DeBerry is among state legislative candidates in ten states who received endorsements from Democrats for Life of America in 2020 the group endorsed just a single candidate for US CongressRep. Collin Peterson of Minnesotathis year. Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life, believes that you do not have to be a Republican to care about life, and as the party of the vulnerable and marginalized, the Democratic Party should take a stand for the unborn. Or at least not exclude politicians for doing so.Day has pushed for an inclusive, big tent party that doesnt rely on abortion rights as the foundation of its platform and wouldnt target pro-life Democrats like DeBerry. On a national level, US Rep. Dan Lipinski, a pro-life Democrat who served Illinoiss 3rd District for 15 years, lost his primary earlier this year to a pro-choice challenger who rallied more funding and support. DeBerry likewise believes that the issue of abortion isnt as starkly partisan as the party elites presume. According to a 2019 Gallup Poll on abortion, 24 percent of Democratic voters and 44 percent of Independent voters identify as pro-life. He says Democrats should not exclude that sizeable minoritymany of them, like him, are religious people whose faith leads them to oppose abortion. In evangelical denominations like DeBerrys Churches of Christ, the Southern Baptist Convention, and Assemblies of God, as well as the historically black Church of God in Christ denomination, most say abortion should be illegal in all or most circumstances, per a Pew Research Center survey. DeBerry cites one of his favorite verses, Matthew 2221, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods KJV, as part of his reasoning for his stance. For DeBerry, only God decides life and death. DeBerry is unsure whether he will caucus as a Democrat or Republican should the 90th District residents send him back to Nashville as an Independent. But he pledges, no matter what side hes on, to always place principles over party and personality.
