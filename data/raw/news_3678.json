Kailee remembers that when she and Cade met, it was \u201ca connection at first sight.\u201d  \n    \n\n            A month after college graduation, Kailee and Cade married in Marble Falls, Texas. They\u2019re both proud to be native Texans: Kailee\u2019s family has lived there for generations, and Cade\u2019s ancestors are among Texas\u2019 \u201cOld Three Hundred,\u201d the original families that joined Stephen F. Austin to settle the area in the 1800s.\n    \n\n            At the time, the DeSpains were both passionately anti-abortion.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Senator Susan Glick, author of Senate Bill 1, debates Senator Greg Taylor shortly before the vote to accept Senate Bill 1, which was passed by the House earlier in the day, making the Indiana legislature the first in the nation to restrict abortions, in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. August 5, 2022.

Michelle Lujan Grisham, center, announced an executive order aimed at ensuring safe harbor to people seeking abortions or providing abortions at health care facilities within the state, at a news conference in Santa Fe, N.M., on Monday, June 27, 2022. Lujan Grisham has signed a new executive order that pledges $10 million to build a clinic that would provide abortions and other pregnancy care. She said Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, that \"the goal here is build it and they will come.\" She said New Mexico already has seen an influx of patients following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn Roe vs. Wade as abortions have ceased in other states.

Full of hope, they posted ultrasound pictures and a gender reveal video of a cannon shooting out blue confetti. They named their baby boy Finley.  \n    \n\n            Then, about three months later, they learned that Finley had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. Carrying him to term put Kailee at high risk for severe pregnancy complications, including blood clots, preeclampsia and cancer.  \n    \n\n            Even so, they could not get an abortion in Texas and fled to New Mexico.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ve never felt more betrayed by a place I was once so proud to be from,\u201d Kailee said through tears.  \n    \n\n            \u201cHow could you be so cruel as to pass a law that you know will hurt women and that you know will cause babies to be born in pain?\u201d she added. \u201cHow is that humane? How is that saving anybody?\u201d  \n    \n\n            CNN emailed Texas lawmakers who authored or sponsored the state\u2019s anti-abortion laws. None of them responded to CNN\u2019s questions. \n    \n\n    A grim prognosis for their baby  \n\n\n            When Kailee and Cade found out she was pregnant, they desperately hoped for a \u201csticky baby\u201d \u2013 a pregnancy that would stick \u2013 after her three miscarriages.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tibor Rubin Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach on Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

The doctors said that either Finley would die before birth, or if he did make it to term, he would die a few minutes or at most an hour after birth. \n    \n\n            One of their doctors told them, \u201cSome of these things could be fixed, but all of these things together \u2013 this cannot be fixed,\u201d Kailee remembers.  \n    \n\n            She says the doctor told them that before Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban went into effect in September of last year, she would have advised abortion as \u201cthe safest course for you [and] the most humane course of action for him.\u201d  \n    \n\n            But the doctor said she could not offer them an abortion in Texas. She said the only option to get one was to travel out of state.\n    \n\n    Risk to Kailee\u2019s life  \n\n\n            Staying pregnant with Finley could have put Kailee\u2019s life in danger.  \n    \n\n            She has two blood clotting disorders, which put her at a higher risk for having dangerous blood clots during pregnancy. Plus, mothers of babies with triploidy are more likely to get preeclampsia, a potentially deadly pregnancy disorder. Also, there was an increased risk for a placental abnormality associated with cancer.  \n    \n\n            Kailee said she considered risking her own life to carry Finley to term.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI [wanted] to say goodbye,\u201d she said. \u201cI [wanted] a chance to hold him.\u201d  \n    \n\n            But then she thought about how Finley would suffer as he struggled to breathe.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers, from left, Richard Houskamp, Anthony Daunt and Mary Ellen Gurewitz listen to attorneys Olivia Flower and Steve Liedel during a hearing, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, in Lansing, Michigan .\n\nCarlos Osorio/Associated Press\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMichigan Supreme Court orders abortion rights initiative to appear on November ballot\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cHe\u2019s going to suffocate, he\u2019s going to die, and I\u2019m going to watch him do it,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n            For Cade, there was only one option: It made no sense to him to risk his wife\u2019s life to have a baby who was certain to die quickly.  \n    \n\n            Cade told Kailee, \u201d \u2018I will support you whatever decision that you make, but I really don\u2019t want to lose both of you, \u2019 \u201d Kailee remembers.  \n    \n\n            The couple opted for abortion, driving 10 hours to a clinic in New Mexico. The procedure and travel cost $3,500. They hoped their insurance would cover the procedure, but Texas law strictly limits abortion coverage, and the clinic told them their insurance company declined to pay.  \n    \n\n            The DeSpains didn\u2019t have enough money \u2013 Kailee said she was docked pay at work because she\u2019d had too many sick days \u2013 so Cade asked a relative he describes as \u201cthe epitome of the Trump fanboy\u201d to give them the $3,500. The relative relented when Cade said that without the abortion, he could end up a widower at age 30.  \n    \n\n            Cade said he didn\u2019t like asking for the money, but \u201cmy job as a husband is to protect and love my wife. If I\u2019m not fighting to keep her here, then I failed.\u201d   \n    \n\n            Kailee had the abortion in March, when she was 19 weeks pregnant.  \n    \n\n    \u2018I\u2019m still so angry and hurt\u2019 \n\n\n            While legislators did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions about Kailee\u2019s case, the president of Texas Right to Life did.  \n    \n\n            John Seago said that \u201cTexas law is very clear about what circumstances that an abortion could be performed\u201d and that \u201cwhat happened to [Kailee] and the response of her physicians was absolutely a misrepresentation of the law. And this should never have happened.\u201d  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarlena Stell\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nIn some states, doctors weigh 'ruinous' litigation against proper care for women who have miscarriages \n\n\n\n\n            But Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center, said Texas\u2019 abortion laws \u2013 the one that took effect last year and another one that went into effect last month \u2013 are not at all clear and are \u201cdesigned to be purposely vague and broad.\u201d  \n    \n\n            The more recent law, for example, says an abortion can be performed if the mother \u201chas a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cThey don\u2019t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided,\u201d Keith said.  \n    \n\n            Kailee said her doctors told her they could give her an abortion only if she were at imminent risk of dying \u2013 essentially, if she were \u201d \u2018dying on the table.\u2019 \u201d  \n    \n\n            If a physician is found in violation of the law, the punishments can be severe: heavy fines, loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.  \n    \n\n            Plus, citizens can file lawsuits against physicians they think have performed an illegal abortion, and if they win, they can get a $10,000 reward. If the citizen is wrong and the doctor wins the lawsuit, the doctor still has to pay their own legal fees, as\u202fTexas law\u202fspecifically forbids doctors from recouping fees from plaintiffs. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalee Clemons, right, speaks to a potential patient while working with Brittany Bester in the call center at Planned Parenthood in Fairview Heights, Ill., Thursday, May 5, 2022. Missouri is among several states that have enacted laws that would effectively ban abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood opened the new clinic in Illinois\u2014located less than 20 miles from the last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri\u2014to provide access not only to women in the state, but also those women living in states with restrictions to abortion.

Wade era\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cFacing the potential to become a felon and face life in prison for simply trying to take care of patients has been horrifying, and I\u2019d be lying if I said that I haven\u2019t considered leaving the state,\u201d said Dr. Leah Tatum, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who practices in Austin, Texas, and has treated patients in similar situations to Kailee\u2019s since the Texas anti-abortion laws passed.  \n    \n\n            The Texas law that went into effect last year barred most abortions at the onset of fetal cardiac activity, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant. It was one of the earliest and most restrictive abortion laws. Laws that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the US Supreme Court\u202fended a constitutional right to abortion\u202fon June 24. \n    \n\n            Kailee says that the last time she saw her obstetrician, she advised her not to get pregnant in Texas.  \n    \n\n            \u201cShe said \u2018this is not safe,\u2019 \u201d Kailee remembers. \u201d She said, \u2018I need you to look at me. I need you to understand that if you get pregnant in Texas and that if you have complications, that I cannot intervene until I can prove that you\u2019re going to die.\u2019 \u201d  \n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n  \n\n\n\n\n            The DeSpains say they are thinking about leaving Texas, but it would be difficult to leave their work and their families.\n    \n\n            Kailee said they\u2019re sharing their story in hopes of increasing awareness so \u201cthat stories like mine can change enough voters\u2019 perspectives.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,\u201d she wrote on Facebook the day after the abortion. \u201cFinley and I were simply collateral damage in a much bigger picture. It\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around the thought process of lawmakers that would rather a full-term baby suffocate to death than allow a mother to make a decision that spares her child that
