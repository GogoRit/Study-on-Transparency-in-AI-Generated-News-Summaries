They discovered that in 35 percent of U.S. counties, Catholic hospitals have a high or dominant market share, meaning they make up more than 20 percent of patient discharges. Combined, these counties serve an estimated 39 percent of U.S. women of reproductive age.\nThe findings have important implications for access to reproductive health care in these communities. Patients in Catholic hospitals have had their care dangerously delayed while suffering miscarriages, been pressured into burying their miscarried fetuses and had their gender-affirming surgeries canceled on religious grounds. But many patients have no choice but to go to one of these hospitals, the study shows. In 101 counties, Catholic hospitals had a market share of more than 70 percent. In seven U.S. counties, that share was more than 90 percent, data provided by the researchers to Truthout showed. \n\u201cIf you thought about a particular type of phone having 80 percent of the market, that would be shocking to people, right?\u201d said Marian Jarlenski, an author of the report and assistant professor at University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \u201cWe thought it was interesting and significant just how many counties fell into that range of more than 20 percent of the market, of all the hospital discharges, being attributable to Catholic hospitals,\u201d Jarlenski added.\nWhile legal restrictions on reproductive health care have proliferated in Republican-led states in the South, the study underscores how Catholic hospitals tend to dominate areas of the country that are seen as more progressive on reproductive health access, including the Pacific Northwest. \n\nRelated Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n|\nEnvironment & Health\n\n\nReligious Corporations Are Interfering in Doctor-Patient Relationships\n\n\nFaith-based health facilities are increasingly imposing their biases on the medical decision-making process.\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\nAmy Littlefield\n\n, \n\n Truthout\n\n\nOctober 24, 2019\n\n\n\n\nTruthout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Upper Midwest, the Pacific Northwest and to a lesser extent, the Eastern megalopolis from New York to Boston, are some of the areas with more restricted access,\u201d said Coleman Drake, another study author who is also an assistant professor at University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see this variation occurring in places that one normally doesn\u2019t associate with restricted access.\u201d\nWhether a patient is forced to seek care in a Catholic hospital depends not only on where they live, but on their insurance network. A study last year in Contraception found that in the Chicago area, Medicaid-managed care plans were disproportionately funneling women of color into Catholic facilities.\nPatients in Catholic hospitals have had their care dangerously delayed while suffering miscarriages, been pressured into burying their miscarried fetuses and had their gender-affirming surgeries canceled on religious grounds.\nWhile the most recent study did not look at Medicaid plans, the researchers did look at plans sold in Obamacare marketplaces. Nationwide, the median marketplace plans in most counties had a lower share of Catholic hospitals than the counties overall. But in 440 counties, patients can inadvertently select a health insurance network that has a Catholic hospital market share of more than 80 percent. That is particularly concerning because of how hard it is to determine ahead of time whether a plan is dominated by Catholic options.\nThere are no regulations requiring marketplace health insurance plans to disclose how facilities in their networks restrict reproductive health care. Less than a third of Catholic hospital websites nationwide mention how the facility\u2019s religious affiliation impacts care, and more than a third of women who rely on Catholic hospitals for care don\u2019t realize the facility is Catholic, prior research has found.\n\u201cI worry about the ability of people to make informed choices here,\u201d Drake told Truthout.\nFinally, the researchers examined the demographics of residents in counties where Catholic hospitals are dominant. They found that overall, populations in counties with high or dominant Catholic hospital market shares were more likely to be white, Latino, more educated, and have higher annual median incomes than their counterparts in other counties. They were also slightly more likely to be Catholic. But the differences were small.\nA prior study by researchers at Columbia Law School\u2019s Law, Rights, and Religion Project found that women of color were more likely to give birth in Catholic hospitals. That suggests that Black women may be directed to Catholic hospitals based on factors other than where they live. \n\u201cIf we see that Black women are more likely to deliver in Catholic facilities, it would suggest that their health plans or their obstetric providers are directing them to Catholic institutions,\u201d Jarlenski said.\nThe researchers said they hoped their study would draw attention to a reproductive health care access issue that has received relatively little scrutiny compared to legal restrictions on abortion. \n\u201cThe main thing we\u2019re trying to do here is just shed light on this issue and provide some more transparency,\u201d Jarlenski said. \u201cI hope to provide health care systems and policymakers the impetus to think about aligning the services with the needs of the patient.\u201d \n\nWe\u2019re not going to stand for it. Are you?\nYou don\u2019t bury your head in the sand. You know as well as we do what we\u2019re facing as a country, as a people, and as a global community. Here at Truthout, we\u2019re gearing up to meet these threats head on, but we need your support to do it: We must raise $50,000 to ensure we can keep publishing independent journalism that doesn\u2019t shy away from difficult \u2014 and often dangerous \u2014 topics.\n\nWe can do this vital work because unlike most media, our journalism is free from government or corporate influence and censorship.
