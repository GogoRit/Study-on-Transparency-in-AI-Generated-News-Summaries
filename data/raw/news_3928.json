There have been over 3300 cases and 2200 deaths in this outbreak, 56% of which have been among women and girls.  Learning from the West African EVD outbreak tells us that such epidemics have a negative impact across the health system, and that sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services are generally disrupted leading to negative outcomes for women, men, girls and boys.  To document the impacts of this outbreak on SRH services, the IRC undertook a programme assessment from October \u2013 December 2019, with the aim of developing concrete recommendations for improving SRH service provision and access during the current outbreak and for future outbreaks.\nMethods: This assessment was conducted in Goma, Butembo, Katwa, Kalunguta and Beni health zones of North-Kivu, DRC.  A total of 120 individuals were interviewed, 85 women and 35 men, either in focus groups, individual interviews or through targeted questions by email.  The participants were selected purposively to ensure a mix of women, pregnant women and men from the community, health workers, EVD response workers, Tradi-practiciens and representatives from the Ministry of Health and Non-Governmental Organisations.  A total of six routine health facilities were visited, of which three were assessed for their SRH preparedness, and one Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) was visited. Routine SRH service indicators from the health information management system were mapped against EVD case counts in the four health zones where the qualitative data collection took place.\nFindings: The EVD outbreak has had an impact on the provision of, and access to, SRH services in the affected health zones across all priority activities of the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Reproductive Health in Crises:\n\nCoordination of the MISP\n\n\nPrevention of Sexual Violence and Care of Survivors\n\n\nReduce transmission of HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\n\nPrevent excess maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality\n\n\nPrevention of unintended pregnancy\n\n\nPlan for comprehensive SRH services.\n\n\nAdditional priority activity \u2013 Safe Abortion Care (SAC).\n\nRecommendations (more specifics found in the assessment):\n\nSexual and reproductive health needs and services are to be embedded in the EVD response from the outset.\n\n\nReduce delays at every stage of the patient journey, particularly for women experiencing obstetric complications, including complications from abortion.\n\n\nSupport individuals and communities to mitigate SRH risks posed during and after EVD epidemic:\n\n\nFormulate SRH guidelines for the EVD context involving experts in all relevant fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nSource\n\nInternational Rescue Committee\n\nDisaster\n\nDR Congo: Ebola Outbreak - Aug 2018\n\nFormat\n\nAnalysis\n\nThemes\n\nHealthHIV/Aids\n\nDisaster type\n\nEpidemic\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nDR Congo\n+ 1 more\n\nDRC Ebola outbreaks: Crisis update - 9 June 2020\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nMSF\n\nPosted\n\n9 Jun 2020\n\nOriginally published\n\n9 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDR Congo\n+ 1 more\n\nDRC Ebola outbreaks: Crisis update - 3 June 2020\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nMSF\n\nPosted\n\n3 Jun 2020\n\nOriginally published\n\n3 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDR Congo\n\nCaritas Congo ASBL : Rapport d'activit\u00e9s 2019\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Other          \nSource\n\nCaritas\n\nPosted\n\n6 Mar 2020\n\nOriginally published\n\n31 Dec 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDR Congo\n+ 1 more\n\nRD Congo - Provinces du Nord-Kivu et de l'Ituri : Plan Op\u00e9rationnel d'Urgence (Janvier - Juin 2019)\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Appeal          \nSource\n\nOCHA\n\nPosted\n\n10 Apr 2019\n\nOriginally published\n\n10 Apr 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
