With about 2.2 million citizens, this is nearly 3 percent of Namibia's population.\nThe campaign drew waves of attacks against feminist activists, primarily from Christian and conservative communities who believe that women should abstain from sex and serve jail time for abortion. But as a result of the petition, parliament has agreed to discuss Nambia's outdated laws governing abortion.\nThe petition\u2019s enormous success stems from a long fight, explains Merja Wolf, a feminist and editor-in-chief of the Informant\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m constantly under attack, every day is a fight on Twitter,\u201d said Wolf, who also told Global Voices that feminist activists face online harassment on a daily basis.\nTwitter may allow users to block or report perpetrators of online harassment, but these tools are not always sufficient to mitigate harm, and studies have shown that women are more likely to disproportionately suffer from online harassment on Twitter than men.\nFor Wolf, a personal line was crossed when a troll went after her kids, causing her to want to step away from Twitter. \u201cBut trolls and misogynists have to realize one thing,\u201d she continues, \u201cIt\u2019s not just me they are facing. If I leave Twitter, there\u2019s still loads of others of us using it. We came in large numbers,\u201d Wolf said.\nShe decided to stay on Twitter, despite the daily harassment she and other feminists must endure in their fight to legalize abortion in Namibia. However, Wolf recently temporarily deactivated her account for personal reasons unrelated to politics.\nUntil now, abortion has been regulated under the Abortion and Sterilization Act of South Africa from 1975. It is only legal under the following conditions: When the pregnancy endangers the woman\u2019s life or her physical or mental health; when the child might suffer from disability; when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest; or when a woman is a person with a disability or a mental health condition that prevents comprehension of what pregnancy entails.\nA war of tweets\nChristian, conservative communities in Nambia strongly opposed the petition, arguing instead to keep Nambia\u2019s abortion laws firmly in place. Members of these communities launched a petition to reject the legalization of abortion in Namibia, as well.\nNetizen Bashupi promoted the petition against legalizing abortion in Namibia:\n\nnamibia government : Pro-Life Namibia \u201cRejecting the Legalisation of Abortion in Namibia\u201d https://t.co/EdGbI5iFGD via @UKChange\nPlease help save the life of the unborn from evil spirits forcing government to legalize abortion. Sign up and save a life.\n\u2014 Bashupi B Maloboka (@bbmaloboka2) July 30, 2020\nThe Namibian,\u00a0Namibia's biggest daily newspaper, featured several tweets highlighting the anti-abortion movement in Nambia, and their Twitter account\u00a0reflects some of the more conservative values regarding abortion held by members Namibian society:\n\n\u2018NO TO ABORTION\u2019 \u2026 Pro-lifers today protested in Windhoek\u2019s city centre against calls to legalise abortion in the country. The group chanted \u201cWe choose life\u201d as they held up posters stating that abortion \u201ckills children\u201d, and deeming the act \u201cmurder\u201d.\nVideo: Arlana Shikongo pic.twitter.com/J6tmZrTxBr\n\u2014 The Namibian (@TheNamibian) July 2, 2020\nIn response, Abigail Buitumelo posted the petition to legalize abortion:\n\nhttps://t.co/VKjyn0YSg4\n\u2014 Abigail Buitumelo (@virovirina) July 2, 2020\nBut Twitter use D'mbukushu fired back:\n\nArrest whoever does abortion!!!!\n\u2014 D'mbukushu (@donfranklin_na) July 2, 2020\nAnd Yvonne tweeted prayers for those who even bring up the idea of abortion:\n\nAlmighty hear our prayers don't allow this to succeed my Lord,please forgive those whom bring up this ideas to your Nation in Jesus name,NO to Abortion NO#NoToAbortionInNamibia\n\u2014 Yvonne????? (@YvonneJosef2) July 2, 2020\nNetizen \u201cRefuse2sink95\u2033 made an ironic comment about those who want to legalize abortion:\n\nYou legalize ABORTION and keep celebrating your BIRTHDAY\u2026 ?\n\u2014 Refuse2sink95 \u264b (@An_thropologist) July 2, 2020\nAnd netizen Alie Epata had an alternative suggestion to abortion:\n\nStay away from sex to avoid creating an unwanted life. Use contraceptives if you can\u2019t stay away. Don\u2019t create a life just to kill it because you can.\n\u2014 Alie Epata ?? (@gracious24_8) July 2, 2020\nFor Wolf, however, the abortion debate is linked to feminism, and feminism means one thing: \u201cMaking society more equal and thereby better for both men AND women,\u201d she told Global Voices. Unfortunately, this concept is highly contested in Namibian society where gender-based violence remains one of the most prevalent issues.\nWolf attributes the power of social media to the petition\u2019s success on social media:\n\nWe are becoming more and more aware of feminism as a society and our numbers are growing on social media such as Twitter. It has the advantage over Facebook because, when someone retweets my statements, it allows messages to spread a lot faster through different audience groups.\n\nDigital rights and gender inequality in Namibia\nExpressing feminist ideas online is an act of free speech that should be protected within the realm of digital rights, primarily focusing on access to information, privacy and freedom of expression.\nBut online gender-based harassment and violence create an unsafe environment for women activists and feminists to freely express their ideas, organize and campaign.\nIn Namibia, there is no law criminalizing cyber violence or harassment.\nA published review of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) by the Namibian Media Trust (NMT) states that Namibia does not have \u201cpersonal data protection policies let alone enacted statutes.\u201d\nIn the review, NMT advocates for a rights-based approach to internet regulation, relevant to both freedom of expression as well as the right to access information. Principles provided for in the African Internet Rights Declaration by the African Union include gender equality and the protection of marginalized groups or groups at risk, of which Namibia falls short, according to the NMT.\nAdditionally, many women live without internet access.\nThe Internet Society Chapter Namibia launched the Women Rights Online Report 2020 in late July, noting that only 47 percent of Namibian women have access to the internet.\nAccording to the report, there were no national policies put into place to acknowledge ICT regulations as an opportunity to fight against gender inequality.\nFurther, the report claims 1 gigabyte of data in Namibia costs over 8% of average monthly income and 70 percent of Namibian schools have no access to the internet. This shows that access to information on the internet is still a major problem in Namibia and a challenge in terms of moving feminist activism into the digital sphere.\nMaking the web a safer space for women in Namibia\nImproving access is the first step, but online safety must be guaranteed for women to close the online gender gap, too.\nThe Women Rights Online Report 2020 gives Namibia a low 2/10 score in terms of online safety for women, justified by the lack of a data protection law which means that both sexualized hate speech, as well as non-consensual image-sharing, can go without legal consequences.\nWhile social media has opened up new possibilities for feminism, especially in the Namibian context, women need to know that local authorities will intervene to protect their safety and security.\nOverall, the successful petition for the legalization of abortion has shown the power and impact of online activism.\n\u201cIf anyone wants to dismiss the power of social media \u2014\u00a0don\u2019t,\u201d Wolf said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Categories\n\nCountries\n\nNamibia\n\n\n\nRegions\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAdvocacyHarassmentHuman RightsLawProtestWomen-Gender\n\n\n\nSpecial topics\n\nUPROAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten byLisa Ossenbrink\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSupport our work\nGlobal Voices stands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.\nPlease consider making a donation to help us continue this work.\nDonate now\n\n\nRecent Namibia Stories\n\nNamibian activists maximize social media to expose unlawful jurisdiction and homophobic legislatureActivism\u00a0 13 December 2021Freedom of expression in a downward spiral in Southern Africa, says new studyMalawi\u00a0 17 February 2021Namibia's COVID-19 internet rollout impresses, but excludes and widens controlAccess\u00a0 12 January 2021More \u00bb \n \n\n\n\n\n\nCancel this reply\n\n\t\t\tStart the conversation\t\t\n\nAuthors, please  log in \u00bb\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSubscribe to comments on this post via email\n\n\nGuidelines\n\nAll comments are reviewed by a moderator.
