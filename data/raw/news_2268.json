She succeeds longtime director, Carol Clews. (George P. Matysek/CR Staff)New head of pro-life outreach takes helm as wall separates two sides of moral divide\n February 6, 2020By George P. Matysek Jr. \n\nFiled Under: #IamCatholic, Feature, Local News, News, Respect Life\n\n\nThe Center for Pregnancy Concerns plans to open a new location this summer adjacent to a\u00a0 Planned Parenthood in downtown Baltimore.\u00a0 The building is undergoing extensive rehabilitation. (Kevin J. Parks/CR Staff)\nESSEX \u2013 One of America\u2019s biggest cultural and moral divides is about to be embodied in a shared wall of two Baltimore buildings with very different missions.\nOn one side, a long-established Planned Parenthood center will continue offering abortion services.\nOn the other, a pro-life pregnancy resource center \u2013 a newcomer to a blighted section of Howard Street tentatively slated to open in July \u2013 will offer women the ongoing support they need to bring their unborn children to term.\nOperated by the Center for Pregnancy Concerns (CPC), a nonprofit Christian outreach organization based in Essex, the new Howard Street center will provide free sonograms, pregnancy testing and counseling. It will also offer material assistance, job training, housing and other aid through an extensive referral network.\nGina Ruppert, the CPC\u2019s newly appointed executive director who succeeded Carol Clews in January, noted that the downtown center will be the CPC\u2019s fifth location, including one at St. Ann in East Baltimore and another at St. Rita in Dundalk.\nRuppert, a parishioner of Sacred Heart in Glyndon, sees the newest center\u2019s close proximity to an abortion provider as an unparalleled opportunity to reach out to women who may believe abortion is their only choice.\n\u201cWe hope that women will consider coming in our door for information on all their options and resources that are available to them before making any decisions,\u201d said Ruppert, a mother of six who holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work from Frostburg State University.\n\u201cWe hope they\u2019ll come in and have a sonogram at no cost to them and hear about how we are ready and able to walk with them and help them with our resources,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also want women to know that if they\u2019ve had an abortion and are suffering, that we would love for them to come in and talk to us because we have resources for them, too.\u201d\nA new pro-life pregnancy center on Howard Street in downtown Baltimore will include an exam room for free sonograms. (Courtesy Center for Pregnancy Concerns)\nThe Archdiocese of Baltimore provided the CPC a grant from the Annual Appeal for Catholic Ministries to help fund the sonography services at the Howard Street location, Ruppert said. Archbishop William E. Lori is expected to bless and dedicate the new building when it opens this summer.\nSonograms are important for showing women \u201cthe truth\u201d of how far along they are in the pregnancy, Ruppert said, and in helping them process what their next steps might be.\n\u201cIt can make a great impact on a woman to choose life,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also know that for some women, it can be a painful experience if they\u2019ve experienced abortion in the past and didn\u2019t have a sonogram to actually see that living baby. And we help them work through that.\u201d\nFor those who are open to it, the CPC offers spiritual counseling and Bible studies in English and Spanish, Ruppert said.\nRuppert comes to the CPC from Catholic Charities, where she worked as the spiritual development coordinator for St. Vincent\u2019s Villa in Timonium. The Villa provides residential treatment for children, ages 5-14, who have not responded to community-based interventions and who need individualized treatment and therapy, Ruppert said.\nShe first became involved with the CPC more than 15 years ago through her parish\u2019s respect life group, organizing a fundraising \u201cbaby bottle campaign\u201d at Sacred Heart School that benefited the CPC.\nRuppert said the CPC serves mothers of children in the womb through pre-school, women facing unplanned pregnancies and families facing hardships in providing for their babies.\nGina Ruppert, executive director of the Pregnancy for Center Concerns, displays donated children\u2019s clothing that is provided to women in need at the center\u2019s Essex location. (George P. Matysek Jr./CR Staff)\nLast year, the CPC served 1,084 clients. Ruppert expects those numbers to jump significantly once the Howard Street location is operational.\nThe CPC, which also offers a 24-hour-a-day help line, bought the building at 328 N. Howard St. at auction Jan. 19, 2017, for $94,500. Funds for the purchase were donated by two anonymous benefactors, including the man who alerted the CPC about the building\u2019s availability after noticing it was for sale when he was praying outside the Planned Parenthood where abortions are performed.\nThe CPC conducted a capital campaign that was heavily promoted by the late Deacon Richard \u201cMonti\u201d Montalto, allowing extensive renovations of the dilapidated, 100-year-old former electronics and jewelry store to begin. The project stalled for more than a year, however, because of a lack of resources. An anonymous donor made a substantial contribution that allowed work to resume late last year.\nThe total cost of rehabilitating the building is expected to approach $1 million, according to Clews.\n\u201cPray that our building goes smoothly and we can open on time and we\u2019ll shine God\u2019s light to each person we meet,\u201d Ruppert said.\nClick play below to listen to a radio interview with Gina Ruppert on \u201cCatholic Baltimore.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit www.cpcforhelp.org\nAlso see:\nPlanned pro-life pregnancy center in downtown Baltimore gets boost\nPro-life pregnancy center to open next to Planned Parenthood\nEmail George Matysek at gmatysek@CatholicReview.org\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nGeorge P.
