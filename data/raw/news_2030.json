Justices are weighing the legal arguments\nPolitics\n\n\n                                Sep 27, 2023 7:25 PM EDT\n            \n\n\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio Supreme Court justices vigorously questioned the state\u2019s lawyer Wednesday about\u00a0a legal strategy\u00a0that Ohio is attempting in hopes of reviving its law\u00a0banning on abortions\u00a0except in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\nBefore Ohio Solicitor General Benjamin Flowers even finished the first sentence of his argument, justices began peppering him with technical questions that suggested they may be reticent to step in and lift\u00a0a county judge\u2019s order\u00a0that has been blocking the law since last October. The state is also challenging whether Preterm Cleveland and other Ohio clinics have the necessary legal standing to sue.\nFlowers argued that the state has the right to appeal Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins\u2019 order if it can show it\u2019s suffering \u201cirreparable harm\u201d while the law is on hold. Flowers said each abortion that takes place that would have been prevented under\u00a0Ohio\u2019s 2019 ban\u00a0constitutes such harm.\nThe law, signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019, prohibits most abortions\u00a0once cardiac activity can be detected,\u00a0which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\n\u201cThe problem with the First District\u2019s ruling (denying Ohio\u2019s request to appeal Jenkins\u2019 order) is that, if it\u2019s right, then all 88 (county) common pleas courts can unilaterally, indefinitely suspend operation of state law for as long as it takes to conduct discovery, to hold the trial and issue an injunction,\u201d Flowers told the court.\nREAD MORE: Planned Parenthood resumes offering abortions in Wisconsin after more than a year\nThe appellate court ruled Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost\u2019s appeal premature, as the order was merely an interim step that paused enforcement of the law while the lawsuit is carried out.\nPreterm\u2019s attorney, B. Jessie Hill, argued that the state\u2019s decision to appeal the stay at the Ohio Supreme Court defies \u201clong-standing, well-established rules\u201d on such actions.\nOn the question of legal standing, Hill told the court that the clinics, and their physicians, were the proper parties to bring such a lawsuit \u2014 not individual pregnant women who are seeking \u201ctime-sensitive health care\u201d.\n\u201cThey are not in a position to hire an attorney, bring a lawsuit, seek an injunction, and then, even if they were to bring it, they\u2019re not going to remain pregnant for very long,\u201d she said.\nFlowers challenged the notion, pointing out that the most celebrated abortion lawsuit in U.S. history, Roe v. Wade, was brought in the name of an individual patient.\nBut when he suggested that abortion clinics also could not prove the necessary \u201cclose relationship\u201d to the category of people covered under the suit, and that their business interests in conducting abortions represent a conflict of interest, Justice Jennifer Brunner pushed back.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the Hippocratic oath, though. I mean the medical profession is a profession,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you would portray it as, as just some kind of monied factory.\u201d\nThe Ohio abortion law had been blocked as part of a different legal challenge until the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision last summer that had legalized abortion nationwide. That ruling\u00a0left it up to states\u00a0to decide the matter.\nOhio clinics then brought their challenge in state court, arguing that a similar right to the procedure exists under the Ohio Constitution. Yost had also requested in his Supreme Court appeal that justices rule on the main premise of the case \u2014 that the Ohio Constitution protect the right to an abortion \u2014 but the court left that question to the lower courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                FILE PHOTO: An abortion rights protester holds a sign at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Dobbs v Women's Health Organization abortion case, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision on June 24, 2022.
