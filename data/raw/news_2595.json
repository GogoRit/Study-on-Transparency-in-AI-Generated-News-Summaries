Wade US court case confessed on her deathbed that she was paid to speak out against abortion in later life, a new documentary reveals.The countries where abortion is legal \u2013 and where it\u2019s illegal Why anti-abortion activists are targeting UK universitiesNorma McCorvey - who used the pseudonym \u201cJane Roe\u201d as the plaintiff in the landmark 1973 case - triggered widespread shock in the 1990s when she disavowed her role in legalising abortion and became a vocal pro-life campaigner.But in a \u201cdeathbed confession\u201d filmed shortly before her death, McCorvey revealed she accepted a series of payments - totalling at least $450,000 (\u00a3370,000) - from ultra-evangelical Christian groups to become an anti-abortion activist, The Times reports.\n\n\nSubscribe to The Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

I took their money and they\u2019d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say,\u201d McCorvey told the makers of AKA Jane Doe. \u201cIt was all an act.\u201dAn anti-abortion group that McCorvey claimed made the payments, Operation Rescue, has denied the claims, reports The Independent. \u201cThere is no way her Christian faith or her pro-life beliefs were false,\u201d the organisation\u2019s president Troy Newman said in a statement.The new documentary chronicles McCorvey\u2019s life from her \u201ctroubled, impoverished youth as a sexual abuse survivor\u201d and her marriage at the age of 16, according to the BBC.McCorvey was in her mid-20s and pregnant with her third child when she was referred to two lawyers, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, who \u201cwere on the hunt for a plaintiff to help to overturn Texas\u2019s strict laws, which permitted abortions only to save the mother\u2019s life\u201d, adds The Times. McCorvey \u201cfitted the bill\u201d.Henry Wade was the Texas attorney general who defended the anti-abortion law.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013For a round-up of the most important stories from around the world - and a concise, refreshing and balanced take on the week\u2019s news agenda - try The Week magazine.
