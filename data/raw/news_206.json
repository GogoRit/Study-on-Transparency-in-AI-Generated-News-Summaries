A woman who is more than 20 weeks pregnant can only have an abortion if a health practitioner reasonably believes that it is appropriate.*\nNational leader Judith Collins voted in favour of reform and said MPs were allowed their own views.\nBut Little said Hipango's comments were \"silly\".\n\"If Judith Collins is happy to have a bunch of radical, anti-abortion extremists running the show on social media, that's a matter for her. If she wants to rein them in she should do, if she's happy to let them go then no doubt she'll do that.\"\n\n\n\nJustice Minister Andrew Little. \nPhoto: RNZ / Dom Thomas\n\n\nHe said it was \"stupid stuff and it would be sad if anybody believed there was any such thing as full-term abortion - there isn't\".\n\"It's pretty bad when people in responsible positions, elected positions, community leadership positions, run those sort of lines - it's just silly.''\nCollins said abortion was dealt with as a conscience issue for the National Party.\n\"It is certainly not something we have a party position on.\n\"I personally voted for the legislation - Harete is very strongly opposed to the legislation and the National Party people are allowed to have views that are not necessarily my views,\" she said.\n\"I would say that Harete is speaking from a position of her own belief - she's a very strong Catholic and her views are her own and they are not mine.\"\n*Please note this sentence has been changed.\u00a0It was originally worded \u201cFor an abortion to take place after 20 weeks, a number of criteria have to be met, and it has to be deemed necessary to save the woman's life or prevent serious injury.\u201d\nMy body, my choice - but what if that choice is a caesarean?\nAbortion services available by phone for some New Zealanders during lockdown\nAbortion Legislation Bill passes third and final reading in Parliament\nMPs reject NZ First bill for abortion law referendum\nLabour shrugs after abortion clinic safe-zones vote misfire\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\nhealth\n\n\n\n\nShare this\n\n\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nShare via email\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Linked In\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, Radio New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView latest newsletter\n\n\n\n\nNext story in Politics\nJudith Collins claims prison escapes false statement a 'joke'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\nImpossible decisions and the job he never got to do - Grant Robertson on his time in politics\nDeputy PM Winston Peters attacks media over speech reporting\n'Nobody should live like this' - K\u0101inga Ora tenants hope changes make a difference\n\n\n\n\nGet the RNZ app\nfor ad-free news and current affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Top News stories\n    \n\nImpossible decisions and the job he never got to do - Grant Robertson on his time in politics\nNellie and me: Unravelling the story of a life inside an asylum\nDeputy PM Winston Peters attacks media over speech reporting\nWorld Rugby reveal plans to speed up the game\nBlenheim cold case: Police offer $100k reward\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView latest newsletter\n\n\n\nPolitics RSS\nFollow RNZ News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ stations\n\nNational\nConcert\nRNZ Pacific\nParliament - live stream\n\n\n\nLatest & popular\n\nLatest audio\nPopular audio\nLatest video\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to watch & listen\n\nAudio help\nRadio\nFollow our podcasts\nSky, Freeview & Satellite\nYouTube\nRNZ apps for iPhone and Android\nRNZ Flash Briefing for Amazon Alexa\nRNZ News for Google Assistant\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout RNZ\n\nAbout\nContact\nAudience Feedback and Complaints\nMedia Releases\nAwards\nJobs\nRNZ Your Media Matters\nLocal Democracy Reporting\nRNZ Commissioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin & Follow RNZ\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Instagram\n\n\n\nSign up to RNZ Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Radio New Zealand 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
