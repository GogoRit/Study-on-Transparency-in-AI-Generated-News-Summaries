UNFPA was forced to suspend the provision of reproductive health care in 140 out of 180 health facilities.\nThe consequences have been catastrophic, particularly for pregnant women and girls. Health workers around the country recounted heart-breaking instances of preventable maternal deaths taking place after care became unavailable.\nSince then, with limited funding coming in, UNFPA has been able to resume operations in some key health facilities across the country. Women\u2019s lives were immediately saved.\nLives saved\nAl-Shael Health Centre in Hajjah Governorate was able to resume reproductive health services in July with funding from the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid, after shuttering these services earlier in the year.\u00a0\nA newborn at a health facility in Taizz. Resumed services are saving lives in key areas. \u00a9 UNFPA YemenThe reopening saved Eltaf\u2019s life. She had been ready give birth at home when she started to experience severe bleeding.\n\u201cWhen Eltaf arrived at the Al-Shael Health Centre, she was in a critical condition,\u201d said Dr. Eshraq, the gynaecologist at the health centre.\u00a0\nEven though reproductive care had resumed at the centre, serious complications are usually referred to larger hospitals. \u201cYet there was no time,\u201d Dr. Eshraq explained. \u201cI was afraid that she and her baby would die.\u201d\nThey were able to stop the haemorrhaging. \u201cThen we helped to deliver her baby, who was suffering from asphyxia,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is like a miracle that we saved Eltaf and her baby with the resources we have. I am proud of my team: midwife Huda and nurse Raya.\u201d\nAbandoned no more\nIn Socotra, with funding from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, UNFPA has been able to support reproductive health services at two health facilities.\nOne is the Nawjad Health Centre, which was non-functional last year, leaving women on the island without any reproductive health services. When Noor, now 20, experienced complications in her pregnancy, she had to travel hundreds of miles to give birth at a health facility in a faraway city. By the time she arrived, it was too late. She lost the baby.\nThis year, she became pregnant again. But this time, she was able to visit the Nawjad Health Centre to deliver under the care of a midwife, free of charge. She had a healthy baby boy.\n\u201cI am happy to come to this health centre. If it was not here, we would have to make the long journey again to the city,\u201d Noor\u2019s husband said. \u201cIt would have cost me 60,000 Yemen Riyal.\u201d\n\u201cThis health centre was abandoned for a long time. We did not receive any pregnant women,\u201d said centre\u2019s director. \u201cBut these days, it has become a lifeline for many women in Socotra.\u201d\nA health worker attends to a woman in labour. But many areas are still without reproductive health services. \u00a9 UNFPA YemenFunds still scraping bottom\nDespite these recent re-openings, some 70 per cent of UNFPA\u2019s reproductive health programmes in the country remain closed due to the lack of funding. Only 61 out of 180 UNFPA-supported reproductive health facilities are functioning.\u00a0\nBy this time last year, UNFPA had supported 265 health facilities and 3,800 reproductive health workers, reaching over 2 million women and girls with reproductive health services. Today, an estimated 1.5 million women of childbearing age are no longer receiving reproductive health services because of the funding shortage.\u00a0\nYet the need for this care has never been greater.\nUNFPA estimates that approximately 6 million women and girls of childbearing age in Yemen need access to reproductive health care. More than a million pregnant women are malnourished. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming the country\u2019s health system, escalating the vulnerabilities of women and girls.\nTo keep reaching the most vulnerable women and girls up to the end of the year, UNFPA urgently requires $38.7 million, with an additional $20 million to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nA displaced girl in Syria finds safety and support\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\u201cGaza is at breaking point\u201d: Health workers and patients describe an unfolding\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nAfter 13 years of crisis, we hear from female health workers in Syria leading\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
