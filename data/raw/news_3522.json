(WLBT) - A group of pro-life doctors fears Mississippi\u2019s abortion ban may not be valid just yet.The Mississippi Justice Institute (MJI) filed a lawsuit Monday in hopes of making sure it is.MJI is the legal arm of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy and is representing the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) in this suit.Aaron Rice, the director of MJI, said he\u2019s not so sure the state\u2019s trigger law is valid, and it\u2019s all because of a 1998 Mississippi Supreme Court opinion called Pro-Choice Mississippi v. Fordice.The opinion holds that abortion is a right protected by the state constitution.Rice said this legal uncertainty has placed the state\u2019s physicians in an impossible \u201cCatch-22.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where elective abortions appear to be both statutorily illegal but a constitutional right, according to this 1998 Mississippi Supreme Court opinion,\u201d he said.Aside from clarifying state law, Rice said the lawsuit also aims to protect doctors from possible punishment by medical institutions.\u201cThere are several professional medical societies that suggest that it is unethical for doctors to refuse to participate in or refer patients for elective abortion and that those doctors could be punished by the state if they refuse to do so,\u201d Rice said.He said the Mississippi Supreme Court relied heavily on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinions when ruling in the Fordice case.Now that the high court\u2019s opinions have changed, he said the states\u2019 should too.The lawsuit was filed in the Hinds County Chancery Court and will likely be decided by the Mississippi Supreme Court.Want more WLBT news in your inbox?
