Carney\nWashington Examiner\nJanuary 24, 2022\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The March for Life is technically a secular event. But everywhere you look, religion is there.\nChristian singer Jordan St. Cyr headlined the pre-march concert and invoked God in his music and between his songs. The Knights of Columbus printed and distributed their ubiquitous \u201cDEFEND LIFE\u201d signs. Most of the groups at the march, it seemed, were Catholic parishes, Catholic colleges, or Catholic high schools.\nThe Lutheran Church Missouri Synod had a visible presence there, as did Orthodox Christians for Life. Friars, priests, and nuns in their habits and cassocks are always visible and prominent. My family traveled to the march straight from a mass that had been offered for the legal protection of the unborn. The presiding priests wore purple, the color of mourning and penance.\nThe religious elements of the March for Life feed one particularly inapt criticism of the pro-life movement. Abortion defenders\u2019 most common accusations against abortion opponents include the charge of \u201ctheocracy.\u201d Pro-lifers are trying to \u201cforce their religious views\u201d on others, which violates the \u201cseparation of church and state.\u201d\nLaws that limit abortion,\u00a0the abortion-defending Left argues, are improperly imposing religion where it doesn\u2019t belong \u2014 in public policy.\nThese arguments have always been tendentious and nonsensical. But these days, as a different sort of religious fervor overtakes the Left, the lectures about stripping faith from the public square are even more laughable.\nFirst, it is false to chalk up the pro-life view on abortion as a religious view per se. The Fifth Commandment, that \u201cthou shalt not kill,\u201d is part of religion, right there in the Bible. Yet somehow, murder statutes do not amount to \u201ctheocracy,\u201d and that\u2019s not even a complicated question. So, why is this?\n\u201cThe pro-life argument is a human rights argument,\u201d said Father Emmanuel Mansford, a Franciscan priest from New York. \u201cIt\u2019s philosophical. It\u2019s based on the fact that a person is a person from the moment of conception. So, I don\u2019t think we need to make it necessarily about God or not about God.\u201d\nOthers at the march made the same argument.\n\u201cI\u2019m Catholic,\u201d said Emily Sullivan, attending the march in a wool hat of her alma mater, Thomas Aquinas College, \u201cbut I\u2019m not pro-life\u00a0because\u00a0I\u2019m Catholic. I\u2019m pro-life because of science and because of basic ethics. All of us, whether you\u2019re religious or not, seem to agree that you shouldn\u2019t murder. I can make the pro-life argument purely based on philosophy. You don\u2019t have to believe in the authority of the Pope or the Bible or pray a rosary to see that.\u201d\nBut even that argument is unnecessary because the premise that faith plays or should play no role in public policy is incoherent.\n\u201cReligion needs to flow through everything you do \u2014 your work life, your play life, everything,\u201d said Bruce, a middle-aged Tennessean who had come to DC for the march.\n\u201cAmen to that,\u201d chimed in Dave, his friend, who wore a red hat emblazoned with \u201cMake America Holy Again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s your moral compass. It\u2019s the way you live. It\u2019s who you are.\u201d\n\u201cIf your faith is genuine, it affects every part of your life,\u201d said Mansford. \u201cIt\u2019s not compartmentalized\u201d into politics and personal.\nThis is an unpopular way to speak, but it is obviously true, even to the self-styled seculars. One\u2019s religion, and one could put under that umbrella any basic belief system that doesn\u2019t involve a god, helps inform one\u2019s ideas of justice and duty, which in turn form one\u2019s policy preferences and politics.\nWhen President Barack Obama spoke of expanding the federal safety net, he regularly\u00a0invoked\u00a0Scripture, citing \u201cJesus\u2019 teaching that for unto whom much is given, much shall be required.\u201d This is common on the Left. And frankly, it\u2019s good.\nThere\u2019s a broader point here, though: Politics\u2019 brief experiment with secularism has ended.\nThe Left in America dressed up as secular for the 1990s and during the Bush era. But by 2022, it\u2019s impossible to ignore the religious zeal that runs through the Left. I covered the\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u00a0protests after George Floyd\u2019s death, and they had all the elements of religious prayer services. The environmental movement has become a religious cause. Even the fight against COVID-19 has become a matter of faith and ritual.\nAll of the Left\u2019s politics are infused with religious fervor and belief these days, oriented toward their idea of the sacred. It never made sense to dismiss the argument against legal abortion as a mere \u201creligious belief.\u201d It\u2019s laughable now.\nThis op-ed originally appeared here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTimothy P.
