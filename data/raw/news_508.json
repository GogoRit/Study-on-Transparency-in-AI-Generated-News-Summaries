Wade\nIn upholding a ban on certain abortions, a federal appeals court drew directly from Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 playbook.\n\n\nBy\n      \nMark Joseph Stern\n\n\nApril 15, 20213:50 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas at the White House on Oct. 26.\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld an Ohio law that prohibits doctors from performing an abortion if they know the reason is because the fetus has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. The 9\u20137 decision seems to defy the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which found a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability. Yet the court\u2019s conservative judges claimed that those precedents did not necessarily apply here, because Ohio was not simply regulating abortion; the state claimed to be combatting eugenics by protecting disabled fetuses from discrimination. The Supreme Court has never squarely confronted these \u201ctrait-selection\u201d laws, which often forbid abortions because of race or sex as well; while these bans have cropped up around the country in recent years, courts have consistently ruled that they are foreclosed by precedent. The 6th Circuit\u2019s conservative majority, by contrast, made a bet that today\u2019s SCOTUS will weaken or overturn Roe and Casey to uphold Ohio\u2019s statute\u2014and, perhaps, overturn the constitutional right to abortion in the process.\n\n\n\nTo get around precedent, the 6th Circuit drew heavily from Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 2019 solo opinion in Box v. Planned Parenthood, which decried abortion as a \u201ctool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d A lower court\u2019s heavy reliance on a lone concurring opinion may seem odd. But, in an article published in the Harvard Law Review just two days before the 6th Circuit\u2019s ruling, New York University law professor Melissa Murray presciently anticipated Thomas\u2019 impact on anti-abortion jurisprudence. By tethering abortion to the eugenics movement, Murray wrote, Thomas had not just provided a justification for \u201ctrait-selection laws,\u201d but laid the groundwork for overruling Roe and Casey on the grounds that they are tainted by discrimination. I spoke with Murray on Thursday about her article, the 6th Circuit\u2019s decision, and the impact of Thomas\u2019 Box concurrence on the future of abortion rights. Our conversation has been edited condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Joseph Stern: Let\u2019s start with Thomas\u2019 concurrence in Box. What was his argument?\nMelissa Murray: Justice Thomas\u2019 concurrence in Box provided a defense of trait-selection laws that really called into question Roe and Casey because it framed these laws as anti-discrimination or anti-eugenics measures, and suggested that Casey and Roe had nothing to say about them. Then there was all of this discussion about race. Justice Thomas was leaning into this racialized history of eugenics and specifically associating the history of abortion with the history of birth control and the movement that Margaret Sanger led in the 1920s and 1930s, which in recent years has been criticized for its affiliations with the eugenics movement.\nThat got my attention because the history of birth control is quite distinct from the history of abortion regulations. And in fact, the racialized politics of abortion regulation run the other way. There\u2019s significant historical research that the effort to regulate and restrict abortion after the Civil War was fueled by anxiety that Black women and immigrant women were outpacing their white sisters in reproduction. Abortion restrictions were fueled by the fear that white women were using abortion and, as a consequence, were not having as many children, and the white race was about to be overwhelmed by African Americans and immigrants. This was demographic anxiety about the changing complexion of the United States and the diminution in the white birthrate. Thomas tried to graft the history of abortion onto the history of birth control, but they are not the same thing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or accurate to conflate them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest Newsletter\nA\u00a0daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\n\n        Thanks for signing up!

Louisiana, intersects with Box to turbocharge Thomas\u2019 argument. Can you explain that?\nRamos is a case that challenged Louisiana\u2019s policy of allowing criminal convictions to proceed from a nonunanimous jury verdict. It\u2019s not the first time the court had taken up that question; they had done so before in 1972. Now the court was dealing with this question again, and this time there is all this historical evidence that the nonunanimous jury rule was steeped in the post-Reconstruction effort to diffuse the power of Black jurors and to entrench white supremacy throughout the South. So, there is very clear racial residue around it. In striking down nonunanimous jury rule, the court noted how steeped this was in this history of white supremacy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nRamos was a really significant development when paired with Thomas\u2019 Box concurrence. It laid out a path for not simply upholding these trait-selection laws, but also for using a challenge to a trait-selection law as a vehicle for revisiting Roe and ultimately dismantling and overruling Roe on the ground that it perpetuates racial injustice. And in his Box concurrence, Thomas also talks about the disability aspect\u2014the idea is that abortion could have eugenic potential because it could keep certain parts of the population who are deemed unfit from reproducing in the future. It could be African Americans you believe to be unfit, or those with disability. He specifically invokes the example of Iceland, where through abortion\u2014which is state-facilitated and subsidized\u2014they\u2019ve basically rooted out all incidents of Down syndrome.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThat brings us to the 6th Circuit\u2019s decision, which upheld a law banning abortions because of Down syndrome. How did the majority draw from Thomas\u2019 Box opinion?\nThomas\u2019 Box concurrence essentially invited more litigation on the question of abortion and eugenics, and he\u2019s getting what he solicits in an opinion like this. He seeded this narrative and now you\u2019re seeing it take root and flower. In the 6th Circuit decision, the majority and almost all of the concurrences cited Thomas\u2019 opinion in Box. Judges John Bush and Richard Griffin\u2019s concurrences really leaned into this idea that abortion has eugenic potential. And specifically, this idea that when women seek an abortion for the purpose of avoiding having a child with Down syndrome, they\u2019re basically engaging in a kind of modern-day eugenics program that is undifferentiated from state-sponsored sterilization programs. The 6th Circuit concurrences say there is nothing distinguishable about a state program of sterilization abuse and the individual choice to terminate a pregnancy. The two are coextensive and indistinguishable according to these concurrences.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge Julia Smith Gibbons, in her dissent, argues that this is apples to oranges. There\u2019s a real difference between a state sterilizing the \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d in Buck v. Bell and an individual woman\u2019s decision to terminate a pregnancy because of a fetal anomaly or diagnosis. But that\u2019s not the language of the Box concurrence, nor is it the language of the 6th Circuit concurrences. They\u2019re very much like, \u201cthis is eugenics, and if it can be deployed here to avoid the prospect of Down syndrome, it can also be deployed in these other ways potentially to deracinate entire scores of the population.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nYou call Thomas\u2019 history, which obviously influenced the 6th Circuit\u2019s decision, \u201cmasculinist.\u201d What do you mean by that?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack men are the ones who historically have been making this claim about abortion and family planning being tools of state-sponsored genocide. These were arguments that Pan-Africanists like Marcus Garvey made in the 1920s and 1930s. Those same arguments were reprised by the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers and Black Nationalists in the 1960s and 1970s. They were primarily invoked by the men within those movements, and the women in those movements often registered their objections. They would say: The state-sponsored genocide we\u2019re concerned about is not abortion or contraception but the fact that Mississippi and North Carolina are maintaining entire systems of state-sponsored sterilization that are bringing Black women into their ambit. We\u2019re worried about the conditions in which women of color are raising their children. We\u2019re worried about state violence against Black and brown children. We don\u2019t see abortion and contraception as the genocide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas has coopted the masculinist narrative but completely sidelined the feminist objections being raised alongside the arguments in the 1960s and 1970s. He has really limited and cherry-picked the people whose voices he wants to highlight.\nDo you think the 6th Circuit did, too?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her dissent from the 6th Circuit decision, Judge Karen Nelson Moore takes her colleagues in the majority to task for this. She essentially says: \u201cYou want to be historians? Well, historians use primary sources. Maybe you should cite one of those. I\u2019m going to cite some primary sources. It\u2019s really easy to do. Can you even find a primary source for this?\u201d And lo and behold, they don\u2019t.\nWhat are the odds that the Supreme Court itself uses this bad history to hobble or overrule Roe and Casey?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\nFirst you need a case that gets to the Supreme Court. And I think the 6th Circuit may just have done that. Now there is a circuit split on the question of whether these trait-selection laws are unconstitutional under Casey. That may truly provide a vehicle for getting a case to the court. And once it gets to the court, it opens up a larger question about whether Roe continues to be good law. And if you have this narrative that\u2019s been raised repeatedly in those concurrences in the 6th Circuit that abortion has eugenic potential. Once you\u2019ve credited that idea, you can begin to line up the arguments against Roe. In light of Ramos, I think there\u2019s an opening to think about whether Roe is rooted in this earlier history of eugenics and the possibility of deracination and is part of a genocidal plot. And suddenly you\u2019re in business.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you point out in your article, Amy Coney Barrett joined an opinion suggesting trait-selection bans are constitutional while serving on the court of appeals. Do you think the stars are aligning for abortion opponents with this case?\nI think one of the reasons why so many were keen to have Barrett on the court was to replace Justice Ruth Ginsburg with a woman who has pro-life sensibilities in the event there was an opportunity to overrule Roe. Then it wouldn\u2019t look like all the conservative men were striking down Roe with all the women in dissent. Now you have a woman with conservative sensibilities who is very clearly skeptical of abortion rights. I think that was a big part of her appeal as a nominee and as a prospective justice. I think the time is right. She\u2019s in the right place. The rest of the court is in the right place. I don\u2019t know what else stands in the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Ohio\n            \n\n\n              Racism\n            \n\n\n              Supreme Court\n            \n\n\n              Disability\n            \n\n\n              Clarence Thomas\n            \n\n\n              Judiciary\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
