That it was bracingly cold was apparent from the the woolen socks Franciscan friars wore beneath their sandal straps.\nThe ongoing coronavirus crisis, coupled with tightened COVID-19 restrictions in the District of Columbia, kept some regulars at home. But by the start of a mid-day, pre-march rally, headlined by a passionate speech by \u201cBible in a Year\u201d podcast star Father Mike Schmitz, the size of the crowd had swelled into the tens of thousands, resembling a typical year\u2019s turnout.\nBut this year\u2019s march was anything but typical. The possibility that the country\u2019s highest court later this year might strike down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide \u2014 and sparked the first March for Life 49 years ago \u2014 lent a festive, anticipatory air to the day\u2019s rituals, culminating in a walk up Constitution Avenue to the steps of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life,\u201d Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, the event\u2019s organizer, said at the rally.\n\u201cRoe,\u201d she said, \u201cis not settled law.\u201d\nNo time for complacency\nSuch statements carry extra weight this year because of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a pivotal Mississippi abortion case that many in the pro-life movement see as the best \u2014 and possibly last \u2014 opportunity to unravel the tightly woven legal framework that has produced some 62 million abortions across the United States, a staggering toll the Catholic Church views as an epic human tragedy. A decision in the case isn\u2019t expected until the end of the court\u2019s term in June.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court, God-willing, (is) poised to affirm the Dobbs case, to prevent abortions after 15 weeks, but also to begin, and we hope, the dismantling of Roe v. Wade,\u201d said Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who spoke during the rally.\nThe intense polarization surrounding the case was made manifest by a brazen publicity stunt by an activist group called Catholics for Choice, which on Thursday night beamed carefully calibrated pro-choice messages on the facade of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception here, while a prayer vigil to end abortion took place inside. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the Archbishop of Washington, criticized the group\u2019s actions, which another prelate, Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone called \u201cdiabolical.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities, said the pro-life movement cannot afford to become \u201ccomplacent,\u201d regardless of the outcome of Dobbs.\n\u201cThe Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to abortion is a response of love for both mothers and their children in the womb. The Church\u2019s teaching proclaims a message of life, reminding us that every life is a sacred gift from God from the moment of conception until natural death,\u201d Lori said in a statement.\n\u201cWe cannot build a truly just society and remain complacent when faced with the massive impact of Roe v. Wade, which has taken over 60 million lives since 1973. May we pray, fast, and work for the day when the gift of every human life is protected in law and welcomed in love,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A large Catholic presence\u2019\nThursday night\u2019s drama gave way to an upbeat show of solidarity at Friday\u2019s march. By longstanding practice, neither organizers nor the police provided estimates of the number of marchers.\nMore than 200 students from Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio arrived by bus for the march before 5 a.m. on Friday morning, two students told CNA. The overnight bus drive took more than five hours.\u00a0\nParticipants at the March for Life in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 21, 2022.

They said the march met their expectations.\u00a0\n\u201cI definitely was looking forward to seeing a whole bunch of people defending life and there's this huge crowd out there so I\u2019m definitely happy with the pro-life movement,\u201d Koehler said.\n\u201cI was expecting a large Catholic presence and so far I've seen it, which I'm pretty happy about,\u201d Hunt said. He explained that he\u2019s pro-life \u201cbecause I believe in the truth, and the truth is that a child is a human being from the moment of conception up until natural death.\u201d\nAdded Hunt: \u201cNot only is a child a human being, but a human being is also a child of God, and I believe in protecting that life.\u201d\nMany of the marchers were there for the first time, including a group of young women from Charlotte, North Carolina.\u00a0\n\u201cI just think we can have more options for people rather than just ending lives,\u201d\u00a0 Millie Bryan, a 17-year-old from Charlotte, told CNA. Bryan was attending her first-ever March for Life, and was toting a sign that read \u201cStop telling women they can\u2019t finish school, have a career, succeed without abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nShe added that she was most looking forward to \u201cgetting the opportunity to see the people come together to fight for something that\u2019s really important, to fight for life.\u201d\u00a0\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nBagpipers and drummers with American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property concluded the march. Members of the group carried waving red flags and reverently carried a platform topped with a statue of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\u201cThere are still a lot of people here. It\u2019s great that people still made the sacrifice to come out,\u201d said Father David Yallaly, who attended the march with the Chicago-based group Crusaders for Life. \u201cIt\u2019s a great witness to the message of the sanctity of human life.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nMarch for Life 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
