Erin Grall, House sponsor of HB 5, the 15-week abortion ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis (background) signed the bill into law April 14, 2022. Credit: DeSantis Facebook page.\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis went to church Thursday to sign a 15-week abortion ban into law during a ceremony bearing many of the accoutrements of a worship service.\n\u201cWe are there to defend those who can\u2019t defend themselves,\u201d the governor told an enthusiastic crowd at the Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee.\n\u201cThis will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation,\u201d he said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union immediately promised to challenge the law in court.\n\u201cMake no mistake: If this abortion ban goes into effect, it would have devastating consequences for pregnant people, especially those who are not able to afford to travel out of state in search of the essential health care they need,\u201d legislative director Kara Gross said in a written statement. \n\u201cNobody should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. We will take swift legal action to protect Floridians\u2019 rights and defend against this cruel attack on our bodily autonomy.\u201d\nThe new law (HB 5) bans abortions after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest, although they would be allowed in cases of severe fetal abnormality. Abortion rights advocates argue that it is blatantly unconstitutional under existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents including Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The 15-week ban in Florida takes effect on July 1.\nThat gives the justices time to rule in a constitutional challenge to a similar law from Mississippi before they take their summer break around the end of June. That court\u2019s new Republican supermajority is widely expected to uphold the Mississippi statute, either by overruling those precedents or trimming them into oblivion.\nFlorida Constitution\nThe Florida Supreme Court is also in play here. It ruled in 1989 that an abortion-consent law for minors was unconstitutional because it violated privacy provisions in the state Constitution. The new state Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, is far more conservative than the court that upheld the right to privacy and hasn\u2019t by shy about overturning its own precedents.\n  A large crowd attended the signing of Florida\u2019s 15-week abortion bill. The law goes into affect July 1. April 14, 2022.\nThe bill-signing event in Central Florida included a large, enthusiastic crowd that broke into cheers and waved signs saying, \u201cPro Life.\u201d It featured witness testimony from women who\u2019d undergone abortions and regretted it and others who\u2019d refused abortions and did not regret it.\nThe ceremony stood in stark contrast to two years ago, when DeSantis announced that he\u2019d signed an abortion parental-consent bill via a press release that tucked it among 14 separate pieces of legislation while holding a public bill-signing ceremony for two water-quality measures.\nOn Thursday, there was much talk of prayer, including from Erin Grall, a Republican representing Indian River and part of St. Lucie counties who sponsored the legislation in the House. She thanked people who prayed for her as the legislation advanced during the recent legislative session and those \u201cwho are praying every day to end the horrific abortions that plague our country.\u201d\nGrall, an attorney, referred to those U.S. Supreme Court precedents during the bill-signing ceremony.\n\u201cThe reality of the Roe decision is that men on the Supreme Court proclaimed that women, in order to achieve equality with men, must be able to kill their own children. As a woman, I refuse to accept such a perverse version of equality,\u201d Grall said.\n\u2018no abortions\u2019\n  Sen. Kelli Stargel, Senate sponsor of the 15-week abortion ban. Credit: Danielle J. Brown.\nSenate sponsor Kelli Stargel, representing portions of Lake and Polk counties, remarked that \u201cwe\u2019re looking at the potential of Roe v. Wade being overturned,\u201d adding, \u201chopefully, in the future, there will be no abortions.\u201d\nAlso on hand were Senate President Wilton Simpson and House Speaker Chris Sprowls, who called DeSantis \u201cthe most pro-life governor in America.\u201d So, too, was Simone Marstiller, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, which regulates abortion clinics.\nSprowls continued: \u201cLike many of you, I believe that life is a gift from God. And, as I look out into this audience, I see many familiar faces who have been warriors on the front lines of the life movement, whether it is \u2026 ministering to young women, whether it is helping them as they give birth to their child in pregnancy centers across this state. You have been a part of this as much as every single legislator here and for that we are very grateful.\nReaction was swift.\nCommissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried, running in the Democratic primary to oppose DeSantis this fall, issued a written statement:\n\u201cThis law is a despicable and disgusting assault on women. It\u2019s an insult to our dignity and our ability to make these deeply personal decisions about our own lives, and it will have a devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of women across Florida,\u201d Fried said.\n\u2018Hypocrisy\u2019\n\u201cThe hypocrisy of Republicans who love to brag about how \u2018free\u2019 our state is while pushing a law that will literally force women and girls to give birth is absolutely outrageous. This law is a direct attack on women\u2019s constitutional rights, and it\u2019s cruel, extreme, and inhumane,\u201d Fried said.\nOn Twitter, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, also in the Democratic primary, called the law \u201can unconstitutional attack on women that strips away their reproductive freedom. Women should make decisions about their own bodies, not governors. I\u2019d veto this bill and any attempt to restrict the right to choose. Full stop.\nState Sen. Annette Taddeo, another Democrat running for governor, issued her own written statement.\n\u201cWe are less free today than before the session started,\u201d it reads.\n\u201cAs Latin American countries like Colombia are moving forward and expanding access to health care, we\u2019re moving backward in Florida. Gov. DeSantis has just signed into law an extreme bill that was made even crueler by the rejections to provide exemptions for victims of rape, human trafficking, and incest.\u201d\n  Florida Sen. Lauren Book. WFSU photo\nNot \u2018moderate or fair\u2019\nLauren Book of Broward County, leader of the Senate Democrats, said DeSantis had \u201cforced the women of Florida back 50 years,\u201d before Roe.\n\u201cThis is not a \u201cmoderate\u201d or fair bill if a woman or girl must live with the consequence of someone else\u2019s actions, revictimized by the decisions of Florida\u2019s right-wing GOP,\u201d she said in a written statement.\n\u201cWithout access to safe and legal procedures, a woman\u2019s life and her liberty are severely endangered. This is nothing more than an authoritarian move by Florida Republicans. Florida will never be free while lawmakers turn a blind eye to women\u2019s rights, victims\u2019 rights, and to the decent and basic needs of our citizens.\nHowever, Andrew Shirvell, founder and executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn, offered praise.\n\u201cThis truly historic law will annually save an estimated 5,000 unborn children from being murdered here in Florida via brutal late-term abortions. Florida Voice for the Unborn anticipates that any legal challenges to the legislation \u2013 whether brought in federal or state court \u2013 will ultimately be unsuccessful,\u201d Shirvell said in a written statement.\nNote: This story has been updated with details from bill ceremony and reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXDeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony\nby Michael Moline, Florida Phoenix April 14, 2022\nDeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony\nby Michael Moline, Florida Phoenix April 14, 2022\n Gov.
