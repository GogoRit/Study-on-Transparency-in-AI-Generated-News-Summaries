Photograph: Baron/GettyIn recent years, however, her family planning work has been overshadowed by her association with the eugenics movement. Among her writings, Stopes called for new laws that allowed the \u201chopelessly rotten and racially diseased\u201d to be sterilised and wrote fiercely against interracial marriage.\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely not trying to erase her from history, or what she did,\u201d said Simon Cooke, MSI\u2019s chief executive. \u201cFor me, she was an acknowledged family planning pioneer, an extraordinary women who broke down barriers \u2026 but we really need to look forward and not back. It\u2019s the right moment for us.\u201dCooke said the board began seriously discussing a name change in November last year, but that the events of 2020, particularly the Black Lives Matter movement, had propelled change. \u201cThe name of the organisation has been a topic of discussion for many years and the events of 2020 have reaffirmed that changing our name now is the right decision,\u201d he said.The organisation is launching a new 10-year strategy to reach at least 120 million women and girls with voluntary healthcare services over the next decade, and to encourage greater use of telemedicine, something which has increased rapidly during Covid-19 lockdowns. MSI wants to be more active in influencing policy in the countries in which it works.'Women always take the brunt': India sees surge in unsafe abortionRead moreCooke said the organisation had done an \u201cexceptional\u201d job in keeping services open during the pandemic. He anticipated health centres would see 10 million clients this year, not far short of the total for 2019. \u201cAfter the disruption in March and April, we\u2019re now pretty much back to full capacity, particularly in Africa,\u201d he said.Cooke said that although \u201cwe didn\u2019t plan it to be part of our strategy\u201d, the organisation was \u201cdelighted\u201d at the result of the US presidential election.Since 2017, MSI has missed out on about $30m (\u00a322m) a year in US funding because it refused to sign the Mexico City policy, or \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d, which Donald Trump reenacted when he took office. The policy prevents overseas NGOs that receive US money from providing any abortion services.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to rescind the policy in January. The headline of this article was amended on 17 November 2020 to correctly reflect that the charity Marie Stopes International was named after the campaigner, not founded by her.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsWomen's rights and gender equalityContraception and family planningHealthBlack Lives Matter movement'Global gag rule'AbortionnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
