According to the new polling, Nebraskans opposed to new abortion bans outnumber abortion ban supporters in both rural and urban communities as well as each congressional district.\nScout Richters, ACLU of Nebraska senior legal and policy counsel, said state senators should take notice of these results and keep abortion legal.\n\u201cMonths since the end of Roe, we are seeing the horrifying impact of extreme abortion bans in other states, and Nebraskans do not want that here,\u201d Richters said. \u201cThe freedom to control our bodies, lives and futures is vital to all of us. That is why a majority of Nebraskans support abortion access. The bottom line is that it is time for our policies to reflect our shared belief that health care decisions belong to Nebraskans and their medical providers, not politicians.\u201d\nHart Research surveyed 604 registered Nebraska voters for the poll between Nov. 12 and 16. The polling is representative of registered voters statewide in terms of demographics, geography and political affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeople Power \nView Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch aclunebraska.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Assistance\nPress\nCareers\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 ACLU of Nebraska\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
