Below, we explain the meaning and history behind six of the most common.\nRed lightning bolt\nA red lightning bolt has become the main symbol of the protests. It is part of the logo of Women\u2019s Strike (Strajk Kobiet), a grassroots women\u2019s rights initiative and the main organiser of the current demonstrations.\nIt was originally created by graphic designer Ola Jasionowska, who says that it symbolises a warning.\u00a0\u201cIt says: watch out, beware, we won\u2019t accept that women are being deprived of their basic rights,\u201d Jasionowska explained to Newsweek Polska.\n\n\nNigdy ju\u017c \u017cadna nie b\u0119dzie sz\u0142a sama. B\u0119dziemy sz\u0142y razem. B\u0119dziemy walczy\u0107 o polskie kobiety i przestrzeganie praw cz\u0142owieka \u2013 na ulicy i w sejmie. Marsza\u0142ek Terlecki albo si\u0119 z tym pogodzi i wprowadzi pod obrad ustaw\u0119 o depenalizacji i legalizacji, albo b\u0119dzie mia\u0142 rewolucj\u0119! pic.twitter.com/PsiH9cvJM7\n\u2014 Marcelina Zawisza (@mmzawisza) October 27, 2020\n\nThe symbol has been seized upon by critics of the protests, who have tried to claim that it is similar to the insignia used by the SS and other formations in Nazi Germany.\nRyszard Terlecki, head of PiS\u2019s parliamentary caucus and deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, said it was \u201csad\u201d to see opposition MPs wearing facemasks \u201creferencing totalitarian symbols\u201d.\nNews broadcasts on state TV, which is under the influence of PiS, have this week repeatedly referred to the protesters as \u201cleft-wing fascists\u201d and drawn links between their symbol and Nazism.\n\n\n\"Leftist fascism is destroying Poland\" headlined the main evening news on state TV (a government mouthpiece) for the second night in a row.\nThey said that abortion protesters have expressed \"approval of cannibalism\" and use a symbol associated with Nazism and Satan pic.twitter.com/8Xufk66tih\n\u2014 Daniel Tilles (@danieltilles1) October 28, 2020\n\nSupporters of the protests point out that the Women\u2019s Strike logo is different in colour, shape and style to the SS insignia, and that lightning bolts are a common symbol for an array of different groups.\nAmong those that have used such as symbol were the \u201cGrey Ranks\u201d, an underground Polish paramilitary organisation that resisted the German Nazi occupation in World War II. Those who link the lightning symbol to Nazism are \u201cinsulting Polish heroes\u201d, said left-wing MP Anna-Maria \u017bukowska.\nJasionowska, the designer of the logo, says the claims of Nazi links are \u201cabsurd\u201d: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention at all. Everyone looks for interpretations that they find useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWypierdala\u0107\u201d and Solidarity\u00a0\nOne of the main slogans of the current protests has been \u201cWypierdala\u0107\u201d, a vulgarity that translates roughly as \u201cFuck off\u201d.\nThe word has been chanted by demonstrators, while also appearing on posters and banners. Some quickly began to combine it with an iconic Polish symbol of protests and resistance, the logo of the Solidarity (Solidarno\u015b\u0107) trade union that played a leading role in bringing down communism in Poland in the 1980s.\n\n\nA court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland has brought tens of thousands of protesters \u2013 mostly women \u2013 onto the streets.\nWe look at the protests through the lens of Italian photographer Luca Aliano https://t.co/EkqNxOnSrZ\n\u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) October 26, 2020\n\nArtist Jarek Kubicki then developed that theme further by adapting a famous campaign poster from 1989, when Poland held its first semi-free elections, in which the Solidarity logo appeared behind an image of Gary Cooper appearing as a cowboy in the American Western High Noon.\nKubicki recreated the poster, but with \u201cSolidarno\u015b\u0107\u201d replaced by \u201cWypierdala\u0107\u201d and Gary Cooper replaced by female action heroes from Hollywood movies.\n\nThe idea quickly spread, with many Polish women, including left-wing female MPs, creating similar images with themselves in the foreground.\n\nThe designer of the original Solidarity logo, Jerzy Janiszewski, has previously said that he has no problem with abortion protesters using his work.\n\u201cAs the author, I am opposed to prosecuting and punishing anyone for using the logo during peaceful and, in my opinion, legitimate protests for women\u2019s rights in Poland,\u201d he said in 2016.\u00a0\n***** ***\u00a0\nAt the abortion protests, there have been many signs bearing eight asterisks in the form ***** ***, in what may be a rather confusing and cryptic message for observers from outside Poland. The symbols (widely referred to as \u201ceight little stars\u201d in Polish) stand for \u201cJeba\u0107 PiS\u201d (Fuck PiS).\nThey became a widely used meme during this year\u2019s presidential election campaign, especially after they appeared in the video for a song by Polish rapper Taco Hemingway that was seen as critical of the ruling party.\nIn one famous image, President Andrzej Duda \u2013 who was standing for re-election as the candidate supported by PiS \u2013 unwittingly posed for a photo alongside a young man wearing a t-shirt bearing the eight stars.\n\n\nChyba nikt prezydenta nie pilnuje na tych wiecach. Ale \u017ce on sam nie wie, co oznacza osiem gwiazdek? Bronkizacji PAD ci\u0105g dalszy.

Tens of thousands of Polish women, wearing black to symbolise mourning, came out onto the streets.\nSome of the largest demonstrations took place in the autumn rain, and as a result umbrellas became a symbol of the \u201cBlack Protests\u201d.\n\n\nThousands Of Pissed Off WomenWarsaw (City in Europe) October 2016 (AD)#czarnyprotest#blackprotest pic.twitter.com/7SfEPJZ7PO\n\u2014 Borys Musielak (@michuk) October 3, 2016\n\nThose demonstrations succeeded in forcing PiS to back away from the proposed abortion ban. But afterwards, organisers vowed: \u201cNie sk\u0142adamy parasolek\u201d (We\u2019re not closing our umbrellas). And since then, umbrellas have reappeared whenever a threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights is perceived.\nEarlier this year, another proposal to ban abortion returned to parliament during lockdown. With street protests prohibited, many women placed black umbrellas in their windows or balconies, or held black umbrellas while queuing outside of shops.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nJak zaprotestowa\u0107, nie ruszaj\u0105c si\u0119 z domu?

Protesters \u201cdecorated\u201d the gate of the palace of the archbishop of Wroc\u0142aw with slogans and coat hangers as well as a chemise stained with blood.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n.@ZieloniWro jak zawsze tam gdzie trzeba\u270a\ud83d\udc9a Dzi\u015b wsp\u00f3lnie z wroc\u0142awiankami i wroc\u0142awianami licznie spacerowali po Ostrowie Tumskim.

But it is estimated that tens of thousands of women have illegal terminations annually, while many travel abroad for procedures in countries with more liberal laws.\nArtist Iness Rychlik has produced a self-portrait combining the coat hanger symbol with a blood stain in the shape of Poland. Her work is entitled Granice subtelno\u015bci, with\u00a0granice meaning both \u201climits\u201d and \u201cborders\u201d and\u00a0subtelno\u015bci meaning \u201cof subtlety\u201d or \u201cof nicety\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cPW\u201d Anchor\u00a0\nThe \u201canchor\u201d (kotwica) is one of Poland\u2019s most important symbols. Created in 1942 by Anna Smole\u0144ska, a member of the underground resistance, it was used as an emblem of the struggle against German occupation during the war. Its shape creates the letters \u201cPW\u201d, standing for Polska Walcz\u0105ca (Poland Fighting).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThe \u2018Kotwica\u201d sign \u2013 the emblem of #FightingPoland \u2013 was created in 1942 as a symbol of resistance against German occupation of Poland.#PolishUndergroundState #OccupiedPoland #WWII #WW2 #HomeArmy #Polishhistory #Kotwica pic.twitter.com/boUE5eL2QQ\n\u2014 Institute of National Remembrance (@ipngovpl_eng) January 17, 2019\n\nDuring the Black Protests of 2016, some women displayed an adapted version of the symbol, turning the arms of the anchor into breasts and making the PW stand for Polka Walcz\u0105ca (Polish Woman Fighting).\n\n\nTransparent z \"Polk\u0105 Walcz\u0105c\u0105\" nie by\u0142 zniewag\u0105.
