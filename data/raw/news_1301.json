In all, it was a dramatic illustration of how the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to eliminate the nationwide right to abortion has galvanized voters who support women\u2019s right to choose. The court\u2019s June decision has led to near-total bans in a dozen Republican-governed states and animated races around the country up and down the ballot. The Kentucky result spurned the state\u2019s Republican-led Legislature, which has imposed a near-total ban on abortion and put the proposed state constitutional amendment on the ballot. The outcome echoed what happened in another red state, Kansas, where voters in August rejected changing that state\u2019s constitution to let lawmakers tighten restrictions or ban abortions. \n\n\u201cAs we saw in Kansas earlier this year, and in many other states last night, this is not a partisan issue,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. \u201cPeople are energized and they do not want politicians controlling their bodies and futures.\u201d\nNationally, about two-thirds of voters say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of over 90,000 voters across the country. Only about 1 in 10 say abortion should be illegal in all cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 6 in 10 also say the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision made them dissatisfied or angry, compared with fewer who say they were happy or satisfied. Still, the nationwide election results Tuesday reflected how voters\u2019 views on abortion rights can play out in complicated ways. By narrow margins, Wisconsin voters re-elected their pro-choice Democratic governor and an anti-abortion GOP senator. Kansas re-elected a Democratic governor who supports abortion rights. Meanwhile, staunchly anti-abortion GOP governors in Georgia, Florida and Texas easily won their contests. \n\nStephen Billy of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America rejected any suggestion that the overall midterm outcome reflected a surge of support for abortion rights. He acknowledged that abortion opponents were outspent in the key ballot-measure campaigns and needed to review their strategies.The Kentucky ballot measure was originally considered a conservative vote driver. But after the Roe decision, abortion-rights supporters raised nearly $1.5 million to fight it. Thousands of voters who cast their ballots for Republican Sen. Rand Paul split with the party on the abortion ballot measure, returns showed. At a elementary school in Simpsonville, a small town outside of Louisville, 71-year-old Republican voter Jim Stewart said he voted for Paul, but chose no on the amendment, even though he\u2019s opposed to abortion. \u201cYou got to have a little choice there,\u201d he said.In Michigan, supporters of the push to protect abortion rights collected more signatures than any other ballot initiative in state history to get it before the voters. It puts a definitive end to a 1931 ban on abortion that had been blocked in court but could have been revived.\n\nOn Michigan State University\u2019s campus, junior Devin Roberts said students seemed \u201cfired up\u201d and that he had seen lines of voters spilling out of the school\u2019s polling places throughout the day. The ballot measure was one of the main drivers of the high turnout, he said. \u201cI think students want to have the same rights that their parents had when they were younger,\u201d Roberts said. Democrats also won full control of the Michigan state government for the first time in 40 years. Democratic state Sen. Jeremy Moss said the outcome showed abortion\u2019s resonance for voters, even in a year where issues like inflation and public safety loomed large. \u201cI think that Republicans really discounted that ... abortion is an economic agenda, a freedom agenda, and people really showed out to support choice,\u201d he said.\n\nChristen Pollo, spokeswoman for Citizens Supporting MI Women & Children, blamed the Michigan measure\u2019s success on out-of-state donors and predicted an \u201cinevitable flood of litigation\u201d over issues of parental consent.Kentucky\u2019s election outcome doesn\u2019t lift its ban, which does not include exceptions for rape and incest, but it means a legal battle over the law will keep playing out. The ban faces a legal challenge presently before the state Supreme Court, and the amendment\u2019s rejection leaves open the possibility that the court could declare abortion a state right.Anti-abortion groups in Kentucky said they were disappointed in the results but the executive director of the Family Foundation pointed out that abortion bans remain in place and voters again backed \u201cpro-life legislative majorities\u201d in state government. \n\nThe reproductive-rights question in Vermont came after Legislature passed a law in 2019 guaranteeing reproductive rights, including becoming pregnant and having access to birth control. Supporters with the Reproductive Liberty Ballot Committee said the overturning of Roe meant \u201cstate-level protections are vital to safeguarding access to reproductive health care.\u201dCalifornia already had passed several measures aimed at easing access to abortion and set aside millions of taxpayer dollars to help pay for some out-of-state abortion travel. On Tuesday, voters approved language that would explicitly guarantee access to abortion and contraception in the state constitution.In Montana, meanwhile, it was too early to determine the result of a ballot measure to create criminal penalties for health care providers unless they do everything \u201cmedically appropriate and reasonable\u201d to save the life of a baby after birth, including the rare possibility of birth after an attempted abortion.___Associated Press writers Tammy Webber in Flint, Michigan, Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, Rebecca Reynolds in Simpsonville, Kentucky, Dylan Lovan in Louisville, Kentucky, and David Crary in New York contributed to this report.___Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.
