She had been feeling so great that she hadn\u2019t felt the need to bring her husband along to her 20-week scan in late November of last year, a few weeks after they publicly announced the pregnancy.But as the scan went on, St.Michel, who is a chiropractor, started to suspect that her fetus\u2019s arms looked a little off. The technician left the room, promising to return with the office\u2019s fetal medicine specialist.Anti-choice states aren\u2019t satisfied. Now they want to punish traveling for abortions | Moira DoneganRead moreThen St.Michel waited. And waited. She took a look at the fetus\u2019s vitals, still displayed on the screen, and many of the measurements were below 1%. St.Michel started to get worried.Around 20 minutes later, the fetal medicine specialist walked in, along with someone else. The specialist introduced herself, and then told St.Michel that her colleague was a genetic counselor.That\u2019s when St.Michel knew something was very, very wrong.The providers recommended that St.Michel call her husband to come to the appointment. After he arrived, they delivered the news: the couple\u2019s fetus had multiple severe genetic and developmental conditions affecting multiple organ systems. If the fetus survived to birth, the baby would immediately need palliative care.St.Michel could consult more specialists, continue the pregnancy \u2013 a decision that, she later learned, could threaten her health \u2013 or get an abortion. But she could not get the abortion in the  state; the procedure is banned in almost all circumstances in Idaho.\u201cBasically, all they could do was hand us a sheet of paper with abortion clinics in nearby states,\u201d St.Michel told the Guardian in an interview, as she started to cry.St.Michel is one of four women who, on Tuesday, sued Idaho in an attempt to clarify the state\u2019s abortion ban and allow doctors to perform abortions in cases like hers. Two doctors and the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians have joined the lawsuit, which was brought on the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf by the Center for Reproductive Rights.\u201cIdaho\u2019s abortion bans have sown confusion, fear, and chaos among the medical community, resulting in grave harms to pregnant patients whose health and safety hang in the balance across the state,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cWhile Idaho\u2019s abortion bans purport to contain \u2018medical exceptions,\u2019 these so-called exceptions simply do not function as such in practice.\u201dSince the overturning of Roe v Wade allowed abortion bans across the country to take effect, doctors in Idaho and other states have said that the bans\u2019 so-called \u201cmedical exceptions\u201d are worded in opaque, non-medical language that they find impossible to interpret. These exceptions, they say, have forced them to merely watch until patients get sick enough that doctors can legally help.Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights also filed legal actions on Tuesday in Tennessee and Oklahoma, which have enacted near-total abortion bans, demanding specificity on how abortions should be handled in medical emergencies. The center has previously sued over the issue in Texas; a judge in that case ruled in favor of the women denied care, but that decision has been paused while the case makes its way to the Texas supreme court.Idaho has one of the most \u201cextreme\u201d abortion bans in the country, Marc Hearron, the center\u2019s senior counsel, said on a press call on Tuesday. While some states allow abortions when people\u2019s health may be at risk, Idaho does not. Under its near-total ban, abortions can only be performed when someone\u2019s life is threatened.Doctors have started to flee Idaho in droves, and the state could soon find itself a pregnancy care desert. At least 13 reproductive health specialists and four fetal medicine specialists have stopped practicing in Idaho, Dr Emily Corrigan, one of the Idaho doctors involved in the lawsuit, wrote in a June article for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Two rural labor and delivery units have also closed.\u201cOur medical community here in Idaho is experiencing catastrophic loss that is going to take decades to fix \u2013 once we get these laws improved. We\u2019re still in a terrible downward spiral right now,\u201d Corrigan told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI have hope that the legislature will improve the law. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. But I have to ask myself every single day if it\u2019s worth it to stay here.\u201dAfter she got the news about the fetus, St.Michel called out of work for the rest of the week, she told the Guardian. She supports abortion rights, but hadn\u2019t thought she would ever need an abortion.Still, she decided she wanted one.\u201cAt that point, I was feeling baby movement, fetal movement,\u201d St.Michel said. \u201cIt was really difficult to think of continuing on and trying to pretend like normal life was happening for us.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She and her husband brought their toddler daughter with them.While the providers at the clinic were kind, St.Michel felt like she had been forced to suffer alone \u2013 her husband couldn\u2019t come inside, and her care team was back in Idaho. During the appointment, she clutched a grainy ultrasound photo of her fetus, she recalled. It is the only photo she has.Among booking flights, a hotel room and a rental car, and the two-day procedure itself, St.Michel estimates that she and her husband spent between $3,500 and $4,000 ending her pregnancy.\u201cI\u2019m so, so grateful to them, to the clinic and how much compassion they showed me. But it still wasn\u2019t fair,\u201d she said: \u201cThat I had to be in that room by myself grieving for the loss of a pregnancy that we wanted so badly.\u201dOnce they returned to Idaho, St.Michel told many people only that her family had experienced \u201ca loss\u201d.But months later, she no longer feels like she should keep what happened a secret.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a shameful thing that we did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt almost feels liberating to share the truth, to share our experience, because I do want people to know how these laws are affecting women across the country.\u201dView image in fullscreenSt.Michel with her husband and child. Photograph: Courtesy of Jillaine StMichelAfter the abortion, St.Michel and her husband debated whether to try for another baby. St.Michel did get pregnant again, and is due in January 2024, but the experience of being pregnant again is nerve-racking.\u201cWhat if something happens again? What if I\u2019m put in this situation again?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWhat if this time is worse and my life is at more imminent danger? Where does that leave us?\u201dSt.Michel and her husband have weighed leaving the state. They love living in Idaho, but she can\u2019t ignore the burgeoning political climate in the Republican-dominated state. She wants to give her daughter \u201ca more compassionate upbringing\u201d and she\u2019s not sure if life in Idaho can provide that.St.Michel wears a diamond necklace every day, because diamond is the birthstone for April \u2013 which would have been her due date. St.Michel\u2019s daughter is too young to understand what happened, she said, but she sometimes picks up the necklace and asks about the fetus that would have been her sibling.\u201cHopefully, when she\u2019s of age to comprehend some of this, things will be different here. Hopefully, this little case will be a thing of the past and I\u2019ll be able to say, \u2018Because of what happened, we were able to make changes for the better in this state,\u2019\u201d St.Michel said of her daughter. \u201cI hope someday she\u2019s proud of me for that.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionIdahoReproductive rightsRoe v WadeHealthWomenfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
