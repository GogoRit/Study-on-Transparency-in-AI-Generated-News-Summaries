(03-26-22) \u2013\u00a0TODAY, Students for Life Action / Students for Life of America President\u00a0Kristan Hawkins\u00a0will speak to participants in the\u00a02022 Philadelphia March for Life. Hawkins will focus her remarks on the strategy for the Post-Roe\u00a0America, the critical importance of the upcoming Pennsylvania gubernatorial race, and ongoing efforts to stop barbaric, taxpayer-funded research on Pennsylvania children.\n\n\u201cRoe v. Wade\u00a0turned 49, said Hawkins, \u201cbut we\u00a0won\u2019t see it turn 50\u00a0as it is.\u201d She continued: \u201cStudents for Life of America was founded as a Post-Roe\u00a0organization, ready to protect life in law and in service in all 50 states. We\u2019ve got a post-Roe plan, and we\u2019re training the next generation of Pro-Life leaders to ensure that the children who will be born will have all our support.\u201d\nPennsylvania is home to some of the most urgent battles for life. Among these is the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s\u00a0barbaric human experimentation\u00a0on children killed in abortions. These experiments,\u00a0funded by taxpayers, include scalping 5-month-old aborted babies and grafting their scalps on the backs of lab rats to see whether the rats could grow human hair.\nPennsylvania is\u00a0also\u00a0a key battleground state in the upcoming Midterm elections.\u00a0In Pennsylvania,\u00a0a\u00a0Senate seat\u00a0and possibly the governorship could flip from pro-abortion Democrat to pro-life Republican hands.\u00a0In 2019, young pro-life advocates were accosted and threatened with doxing by Brian Sims, a state representative. Sims has since launched a bid for Lieutenant Governor of the state \u2014 a role in which his discriminatory and dangerous views would affect even more victims.\n\nOn Monday, Hawkins will travel to Montana where she will deliver an address entitled\u00a0No Woman Stands Alone In A Post-Roe\u00a0America\u00a0at Rocky Mountain College, an event sponsored by Young America\u2019s Foundation.\nThe Rally Will Take place at Noon at the end of the March route:\nIndependence Mall Visitors Center\n599 Market StreetPhiladelphia, PA 19106\nLearn more about Kristan Hawkins\u00a0HEREMore information on the 2022 Philadelphia March for Life\u00a0HERE\nFor interviews, contact Lauren Enriquez at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\n\u201330\u2013\u202f\u202f\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages.
