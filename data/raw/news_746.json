Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\nSome Wisconsin voters will have a chance to offer their views on the state\u2019s 1849 ban on abortions, as several cities are putting the question to an advisory referendum this fall.On Tuesday, the Racine City Council unanimously approved a resolution to put the referendum on the ballot this fall. It will ask voters if they think Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban, which makes the procedure a felony in most cases, should be repealed. Dane County previously approved a referendum in July. And on Thursday night, the La Crosse County Board of Supervisors will vote to put a similar question on a referendum.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin adopted statutes in 1849 and 1858 banning doctors from performing abortions unless the pregnant person\u2019s life is in danger. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 invalidated the ban. But the Court\u2019s decision in June to reverse Roe put Wisconsin\u2019s 19th century ban back into effect.Racine City Council member Natalia Taft proposed the idea for the referendum in Racine. She said she\u2019s heard support for it from many residents there. \u201cI am pretty confident that the majority of people in Racine, just like the majority of folks in Wisconsin, just like the majority of folks in this country, believe that people need to have access to these services,\u201d Taft said. In a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday, 55 percent of respondents said they were very concerned about abortion policy; only 8 percent said they were not concerned. Taft said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d following the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June. \u201cI just felt like I got punched in the gut. I felt violated,\u201d she said. She quickly helped organize a rally and protest in Racine following the news, after she realized many residents were outraged at the decision. \u201cI was both sad and encouraged by the number of people that showed up to that rally that were new, that I\u2019d never seen at any sort of rallies or political events before,\u201d she said.Taft views the move as a way to show the state Legislature how local voters feel about the issue. After the SCOTUS decision was released, and at the direction of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court seeking to block the state\u2019s 173-year-old ban on abortions. \u201cIn the meantime, unfortunately in Wisconsin, we have to do this community by community to be heard,\u201d Taft said about the referendum. Racine\u2019s referendum, which is non-binding, will read: \u201cShould Wisconsin Statutes section 940.04, which bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy without exception for rape, incest, or health of the patient, be repealed to ensure legal access to abortion care?\u201d Voters can vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201dEvers sent a statement to Wisconsin Public Radio Wednesday after learning about the referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the vast majority of Wisconsinites support access to safe and legal abortion and believe that people should have the freedom to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions without interference from politicians,\u201d Evers said. \u201cEspecially on an issue as important as this one, folks in every community deserve the chance to make their voices heard and elected officials have a duty to listen.\u201dVoters in Dane County will see a similar referendum on their ballot this fall. La Crosse County Board chair Monica Kruse proposed the idea to the board. She hopes it\u2019ll pass during a board meeting Thursday night.She\u2019s encouraged that Racine and Dane County officials took similar moves.\u201cI think there\u2019s strength in numbers,\u201d Kruse said. \u201cWhen there are many voices asking for a change, I think that\u2019s more effective than if there\u2019s just a few, so I thought it was important for us to join this fight.\u201dA referendum in Milwaukee County will not be on the ballot after the measure failed to receive enough votes from the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors. Two weeks ago, voters in Kansas rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have said there was no right to an abortion in the state. Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Organization.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nOpponents and supporters of abortion access testify against 14-week ban \n\n \n\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris voices support for abortion access at Wisconsin visit \n\n \n\n\n\nGOP bill would restrict abortions after 14 weeks \n\n \n\n\n\nIn victory for abortion rights, Dane County judge rules 19th century law does not ban abortions in Wisconsin \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
