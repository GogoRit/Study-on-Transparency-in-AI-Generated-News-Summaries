(CNS photo/David Maung)Why not love them both?\n November 3, 2022By Richard Doerflinger Catholic News Service\n\nFiled Under: Commentary, Feature, Respect Life\n\n\n\u201cWhy not love them both?\u201d has been a message of the pro-life movement for many years, expressing a commitment to both the unborn child and his or her mother who may be considering abortion.\nFor decades the movement has put its money where its mouth is, by sponsoring and funding thousands of volunteer-staffed pregnancy aid centers offering free pregnancy tests, baby clothes, access to prenatal care and social services, and other support.\nNow that the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision has reopened a fierce national debate on abortion, much more is needed. Pro-life advocates are urging legislators to expand financial and social support for pregnant and parenting women and their families.\nLeading the way is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, whose \u201cWalking with Moms in Need\u201d project for many months has called on all parishes to assess and improve local pregnancy assistance.\nThe conference, which supported the original Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, has stepped up its call for this program to include paid leave.\nEven before Dobbs the bishops had endorsed expanding the child tax credit and making it refundable for lower-income families and passing a Pregnant Workers Fairness Act requiring reasonable accommodations for employees while they are pregnant.\nOn Oct. 26, the chairmen of four USCCB committees wrote to Congress to promote what St. John Paul II called \u201cradical solidarity\u201d with mothers, their born and unborn children, and families. Their recommendations include these measures and many others, including elimination of the \u201cmarriage penalty\u201d in the tax code.\nOther pro-life leaders have not been idle.\nThe University of Notre Dame\u2019s de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture has spearheaded a \u201cWomen and Children First Initiative\u201d to research and promote the most effective ways to assist pregnant and parenting women in need.\nIn Washington, the Ethics and Public Policy Center has issued a statement, \u201cEnvisioning a Pro-Family Policy Agenda,\u201d that dovetails with much of what the bishops advocate. Authored by a dozen experts in law and policy, it has been endorsed by dozens more.\nAnother group has issued a \u201cJoint Statement on building a post-Roe future\u201d with similar goals.\nThe Ethics and Public Policy Center is commonly associated with conservative politics, while the second statement was co-authored by some seen as more liberal, such as professor Charles Camosy.\nBut their proposals overlap extensively with each other and with the bishops\u2019 goals. The authors realize that these goals are easier to state as general concepts than to turn into legislative language. (Full disclosure: I\u2019ve endorsed both statements.)\nThe greatest challenge of all, however, will be to bring these proposals into a political climate in which demonizing one\u2019s political opponents is a virtue and bipartisanship is seen as betrayal.\nAmong the legislative goals, for example, is improved support for pro-life pregnancy aid centers. But some abortion activists have vandalized or tried to destroy these centers \u2014 and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has declared that \u201cwe need to shut them down all around the country.\u201d\nPresident Biden\u2019s recent statement that promoting abortion will be his first priority if his party takes full control of the Senate included not a word about supporting other options for pregnant women.\nYet those options will be essential in states restricting abortion, so women will know where they can find help. And they will be essential in states promoting abortion, so these women won\u2019t feel social and economic pressure toward thinking that abortion is their only choice.\nOne advantage of divided government is that it may get politicians of both parties to finally sit down and talk about this.\n\nDoerflinger worked for 36 years in the Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
