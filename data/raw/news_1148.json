Wade is gone, here's what's legal and what's not C. A. BridgesTallahassee DemocratUPDATE: FDA rules abortion pills may be dispensed in pharmaciesOn Friday, June 24, 2022,\u00a0the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that constitutionally established the right to abortion.That passed abortion laws to the states, where Republican lawmakers quickly began to ban abortion in\u00a0about half of them\u00a0while some Democratic-led states worked to reinforce protections\u00a0for the procedure. Access to abortion, in other words, now depends almost entirely on where you live.\u00a0What does that mean to Floridians?In April of that year, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state's most restrictive abortion regulations since Roe v. Wade, banning nearly all abortions in\u00a0Florida after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest.The law went into effect July 1, was briefly stopped by a Leon County judge who called it a likely violation of the state constitution\u2019s\u00a0right to privacy., and then went back into effect when the state appealed.Here's what the new law means for pregnant people in Florida.'Dream bigger':How weekend marches keep advocates' fight for Roe v. Wade alive on 50th anniversaryEnforcement:Online data, medical records could be used to put women in jail under new abortion lawsBlocked, appealed:Florida appeals judge's order to block abortion law, leaving in place new 15-week lawWhat does overturning Roe v. Wade mean?Previously Florida's new abortion law\u00a0may have faced a constitutional challenge since it was more restrictive than\u00a0Roe v. Wade. That is no longer the case.What does Florida's abortion ban do?As of July 1, the \"Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality\" law (HB 5) bans all abortions at 15 weeks and later. The only exceptions are if carrying the pregnancy to term would result in serious injury or death for the mother or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.\u00a0Two physicians must certify, in writing, that one of those conditions warrants the procedure. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.The new law redefines\u00a0\"gestation\" from \"between fertilization and birth\" to \"as calculated from the first day of the pregnant woman's last menstrual period.\"15-week abortion ban:Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signs Mississippi-style abortion ban into law24-hour waiting period:After 7-year legal battle, Leon County judge signs off on Florida abortion waiting periodHow many months are 15 weeks?Fifteen weeks comes out to three months and three weeks.A full-term\u00a0pregnancy is considered to be 39-40 weeks.'A death of a thousand cuts':\u00a0Women born before abortion was legalized are now organizing against a possible overturn of Roe v. WadeIn case you missed it:Abortion rights activists look to VP Kamala Harris for help in midterm election fightCloser look:Graphics show consequences of overturning Roe v. WadeDoes the Florida abortion bill\u00a0make exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking or mental health?No.\u00a0Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate defeated amendments that would have made\u00a0exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and mental health.\u00a0\"After 15 weeks, that is a child. And so the argument is, should you kill a baby after 15 weeks because it was (conceived) under certain circumstances?\" Senate President Wilton Simpson said.Abortion bill amendments blocked:Despite attempts to block it, Florida Senate prepares abortion ban for final vote this weekDoes Florida have a waiting period for abortions?Yes. As\u00a0of April the state requires anyone seeking an abortion wait\u00a024 hours after an initial doctor\u2019s visit before returning to undergo the procedure.Waiting period:After 7 year legal battle, Leon County judge signs off on Florida abortion waiting periodCan minors get an abortion in Florida?Florida required minors seeking an abortion to\u00a0notify at least one parent 48 hours before an abortion and obtain consent from a parent or approval from a judge through a legal mechanism known as judicial bypass.What happens to doctors who perform an abortion after 15 weeks?If a physician violates\u00a0the ban, they would be\u00a0guilty of a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\u00a0If I get\u00a0an abortion after 15 weeks will I be charged with murder?Unlike Georgia's abortion laws, Florida's does not expressly define a fetus as a human being and there are currently no listed penalties for the person getting the abortion. The state's existing laws only penalize\u00a0the doctor(s) performing it or anyone actively participating in the procedure.\u00a0If I'm\u00a0pregnant in Florida and need an abortion after 15 weeks, what do I do?If your pregnancy threatens your life or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, or if the fetus has not achieved viability and has a fatal abnormality, you still can get an abortion but you would need to get two physicians to certify that in writing first.\u00a0Otherwise, you would need to travel out of state, and you may need to drive a while. Like Texas, Georgia bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually about six weeks, often before some people even know they're pregnant.Florida's laws still are more lenient than other states, including the ones that border us.\u201cAs mind-boggling as it sounds, even with the 15-week restriction, we will be seen as a haven state,\u201d said Alexandra Mandado, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida.Many states with newly-restrictive laws \u2014 and states with bills ready to go\u00a0\u2014 are expected to increase restrictions or ban abortion outright now that the Supreme Court decision has come down.Which states have banned abortion\u00a0or made it illegal?There are 44 states with some ban on abortions after a certain point in a pregnancy, according to The Guttmacher Institute, an organization that works to study, educate, and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.Twelve states \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennesee, Texas, and West Virginia \u2014ban abortions entirely.Georgia bans them at 6 weeks.Two states, Florida and Arizona, ban them at 15 weeks.North Carolina bans them at 20 weeks.Nine states, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin, ban abortions at 22 weeks.Nevada, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania ban them at 24 weeks.14 states \u2014 California. Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, MInnesota, Montana, New York, Rhode Island, Washington and Wyoming \u2014 ban abortions at the point of viability.Virginia bans abortion at the beginning of the third trimeser of pregnancy, 25 weeks.Many of these states are currently attempting to further restrict abortion or already have new laws on the books that have been blocked or contested in courts.Are abortion pills still legal in Florida?Sort of. In 2021 the Food and Drug Administration permanently removed a key restriction\u00a0on medication used to terminate pregnancies, allowing so-called \"abortion pills\" to be available by mail and prescribed through\u00a0telehealth medical consultations due to pandemic restrictions, and in January of this year they announced that they could be dispensed in some pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens.\u00a0The U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills even in states that have banned or\u00a0restricted abortion access, the Department of Justice announced, since senders cannot know if the recipient will us them illegally.But Florida law requires the physical presence of a doctor for the\u00a0abortion process, which includes\u00a0talking to the patient 24 hours before the procedure, so telehealth consultations are not permitted and other abortion restrictions apply. Medical abortions must be performed within the first 11 weeks of pregnancy, an even tighter deadline than the state's.The abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, also must be prescribed, although people in states where telehealth abortions are banned have started driving over the border to states where they are not, as that can be considerably cheaper than driving to a possibly-far-off and overbooked clinic.\u00a0The day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, U.S.\u00a0Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department will protect providers and anyone seeking abortions in states where it is legal.\u00a0In particular, Garland said the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of mifepristone for medical\u00a0abortions.Medical abortion Qu0026A:Are abortion pills safe? Can I get out-of-state prescription? Your questions, answeredMore:Justice Department clears Postal Service to deliver abortion pills even in restrictive statesWhere can I find an abortion clinic near me?You can find a list of abortion clinics and health centers that perform abortions at Planned Parenthood. You also can find clinics through\u00a0Florida\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration's online facility locator by picking \u201cAbortion clinic\u201d in the \u201cFacility/Provider Type\u201d field.There are currently 53 clinics in Florida spread across the following counties: Alachua, Broward, Collier, Duval, Escambia, Hillsborough, Lee, Leon, Miami-Dade, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, Seminole and St. Lucie. A majority of counties do not have an abortion clinic.When does the new Florida\u00a0abortion law take effect?The law took effect July 1, 2022.The 15-week ban is facing two lawsuits, one from a group of Planned Parenthood affiliates and independent providers, and another from a Palm Beach County synagogue. Both challenges seek to block the ban from going into effect and charge that it violates the state constitution\u2019s privacy amendment.What other restrictions on abortion does Florida have?Along with the restricted time period, abortion law\u00a0in Florida currently requires that 24 hours before an abortion can occur, the physician performing it or a referring physician must, while physically in the same room, inform the patient of the physical risks of both getting an abortion and carrying the pregnancy to term and\u00a0the probable\u00a0gestational age of the fetus as determined by mandatory ultrasound.The physician must also provide state-directed counseling materials. The patient may refuse to look at the ultrasound.How many abortions are done in Florida?There were 79,648 abortions performed in 2021\u00a0in Florida, of which 59,252 (74%) were listed as elective, according to data from the\u00a0state Agency for Health Care Administration. About 75,000 of them occurred\u00a0in the first trimester, or the first 12 to 13 weeks of pregnancy, compared with 4,850 in the second, according to state data.State data shows 16,822 abortions were done because of social or economic reasons and 1,503 abortions were\u00a0for the psychological health of the mother. Another 1,060 abortions were for the health of the mother yet not for life-endangering reasons, the data shows.There were 757 abortions due to \u201cserious fetal genetic defect, deformity or abnormality,\u201d another 119 abortions were performed because of a life-endangering condition to the mother,\u00a0eight abortions were performed because of incest and 118 were done because of rape.Of the abortions because of serious genetic defect or some other abnormality, the state data shows 64% of them, or 484 abortions, were done in the second trimester. The second trimester starts at week 13 and ends at week 26, according to the Mayo Clinic.Do Florida doctors support the new abortion ban?Some do, many don't.\u00a0Roughly 700 physicians in Florida signed an open letter to the state Legislature opposing the 15-week abortion ban, calling it an \u201calarming attempt to improperly insert politics into the patient-clinician relationship\u201d and said the consequences for Floridians would be dire.\u201cThis legislation is bad medicine and bad policy, and we urge you to reject it for numerous reasons,\u201d the letter states.Do Florida voters support the new abortion ban?According to a poll by the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Laboratory, 55 percent of voters surveyed opposed the abortion bill. Opposition grew to 60 percent when people were told it didn\u2019t make exceptions for victims of rape or incest.Thirty-four percent of the people surveyed supported the idea, according to a\u00a0release from UNF.Gallup Poll:Most Americans identify as pro-choice and believe abortion is 'morally acceptable'UNF poll:Most voters don't back abortion ban, 'Don't Say Gay' bills in Florida LegislatureWill Florida pass more restrictive abortion laws?Quite possibly.Gov. DeSantis has not committed to whether he supports the so-called\"heartbeat\" abortion bill, so named because of the belief that a detectable human heartbeat can be heard at that point. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many pregnant people realize they are pregnant.But he has said that he wants to \"sign great life legislation,\u201d\u00a0and he has previously said he wants to \"expand pro-life protections.\"Contributors: Liz Freeman, Naples Daily News; James Call, Florida Capital Bureau; Kathryn Varn, Gannett/USA Today Network - Florida\u00a0C.
