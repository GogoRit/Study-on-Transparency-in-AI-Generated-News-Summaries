The 33-year-old man is reportedly on the run.Paraguay: indigenous girl's murder fires public outrage at child sexual abuseRead moreBrazil\u2019s highly restrictive abortion laws \u2013 largely written in 1940 \u2013 permit terminations in cases of rape, when the mother\u2019s life is at risk and when the birth defect anencephaly is detected.Yet despite this, the child was forced to fly more than 900 miles to the north-eastern city of Recife for the procedure, following a highly politicized legal battle which saw one hospital in the girl\u2019s home state refuse to treat her.When the girl reached the hospital where the termination was to be performed on Sunday afternoon, its entrance had been occupied by far-right anti-abortion activists and politicians who were filmed hurling abuse at hospital staff and the child, and trying to stop them entering.\u201cWhen you see a 10-year-old girl being criminalized for terminating a pregnancy resulting from rape and because her life is in danger, it really gives you a sense of how religious fundamentalism is advancing in our country,\u201d said Elisa An\u00edbal, a Recife-based feminist campaigner.The activists appear to have discovered the hospital\u2019s location, which was kept secret for security reasons, from a hardcore supporter of Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.In an online video, which was later deleted but the Guardian has seen, the pro-Bolsonaro extremist Sara Giromini names the girl and falsely claims authorities had kidnapped her and chartered a private jet to transport her to the termination.\u201cThis is an extremely serious human rights violation!\u201d claims Giromini, brandishing a plastic doll she alleged was the size of the fetus.It\u2019s just unbelievable this is happening in Brazil, that part of the population really believes abortion is worse than rapePaula VianaUntil last year Giromini worked for Bolsonaro\u2019s minister for women, family and human rights, a conservative evangelical pastor called Damares Alves. The two women appear together in a widely circulated campaign video in which Alves boasts: \u201cSara is more than my comrade in this struggle to defend life and the family \u2013 Sara is like my daughter.\u201dPaula Viana, a pro-choice activist who escorted the girl from Recife\u2019s airport to the hospital, said she had been warned anti-abortion activists lay in wait as they drove there in a taxi. They stopped the car, hid the girl in its boot and smuggled her into the building through a side-door.\u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable this is happening in Brazil, that part of the population really believes abortion is worse than rape,\u201d said Viana from the women\u2019s rights group Curumim. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t surprised because we know we have a president who is supportive of these shows of hatred.\u201dAs word of the anti-abortion ambush spread among Recife\u2019s feminist community, activists flocked to the hospital to defend the girl\u2019s right to a termination she had requested.\u201cWe realized we needed reinforcements,\u201d said An\u00edbal, from the F\u00f3rum de Mulheres de Pernambuco group, who summoned supporters on social media.\u201cBy the end of the day there were more than 150 people there supporting that girl \u2026 women, trans people, black people, young people \u2026 and when we looked at the other group they were mostly old white men in suits, with just few women among them.\u201dFootage that went viral on social media showed the women challenging the fanatics with a call-and-response battle cry that recalled the Chilean anti-rape anthem A Rapist in Your Path.\u201cThis child fell pregnant after being raped and these fundamentalists are here to say that her life doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the women chanted. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say that our lives do matter.\u201dDebora Diniz, a reproductive rights campaigner who has championed the girl\u2019s cause, said she had been moved by the \u201cbeautiful\u201d rally.Diniz, who lives in exile because of death threats, called Sunday\u2019s standoff the perfect portrait of Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil: a \u201churricane of hatred\u201d colliding with determined, non-violent feminist resistance.Gabriela Rondon, a lawyer from the pro-choice group Anis, said the extremists\u2019 widely condemned behaviour had inadvertently boosted the debate about decriminalizing and legalizing abortion.\u201cBrazil\u2019s laws are clearly inadequate and put millions of women at risk. According to our figures half a million women must subject themselves to illegal abortions each year,\u201d Rondon said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost one woman per minute.\u201dDespite the horrific circumstances, Rondon said Sunday\u2019s demonstration \u201cbrought us real encouragement\u201d. \u201cA crowd of women protecting a young girl \u2013 it gives us such great hope of change.\u201dViana said the girl had said she was desperate to get back to playing football. \u201cShe is very strong \u2013 but she is just a child \u2026 She will need long-term psychological support. She understands everything that she is going through.\u201dIn the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at www.rainn.org. In the UK, Supportline can be reached at 01708 765200.
