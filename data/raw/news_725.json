Whitmer wants to cheat,\" the group said in a tweet. \"The question is if the (Michigan) Supreme Court wants to torch their credibility as well. They should think about how these precedents they want to set will be used in the future by other officials.\"Nessel noted it was possible a court could order her to set up a conflict law for the defense of the state's law or, more likely, that the GOP-led Legislature would intervene to defend the law.\u00a0\"They move to intervene even in cases where we are defending the law,\" Nessel said. \"I would suspect that even if I did erect a conflict law, they would try to intervene in the matter.\u201dSenate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, on Thursday criticized Nessel's decision.\u00a0\"The attorney general shouldn\u2019t have run for office if she didn\u2019t want to do the job,\" Shirkey said in a statement. \"The Senate will explore all of our options if she won\u2019t fulfill her obligations.\u201dBoth Planned Parenthood of Michigan and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer filed suits Thursday seeking to overturn the state's 1931 ban on abortions, seeking court orders opining that the state constitution already included the right to abortion and prohibiting prosecutors from enforcing the law should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.\u00a0More:\u00a0Whitmer, Planned Parenthood file separate suits to overturn Michigan's 1931 abortion banNessel prefaced her decision not to defend against the Planned Parenthood case in a press call Thursday by relating the story of an abortion she had in 2002. She was pregnant with triplets through artificial reproductive technology when physicians advised her to abort one in a bid to save the lives of the other two, whom she later delivered.\u00a0\"I didn't work as hard as I did to become pregnant only to have an abortion, but like most people I was faced with what felt like an impossible and incredibly difficult decision,\" Nessel said. \"Because of that procedure, it allowed me to carry those other two babies long enough for them to be born alive.\"The attorney general said she was unaware of other Michigan attorney generals refusing to defend a state law, including through a conflict wall. But she said it has occurred in other states during the same sex marriage debate as attorneys general refused to enforce state bans on gay marriage.Nessel also is avoiding involvement with Whitmer's lawsuit filed Thursday in circuit court seeking to overturn the state's abortion ban. Others from her office filed the suit on behalf of Nessel, but the attorney general is not involved.\u00a0Nessel, a Democrat, is running for re-election. Three Republicans are seeking to become her challenger at an April 23 state nominating convention, including former House Speaker Tom Leonard of DeWitt, who lost to Nessel by less than 3 percentage points in 2018.eleblanc@detroitnews.com\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySite MapResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper"
