Credit: Vatican Media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Courtney Mares\nVatican City, 25 March, 2020 / 12:00 pm (ACI Africa).\nPope Francis said Wednesday that the Church\u2019s pro-life message is more relevant than ever as the world faces the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cThe attacks on the dignity and life of people unfortunately continue even in our era \u2026 We are faced with new threats and new slavery, and legislation is not always to protect the weakest and most vulnerable human life,\u201d Pope Francis said March 25.\n\u201cThe message of the encyclical Evangelium Vitae is therefore more relevant than ever,\u201d the pope said in his livestreamed Wednesday audience.\nThis year\u2019s Solemnity of the Annunciation marks the 25th anniversary of the encyclical Evangelium Vitae promulgated by St. John Paul II on the value and inviolability of human life.\nPope Francis said that the coronavirus pandemic makes the encyclical's message on the defense of all human life more urgent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, we find ourselves relaunching this teaching in the context of a pandemic that threatens human life and the world economy. A situation that makes the words with which the encyclical begins even more demanding,\u201d the pope said.\nPope Francis then quoted the first line of the 1995 encyclical: \u201cThe Gospel of life is at the heart of Jesus' message. Welcomed by the Church every day with love, it must be announced with courageous fidelity as good news to men of all ages and cultures.\"\nPope Francis said: \u201cThe life we \u200b\u200bare called to promote and defend is not an abstract concept, but always manifests itself in a person in flesh and blood: a newly conceived child, a poor marginalized person, a sick person alone and discouraged or in a terminal state, one who has lost his job or is unable to find it, a rejected or ghettoized migrant.\"\nThe pope explained that the Catholic Church has a particular responsibility to ensure the protection of every individual human life, which in itself is unrepeatable and of inestimable value.\n\u201cThe defense of life for the Church is not an ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery human being is called by God to enjoy the fullness of life; and being entrusted to the maternal concern of the Church, every threat to dignity and human life cannot fail to affect its heart.\u201d\n\nMore in Vatican\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVatican Observatory publishes new method to better understand the Big Bang theory\nRead the article\n\n\n\n\n \u201cBeyond emergencies, such as the one we are experiencing, it is a question of acting on a cultural and educational level to transmit to future generations the attitude of solidarity,\u201d he said.\nIn his televised Wednesday audience delivered from the library of the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Palace, Pope Francis praised the \u201csilent testimony\u201d of many people who are witnesses to this \u201cGospel of Life\u201d by serving the sick, the elderly, and those who are lonely and poor.\nHe said that their lives mirror the example given by the Blessed Virgin Mary, who went in haste to help her cousin Elizabeth after the Annunciation.\n\u201cDear brothers and sisters, every human life, unique and unrepeatable, valid in itself, constitutes an inestimable value. This must always be announced again, with the courage of the word and the courage of actions,\u201d the pope said.\n\u201cTherefore, with St. John Paul II, who wrote this encyclical, with him I reaffirm with renewed conviction the appeal he made to all twenty-five years ago: \u2018Respect, defend, love and serve life, every life, every human life! Only on this path will you find justice, development, freedom, peace and happiness,\u2019\u201d Pope Francis said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nSt. John Paul II, \nPro-life, \nPope Francis, \nEvangelium Vitae, \nCOVID-19, \nCoronavirus, \nCatholic News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney Mares is a Rome Correspondent for Catholic News Agency.
