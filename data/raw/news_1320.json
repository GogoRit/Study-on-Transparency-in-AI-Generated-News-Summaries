This court ruling will provide significant relief to Ohio patients and clinics,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Ohio, the ACLU and other clinics across the state said in a statement Friday afternoon.\nJenkins ruled against the state, who had previously argued that the \u201cstatus quo\u201d in Ohio was the six-week abortion law, since the clinics had not filed the lawsuit in Hamilton County court until two months after the law was implemented.\nThe two-month waiting period came as the Ohio Supreme Court did not move forward with a lawsuit the clinics had filed in its court. Because of that, the groups asked the state\u2019s highest court to dismiss the lawsuit, so it could be moved to the current venue in southwest Ohio.\nIn ruling against the state on Friday, Jenkins considered testimony from multiple doctors on both sides of the case, and looked directly to the federal and state constitution for answers as to whether abortion was a right.\nThough abortion is not a part of either constitution, Jenkins said the writers of both constitutions spelled out in the founding documents the ability for other rights, called \u201cunenumerated\u201d rights, to be a part of society, if not explicitly listed in the Bill of Rights.\n\u201cIt is simply wrong to state, as many do, that a right does not exist because it is not specifically listed in the constitution,\u201d Jenkins said.\nHe pointed to affidavits that had been submitted to the court by the ACLU and abortion clinics, telling stories of pregnancies that were not viable or caused patients to forgo cancer treatment, but were forced to continue because they were past the six-week gestation mark.\nHe said Ohio\u2019s constitution does not allow women to be subject to such regulations, and gives no preference to any religion of specific ideological group under \u201crights of conscience.\u201d\n\u201cOhio\u2019s constitution specifically and unambiguously recognized as fundamental the right to liberty \u2026 and the right to seek and obtain safety,\u201d Jenkins said.\nDuring the Friday hearing, a University of Maryland doctor with three decades of working with high-risk pregnancies, who also said abortion \u201cis one of the tools in my tool box\u201d as an obstetrician, argued the Ohio law strikes fear in doctors\u2019 minds as they search for legal answers, leaving patients to wait for care.\nDr. Steven Ralston focused his testimony largely on the safety of the abortion procedure, and the similarities the procedure has to other surgical methods, such as miscarriages. Ralston said abortion is \u201ca very common procedure \u2026 and it is one of the safest procedures that we have.\u201d\nIn fact, the doctor said pregnancies can present more dangers and risks than abortions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many, many more patients end up in intensive care units after having a baby, compared to women having abortions,\u201d Ralston said.\nHe said SB 23 is concerning partly because of the \u201cvague\u201d language used in the law, including a lack of clarity to when a woman\u2019s condition reaches a point to allow a legal abortion.\n\u201cThey use terms like \u2018serious\u2019 and \u2018substantial\u2019 that are not well-defined in the law,\u201d Ralston said.\nThe state brought up a retired Cedarville University biomedical ethics professor who called abortion a violation of those ethics.\nDr. Dennis Sullivan recently retired from the Christian college as a professor of pharmacy practice and director of the center for bioethics. He told the court he had not trained as an OB/GYN, did not have any board certifications in obstetrics or gynecology, and had not observed any abortions being performed.\nIn his testimony supporting the abortion law, he pointed to research he\u2019d previously done on the ethics of \u201cpersonhood,\u201d and his belief that life begins at conception. A scholarly article authored by him on \u201chuman embryo metaphysics\u201d says the idea that humans\u2019 \u201cintrinsic value\u201d begins at conception \u201cis crucial to the most prominent Christian understanding of human dignity.\u201d\nAfter hearing from various medical professionals, Jenkins said one thing was still not up for debate.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve heard today, there is not any legitimate dispute that abortion is a medical procedure\u2026and it is undoubtedly health care,\u201d the judge said.\nGoing further, he said the Ohio law was intended to \u201ceffectively eliminate\u201d abortion in Ohio.\nPreviously, the judge had issued two temporary injunctions of two weeks each.
