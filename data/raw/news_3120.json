In Utah, a new approach to the campaign is being proposed: Each parish in the Diocese of Salt Lake City is being invited to sign up for one hour of prayer with this intention. \u201cOur goal is to personally invite all churches to send delegates to peacefully gather for prayers at Planned Parenthood Metro (in Salt Lake City), the primary abortion clinic in the state of Utah, for one hour, from 11 a.m. to noon, starting on March 2 until April 10,\u201d said Michael Dovel, a member of 40 Days for Life Utah.The prayer effort is being organized by Dovel along with Deacon Greg Werking; Crystal Painter, director of the diocesan Office of Marriage and Family; and Catherine Stokes, president of the diocesan Respect for Life Commission.The plan is to have Catholics praying outside the abortion clinic from 11 to noon each day of the week, but other times could be available. Already the parishes of the Cathedral of the Madeline and St. Ambrose in Salt Lake City, St. Martin de Porres in Taylorsville, St. Thomas More in Cottonwood Heights, St. Vincent de Paul in Holladay, St. John the Baptist in Draper and Blessed Sacrament in Sandy have responded to the call and have been assigned a day for the hour of prayer, Dovel said.\u201cTo start modestly, we will fill the schedule with churches on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,\u201d he said. When those days are filled, \u201cwe will add Tuesdays and Thursdays, followed by Saturday and Sunday.\u201d40 Days for Life has created a worship aid with Psalm-based pro-life prayers for people to use if they choose. With the prayer aid, the prayer leader recites a portion of a Psalm or prayer, and the group answers \u201cwith a set response following a \u2018call and response\u2019 idea found in many Psalms,\u201d Dovel said.The power of prayer is effective, Painter said. \u201cWhen people are outside abortion clinics praying \u2026 the numbers of abortions go down\u201d through God\u2019s intercession, she said. \u201cEven people who go to those clinics, when they get to see other people really caring for them, praying for them, that opens up their hearts.\u201dOne of the many things that she likes about the 40 Days for Life campaign is that people feel comfortable doing it, she said, while many people are uncomfortable doing sidewalk advocacy or protesting. \u201cBut it is easy for us Catholics, who are used to praying the rosary, to be there and pray for the women and men that go to those clinics.\u201dPainter is encouraging all the people interested in joining this effort to approach their parish prolife ministry or to contact their priest about participating.The first 40 Days for Life campaign took place in 2007. Since then, according to the organization\u2019s website, it has grown into a worldwide movement with a million volunteers in 607 cities across 64 nations. Because of the movement, 20,728 lives have been saved, 229 abortion workers have quit their jobs and 114 abortion centers have closed, the website states.
