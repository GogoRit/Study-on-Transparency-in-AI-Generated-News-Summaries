The Indiana Attorney General\u2019s Office said in court filings that abortion was banned by law in Indiana as early as 1835.\nSolicitor General Thomas Fisher with the attorney general\u2019s office said the injunction will lead to the deaths of \u201cso many\u201d unborn fetuses.\nKen Falk with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana pushed back, saying the abortion ban amounts to government infringement into private lives.\nThe five justices grilled both sides, largely questioning the attorneys about their interpretations of the rights guaranteed to Hoosiers in the state constitution.\n  Indiana Solicitor General Tom Fisher speaks to reporters from outside the Indiana Superior Court in Indianapolis on Jan. 19, 2023. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)\nThe state\u2019s highest court granted a request by Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita to bypass the Indiana Court of Appeals. The court also denied the state\u2019s request to stay the preliminary injunction that is currently blocking the abortion law.\nThe court challenge up for debate was originally filed in Monroe County Circuit Court in August by the ACLU of Indiana on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center.\nA special judge in Owen County later ruled that the ban likely violates the Indiana Constitution. An injunction issued by Judge Kelsey Blake Hanlon, a Republican, halted the state\u2019s new abortion law one week after it took effect. Under the injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law stands \u2014 allowing abortions up to 20 weeks.\nThe state quickly appealed that decision and asked the Indiana Supreme Court to bypass the Court of Appeals and take the case directly.\nIt\u2019s not clear when the justices will make their ruling. Chief Justice Loretta Rush said an opinion will be issued \u201cin due course.\u201d\nThe court has numerous options. For instance, it could rule only on whether the preliminary injunction was proper and send it back to the trial court for further proceedings. Or it can move forward with ruling on the legality of the law.\u00a0\nCourtroom debate\nAddressing the justices, Fisher said Indiana\u2019s founders were \u201cwell aware\u201d of abortion when they crafted the constitution, adding that the state \u201chas always recognized the right of the embryo to life.\u201d\nBut Rush, who led most of the questioning, said she had looked at \u201cevery law\u201d that was in place at the time of the constitution\u2019s writing, and they all protected the right of the mother to make decisions to protect her own life, implying that abortion could be one of those options.\nRush asked Fisher if a total abortion ban \u2014\u00a0with no exceptions \u2014 would be acceptable under the constitution.\nFisher conceded no, saying he doubts it would be.\u00a0\n  ACLU of Indiana legal director Ken Falk (From the ACLU of Indiana Website)\nJustice Christopher M. Goff also asked Fisher why the near-total abortion ban shouldn\u2019t be placed on a referendum voters decide. Fisher rebutted that the public already decided the issue when they elected lawmakers to the General Assembly.\nGoff asked, too, why the law must force abortion clinics to shut down entirely. Fisher said they could become hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers owned by hospitals, but Goff responded that he doesn\u2019t understand why \u201cit\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d\nFisher further argued that abortion care providers want the justices to create a \u201cnovel, unindicated\u201d right in the Indiana Constitution.\nHe additionally said medical providers who are plaintiffs in the case shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sue based on the alleged rights violations of their patients. Fisher maintained \u201cit would have to be a woman who is pregnant\u201d to file such a lawsuit.\nAddressing Falk, Justice Geoffrey Slaughter pointed out that the Court usually does not allow health care providers to bring cases on behalf of their patients.\nFalk emphasized that medical providers are harmed by the law and have standing to sue, as well, in part because they could face criminal penalties under the new abortion restrictions.\nExisting Indiana law makes it a felony for a doctor to perform an illegal abortion, and under the new legislation, most abortions will be illegal.\nDoctors who perform abortions outside of an approved setting could face a Level 5 felony criminal charge \u2014 punishable by one to six years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.\nSlaughter also asked Falk how the constitution ensures a mother\u2019s right to terminate a pregnancy over the right to life of the fetus.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have never equated the life of the woman with the potentiality of life of the fetus,\u201d Falk said.\u00a0\nBan background\nThe ACLU\u2019s lawsuit argues that the abortion ban \u201cwill infringe on Hoosiers\u2019 right to privacy, violate Indiana\u2019s guarantee of equal privileges and immunities, and violate the Constitution\u2019s due course of law clause through its unconstitutionally vague language.\u201d\nThe court challenge is based on the Indiana Constitution. The Supreme Court of the United States in June ruled that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee abortion rights.\nMeanwhile, a second lawsuit, also led by the ACLU of Indiana, seeks to strike down the ban on the basis that it violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. A Marion County judge is scheduled to hear arguments in this case on Friday.\nThe Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly advanced the abortion-restricting measure during a heated, two-week special session that concluded in August.\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nThat made Indiana the first state in the nation to approve such legislation since the high court ruling that overturned Roe v.
