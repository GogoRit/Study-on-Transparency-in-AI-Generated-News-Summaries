Hathaway, Preston Lim and Mark StevensNovember 18, 2020[Editor\u2019s Note: This article is part of a\u00a0Just Security\u00a0series,\u00a0COVID and International Law. All articles in the series can be found\u00a0here.]\nCOVID-19 continues to grow at a rapid pace worldwide. Many States have struggled to contain the virus and many have failed to ensure that all individuals under their jurisdiction can live with security and dignity in the face of the threat.\nIn Israel, the government has been criticized for prematurely allowing businesses and schools to reopen after an initial lockdown. With per capita infection rates among the highest in the world, the government has had to impose a second nationwide, weeks-long lockdown. Many governments have failed to protect particularly vulnerable communities and individuals under their jurisdiction. In Libya, for instance, the pandemic has spread quickly among migrants and refugees. As Amnesty International reports, government authorities have not ensured these individuals have access to testing and treatment, and detention centers where many are held remain dangerously overcrowded. Meanwhile, Libyan officials have specifically blamed \u201cforeign nationals\u2026for the rise in crime and the spread of diseases including COVID-19.\u201d\nStates\u2019 shortcomings in protecting populations under their care from the threat of COVID-19 may violate a fundamental right in international human rights law: the right to life. This right is considered a core right that governments have a duty to protect and an obligation not to infringe.\nThis article is the first of three examining international human rights affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto. It first outlines the right to life as it is defined and protected in various human rights conventions. It then considers the scope of State obligations related to the right in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of claims that countries are culpable for the virus\u2019 impact on other States when they have failed to prevent COVID-19\u2019s spread beyond their borders, this article also evaluates the extraterritorial reach of the right to life and its application to the current pandemic.\nThe Right to Life \nThe right to life is a fundamental principle of international human rights law. Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that \u201ceveryone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.\u201d Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that \u201cevery human being has the inherent right to life\u201d which is to be \u201cprotected by law,\u201d and \u201cno one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.\u201d Further, Article 6(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that \u201cStates Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life.\u201d\nRegional human rights treaties also entrench the right to life. Article 1 of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, like Article 3 of the UDHR, affirms that \u201cevery human being has the right to life, liberty and the security of his person.\u201d Article 4(1) of the American Convention on Human Rights articulates similar language. Article 2(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) states that \u201ceveryone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\u201d Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights states that \u201chuman beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right.\u201d\nIn the ICCPR, the right to life is a non-derogable right, meaning that it cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency. The African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights has similarly held the right to life to be non-derogable. However, the right to life is not an unbounded right, as provisions of human rights conventions provide leeway for authorities to use deadly force in their pursuit of justice or security; Article 2(2) of the ECHR, for example, provides that \u201c[d]eprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary\u201d (see also Article 6(2) of the ICCPR).\nThe Right to Life During a Pandemic\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee has stressed in General Comment No. 36 that the right to life, as expressed in the ICCPR, should not be \u201cnarrowly interpreted.\u201d Accordingly, individuals are entitled \u201cto be free from acts and omissions that are intended or may be expected to cause their unnatural or premature death, as well as to enjoy a life with dignity.\u201d Critically, the Committee also suggests States Parties \u201cshould take appropriate measures to address the general conditions in society that may give rise to direct threats to life or prevent individuals from enjoying their right to life with dignity,\u201d conditions that may include \u201cthe prevalence of life-threatening diseases.\u201d It also notes that \u201c[t]he duty to protect the life of all detained individuals includes providing them with the necessary medical care and appropriately regular monitoring of their health.\u201d In Toussaint v. Canada, the Committee specifically held that Canada\u2019s exclusion of undocumented immigrants from a federal health care program violated the right to life, among other rights. The Committee found that the duty to respect the right to life \u201cextends to reasonably foreseeable threats and life-threatening situations that can result in loss of life.\u201d\nParties to adjudication in international and regional courts have invoked the right to life across a range of issue areas, including in the health care context. In Powell v. the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) wrote: \u201cit cannot be excluded that the acts and omissions of\u2026 [State] authorities in the field of health care policy may in certain circumstances engage their responsibility under the positive limb of Article 2.\u201d And in Cyprus v. Turkey, the ECtHR observed that \u201can issue may arise under Article 2 of the Convention where it is shown that the authorities of a Contracting State put an individual\u2019s life at risk through the denial of health care which they have undertaken to make available to the population generally.\u201d A State authority is obligated, the Court continued, to take \u201cappropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction.\u201d Further, in Stoyanovi v. Bulgaria, the ECtHR broadly interpreted the Convention\u2019s right to life provision as sometimes requiring the authorities to take preventive operational measures; the Court suggested that such measures are necessary in \u201cdangerous situations of specific threat to life which arise exceptionally from risks posed by\u2026 man-made or natural hazards.\u201d\nApplication in the Context of COVID-19 \nThe precise scope of the right to life as States respond to COVID-19 is far from clear. States have at least minimal obligations to protect the lives of their inhabitants through taking steps to address clear health threats to the population, such as the deadly COVID-19 virus. For instance, as noted above, the U.N. Human Rights Committee\u2019s General Comment No. 36 states that the right to life obligates ICCPR States Parties to \u201caddress\u2026life-threatening diseases.\u201d Further, as scholars such as Alessandra Spadaro point out, the General Comment articulates a \u201cdue diligence obligation\u201d for States to \u201cundertake reasonable positive measures\u2026 in response to reasonably foreseeable threats to life originating from private persons and entities.\u201d While this due diligence obligation is presented in the context of physical threats by armed groups or criminals, Spadaro suggests the duty could also entail \u201cprotecting individuals from threats to life posed by others carrying and infectious and deadly disease, such as COVID-19.\u201d\nThese readings of the ICCPR\u2019s right to life provision square neatly with other authoritative bodies\u2019 interpretation of the right to life as it appears in other instruments. For instance, as Elizabeth Stubbins Bates has explained, the ECtHR\u2019s Stoyanovi decision and other opinions of that court suggest that States Parties to the ECHR may have a positive duty to plan for pandemic response so that lives can be saved once public health emergencies arise.\nThe failure of a State to take at least minimal steps to protect its population from the spread of COVID-19 arguably violates the right to life of those who become infected and die. The precise scope of this obligation is not clear, however. It likely does not mean that States are required to establish lockdown measures or mandatory masking policies. But it likely does mean that States at least have a duty to not knowingly contribute to the spread of the virus \u2013 for instance, States should ensure first responders and health care workers have access to necessary personal protective equipment (especially masks) to protect themselves and those they serve.\nMoreover, the law suggests that the right to life may be violated in some cases by denying access to health care essential to treating those at risk of losing their lives to the pandemic. The right to life does not guarantee universal access to health care, of course. But General Comment 36 does require States to provide a minimal degree of access to health care in order to fulfill the right to life. How far these obligations extend, however, has yet to be established.\nRegardless, any life-saving COVID-19 interventions must be inclusive of all groups of patients in society and must not be discriminatory, as U.N. human rights experts have specified. For instance, when a vaccine becomes available, States will be obligated to ensure that it is available without invidious discrimination.\nStates also have a heightened responsibility to protect the right to life of those they detain. As noted above, the Human Rights Committee has concluded that the duty to protect the life of detained individuals includes providing necessary medical care and monitoring of their health. In the United States, incarcerated people are infected by COVID-19 at rates five times that of the general population, and the death rate is higher than the national rate. Given this greater level of vulnerability of incarcerated populations, and the difficulty they have protecting themselves from infection (they obviously cannot self-quarantine), States have heightened obligations to protect them. This means that incarcerated or detained persons should be provided essential protective equipment (masks) and social distancing and other measures should be put in place to limit the spread of the virus. Those who are infected should be quarantined away from the rest of the population of those detained and should be provided adequate medical care. When a vaccine is available, it should be provided to those in confined situations, particularly to those who are especially vulnerable to the virus due to comorbidities.\nThese obligations extend to detention facilities for immigrants, where these obligations have not always been met. There are reports that the United States, for example, has been careless in protecting immigration detainees from COVID. According to Eunice Cho, at the ACLU\u2019s National Prison Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has transferred people between facilities, \u201cknowing that they are positive for the coronavirus and that they are spreading COVID-19 across the country.\u201d If these reports are true, those actions arguably violate the detainees\u2019 right to life \u2013 and potentially the right to life of others exposed to the virus as a consequence, including ICE employees and their families. (A later article in this series will specifically consider States\u2019 obligations to asylum seekers and other migrants detained by the State.)\nStates\u2019 Obligations to Individuals Outside their Territories \nThere have been accusations that some governments\u2019 inadequate responses to COVID-19 have allowed the virus to spread transnationally and harm populations abroad. It is therefore worth considering whether States\u2019 right to life obligations apply outside their own borders\u2014that is, extraterritorially.\nThere is significant disagreement over the scope of extraterritorial obligations under the primary treaty that establishes the right to life\u2014the ICCPR. Article 2(1) requires a State Party to respect the rights of individuals \u201cwithin its territory and subject to its jurisdiction.\u201d The Human Rights Committee has interpreted this obligation in General Comment No. 31, stating that a State\u2019s duty to respect and ensure these rights applies to \u201cthose within the power or effective control of the forces of the State Party acting outside its territory, regardless of the circumstances in which such power or effective control was obtained.\u201d General Comment No. 36 also specifies States have an obligation to \u201censure that all activities taking place in whole or in part within their territory and in other places subject to their jurisdiction, but having a direct and reasonably foreseeable impact on the right to life of individuals outside their territory,\u2026 are consistent with\u201d ICCPR Article 6. The United States, however, has long taken the view that the ICCPR does not apply extraterritorially.\nThe ICJ recognized in its advisory opinion Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (2004) that State obligations under a number of human rights conventions, including the ICCPR, CRC, and Convention Against Torture, apply in areas beyond States\u2019 territory if they exercise jurisdiction over such areas. Based on this holding, the U.N. Human Rights Commission determined the United States\u2019 ICCPR duties (including protection of the right to life) extend to its military base and detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nRegional courts and conventions take varying approaches to the question of extraterritoriality. The European Court of Human Rights clarified in Al-Skeini v. United Kingdom (2011) that Article 1 of the ECHR obliges States Parties exercising physical control and authority in foreign territory to secure the rights and freedoms identified in the Convention for individuals subject to that control. In Coard et al v United States, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights similarly recognized that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d may \u201crefer to conduct with an extraterritorial locus where the person concerned is present in the territory of one State, but subject to the control of another State.\u201d Meanwhile, the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights does not have a provision explicitly tying duties to State jurisdiction, which some scholars have pointed out suggests that the Charter\u2019s duties may apply extraterritorially.\nExtraterritorial Application in the Context of COVID-19\nThe range of circumstances in which States may have pandemic-related extraterritorial obligations under the right to life is narrow. However, some States would have a duty to protect the lives of foreign nationals abroad from the COVID-19 threat and to refrain from \u201cacts and omissions\u201d that leave other populations susceptible to the virus. Specifically, a State Party to the ICCPR exerting effective control of or asserting authority over foreign territory or persons would, under most readings of the ICCPR, be expected to ensure that State policies do not knowingly contribute to \u201cunnatural or premature\u201d deaths during a pandemic.\nThus, administering powers of non-self-governing territories, such as the Falkland Islands, American Samoa, and French Polynesia, would likely be obliged to protect the right to life of individuals in those territories by containing the spread of COVID-19 and providing minimum adequate care to infected individuals. During armed conflict, States that occupy or exert effective control over foreign territory would also be expected to protect foreign individuals under their authority from \u201cunnatural or premature\u201d death resulting from infectious diseases (in addition to complying with duties arising from international humanitarian law).\nImage: NAIROBI, KENYA \u2013 JULY 10: A young boy walks in front of a graffitied wall spelling out the symptoms of and ways to avoid Coronavirus in Mathare informal settlement on July 10, 2020 in Nairobi, Kenya.
