She said women did not need \"to be met by lifelike medically inaccurate foetus dolls and graphic images, to be handed misleading literature, be called \"Mum\" and told they'd go to hell\".Although Ealing Council has managed to legally remove anti-abortion protesters Dr Huq says this is \"only temporary\" and will need reviewing next spring. She added that the process for implementing and defending the ban in court can cost six figure sums. \"Councils do have enough on their plate without having to find time and resources to implement such bans,\" she said. Image source, PAImage caption, Pro-choice demonstrators also gathered outside the clinicThe bill was opposed by Conservative Fiona Bruce who described the proposed law as \"dangerous... with potentially far-reaching implications\".\"Not only freedom of speech could be threatened, but also freedom of assembly, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the right to peaceably protest, the right to receive information.\"She added: \"Everyone has the right to free speech within the law - this includes the right to say things which, though lawful, others may find disturbing or upsetting.\"MPs voted to approve the bill at the first stage by 213 votes to 47, however unless it secures government support it is unlikely to become law.A Home Office spokesman said: \"The right to protest is a vital part of a democratic society, but it is completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated, and we are clear we expect the police to take action in such cases.\"There are already powers in place for police and local authorities to restrict harmful protests and the previous home secretary (Sajid Javid) asked the police to work closely with abortion services, to ensure that all those visiting these services are not subjected to harassment or intimation.\" More on this storyAppeal against abortion clinic protests ban failsPublished21 August 2019'I felt like a criminal for having an abortion'Published10 April 2018Top StoriesHong Kong passes tough security law fought by protesters for yearsPublished49 minutes agoUS-Philippines alliance is \u00e2\u0080\u0098ironclad\u00e2\u0080\u0099- BlinkenPublished7 hours agoEntire Gaza population facing acute hunger - USPublished3 hours agoFeaturesHow Temu is shaking up the world of online shoppingIs TikTok really a danger to the West?Gaza faces famine during Ramadan, the holy month of fastingBridgerton's Nicola Coughlan: Why I hate on-screen vanityWhy Gillian Anderson found it scary to play Emily MaitlisThe US just announced an asbestos ban.
