Kat Cammack Florida Rep. Kat Cammack provides a personal pro-life message in response to Biden signing an order to protect abortion on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019 Raising kids who value life at every age and stage can be possible today in a confusing world \u2014 as long as there is time and intentionality within the home, according to those who are active in the pro-life arena.    Bethany Bomberger, co-founder and executive director of The Radiance Foundation, a faith-based educational\u00a0501c3 nonprofit headquartered outside Washington, D.C., believes in the importance of creating a family that celebrates life.\u00a0Bomberger told Fox News Digital in an interview that she hopes \"Pro-Life Kids!\" \u2014 her new book geared to children in kindergarten through 6th grade \u2014 can be a \"catalyst for a lot of adults who think it's too hard to talk about hard things.\"\u00a0  \"We\u2019re living in a culture that is screaming lies at our children about what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a man and what it means to value other human beings,\" she said this week.\u00a0  IMAGINE IF THE TERM \u2018BIRTHING PARENT\u2019 REPLACED THE WORD \u2018MOTHER\u2019 IN THESE HIT SONGS  \"So if we do not teach our children, there is a broken world that will reach them.\"A mom of four, Bomberger was a teacher for many years in both public and in Christian schools. It was inside the classroom, she said, that she learned \"the power of literature\" \u2014 and that kids need adults to \"delve into some really hard issues age-appropriately.\"  Bethany Bomberger believes that \"very well-intentioned people with a pro-life worldview \u2026 don't know, really, how to communicate that worldview powerfully and appropriately.\"\u00a0 (Bethany Bomberger/The Radiance Foundation)  Bomberger and her husband, Ryan, co-founded The Radiance Foundation.They speak to tens of thousands of people each year at events all over the country \u2014 and they frequently notice, she said, that young people in both high school and college often say, \"My parents were pro-life, but I know better \u2014 I am pro-abortion.\"  Bomberger believes that \"very well-intentioned people with a pro-life worldview \u2026 don't know, really, how to communicate that worldview powerfully and appropriately.\"\u00a0\"If we do not teach our children, there is a broken world that WILL reach them.\"     Given all of this, what are some steps parents can take to create a culture of life within the family?\u00a0Here are five smart steps to consider.1. Parents should \u2018create a foundation\u2019One way, suggested Bomberger, is to hold \"a once-a-week family meeting or a date that you come up with [for the family calendar], where you say, \u2018Today we're going to talk about these things.\u2019\"\u00a0    Kids need to hear this, she said.  Bethany Bomberger and her husband, Ryan Bomberger, are surrounded by their four children here. She said being pro-life comes naturally to kids. (The Radiance Foundation)\"We can't shy away from creating a foundation, a belief system, for our children,\" she said. \"Since kids are inundated with a culture that says things like \u2018abortion is health care\u2019 and 'abortion is women's rights,' we\u2019re going to give them a standard by which they're going to weigh that information.\"\u00a0Being pro-life comes naturally to children, said Bomberger.\u00a0  She said parents must \"be intentional about fostering that natural inclination.\"\u00a0  Parents, suggested Bethany Bomberger, should \"be intentional about fostering\" kids' \"natural inclination\" to be pro-life.\u00a0 (iStock)    The current \"culture of destruction\" has anger at its foundation, Bomberger believes, particularly now that the Supreme Court, in the Dobbs decision, HAS struck down Roe v. Wade.\u00a0She said that culture is expressed through a bevy of \"bumper-sticker phrases that are superficial and shallow.\"\u00a0  ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED: REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM, OTHER FAITH LEADERS, REACT TO \u2018SIGNIFICANT\u2019 ABORTION RULINGWhen it comes to slogans such as \"my body, my choice,\" Bomberger suggested parents drill down on that meaning.\u00a02. Parents should say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about that'  Parents and other guardians might say to their kids, \"Let\u2019s talk about that. Let's talk about \u2018my body, my choice,'\" said Bomberger.  A pro-life crowd reacts outside the court on June 24, 2022, to the SCOTUS decision overturning Roe v. Wade and sending abortion back to the states. (Joshua Comins/Fox News)  Among the benefits of raising children who value life, noted Bomberger, is this: \"When we help children understand the power of what it means to be pro-life, they see other human beings as important and having intrinsic value,\" she said.\"Something we like to say is we love every human being, not necessarily every human doing,\"\u00a0said Bomberger.\u00a0  \"There\u2019s a way we can teach people to value others without having to agree with all of their behaviors and ideologies.\"\u00a0  Bethany Bomberger hopes her new book can be a \"catalyst for a lot of adults who think it's too hard to talk about hard things,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Bethany Bomberger/The Radiance Foundation)    Any time any individual or group begins to think that another individual or group of humans is without value, said Bomberger \u2014 \"it has never turned out well.\"\"We've seen this with slavery, we\u2019ve seen this with the Holocaust \u2026 It leads to oppression, racism and hatred. We want to see a culture that defies that.\"\u00a03. Parents need to \u2018keep ahead of the curve\u2019Fox News Digital also spoke with Lila Rose, a prominent pro-life activist, author and speaker based in California, about how parents and families can raise kids to value life at every stage.\"It is a universal experience for children to understand that life is precious and special, especially if they\u2019re well-loved themselves.\"   \"You\u2019re hard-pressed to find a little kid who doesn\u2019t see the humanity of other little kids,\" said Rose.\u00a0  She, too, believes that young children are naturally pro-life.\u00a0\"They get very excited about pregnancy and a new baby coming along, and the joy that brings them naturally,\" said Rose, who is also a mom.  San Francisco native Lila Rose of Live Action said that it's very important for parents to make sure their kids are not \"preyed upon by a school system that is out to destroy proper moral thinking.\" (LiveAction.org)    \u00a0\"It is a universal experience for children to understand that life is precious and special, especially if they\u2019re well-loved themselves.\"When children grow to experience the \"brainwashing of our school system\" \u2014 which presents \"the false dichotomy of women\u2019s rights versus pro-life\" \u2014 that's when they get confused, said Rose.\u00a0  FAITH, FAMILY AND FUN COMBINE IN BIBLE STORY COME TO LIFE AT KENTUCKY'S ARK ENCOUNTER\u00a0  \"It\u2019s very important that parents not let their children become preyed upon by a school system that is out to destroy proper moral thinking.\"She advised parents to \"take whatever measure you need to as a parent to keep ahead of the curve.\"4. Parents might consider switching schools or choosing to homeschoolRose suggested switching schools or even homeschooling the kids if a school where they're currently enrolled is teaching pro-choice rhetoric.    \"We can also do a lot, right in our own homes, to create kids who value life,\" said Rose.  A mom homeschools her daughter. Children need \"the perspective that a baby also has human rights,\" Lila Rose told Fox News Digital. (iStock)  She said that \"showing appreciation for pregnancy and celebrating babies\" is one \"powerful\" way.\u00a0Rose said that once kids are old enough to understand, \"provide the truth to them: This [fetus or growing baby] is a child, a human being that has human rights.\"  RAISING MY DAUGHTERS AFTER ROE V. WADE, SHARING THAT PRO-LIFE EQUALS PRO-WOMAN  \"If they\u2019re just hearing one side \u2014 that women\u2019s rights are being withheld in some way by pro-lifers \u2014 they\u2019re going to want to do what\u2019s most empathetic,\" said Rose.\u00a0\"But if they\u2019re getting the perspective that a baby also has human rights, and that no woman has the right to kill her child \u2014 this viewpoint can be very compelling.\"\u00a05. Parents must be willing to engage  Raising pro-life kids takes a multi-faceted approach, Rose said. \"It\u2019s family culture \u2014 how we appreciate new life in our own families \u2014 and how well we cherish our own children.\"  A newborn baby is shown right after delivery. Parents need to be willing, said Lila Rose, \"to engage in [key] topics with kids and not shy away from them.\" The work must continue as children grow, she said, with parents \"having conversations to help [the kids] reason through the questions as they arise, and helping them to understand that this [issue] is human rights for the child and fundamental human rights for all people.\"    It is very important, she said, that parents are willing \"to engage in these topics with kids and not shy away from them.\"\"Children are a blessing, and we respect life.\"   Rose believes the current pro-choice agenda is actually \"brainwashing\" many children.\"I\u2019ve talked to so many young women. And I\u2019m always amazed at how many of them have not actually heard the pro-life position. When they do,\" she added, it \"undermines\" the pro-choice point of view \"that they've been fed\" for so long.\u00a0CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER    \"They suddenly are open to the pro-life position,\" she said.Rose emphasized that \"it's game over for the pro-abortion movement when parents actually engage their children and properly educate [them about] the pro-life movement and its values.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    \"Children are a blessing, and we respect life \u2014 that\u2019s the pro-life culture,\" she said.
