(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nJudge Lori Maret sided with Attorney General Mike Hilgers and the state, which argued Legislative Bill 574 did not violate the Nebraska Constitution\u2019s requirement that bills cover only a single subject because both proposals covered health care.\u00a0\n\u201cThe rule \u2026 for legislative bills is that they must have \u2018one general object, no matter how broad,\u2019 and they must not include any matter that is not relevant to that general object,\u201d Maret wrote. \u201cApplying that standard here, the Court concludes that LB 574 has the general object of health care and that all parts of the bill relate to health care.\u201d\nLawsuit had argued proposals unrelated\nThe lawsuit Maret rejected, filed in May by ACLU Nebraska and others, including Planned Parenthood, had argued LB 574 was unconstitutional because lawmakers combined two unrelated bills that spent most of the legislative session on separate tracks.\n  Faith leaders, state senators and advocates for abortion access join for a noon rally against abortion restrictions on Wednesday, April 12, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nOne of their core arguments was that neither bill could have passed without the other. They argued that supporters of State Sen. Kathleen Kauth\u2019s bill on gender care and State Sen. Ben Hansen\u2019s abortion ban needed the other proposal to pass.\nNebraska prohibits so-called \u201clogrolling\u201d proposals together to pass legislation. But, as Maret wrote, it was \u201cspeculative\u201d to presume either measure in LB 574 would not have passed on its own because the abortion ban was tweaked before key votes.\nLB 574 bans abortions in Nebraska after 12 weeks of gestation, with exceptions for the mother\u2019s life. A previous proposal, Legislative Bill 626, would have banned abortions in Nebraska after an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity, at about six weeks. That bill failed, falling one vote short.\n  Gov. Jim Pillen holds a 5-day-old newborn after signing LB 574 into law. Pillen is joined by State Sens. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, at left, and Kathleen Kauth, at center.

Jim Pillen said he was pleased with the ruling and that LB 574 \u201cprotects kids and defends the unborn.\u201d\nAbortion rights advocates regroup\nMaret\u2019s decision left local advocates supporting abortion rights and trans rights pledging to appeal the decision to the Nebraska Supreme Court. Legal and political observers said an appeal of Maret\u2019s decision likely faces a stiff but not impossible climb.\nMaret, appointed in 2014 by then-Gov. Dave Heineman, received the lowest score of any District Court judge statewide in the Nebraska State Bar Association\u2019s most recent Judicial Performance Evaluation, the Lincoln Journal Star reported in 2022. She earned a 46% rating from lawyers.\nAbortion rights advocates have said that women have already had to make arrangements to visit other states for care. And trans advocates have said the changes in LB 574 have some people rethinking whether they should stay in Nebraska.\n  Interim ACLU Nebraska Executive Director Mindy Rush Chipman said ACLU Nebraska filed suit with Planned Parenthood of the Heartland against LB 574. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\nRuth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, described Friday\u2019s ruling as \u201ca devastating blow to Nebraskans\u2019 fundamental right to make what should be private decisions between them and their doctors.\u201d\n\u201cI want to be clear, this is not the end of this fight,\u201d she said in a joint statement with the ACLU. \u201cWe will never stop fighting for the freedom, bodily autonomy and health of our communities.\u201d\nACLU Nebraska\u2019s Mindy Rush Chapman disagreed with the court\u2019s conclusion, saying \u201cNebraskans are being seriously harmed.\u201d\nLocal representatives of both the ACLU and Planned Parenthood have said this was just the first lawsuit of many likely to be filed against the new law and that more would likely come.\n \n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXJudge dismisses LB 574 lawsuit, says abortion and gender care are health care\nby Aaron Sanderford, Nebraska Examiner August 12, 2023\nJudge dismisses LB 574 lawsuit, says abortion and gender care are health care\nby Aaron Sanderford, Nebraska Examiner August 12, 2023\n LINCOLN \u2014 A lawsuit trying to stop the new Nebraska law mixing a stricter abortion ban at 12 weeks of gestation with restrictions on gender-affirming care for trans minors was dismissed on Friday by a Lancaster County District Court judge.\n  Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers speaks during a press conference.
