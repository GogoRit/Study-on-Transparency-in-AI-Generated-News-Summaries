Wade decision legalizing abortion.\u00a0\nLike many of the families in the crowd, Bogdan has a personal connection to the issue.\n\u201cThey wanted us to abort him 20 years ago,\u201d she told the Register, gesturing to her son Andrew, who has Down syndrome. Bogdan has been joining in the March for Life for 35 years, bringing her children to witness for life. They traveled from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to participate this year.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s possible willingness to overturn Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson Health case has given her a lot of hope. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see this day, that we\u2019re so close, despite everything that\u2019s against us; we\u2019re so close, and look at how many young people there are,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nShe added that the many young people at the march are a source of renewed energy: \u201cThe young people are aware the truth is there.\u201d She said parents \u201cneed to speak up\u201d to their kids about the importance of the pro-life issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCharbel Rizk, a Maronite Catholic from Raleigh, North Carolina, made the six-hour journey to march this year with his five children. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fundamental issue \u2014 right \u2014 it\u2019s life,\u201d he told the Register. \u201cEverybody seems to be fighting for justice, and so this is the most fundamental. If you don\u2019t have the opportunity to live, what else matters?\u201d\u00a0\nRegarding the possibility of Roe being overturned, he said that he was more concerned with reaching hearts and minds on the issue. \u201cI\u2019m more focused on really getting people to care enough. Laws always reflect the majority of society, so when the majority in this country realizes that abortion is wrong ... the Supreme Court is no longer relevant anymore.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSupporting Mothers and Babies\nMary Rose Somarriba traveled from Cleveland to march alongside her husband, Gabriel, and two of her four children. Her 9-year-old daughter, Inez, marched beside her with a handmade sign that read: \u201cA baby is a person in and out of the womb.\u201d Her son, Vinny, was balanced on his father\u2019s shoulders, carrying a sign that said: \u201cBabies Need Love.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come over the years to stand up for unborn lives because the babies can\u2019t speak for themselves,\u201d Somarriba \u00a0said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI did think it\u2019s a big year to march and show our support.\u201d\u00a0\nRegarding the Dobbs case, she told the Register, \u201cI don\u2019t know if Roe will be overturned or not, but, either way, our country needs a lot of healing, and women need a lot of support in facing their unplanned pregnancies.\u201d That\u2019s because pushing abortion \u201creally pushes women into corners more than many people realize and makes them think that they can\u2019t have children and careers and success or other passions in life,\u201d \u00a0she said. These women \u201cdeserve compassion and support, and they deserve a chance at reaching their goals and living beautiful lives.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone deserves a chance at life, and the babies in the womb, if they could speak, they would want a chance at life \u2014 just like everyone else,\u201d Somarriba said. \u201cSo we need to find a way to not tear down one in the effort to provide for another \u2014 we need to find a better way forward.\u201d\u00a0\nKatherine Michael, a medical student from Virginia, spoke with the Register near a \u201cLove Them Both\u201d sign outside the Supreme Court at the end of the march. She was holding her two young daughters, who she had while in medical school, and said she wanted \u201cto be an example that it\u2019s possible and that it\u2019s actually fighting the negativity of the society, allowing us to embrace our fertility and motherhood, while still contributing and doing other things really well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coming out for a few years now, and we really like standing with other people and letting them know that pro-life people exist and that we\u2019re here, whether abortion is legal or illegal, to support and protect women and children,\u201d she said.\nMichael, who is specializing in maternal and child health, said that while she is a Christian now, she first became pro-life from a secular background.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was just my moral compass that brought me against abortion initially,\u201d she said, \u201crealizing that it wasn\u2019t serving women the way I had thought it was, when I was younger. And then I came to Jesus and realized even more that there\u2019s so much more to life and so much value in life, that it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBeing People of Life\nThe Sisters of Life, whose order is devoted to the pro-life cause and provides resources to vulnerable abortion-minded women, participated in the march this year with a lot of prayer surrounding the case before the Supreme Court.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re praying for the end of Roe. We\u2019re praying for the Dobbs case to be successful,\u201d Sister Marie Veritas, who traveled from the Bronx, told the Register. She added that \u201cno matter what happens with legislation, we still need to be people of life and for life and really helping women, to give them a lot of the support they need \u2014 not just to choose life, but to flourish.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo come today, in this time of solidarity and to stand for life, to stand for love with our brothers and sisters here, that\u2019s one of the most powerful witnesses we can give to the world, especially this year on the possibility of Roe falling,\u201d she said of their participation in the march. \u201cWhat every person here wants to let women know is that we want to cherish you in your motherhood and support you in that.\u201d\u00a0\nSister Faith Marie told the Register that while this year \u201cthere\u2019s a poignancy with Dobbs in the air,\u201d regardless of the outcome of the case, \u201cwe love coming to actually show the dignity of every human person is worthwhile.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \nlauretta brown\nroe v.
