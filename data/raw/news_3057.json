Jones \n\nWashington, D.C. Newsroom, Dec 7, 2022 / 17:00 pm\nA Northern Ireland law to ban pro-life advocacy near abortion providers, including advocacy of abortion alternatives, is \u201cjustifiable\u201d and compatible with the rights of people who want to express their opposition to abortion, the U.K. Supreme Court unanimously ruled Wednesday.\nThe law prohibits \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d pro-life \u201cinfluence,\u201d broadly defined, within 100 meters (about 328 feet) of an abortion provider. The designated areas have been called \u201ccensorship zones\u201d by critics of the law, who include the legal group ADF UK.\n\u201cWe are of course disappointed to see today\u2019s ruling from the Supreme Court, which fails to protect the basic freedoms to pray or to offer help to women who may want to know about practical support available to avoid abortion,\u201d Jeremiah Igunnubole, legal counsel for ADF UK, said Dec. 7. \n\u201cPeaceful presence, mere conversation, quiet or silent prayer \u2014 these activities should never be criminalized in a democratic society like the U.K.,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Northern Ireland pro-life group Precious Life voiced stronger criticism, calling the decision \u201ca travesty of justice.\u201d\n\u201cThe judges in the Supreme Court ruled this is appropriate and justifiable, even though it breaches rights of freedom of speech and assembly protected by the European Convention on Human Rights,\u201d the group said Wednesday. \n\u201cOur work to protect mothers and babies from abortion has always been peaceful and legal. We will use innovative and creative new methods to continue offering help and support to women outside abortion centers,\u201d the group said.\nThe ruling concerned a query regarding the Northern Ireland Assembly\u2019s Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) Northern Ireland Bill, which passed in March. Prohibited activities near abortion providers include quiet or silent prayer as well as the distribution of leaflets that offer women alternatives to abortion.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s attorney general, Dame Brenda King, had referred the bill to the U.K. Supreme Court out of concern that it was incompatible with fundamental freedoms enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.\nAbortion critics may protest anywhere outside of the designated zones, the court noted. Conviction under the law will not \u201cinterfere disproportionately with a protestor\u2019s rights.\u201d The context is \u201chighly sensitive\u201d and there is \u201cparticular importance\u201d to protecting \u201cthe private lives and autonomy of women,\u201d the court\u2019s decision summary said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c(W)omen who wish to access lawful abortion services have a reasonable expectation of being able to do so without being confronted by protest activity designed to challenge and diminish their autonomy and undermine their resolve,\u201d the court said. Women and abortion provider staff are \u201ca captive audience who are compelled to witness anti\u2013abortion activity that is unwelcome and intrusive.\u201d\nThe court\u2019s explanation for the ruling also cited the bill\u2019s stated aim of implementing obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nIgunnubole objected that the law\u2019s criminalization of \u201cinfluencing\u201d is \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201creduces the threshold of criminality to an impermissibly low level.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNorthern Ireland\u2019s broadly drafted law hands arbitrary power to police officers, with the inevitable consequence being the unjust arrest and prosecution of those expressing pro-life views, even though such views are protected under domestic and international human rights law,\u201d he added.\nAnother critic of the law is Alina Dulgheriu. She changed her mind about having an abortion because pro-life advocates at the doors of an abortion clinic offered to help her. She now speaks on behalf of the pro-life group Be Here for Me.\n\u201cWhat kind of society withholds help from vulnerable women?\u201d Dulgheriu asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t want an abortion but I was abandoned by my partner, my friends, and society. My financial situation at the time would have made raising a child very challenging.\u201d\n\u201cThanks to the help I was offered by a group outside of a clinic before my appointment, my daughter is here today,\u201d she said. \u201cMy experience is typical of hundreds of others. Refusing charitable volunteers from offering much-needed services and resources for women in my situation is wrong. Let them help.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, Precious Life said it \u201cwill not be deterred by this court ruling.\u201d \n\u201cOur legal team is now working on how this ruling can be appealed and challenged in the European Court of Human Rights,\u201d the group said. \u201cMeanwhile, we will redouble our efforts in our public awareness campaigns to expose the horrific reality of what abortion does to an innocent baby in the womb.\u201d\n\u201cIn a humane society, the safest place for a baby should be their mother\u2019s womb. Precious Life will work to create \u2018safe zones\u2019 for all unborn babies and their mothers throughout Northern Ireland.\u201d\nLois McLatchie, communications officer for ADF UK, cited a 2018 Home Office review of the work of pro-life advocates outside abortion clinics. The most common pro-life efforts include quiet or silent prayer or offering leaflets about alternatives to abortion and charitable support for women. The review found that instances of harassment outside abortion clinics are \u201crare\u201d and police already have powers to stop it. \n\u201cCensorship zones go much further. They introduce a disproportionate and unjustified blanket ban on all pro-life activity, including offering meaningful charitable help and support to women where they need it most,\u201d McLatchie said. \u201cAuthorities do not hold a right to silence the public expression of a viewpoint with which they simply disagree.\u201d\nIn addition to the Northern Ireland law, several U.K. town councils have passed similar laws.\nObservers expect the decision of the Supreme Court will likely influence the direction of similar legislation in Scotland, England, and Wales.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nParliamentarians in England and Wales have also conveyed concern about the direction of religious freedom within their jurisdiction as the Public Order Bill makes its way through Parliament.\nClause 9 of the bill proposes to institute \u201cbuffer zones\u201d around abortion clinics nationwide, which campaigners argue would have a detrimental impact on outreach for women facing crisis pregnancies while raising fundamental questions concerning freedom of religion and expression. The clause faced notable scrutiny in the House of Lords on Nov. 22 as peers across the political spectrum expressed their unease with the introduction of buffer zones.\n\u201cWestminster\u2019s proposal to ban such activities is much further reaching than Northern Ireland\u2019s,\u201d Igunnubole commented. He said it would ban \u201cinforming,\u201d \u201cadvising,\u201d \u201cpersuading,\u201d or even \u201coccupying space\u201d or \u201cexpressing opinion\u201d with a penalty of up to two years in prison.\n\u201cThis is clearly grossly disproportionate. Nobody should be censored for simply holding pro-life beliefs,\u201d he said.\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nFree Speech, \nNorthern Ireland, \nUnited Kingdom, \nAbortion in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin J.
