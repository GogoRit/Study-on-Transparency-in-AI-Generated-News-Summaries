(Photo by Deborah Yetter)\n\n\n\n\n\nLOUISVILLE \u2014 A judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of two Kentucky laws that together ban nearly all abortions, a week after the state\u2019s two licensed abortion providers signaled they planned to drop the case \u2014 for now.\nJefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry on Tuesday signed an order the parties submitted agreeing to dismiss the case.\nEMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center and Planned Parenthood said in a June 20 filing that they would drop the case in light of a state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that to pursue it, they must find a patient to serve as a plaintiff.\n  Amber Duke\nBut they have not given up, Amber Duke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, said at a news conference Saturday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find someone to come forward,\u201d Duke said. \u201cWe stand ready to file and immediately go back in court when we have someone who is in a position to take on the lawsuit.\u201d\nThe ACLU represents EMW, and Duke was speaking at a news conference called to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down the federal right to abortion.\nAccess to abortion ended immediately in Kentucky after the June 24, 2022, ruling because of a \u201ctrigger law\u201d on the books to ban the procedure should the high court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case establishing it as a federal constitutional right.\nEMW and Planned Parenthood had challenged that law in state court, arguing Kentucky\u2019s Constitution provides a right to abortion. They also had challenged a second law, a ban on abortion once cardiac impulses are detected in an embryo, at about six weeks and often before most women know they are pregnant.\nBut the state Supreme Court curtailed their right to challenge the laws, ruling that the clinics lacked \u201cstanding,\u201d or the right to sue without a patient as a plaintiff who had been affected by the laws, even though providers have often been granted standing to pursue such cases by the courts.\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, an anti-abortion Republican who is defending the two laws, signed off on Tuesday\u2019s agreed order.\nCameron is running in this year\u2019s gubernatorial race against Gov. Andy Beshear, the Democratic incumbent who supports abortion rights. Cameron previously had praised news the clinics had agreed to drop the case.\n\u201cMy office will always defend and enforce Kentucky\u2019s pro-life laws passed by our General Assembly,\u201d he said in a statement.\nKentucky Right to Life, which had supported the laws, celebrated the decision of the plaintiffs to end litigation.\n\u201cThey have walked away from their own case,\u201d said Addia Wuchner, executive director, in a post on the organization\u2019s website. \u201cToday, every word of every pro-life law is intact.\u201d\n  U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, speaks at a news conference Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of the date the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade (Photo by Deborah Yetter)\nHowever, abortion rights supporters vowed to continue the fight, speaking at Saturday\u2019s news conference held at Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinic in Louisville.\nU.S. Rep Morgan McGarvey, who represents Kentucky\u2019s 3rd Congressional District based in Louisville, said he is among a group of House Democrats pushing a measure called the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act to restore abortion as a federal right.\n\u201cRight now, no woman in Kentucky can receive an abortion even in cases of rape or incest,\u201d McGarvey said. \u201cAbortion is health care. We must make sure that that health care continues to be available in a safe and legal way.\u201d\nKentucky laws make no exception for pregnancies resulting from rape, incest or in cases of serious fetal abnormality. Nor do they make allowances for the age of the patient where, in Kentucky, the two youngest patients in the last two years abortion was legal were age 9.\nMeanwhile, abortion rights advocates say they will remain active in Kentucky and keep fighting for women seeking abortions in other states. Both EMW and Planned Parenthood are taking calls and providing information to such patients.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d said Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky state director of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. \u201cThese doors stay open. Through thick and thin, we\u2019ll be fighting for the future we know is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXChallenge to Kentucky\u2019s abortion ban dismissed as advocates seek a patient to press case\nby Deborah Yetter, Kentucky Lantern June 27, 2023\nChallenge to Kentucky\u2019s abortion ban dismissed as advocates seek a patient to press case\nby Deborah Yetter, Kentucky Lantern June 27, 2023\n LOUISVILLE \u2014 A judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of two Kentucky laws that together ban nearly all abortions, a week after the state\u2019s two licensed abortion providers signaled they planned to drop the case \u2014 for now.\nJefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry on Tuesday signed an order the parties submitted agreeing to dismiss the case.\nEMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center and Planned Parenthood said in a June 20 filing that they would drop the case in light of a state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that to pursue it, they must find a patient to serve as a plaintiff.\n  Amber Duke\nBut they have not given up, Amber Duke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, said at a news conference Saturday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find someone to come forward,\u201d Duke said. \u201cWe stand ready to file and immediately go back in court when we have someone who is in a position to take on the lawsuit.\u201d\nThe ACLU represents EMW, and Duke was speaking at a news conference called to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down the federal right to abortion.\nAccess to abortion ended immediately in Kentucky after the June 24, 2022, ruling because of a \u201ctrigger law\u201d on the books to ban the procedure should the high court overturn Roe v.
