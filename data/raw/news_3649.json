Dean Phillips (MN-03) led 26 House Democrats in introducing the real PRO-LIFE Act. Phillips\u2019s Providing Real Opportunities and Lifelong Investments For Everyone (PRO-LIFE) Act reclaims the moniker and is aimed at supporting women and families \u2013 during pregnancy and beyond.\u00a0The PRO-LIFE Act is co-led by Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, Rep. Robin Kelly, Rep. Grace Meng, and Rep. Nanette Diaz Barrag\u00e1n.\n\u201cEquitable access to health care, childcare, education and paid leave is, by definition, pro-life,\u201d\u00a0said Rep. Phillips.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m ready to work with anyone in Congress who is serious about supporting children and families, and ask my colleagues to stop using women\u2019s bodies, freedoms, and futures to score political points. It\u2019s time we unify behind actually improving lives and outcomes for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressional Republicans are making their end goal crystal clear: to strip away a woman\u2019s fundamental right to make her own healthcare decisions and ban abortion nationwide,\u201d said House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro. \u201cThey claim to be pro-life and pro-family, and then they enact policies that go against science, hurt the health of American women, and gut programs that help families deal with rising costs and stagnant wages. Let me be clear, if Republicans were true to their claims, they would fight for policies that actually support the lives of working Americans. With introduction of the PRO-LIFE Act, which includes a number of priorities that will support American families, including the Child Tax Credit and paid family and medical leave, we will re-establish what it truly means to be pro-life.\u201d\n\u201cInvesting in maternal and infant healthcare, child care and paid leave is how we truly support and protect the lives of infants, mothers and families,\u201d said Congresswoman Robin Kelly. \u201cAs Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I know how devastating the Dobbs decision will be for Black women and families, who are already facing a worsening maternal mortality crisis and disproportionately low access to affordable child care and paid family leave. I am co-leading the PRO-LIFE Act with Reps. Phillips, DeLauro, Barrag\u00e1n and Meng to ensure equitable access to lifesaving healthcare and to invest in services that families across America need now more than ever.\u201d\n\u201cAmericans\u2019 rights and freedoms have been under attack since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe V. Wade almost three months ago. Republicans are looking to expand on this ruling by enacting a nationwide abortion ban, claiming to be \u2018pro-life\u2019. This is unacceptable,\u201d said Congresswoman Grace Meng. \u201cThe Providing Real Opportunities and Lifelong Investments For Everyone Act, the real pro-life legislation, bundles commonsense bills that aim to support women, families, and Americans throughout their lives. I am proud to be a co-lead on such a crucial bill. This package includes my Honoring Family-Friendly Workplaces Act, which would require the Department of Labor to recognize employers that have policies that provide paid family and sick leave and provide subsides for childcare. We are reclaiming what it really means to be \u2018pro-life\u2019.\"\n\r\n\u201cFor the past three months, we have seen the heartbreaking and devastating impact that anti-abortion Congressional Republicans have worked for decades to create,\u201d\u00a0said Congresswoman Nanette Barrag\u00e1n. \u201cPatients and their families across the nation are being forced to flee their own communities to access basic health care or face carrying pregnancies against their will. For far too long, Republicans have been claiming to be \u2018pro-life\u2019 and \u2018pro-family,\u2019 but, time and time again, they have passed legislation that harmed the wellbeing of American families, increased costs for working families, and threaten to gut popular, successful programs that so many Americans rely on such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Democrats truly understand what it means to be \u201cpro-life\u201d and I am proud to be co-leading The Providing Real Opportunities and Lifelong Investments For Everyone Act, or PRO-LIFE Act, with Reps. Phillips, DeLauro, Kelly, and Meng to actually support women, families, and children. This package includes my Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Permanency Act, which would permanently fund the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and related programs that support the development of child health.\"\nThe PRO-LIFE Act package includes popular, reasonable, family-focused bills that have been blocked by the Senate in reconciliation negotiations:\n\nPaid Leave: H.R.804, the FAMILY Act\nChild Tax Credits (CTC): H.R.928, the American Family Act of 2021\nChild Care Infrastructure and Affordability: H.R.1911, the Child Care is Infrastructure Act\nAdoption Support: H.R.4837, the Honoring Family-Friendly Workplaces Act\nMaternal Health: H.R.959, the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021\nMaternal Mortality Prevention: H.R. 3407, the MOMMA\u2019s Act\n\nChildren\u2019s Health: H.R.1791, the CHIPP Act\n\nIn addition to Phillips and the co-leads, the PRO-LIFE Act is cosponsored by Reps. Carson, Porter, Norton, F. Wilson, Nadler, Khanna, Doyle, Kirkpatrick, Neguse, Cicilline, Vel\u00e1zquez, Evans, Adams, Lofgren, Connolly, McCollum, Schakowsky, Torres, Escobar, Grijalva, Cohen, and G. Moore.\n###\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\nPhillips Backs Medicare for All\n\nDecember 20, 2023 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\nPhillips Introduces Bill to Expand First Responders\u2019 Access to Health Care Coverage\n\nDecember 11, 2023 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\nCCX News: Phillips secures federal funding for Minnesota domestic violence organization\n\nOctober 13, 2023 | Posted in In the News\n\n\n\nKSTP: During Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Phillips aims to improve cancer care in Minnesota\n\nOctober 13, 2023 | Posted in In the News\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Files\n\n\n\r\n            PRO-LIFE Act\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota Office\n\r\n13911 Ridgedale Drive \r\nSuite 200\r\nMinnetonka, MN 55305 \n(952) 656-5176\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C.
