According to the campaign\u2019s website, \u201cAll players have the option to donate their cleats to NFL Auction where you can make their custom cleats yours. All proceeds from sales go to the respective causes selected by players.\u201d\nThere are a lot of neat causes on a lot of cleats each game \u2013 but our favorite has to be Kansas City Chief\u2019s kicker Harrison Butker\u2019s! Butker chose to support his own Butker Family Foundation, which according to Harrison, has a \u201cfocus on stopping human trafficking and support[s] pro life.\u201d\n\n\nGreat team win this past weekend at Arrowhead! Thanks to @grecopaintworks for his hard work on My Cause My Cleats customs! My cause is The Butker Family Foundation where we focus on stopping human trafficking and support pro life. \ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/NG0WIoCcj8\n\u2014 Harrison Butker (@buttkicker7) December 9, 2020\n\nBeautifully emblazoned on his cleats are the messages \u201cStop Human Trafficking\u201d and an illustration of a mother and preborn baby. These two causes, of course, go hand-in-hand and have a joint purpose of protecting the dignity of all human life. Butker is a Catholic and has played for the Chiefs since 2017. Plus, in a pleasant surprise, all replies to the tweet above have been positive & supportive!\nIt\u2019s not always easy (especially as a public figure) to be vocal against abortion since pop culture ruthlessly tears pro-lifers down. Needless to say, if you weren\u2019t a Kansas City fan before\u2026 it might be time to switch teams!\n\n Post Views: 2,833\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
