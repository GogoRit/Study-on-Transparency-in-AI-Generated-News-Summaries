The edition was retracted by school administrators because this oped was published.\n\n\n\nAURORA | Regis Jesuit High School retracted the winter issue of its student magazine because it contained an op-ed from a student expressing pro-choice abortion views, and fired both of the magazine\u2019s faculty advisors, according to Sentinel sources.\nElevate, a Regis Jesuit student magazine, publishes in print and online four times a year. In the Winter 2021 Edition, a student wrote an opinion piece titled, \u201cThe battle for our bodies: confronting abortion and human rights.\u201d\n \nSign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture of an opinion column in the Winter 2021 edition of Elevate, a student magazine by Regis Jesuit High School students. The edition was retracted by school administrators because this oped was published.\nThe piece is written from a pro-choice point of view, and argues that making abortion illegal causes women to die from unsafe illegal procedures, and that there is a meaningful distinction between a fetus and a baby.\n\u201cInstead of changing the laws and creating a pseudo-religious government to rule over women having better access to contraception, meaningful sex education, and family planning services should take place,\u201d the article said. \u201cReligious beliefs of other people should never interfere with a person\u2019s choices with their body and future.\u201d\nEditions of the magazine are printed and also hosted online on the publishing platform Issuu. In place of the winter edition, a letter signed by the school\u2019s president and principal says that it has been retracted in its entirety due to the op-ed.\n\u201cEarlier this week, the winter edition of the student-produced Elevate magazine was released to the student body,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAn opinion piece that presented a stance on abortion clearly in opposition to Church teaching was included that we found both deeply troubling and unacceptable.\u201d\nThe letter says that it affirms the teaching that life begins at conception. Regis Jesuit is a private, Catholic high school, and a web page on the \u2018mission\u2019 section of its website states that it follows the tenets of Catholic social teaching and is influenced by Jesuit spirituality.\n\u201cWe do not tell our students what to think; we teach them how to think and how to discern with an informed conscience,\u201d the site says.\nThe letter says that regarding the op-ed, the school failed to provide students with proper guidance regarding its beliefs.\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that this does not happen again,\u201d it said. \u201cThe issue has been retracted in its entirety. While we believe in providing an avenue for student expression, we are taking steps now to consider the magazine\u2019s editorial process to ensure its compatibility with and responsibility in representing the mission of Regis Jesuit.\u201d\nThe letter did not say if any students or staff members were disciplined. The masthead of the fall edition of the magazine lists two faculty advisors, neither of whom currently appear in the school\u2019s staff directory. After being contacted by the Sentinel, both confirmed that they were no longer employed by Regis Jesuit but declined to discuss the situation further.\nA Regis Jesuit student told the Sentinel, on the condition of anonymity, fearing possible reprisal, that students were told on Tuesday, the first day of the semester, that the two advisors had been fired. Many students and teachers are very upset at what happened, the student said.\nThe teachers\u2019 journalism classes are currently being taught by substitutes, according to the student. A third advisor, who previously was working with the school\u2019s video team, is now overseeing the magazine.\nThe student believes that backlash from parents and the Denver Archdiocese is what led to the retraction and firings.\n\u201cThis is a school that the only thing that seems to make them make any decision is pressure from parents,\u201d the student said. \u201cAnd so instead of encouraging a conversation about abortion, they shut it down because that\u2019s what parents had been calling for.\u201d\nThe student expressed frustration with the gap between the school\u2019s actions and the way it presents itself publicly as an intellectually and spiritually rigorous institution.\n \nGet FREE morning and afternoon BRIEF ROUNDUPS of all the news sent to your email box.

Never a paywall.\n\n \n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re a school, and a school\u2019s job should be teaching students how to think, not what to think,\u201d the student said.\nRegis Jesuit officials declined to answer specific questions from the Sentinel or to confirm whether the advisors had been fired. In a statement, President David Card said the school did not comment on personnel matters as a rule.\n\u201cWhat I can tell is (sic) that as a Catholic, Jesuit institution, we believe that life begins at the moment of conception,\u201d Card said in an email. \u201cWe believe that the protection of life at this stage represents the foundational requirement of respecting the dignity of human life at every stage. Through that lens, we failed our students in providing proper guidance in how to consider matters involving these firmly held beliefs. As an institution focused on teaching and learning, we are using this situation as an opportunity to help form our students.\u201d\nThe letter to parents signaled likely changes for the magazine.\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the policies and editorial practices of our student journalism program,\u201d Card\u2019s statement to the Sentinel said. \u201cStudents, faculty and staff will be included in this process. Our desire is to support this program as a vehicle for students to share their voices and perspectives while continuing to represent and respect our Catholic, Jesuit mission.\u201d\nA spokesperson from the Archdiocese of Denver declined to comment on the matter, saying Regis Jesuit is not directly controlled by the Archdiocese and is in charge of its own operations. Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila has long been active in the pro-life movement. He is one of a group of American bishops arguing that President Joe Biden should not be able to receive communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden is a practicing Catholic and has long been a staunch supporter of pro-choice state and federal legislation.\nBut in a letter to the community written over winter break, Aquila said that many families had reached out to the diocese expressing concern about the op-ed. In the letter, he said it was a failure that it had been published, and that he has asked his team to assist the school in ensuring that students and staff are receiving Catholic faith formation.\nThe school\u2019s handling of the situation appears to directly contradict the editorial policy printed in the magazine, which said that the student editorial board will have final say in the content of the publication and that \u201cschool officials, administration or faculty and staff shall not practice prior review or have the ability to censor any student publication\u201d except in specific circumstances including articles involving deaths or legal situations.\nThe policy also states that the views of opinion columnists do not necessarily represent the newspaper staff.\nThe private school editorial policy is not backed by statute, according to experts.\nStudent journalism has fewer First Amendment protections than other publications, and student journalists at private schools have very little recourse to fight staff censorship, according to Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel at nonprofit advocacy group Student Press Law Center.\nThe Colorado Student Free Expression Law protects the rights of student journalists at public schools and limits their ability to be censored. It also contains a clause protecting faculty student media advisors from being retaliated against by school administrators. However, the law only applies to students and employees at public schools.\n\u201cIf this had happened at a public school clearly this would be breaking the law,\u201d Hiestand said. \u201cBut at a private school you don\u2019t have any sort of First Amendment protections.\u201d\nThese types of situations are non uncommon at private Catholic schools, especially when it comes to the topic of abortion, Hiestand said.\nIt is not the first time local religious schools have been at odds with students and employees over issues of religious doctrine. In August, a volleyball coach at Valor Christian, a private school in Highlands Ranch, said he was forced to resign after school administrators found out he was gay. After the news broke, another former coach said the same thing happened to her in 2019.\nMany Valor students spoke out against the school\u2019s decision. A group of students and alumni formed a group called Valor for Change, which is lobbying to change the schools\u2019 policies regarding gender and sexuality.\u00a0\nWhile private schools have the legal right to censor student publications, Hiestand remarked that it seems strange to teach students about the importance of the First Amendment in class and then punish them when they put it into practice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird lesson they\u2019re providing these students,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t73 replies on \u201cRegis Jesuit High School fires teachers after pro-choice column runs in student magazine\u201d\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlivia Castro says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 6:23 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIt is surprising a Jesuit organization would actually stand up for Catholic teaching and the Truth.

It\u2019s pathetic to put the school\u2019s reputation on some kids you saw or heard at King soopers. What\u2019s surprising about a catholic organization standing up for catholic beliefs.

This is a Catholic affiliated school. Their views are no abortions. Don\u2019t go to a school that is conservative and guided by their religion. I am surprised the article was published especially when the pope recently chastized those who choose not to have children but opt to have pets.

And a student newspaper is not a function of the school and should be outside of its \u201ccontrol.\u201d  It\u2019s similar to what happens with all other after-school clubs.

Young students and many adults don\u2019t fully understand both sides of difficult issues to be able to articulate thoughts and ideas without them being misconstrued. We should do our due diligence when teaching children to understand as opposed to letting them have free reign of all their thoughts. My fear is for this young writer to be put in the spotlight like this on a very controversial issue. I think that is missing in this article. We took a simplistic view on a student not being able to voice their opinion without taking into consideration of the care of this very young student. I support that Regis retracted this to protect a very young student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebra MacKillop says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 2:03 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a High School, not kindergarten.  It\u2019s also a HS newspaper with HS journalists researching and writing it, and with adult teachers helping. It\u2019s a pretty well-written article, with some facts and statistics. Regis could have used this as an opportunity for dialogue and respect for their students and encouraging a range of views be expressed. That never seems to occur to Catholic leaders or any religious leaders. Brainwashing, censorship and punishment are typically their approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWanting Justice says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 10, 2022 at 1:43 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t retract this piece to protect the student in any regard. They retracted it because they got backlash from Archbishop. The Catholic identity of the school is in question so that\u2019s why the article was retracted. Students do not have a safe place to express there opinions because when they do repercussions are taken. They say part of growing in our faith is questioning and challenging the beliefs and practices of the church although when we do articles are retracted. The whole reason this opinion piece by a student was retracted was because the school was in jeopardy of losing funding and there Catholic identity, none of this was to protect the students it was to take away the freedom of sharing our opinions because it\u2019s puts the school at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaddie Proctor says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 12:46 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAs an alumnus of Regis Jesuit, this is incredibly disheartening. Pushing your views on students is not education. It\u2019s indoctrination. Great, informative article. The actions of the administration show exactly how under the thumb of the corrupt Denver Archdiocese (specifically Archbishop Aquila, who has made sexist comments and used Holocaust analogies in the past- ironically those disgusting analogies were about the freedom of religion\u2026 interesting how he can advocate for one part of the First Amendment but not the other). This situation should strike the consciences of everyone affiliated with Regis Jesuit.

As a Catholic institution, Regis Jesuit should not support pro-choice beliefs in any written or verbal form.\u00a0\nFirst and foremost, the Catholic Church believes in life at conception, which can occur as soon as 3 minutes after sexual intercourse. The first step of human development after the formation of the zygote is cell division without growth, creating a morula. The cells migrate to the outside, creating a \u201chollow ball\u201d, called a blastocyst (some cells become part of the mother\u2019s placenta). Lastly, the cells migrate inward in waves, creating the endoderm (eventually becomes organs), mesoderm (composes muscles and structural formations), and the ectoderm (constructs skin, teeth, etc.). Through the change in classical cadherins, the neural plate is distinguished from the ectoderm, becoming a neural tube, which will eventually be distinguished into the separate regions of the brain.\u00a0\nNow tell me, how is this not life? How is God not present in this developmental event?\u00a0\nBy receiving an abortion, a woman is committing an act of murder. We must act now to protect the lives of babies and to guard the phenomenon of human development.\u00a0\nI expected Regis Jesuit to be better, and I hope and pray that the administrators can begin to orient education in science, service, and faith.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 9:24 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nLooks like someone got educated by Regis. Maybe there is hope for future generation after all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaddie Proctor says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 9:56 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFrankly, just as you are free to express your beliefs on abortion and when life begins, that student should be free to make her argument for choice. The editorial policies are clear in that the Opinion section does not represent the beliefs of the magazine, nor the school. It is widely recognized that what constitutes the beginning of human life, as well as whether there is a right to abortion, is disputed. This is not a question of whether or not abortion is moral. Thus, your beliefs on abortion really don\u2019t contribute to what is happening right now. The issue is one of free discourse, censorship, and education. A good education allows for questioning and diversity of thought (something Regis touts on their website). You will not prepare students for the real world if you do not expose them to real world ideologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Berrian says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 8, 2022 at 2:49 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThe primary goal of Regis Jesuit High School is to provide a well-rounded education to young adults in order to promote the development of men and women with and for others. As stated on the institution\u2019s website, \u201cRegis Jesuit High School\u2014a Catholic educational community\u2014engages the gifts of young men and women in a single-gender environment, fosters faith in Jesus Christ and promotes justice and mercy, develops critical minds and nurtures compassionate hearts to serve others \u2013 all for the greater glory of God.\u201d Therefore, Regis must teach students about true mercy and compassion, characteristics that expand to all human beings, including unborn children. By fulfilling this mission, Regis Jesuit will prepare students to tackle real world issues with an analytical and compassionate mindset.\u00a0\nAlthough many individuals believe the firing of teachers is an act of censorship that violates the First Amendment, Regis Jesuit is a private institution that has the right to regulate political conversation. Through this regulation, Regis maintains the ability to orient students\u2019 mindsets in faith and mercy. Consequently, Regis is able to carry out its mission that is promised to students and their families.\u00a0\nOn the same note, the students and families are aware of Regis Jesuit\u2019s mission statement before attending the institution. If students are not happy with the educational guidelines, then they should choose to attend a public institution instead of accusing Regis for \u201ccensorship.\u201d\u00a0\nIf you think the Archdiocese is corrupt in itself, then do not choose to go to a Catholic school.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaddie Proctor says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 9, 2022 at 12:22 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRegis Jesuit also has a mission to develop graduates who are intellectually competent, as well as to \u201cteach them how to think, not what to think\u201d (as per the website). It preaches the importance of dialogue between diverse viewpoints. Censorship is directly contradictory to that premise of intellectual diversity, which is integral to education more generally. The recent actions of administration were not an attempt to \u201corient students\u2019 mindsets\u201d; they were an attempt to police the words and thoughts of a freshman girl (just like the pro-life movement polices the bodies of women). Honestly, censorship by those in power of the vulnerable/young/those with differing opinions only occurs when they are scared of the censored ideology. RJ does educate students on the Catholic position by promoting pro-life rhetoric through theology classes and in official statements. While it is a private institution and thus has greater legal freedom in terms of the First Amendment, Regis also instituted editorial policies to establish extremely limited review/censorship of student media by administration. Per the Student Press Law Center and precedent from several cases at every level of the court, private school handbooks and policies may be treated as contracts between students and the school. Even if this is a legal gray area, the legality here is not as straightforward as you argue. Regardless, I think you would agree that just because something is legal, doesn\u2019t mean it is moral (like abortion, in your view). If Regis truly wants to educate its students, it will allow for diverse opinions. If you truly want students to believe in pro-life rhetoric, you must allow them to be exposed to pro-choice rhetoric as well, just like the real world (where according to Gallup polls, a greater percentage of adults are pro-choice than pro-life). As a student, I was aware of Regis Jesuit\u2019s beliefs and never had a problem with being taught them in theology class \ud83d\ude42 But I was also aware of their editorial policies and (at the time) promotion of free and open discussion. That is the Regis Jesuit I know and loved. Because RJ is not an archdiocesan school, but rather a private Catholic school, it should not be held captive in answering to the Archbishop for recognition. A school, first and foremost, should care for its students and teachers\u2014not donors and religious/political figures. If you don\u2019t want to truly educate students, and rather just indoctrinate them, then you shouldn\u2019t run a school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory Working Orphan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 10, 2022 at 9:03 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe recent actions of administration were not an attempt to \u201corient students\u2019 mindsets\u201d; they were an attempt to police the words and thoughts of a freshman girl (just like the pro-life movement polices the bodies of women).\u201d\nJust because your every thought and utterance isn\u2019t indulged doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being \u201cpoliced.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamesathan Octavius Rutherford says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 11, 2022 at 8:08 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nmy guy did you read the article ????\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory Working Orphan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 11, 2022 at 3:45 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nYes, and now I\u2019m critiquing the quoted assertion.

My family was big on all of us going to college where we finally were allowed to freely explore the world\u2019s marketplace of ideas. What this Catholic HS did is not surprising but is saddening. Remember this is a school supported by a religious group that hid priest abuse and rape of children for decades and is still doing it. Catholic leaders also have never figured out that trying to brainwash, censor, take hypocritical stances and punish, all drives away potential supporters. The HS could have used this as an opportunity to explore views about abortion show respect for differing opinions and create open dialogue. That\u2019s how you help people learn. That clearly never occurred to them, as usual.\nThe most important part of article is: \u201cWhile private schools have the legal right to censor student publications, Hiestand remarked that it seems strange to teach students about the importance of the First Amendment in class and then punish them when they put it into practice. \u2018It\u2019s a weird lesson they\u2019re providing these students,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeelingsAreNotFacts says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 3:23 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nNothing brings out the anti-Catholic, abortion apologists like an article about a private school standing behind their beliefs.

Conception until natural death is the basis of Catholic Social Teaching. At Regis I learned to fight the unjust prison system, vote to end the death penalty, march for the equal pay and treatment of women in the workforce, stand with DACA and migrant students, and protect the individual rights and dignity of a fetus in the womb. It\u2019s called a consistent ethic of life, and it\u2019s the backbone of the Catholic faith, which is why American Catholics have historically voted Democrat. \nPerhaps instead of seeing this as some \u201cweird conservative private school thing,\u201d you should view it through the lens of an institution that\u2019s committed to promoting human dignity and rights *at literally every stage of life.*\nThe paper had one article with one viewpoint. It wasn\u2019t a discussion. It wasn\u2019t a debate. It wasn\u2019t part of a larger conversation. Just one article, with no context, in direct opposition to the consistent promotion of dignity that Regis values. I have been a part of (and watched) many big discussions about hot-button issues at Regis (police brutality, immigration, etc), always presented with nuance and giving students lots of space to explore and share viewpoints and opinions. \nI find it odd that the paper ran such an *obviously* inflammatory piece, on a super hot button issue, without any larger discussion or context. An essay like this within a classroom discussion? Totally. (And if you know Regis, you know the freedom to debate these things happens daily.) An essay like this printed in a school-wide newspaper without context or debate?

Last year, we were told we had to include an OpEd that was anti-BLM, even though we (and the school, in official statements) disagreed wholeheartedly. We did so because that is free speech, and that is journalism. The school/admin/archdiocese had zero problems with that article and allowed the issue to run. Why does the school get to censor a student expressing opinions about abortion, but not about the murder of fully formed adults? It is blatantly hypocritical. You don\u2019t get to pick and choose the First Amendment, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 8, 2022 at 10:33 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t get to pick and choose who receives the right to life. Your reply in itself is hypocritical. Why would you advocate for BLM but not the rights of children? Why does the fact that unborn babies are not fully formed affect their right to life? What if a black person was missing an arm or was mentally underdeveloped? Human rights apply to all. Not just black people, Hispanics, or Asians. This includes babies.\nClearly, you are part of the radical left. Your comments would be well placed if this was a public school.  Use some of these comments to further educate yourself \u2013 it isn\u2019t a one sided world.   It may be useful for your future if you occasionally listen to a conservative news outlet. Better yet, get to Mass & one held by our Bishop.

I agree that we do not live in a one-sided world and respect the right of the school and other commenters to share their opinions on abortion. Because we do not live in a one-sided world, it is vital that we encounter beliefs outside of our belief systems rather than existing in echo chambers. I value the dialogue I have had within Regis and outside of it for helping to form my beliefs and do in fact listen/read a variety of news sources! I also think it is vital to realize that you can be religious and even Catholic and a part of what you call \u201cthe radical left\u201d. I respect and love Catholics who advocate for their position without suppressing the positions of others because that is what a functioning democracy looks like. If you suppress the beliefs of others, you will only succeed in turning people against the Catholic Church. I ask you the same question: Why does the school censor this and not anti-racial justice articles if they hold a consistent ethic of life? Calling me hypocritical (based on your conception of life) does not render the school any less hypocritical for their actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 9, 2022 at 9:41 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nYou are clearly missing the point. I agree with Brandon, you do not get to pick and choose who receives the right to life. You are personally fighting for the rights of the black community but not the rights of babies? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. You are also attempting to suppress Regis\u2019 belief on this topic, which is censorship in itself, right? In addition to your liberal education, you should also include some science classes (to teach you what constitutes life since you seem a little confused). You criticize Regis for not holding a \u201cconsistent right to life\u201d but you also do not hold a consistent viewpoint. Therefore, you are hypocritical as well. Fix yourself before you try to fix Regis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMel Alma says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 8:34 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nTo the students reading the comments,\nKeep learning.  Find out that Catholics get abortions at the same rate as other spiritual denominations. Find out that most Catholics in the US do not follow the contraception restrictions.  Find out about how often natural abortions happen under God\u2019s watch.  Find out that most natural abortion (spontaneous miscarriages) occur due to medical anomalies.\nLearn about when the church finally weighed in on the \u201cevils\u201d of family planning and chart it with a time-line of medical discoveries.  Were there a bunch of years it wasn\u2019t a sin?  In the wave of a pen the church undid the teaching of limbo.  Maybe the child rape hiders in Italy were making things up as science figures out what happens before a quickening.\nAbortions are a conflict of needs between a living sentient human and a potential one.  We will never all agree on who is more important in the situation and this will be debated until the end of humanity.  Never let someone convince you that people with uteruses are the negligible cost of their personal belief system especially if the topic will never impact their own future liberties. It is complex and complicated.  A government which obtains the power to stop a medical procedure, is a government who holds the power to force medical procedures. Mandatory sterilization is in our countries past, and it potentially will return with more religious zealot politicians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 11:29 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPotential\u201d life?

Ask anyone with a single semester of Thomism in their CV: such an individual should be able to amply destroy those three false claims within about 10 minutes. It\u2019s pretty easy because *all* the scientific evidence and *all* rigorous logical thought supports the pro-life side\u2014not simply a preponderance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarol Tauer says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 31, 2022 at 2:22 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re wrong about Thomism. Thomas Aquinas followed the science of Aristotle, and thus taught that a male embryo received its human soul (hence became a human being) at 40 days after conception, whereas female embryos were slower to develop and did not receive their human souls until 80 days. He believed that conceived embryos were living before that time, but at first they had vegetative souls (\u201csubstantial form\u201d in Scholastic language) and then non-human animal souls, and then finally human souls. An axiom of both Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy was that a substantial form (soul) of a certain type can be joined only to matter that is appropriate to it, hence requiring some level of neural development to accommodate a human soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald T says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 7, 2022 at 9:06 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSchool is an absolute joke.

All of a sudden every thing was not viewed through the eyes of religion.  I think many in the same situation have moved away from faith based teachings to allow that there is another side to the story.  Our future lies in a place I would hope and \u201cpray\u201d for a place where dialog is allowed.  What is gained by censuring speech and expression of \u201copinions\u201d.  There is just as much danger in being so one sided if you are teaching the need to not be a sheep and woke in seeing everything through race or in this case RELIGION.  Yes it is a christian school\u2026 but they teach socialism and such things as the 1619 project- which is just rewriting history.  Many years back they did this in the bible\u2026 taking out women.  That has changed history\u2026 lets embrace diversity and the ability to not be so much in fear if someone holds a different passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njr flyboy says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 10, 2022 at 10:52 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nHuh, the 1619 project didn\u2019t rewrite history, it exposed a dark side of it that Americans don\u2019t like to own.  How about we teach your version of history alongside the 1619 project\u2014as you say, let\u2019s allow some dialogue.  Do you think that the wealth that this nation accrued (and is held by a hugely disproportionate amount of white folks) had nothing to do with slavery?  BTW\u2014Christ would almost certainly identify as a socialist.  No doubt about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory Working Orphan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 10, 2022 at 10:49 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u00a0Do you think that the wealth that this nation accrued (and is held by a hugely disproportionate amount of white folks) had nothing to do with slavery?\u201d\nNot since 1865.

Dead stop.  No holdings, land, gold still chugging on in the hands of plantation owners?  Give it a rest.  I\u2019m white.  Most of my friends and loved ones are white.  Doesn\u2019t mean I love everything whites have ever done.  What a vapid, simplistic argument. And that last quote, it seems that you think it means that caring about the world and its people is antithetical to Christ\u2019s teaching.  Again, simply dumbfoundingly inane.
