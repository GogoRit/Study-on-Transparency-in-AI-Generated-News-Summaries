It seems that society\u2019s problem with reacting negatively to babies who \u201crock an extra chromosome!\u201d as Poirier says, is more with the stigma than the actual diagnosis.\nSFLA had the opportunity to talk with Poirier about the societal challenge and triumphs of raising a child with Down syndrome and her overflowing joy is an incredible testament to the truth that all babies are a gift, not a nuisance.\nWould you tell us about you and Alice\u2019s story?\u00a0\nWhen I was 32, I gave birth to my second child, a daughter named Alice. At the time, I also had a two-year-old daughter named Lucy. When Alice was about an hour old, we were told that she likely had Down syndrome. My husband and I knew nothing about Down syndrome at the time and we were crushed. The doctor asked me if I had done any prenatal testing for Down syndrome and I told her no because we are pro-life. She kind of rolled her eyes at me, as if I should have done it and then aborted when the test came back positive for Down syndrome.\nWhen Alice was a few months old, I found out the abortion statistics for babies with Down syndrome. In Iceland, it is 100%. They have not had a baby with Down syndrome born in the last five years, as all babies are screened prenatally and then aborted if a positive Down syndrome test comes back. In the US, the Down syndrome abortion stats are about 70%. Those numbers are sickening to me, especially because Down syndrome has been nothing like we thought it would be. It is nothing but a tremendous blessing. Today, Alice is a happy, healthy, spunky, smart two-year-old girl. She says a few words, she runs around and she makes everyone around her better, more accepting and more loving.\nHas this experience impacted your involvement in the pro-life movement?\nI have always been pro-life, but my passion for the pro-life movement has increased so much since having Alice. I firmly believe that the high statistics for Down syndrome abortion are due to the way the doctors present the diagnosis (as if it is going to be absolutely horrible, when that actually couldn\u2019t be further from the truth). I have heard of so many of my friends now who received a prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis and the doctor followed it up with, \u201cSo do you want to get an abortion?\u201d \nAs a result, I\u2019m doing everything I can do to change the diagnosis experience. I recently wrote a letter to new Down syndrome parents. It is true, positive, and hopeful. It just got picked up by Yahoo. You can find it here. My goal is to have this letter given out with every Down syndrome diagnosis, whether that\u2019s prenatal or at-birth (like ours). I want women to know the joy that their baby will bring\u2026 not the lies about how horrible it is going to be. I firmly believe that this will change the outcomes in terms of the abortion statistics.\nCould you tell me about your daughter? What is it like raising her?\nAlice is amazing! She is a happy, healthy two-year-old. She says a few words, she runs around and she makes everyone better. Raising her is incredibly easy. Babies with Down syndrome are known for being easygoing and generally pretty happy. She is no exception to that! When we first received Alice\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis, I thought we would be in constant doctor\u2019s appointments and having to spend so much money and time on caring for her. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. She is 100% healthy and doesn\u2019t require any more medical care or cost than our other two kids. She is a gem to raise.\nThere\u2019s a lot of negativity surrounding babies with Down syndrome. Did you receive any negative reactions about your child\u2019s diagnosis, from doctors, family, or anyone?\u00a0\nOh yes. The doctor who told me that Alice likely had Down syndrome said it in a very negative way and basically told me that I should have screened for it prenatally. Alice\u2019s pediatrician also asked me why I didn\u2019t screen for Down syndrome prenatally. I promptly switched pediatricians.\nMy husband\u2019s family and my family, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t have been more thrilled about Alice. Her Down syndrome diagnosis simply didn\u2019t matter to them. They loved her from the moment they met her\u2026 every part of her, including and especially her Down syndrome!\nWe had a few doctors and friends tell us that they were \u201csorry\u201d that Alice has Down syndrome. I was quick to let them know that there\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. I really believe people don\u2019t know what to say, so they say they\u2019re sorry, but it\u2019s not with bad intent. They are just not educated about Down syndrome and don\u2019t know what to say.\nThe best thing to say is \u201cCongratulations\u201d like you would with any other baby, and then to tell them that they\u2019ve been chosen for an incredible ride and that Down syndrome will soon become their biggest blessing. Because it will.\nTell me about your own work and how you interweave your journalism, working and writing in the pro-life movement, with your personal experience through raising your daughter?\u00a0\nI have always worked in journalism. I knew I wanted to be a writer since I was a little girl. I have a degree in English and public relations from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. In college, I was the managing editor of the school newspaper. After college, I worked as a writer for a few marketing agencies. After having my first baby, I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom but I continued freelance writing for a few local magazines.\nWhen we had Alice, it gave me a unique opportunity to use my writing in a new way. I started my blog when she was a month old. I knew I had to start a blog to tell people about the reality of Down syndrome (not the myths) and to share the story of my beautiful new daughter. On my blog, I write all about Alice and Down syndrome with the goal of changing people\u2019s perceptions. My hope and prayer is that someone who has just received a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome and is considering abortion finds my blog, gets a new perspective and decides to keep her child.\nWhat would you say to a mother who just found out her child has/may have down syndrome?\n\u201cCONGRATULATIONS! I know you aren\u2019t there yet, but it\u2019s going to be OK. It\u2019s going to be awesome. Forget what you think you know about Down syndrome, as it will soon become your biggest blessing. You are the perfect mom for this baby, and this baby is the perfect child for you. You were chosen for this role! Just love your baby. Loving the diagnosis will come soon after.\u201d\nYou can follow Poirier\u2019s work on her blog Wonderland Mommy to hear more about her family and mission. \n\n Post Views: 1,353\n\nShare this postJessica Nardi\nAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSupportersSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
