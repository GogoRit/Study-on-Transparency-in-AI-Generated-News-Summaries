The appellate court ruled the appeal premature, as it was only an interim step in the lawsuit challenging the so-called heartbeat law\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nJustices will now decide whether such orders are appropriate legal procedure, or attempts by lower courts to block laws they don\u2019t like, as Yost has asserted.Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy, justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer and Ohio Court of Appeals Judge Matthew Byrne \u2014 sitting in due to Justice Joe Deters\u2019 recusal \u2014 voted in favor of the review. All are Republicans. The court\u2019s three Democrats dissented. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPedal coast-to-coast without using a road?

The law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibits most abortions after the first detectable \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. \n\nThe law had been blocked through a different legal challenge until right after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The ruling effectively nullified all abortion-rights lawsuits across the country that had cited the federal constitution, sending the question back to the states.The lawsuit filed in Jenkins\u2019 court argues a similar right exists under the Ohio Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIE CARR SMYTH\n\n\n                Smyth has covered government and politics from Columbus, Ohio, for The Associated Press since 2006.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
