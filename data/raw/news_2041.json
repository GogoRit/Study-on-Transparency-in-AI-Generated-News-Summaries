Flowers argued providers and Planned Parenthood, for example, don\u2019t have the same relationship as a \u201cfamily physician\u201d or a cancer patient\u2019s specialists.\n\u201cWhat you see here is only evidence of transactional, episodic interactions in which the patient meets with the plaintiff, the plaintiff provides the services and they may never see each other again,\u201d Flowers told the court.\nThat relationship \u201cis not as you portray it,\u201d Brunner said, adding that while there may be \u201cone-off situations\u201d where there\u2019s an abortion, it\u2019s still a doctor-patient relationship.\nIn terms of a conflict of interest argued by the state in which physicians should not be able to stand up for patients\u2019 rights because the law causes them to change their behavior and impacts their profession, Brunner discredited what she saw as Flowers\u2019 portrayal of the medical profession as \u201csome kind of monied factory.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re concerned that they could be prosecuted and lose their medical license, and they would then be unable to not only earn a living, but to help the people that they care about,\u201d Brunner said.\nStill, Brunner acknowledged that, for the purposes of the argument held Monday, \u201cwe really can\u2019t get to that issue until we deal with the issue of whether or not we have jurisdiction to hear the case.\u201d Flowers agreed.\nOn the other side of the case, attorney Jessie Hill fielded questions from Justice Patrick Fischer that wondered about the broader implications of the law. If physicians are allowed to act on behalf of patients, Fischer wondered if grandparents or \u201cputative fathers\u201d could stand in opposition to the elimination of the abortion law.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t a putative father have more of a close relationship than a doctor (conducting) a one-time medical procedure,\u201d Fischer asked.\nHill argued the physicians are the \u201cbetter plaintiffs\u201d to bring a lawsuit because of their \u201cconcrete, ongoing personal stake in the litigation,\u201d and a case brought by a grandparent or father would be a different argument all together.\n\u201cBecause the woman relies on the provider to exercise her rights, but the law only penalizes the provider, that\u2019s a situation where the court has said the rights are interdependent, and therefore meets the requirement for third-party standing,\u201d Hill said.\nTo the argument that patients could stand on their own in a lawsuit, Hill said patients are \u201cseeking very time-sensitive health care,\u201d and may be dealing with not only other health care concerns, but financial issues and lack of ability to hire an attorney.\n\u201cEven if they were to bring it, they\u2019re not going to remain pregnant for very long \u2026 for the duration of the lawsuit,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAt some point, her interest is extinguished.\u201d\nThe court could take months to decide on the current case. The timeline could get complicated, with a ballot initiative to enter reproductive and abortion rights into the Ohio Constitution set to hit voters at the Nov. 7 general election.\nThe state supreme court had to rule on the ballot initiative itself several times, rejecting lawsuits seeking to block it, but also allowing summary language passed by the Ohio Ballot Board to stand.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXShould abortion law be paused while court case continues?
