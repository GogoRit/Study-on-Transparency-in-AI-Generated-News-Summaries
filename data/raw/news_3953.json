Black people have shaped this country since its beginning, pushing it closer to its stated ideals of liberty and equal justice under the law. That work continues, as Black feminist-led movements fight to address this country\u2019s legacy of systemic bias and build a more equitable future.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Reproductive Justice?\n\n\n\nerror rendering https://twitter.com/PPBlackComm/status/1093957386845544448?s=20\n\n\nThe term \u201creproductive justice\u201d originated in 1994, when a group of Black women convened ahead of an international conference on population and development. These women agreed that the right to plan one\u2019s family, or to choose not to, deserves a central place in any discussion of economic and social development \u2014 in the United States and worldwide.\u00a0\nThe reproductive justice movement scrutinizes the effects of unfair laws and systems on marginalized communities. Racial bias, gender discrimination, and economic inequality are sources of injustice that catalyze ongoing activism \u2014 because health and rights are meaningless if people lack access to them.\n\n\n\nTen Organizations Working for Reproductive Justice\n\n\n\nSisterSong\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by SisterSong (@sistersong_woc)\n\n\n\nSisterSong has been a key organization in the fight for reproductive justice. Based in Atlanta, SisterSong was established by a network of women-of-color led organizations to foster the reproductive-justice movement\u2019s growth by providing training, leadership development, and a space for collaboration toward shared policy goals.\n\n\n\nIn Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nProtest movements have long marginalized Black women, but this was the decade that changed. #MondayMotivation https://t.co/B6JFJuSZ80\u2014 In Our Own Voice (@BlackWomensRJ) December 23, 2019\n\n\n\nThe name \u201cIn Our Own Voice\u201d aptly describes this initiative\u2019s mission: to provide a place where leading organizations in the reproductive justice movement can convene and plan the path forward, in their own voices. The Black-led organizations that make up In Our Own Voice help to set the national agenda for reproductive justice \u2014 and provide coordination and resources for state-level fights for access to sexual and reproductive health care.\n\n\n\nBlack Women for Wellness\n\u00a0\n\n\nerror rendering https://www.instagram.com/p/B3aV28cArtg/\n\n\nFor more than two decades, Los Angeles-based Black Women for Wellness has worked for the health and well-being of Black women and girls. Black Women for Wellness bolsters all aspects of people\u2019s well being \u2014 from physical to emotional, to financial \u2014 and advocates for resources Black women need to thrive.\n\n\n\nBlack Women\u2019s Health Imperative\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThings We Couldn't Agree With More: Black Women need better healthcare and access to reproductive care as a necessity, not an option. https://t.co/JCstzBO2gX pic.twitter.com/MFImOoEyet\u2014 blkwomenshealth (@blkwomenshealth) March 27, 2018\n\n\n\nSince 1983, the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative has worked to erase inequities in health care \u2014 both by improving the access Black women have to care, and the care they receive. Its focus is on providing Black people, who are already resilient and powerful, the information and policies they need to achieve improved health outcomes and greater justice.\n\n\n\nNew Voices for Reproductive Justice\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by New Voices for Repro Justice (@newvoicesrj)\n\n\n\nFounded in 2004, New Voices for Reproductive Justice has mobilized thousands of people in southwestern Pennsylvania and beyond to work toward the health and well being of Black women, girls, and trans folks. With its organizing and activism extending to Philadelphia and across the state\u2019s border to Cleveland, Ohio, New Voices works for policy changes that deliver justice to marginalized communities \u2014 such as a ban on the shackling of imprisoned pregnant people.\n\n\n\nSisterLove\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nerror rendering https://twitter.com/SisterLoveInc/status/1080256127038865413?s=20\n\n\nDevoted to serving Black people in the South and beyond who live with HIV, SisterLove began as a grassroots network of volunteers. They\u2019ve grown to provide testing, prevention, education, training, advocacy, and more. SisterLove seeks to break down stigma around HIV/AIDS, and works to eliminate structural barriers to health care. They also train service providers to understand the unique challenges that can face women and communities of color.\n\n\n\nSisterReach\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Black women\u2019s wombs, bodies, children, and parenthood have been the focus of conservative\u2019s misogynistic and racist campaigns for at least the last ten years.\" Tennessee lawmakers cut her mic, but Cherisse Scott of @SisterReach won't be silenced. https://t.co/z78ONbnwGO\u2014 Rewire News Group (@RewireNewsGroup) September 23, 2019\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2011, Memphis-based SisterReach works to support the reproductive autonomy of women, girls, and LGBTQ people of color. Serving people across western Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, and northern Mississippi, SisterReach focuses its efforts on the empowerment of people with low incomes and those who live in rural areas.\u00a0\nSisterReach founder Cherisse Scott established the organization after encountering, at a time when she was pregnant, a crisis pregnancy center confusingly disguised to seem like an abortion provider. \u201cIt's important to note that though this organization convinced me to keep my baby,\" Scott told Oprah magazine in 2018, \"they were nowhere to be found to offer any support for his life, health, education, or well-being.\"\n\n\n\nSPARK Reproductive Justice NOW\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by SPARK Reproductive Justice NOW (@sparkrjnow)\n\n\n\nBased in Atlanta, SPARK advocates for changes in policies, leadership, and culture to empower people and communities to make decisions about their bodies and lives. Among its signature campaigns: an effort to pressure Georgia officials to outlaw the practice of shackling imprisoned pregnant people during labor and delivery.\n\n\n\nWomen With a Vision\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nerror rendering https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxf5nOMFkJu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\nThis Louisiana organization began in response to the spread of HIV/AIDS in communities of color \u2014 and has grown its mission to serve, and work to empower marginalized women of color, LGBTQ communities of color, and families, by confronting the social conditions that hinder their health and well-being.\nToday, Women with a Vision advocates for access to sexual and reproductive health care, sex education, and more \u2014 and works to destigmatize and decriminalize sex work, partnering with one New Orleans judge to divert defendants out of the criminal-justice system.\n\n\nThe Afiya Center\n\u00a0\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by The Afiya Center (@theafiyacenter)\n\n\n\nBased in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, the Afiya Center was founded to help Black women overcome disparities in health access and outcomes. Its establishment was prompted by the disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among Black women and girls in Texas \u2014 and today the organization empowers people in marginalized communities to combat the spread of HIV, while also working to change policies that have caused the dwindling of Texans\u2019 access to sexual, reproductive, and maternal health care.\n\n\nWe Testify\n\n\n\nToday is the anniversary of #RoeVWade. At a time when communities of color, queer people and more have been denied access to abortion #OursToTell is our short film with @PPFA that calls for compassion and protection.

This January, We Testify partnered with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America to release \u2018Ours to Tell\u2019 \u2014 a Sundance-screened short film that amplifies the stories of four women living full and empowered lives because they had the freedom to choose abortion.\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\nThis Black History Month, Planned Parenthood is proud to celebrate the organizations spearheading the movement for reproductive justice \u2014 and remains committed to working with Black-led reproductive justice partners who lead the charge in this fight.\n\n\nFollow @PPBlackComm on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nPP Black Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\u00a0\n\n\n\n Abortion Birth Control Health Care Planned Parenthood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Abortion Still Legal in My State?\n\nLearn about abortion access changes in your state.\n\n\nGet the Facts\n\n\n\n\n\nTell Our Courts: Save Mifepristone!\n\nWe should be able to trust our courts to respect science and follow the law.\u00a0It's time for our leaders to hear us, loud and clear: The attack on mifepristone is a gross injustice that could harm millions of people.\n\n\nSpeak Out Now\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund Will NEVER Back Down\n\nKnow this: our right to abortion is not debatable.\u00a0We will rebuild and reclaim the freedom that is ours.\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for Email\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund works to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITEMAP\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nPressroom\n\n\nTipsheet\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nElections\n\n\n\n\nIssues\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nAbortion Access\n\n\nAttacks on Planned Parenthood\n\n\nBirth Control\n\n\nFederal Courts\n\n\nHealth Equity\n\n\nSexual Assault\n\n\nSex Education\n\n\nState Attacks\n\n\nVoting Rights\n\n\n\n\nCommunities\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nLatinos for Planned Parenthood\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Black Community\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Generation Action\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nBans Off Our Bodies\n\n\nTake Action\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nGet Involved Locally\n\n\nStore\n\n\nCongressional Scorecard\n\n\nRecess Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
