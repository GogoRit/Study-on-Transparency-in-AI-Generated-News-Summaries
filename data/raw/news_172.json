Bill Lee told the Republican caucus last week that pro-life abortion legislation would be the most important work he would do in Nashville, state Sen. Joey Hensley said Thursday.Surrounded by GOP members of the Senate and House, including Hensley, the governor revealed that he wants to enact some of the strictest abortion laws in the country. Those restrictions would include banning women from undergoing the procedure once a fetal heartbeat was detected.\u201cThe governor became very emotional as he introduced his plans,\u201d said Hensley, noting that Lee paused to choke back tears during his comments. \u201cHe cares very much about the unborn and thinks this is the best thing he can do as governor. He said it\u2019s the most important bill he\u2019ll ever push as governor.\u201cShort of banning abortion completely, which we cannot do because of Roe v. Wade, I agree with him. I have been trying to protect the rights of the unborn essentially since I joined the legislature and have sponsored several bills to restrict it,\u201d the senator added.Last year, a bill restricting abortion passed in the House. It stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, who worried about courts throwing it out as unconstitutional.\u201cThis legislation, while not completely drafted at this point, will pass,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cWe probably will have the most complicated abortion law in the country.\u201dLee also said he wanted to ban abortion for those seeking to end pregnancies because of the gender, race or disability of the fetus. The proposed legislation would require an ultrasound before an abortion, which is not required in the state now.\u201cWe\u2019re taking a monumental step forward in celebrating, cherishing and defending life,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be joined by members of the General Assembly who have helped lead the way in this important effort.\u201dThe Republican from Hohenwald said he has been on board for nearly two decades. Hensley was elected to the state Senate in 2012 after serving in the House from 2002-2012.\u201cI have sponsored a lot of pro-life legislation,\u201d said Hensley, who is a medical doctor. \u201cIn 2009, I sponsored a bill that would take state funding away from Planned Parenthood. I sponsored legislation that prevented abortion after 20 week, if the fetus is viable. I am a pro-life legislator and person. We should protect the unborn.\u201cI just think when the baby is conceived, society should be protecting the unborn, not making options for abortion.\u201dHensley noted that he has adopted three children and said adoption remains the best alternative for women who do not want or are not ready for children.\u201cMillions of children have been aborted over the years, and there\u2019s a lot of people who want children and can\u2019t have them,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cAccidents do happen, but we should be obligated to protect them. I am in favor of as few abortions as we can possibly have.\u201dI asked Hensley about the social consequences of restricting abortions. For example, would limits on abortion cost the state more in welfare payments and social programs for struggling single mothers and families?Women had nearly 8,636 induced abortions in Tennessee in 2017, according to the Tennessee Department of Health. The number fell from 14,245 in 2008.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of private organizations that can help expectant mothers,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cIf they do not want to keep it, there are lots of people who want to adopt infants. If they want to keep it, we have a lot of services from the state to assist. We have money available for child care. There\u2019s a lot of entities that can help women if they need it.\u201cYes, I understand the other side of the issue. I just believe in protecting life from unborn babies to the elderly and everywhere in between.\u201d\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6James Bennett is editor of The Daily Herald.
