at conception\u201d bill. \n\n\n\n\n\nIowa anti-abortion groups and some Republican lawmakers are starting the push for a \u201clife at conception\u201d bill that would ban all abortion in Iowa.Maggie DeWitte, who heads the Coalition of Pro-Life Leaders, announced the effort Monday at a Prayer for Life anti-abortion rally at the Statehouse. She said while they\u2019re waiting for a court decision on Iowa\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, anti-abortion groups believe it\u2019s the right time to start pushing for more restrictions.\u201cEven if we win the appeal and get heartbeat, the pro-life community and Iowans are not going to stop at heartbeat,\u201d DeWitte said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop until we\u2019ve eliminated abortion, which means a life at conception bill.\u201dRep. Luana Stoltenberg, R-Davenport, is one of the bill\u2019s sponsors. She said abortion is not a good option for Iowa women, and it should be eliminated from the state.\u201cMy prayer is that Iowa will pass a life at conception bill to protect our most vulnerable and defenseless citizens, and our women and children,\u201d Stoltenberg said.Stoltenberg and a small group of Republican lawmakers already introduced a bill thatwould ban medication abortions. It\u2019s not clear how much traction either of these bills will get at the statehouse.Abortion is currently legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.\u201cAbortion bans take away people\u2019s power over their lives and their futures, and gives control to politicians and judges,\u201d said Mazie Stilwell, director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa. \u201cGov. Reynolds or any legislator should not be in the exam room with a patient and doctor to decide what medical care is best for them.\u201dIt\u2019s still not known how far lawmakers will be able to go in banning abortion as the Iowa Supreme Court prepares to reconsider the level of protection that abortion rights should have in the state.Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds is asking the Court to reinstate her ban on abortionsafter cardiac activity is detected, with some exceptions. That can be as early as six weeks of pregnancy. The Iowa Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in April, and would likely issue a ruling by the end of June.That ruling could reinstate the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, and it could expand lawmakers\u2019 ability to further restrict abortion. Republican leaders in the Iowa Legislature have saidthey want to wait for that ruling before taking action.House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, said Iowans support reproductive freedom.\u201cPoliticians have no place interfering in someone else\u2019s decisions about when to start a family,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe latest plan by MAGA Republicans to ban all abortion without exception will put the lives of too many Iowans at risk.\u201dKonfrst said Democrats want to guarantee abortion rights in the Iowa Constitution.Reynolds and Republican Attorney General Brenna Bird also spoke at the anti-abortion event Monday. They told attendees they\u2019re fighting in court to get the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law reinstated, but they didn\u2019t say if they would support a bill to ban all abortions.Reynolds said keeping the focus on the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bill doesn\u2019t mean doing nothing.\u201cAs we enter a post-Roe world, it\u2019s up to us to show what it means to be a pro-life state,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to not just dismantle abortion\u2019s culture of death, but to build a culture of life.\u201dShe touted her proposals to increase funding for anti-abortion pregnancy resource centers and to create grants to promote fathers\u2019 involvement in parenting.Bird said she was thankful to sign on to defend the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law when she entered office, after her Democratic predecessor refused to defend it in court. She also mentioned that she signed a letter with other Republican attorneys general warning pharmacies of potential legal consequences for mailing abortion pills.\u201cAs long as I\u2019m attorney general, I will work hard and fight to protect the right to life,\u201d Bird said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nState Government News\n2023 Legislative SessionAbortion\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatarina Sostaric\n\n\n                \n                    Katarina Sostaric is IPR's State Government Reporter \n                \n            \n\n\n                        See stories by Katarina Sostaric\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPR's weekly newsletter that helps you make sense of politics and policies.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name  *\n\n\n\n\nLast Name \n\n\n\nNewsletters \n\n\nChatter - Your weekend update\n\n\n\nDaily Digest - Local and national updates every weekday\n\n\n\nPolitical Sense - For what's happening in politics\n\n\n\nAll Access - Your connection to Iowa's music scene\n\n\n\nGarden Variety - Gardening for green thumbs and beginners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews from NPR\n\n\nSo long, Stumpy.
