At 12 weeks the foetus is not capable of consciously perceiving anything and all movements are reflex in nature. \"It is certainly not capable of \"frantic activity\" as described in the film,\" they said.\u00a0\nThe film shows the open mouth of a 12-week foetus on an ultrasound.\u00a0\"At 12 weeks the open mouth of a foetus is not visible on ultrasound,\" they said.\nThe foetus in the film emits a \"silent scream.\" The NGO said that a 12-week foetus does not have formed lungs and certainly does not have any air in them to emit a scream. \"A 12-week foetus does not even display involuntary respiratory movements,\" the group said.\u00a0\n\"Crushing instruments\" are used to crush the fetus's head before it can be extracted.\u00a0Doctors for Choice said this was not required in abortions at 12-weeks. Up until approximately 14 weeks, a suction cannula is all that is needed to extract the pregnancy.\nThe 12-week foetus is referred to as a child.\u00a0The NGO said that at that stage of development the foetus does not have developed organs, and is nowhere close to being able to live independently outside the womb.\nThe film claims that \"brain waves\" are present from six\u00a0weeks. The group said that genuine brain waves begin in the third trimester of pregnancy when the foetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.\nThe film claims that many women who have abortion suffer severe psychological distress. Doctors for Choice said this was also untrue.\u00a0\"Studies have shown that the vast majority (over 95%) of women who have an abortion have no regrets and the minority who do improve over time,\" they said.\n\"The Silent Scream has been shown in Maltese schools for decades and this practice must end. The film misrepresents abortion and fuels stigma, to the detriment of women in Malta who need abortions and have had abortions,\"\u00a0the NGO said.\nThe group said that it would be more beneficial for children to receive evidence-based scientific sexual education to help prevent unwanted pregnancies, coupled with improved access to contraception.\n\"Regardless of how abortion is portrayed, there will always be a need for abortion services, and therefore abortion should be legal and regulated like any other medical procedure,\"\u00a0Doctors for Choice said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Calleja is features editor at MaltaToday \n\n More from Laura Calleja\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise \nContact \nDigital Edition\nSMS Alerts\n\n\nTerms and Conditions \nPrivacy Policy \nCookie Policy \nArchives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaToday is an independent media house based in Malta.
