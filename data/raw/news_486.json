[\u00a0PATRICK SEMANSKY  |  AP\u00a0]By Kirby WilsonTimes staffPublished April 22, 2021|Updated April 22, 2021TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Most abortion bills are controversial. A bill making its way through the Florida House that would ban \u201cdisability abortions\u201d is no exception \u2014 particularly for the disability community.But it\u2019s less the \u201cabortion\u201d part of the bill that\u2019s an issue for some in that community. It\u2019s more the \u201cdisability\u201d part.The bill, House Bill 1221, would ban a doctor from performing an abortion in an instance where they know, or \u201cshould know,\u201d a woman is seeking the procedure \u201dsolely on the basis of\u201d a disability or potential disability found in the fetus. Sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, the bill is part of a national effort to restrict abortion access in these instances. At least nine states have laws banning abortion in similar circumstances; most of those laws have been legal challenged.Proponents of these efforts say it\u2019s a moral imperative to prohibit \u201cdisability abortions,\u201d which they liken to eugenics \u2014 the bigoted practice of striving to improve the human gene pool by removing genetic traits seen as undesirable from the population.On Thursday, Grall\u2019s bill is scheduled to be debated in the House. It could pass this week. However, it\u2019s unlikely to become law this year because a companion measure sponsored by Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez, R-Miami, was first referred to a committee chaired by Democrat Lauren Book. It never got a hearing there.When asked why her bill hadn\u2018t gained any traction in the Senate, Rodriguez said, \u201cThat\u2019s a great question, and I don\u2019t have the answer.\u201dSome advocates for people with disability say the bill, which purports to champion a marginalized community, only pays lip service to the idea. For example, those advocates take issue with the bill\u2019s definition of disability: \u201cany disease, defect, or disorder that is genetically inherited.\u201d (After that definition, the bill then lists several example conditions: Down syndrome; scoliosis; dwarfism; albinism, etc.)Olivia Babis, a senior public policy analyst at the advocacy group Disability Rights Florida, and herself a person with a disability, said that definition does not do those with disabilities justice. Babis said the definition of disability varies depending on the context. In her own home, Babis is comfortable, and has the accommodations she needs. Elsewhere, she needs more help. A better definition, Babis contended, would be a condition that leaves a person with an inability to complete one or more activities of daily living.\u201cIt feels more like a list of stigmatized populations that we can determine in utero than a definition of actual disability,\u201d Babis said.Neither Grall nor her office responded to requests for comments. However, she faced many of the same criticisms enumerated by disability advocates like Babis as the bill made its way through two House committees. In those committees, the criticisms were brought by Democratic opponents of the bill.For example, in response to the criticism about her bill\u2019s definition of \u201cdisability,\u201d Grall said she did not mean to demean the disability community.\u201cThe language in this bill is not intended to shame at all, and if anything it is meant to hold up the fact that each of these different disabilities is something that we value,\u201d Grall said.Laura Minutello of Valrico, who has cerebral palsy, said in an interview that she was at high risk of being aborted because her birth mother was an addict. She noted that like any segment of the American population, the disability community has a diverse set of views when it comes to abortion.But Minutello said that Grall\u2019s bill is hard to square given the track record Florida has of not offering enough of a safety net for people who need extra accommodations.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that I or anybody that I know really disagrees with the intent of the bill, it\u2019s more that within the disability community, we feel that to truly value the lives of people with disabilities, you have to give them the supports and the things that everybody else has,\u201d Minutello said.Babis noted that she requested a special accommodation by the House to testify virtually on the disability abortion bill earlier in the legislative process. The disability advocate said she is especially susceptible to COVID-19, and she didn\u2019t want to risk being infected during a trip to the Capitol \u2014 where several lawmakers have contracted the virus. Even though state agency heads and other advocates have been allowed to testify virtually on bills in the Florida House, Babis\u2019 request was denied.Florida also has tens of thousands of people on its waiting list for services provided under the state\u2019s iBudget waiver. That Medicaid-supported program funds \u2014 often costly \u2014 at-home services for people with developmental disabilities.This year, the Senate and House are currently haggling over funding to get more people off the wait list. The House has proposed spending $15 million to get 306 more people off the list.But advocates say more could be done. The state could offer a program allowing working people with disabilities to buy into the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Lawmakers could spend even more money to get even more people off the wait list. They could also fund more job training initiatives for people with disabilities, or spend more money on home modification programs.Grall fielded the criticism that her abortion bill did not do enough for the disability community at a committee hearing earlier this month. She said she agreed on this point.\u201cI consider myself an advocate for people with disabilities and do understand and appreciate the system is a patchwork,\u201d Grall said then. \u201cThat is outside the scope of my bill, but it\u2019s not outside the scope of my heart for what we need to be doing as a Legislature.\u201dThere are also those in the disability community who say anti-abortion efforts like Grall\u2019s are antithetical to the disability rights movement \u2014 which they say is all about bodily autonomy.Robyn Powell, a visiting assistant professor at Stetson University College of Law, studies the intersection of abortion and reproductive rights. She also has arthrogryposis, a condition which leaves her with limited use of her arms and legs.Powell argued that like every abortion restriction, a \u201cdisability abortion\u201d ban would hurt the least fortunate the most. Well-off abortion seekers, she contended, would still be able to get access to an abortion, and they\u2019d be more likely to have the legal savvy to sidestep this ban. Or they\u2019d be able to travel to another state to get the procedure done.\u201cI see these bills as using disability as a justification for taking abortion rights away,\u201d Powell said.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Tampa Bay Times Florida Legislature coverageGet updates via text message: ConText, our free text messaging service about politics news, brings you the latest from this year's Florida legislative session.Sign up for our newsletter: Get Capitol Buzz, a special bonus edition of The Buzz with Steve Contorno, each Saturday while the Legislature is meeting.We\u2019re working hard to bring you the latest news from the state\u2019s legislative session.
