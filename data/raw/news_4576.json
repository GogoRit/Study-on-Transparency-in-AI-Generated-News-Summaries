Wade, 2022 was a harrowing year in the fight for abortion access. From the halls of state legislatures to clinics, advocates, organizers, and abortion providers worked tirelessly to prepare and protect abortion access. When the Dobbs decision was finalized in June, it wasn\u2019t just the revocation of the federal constitutional right to abortion on paper \u2014 it was a direct attack on our agency over our lives and our futures, with immediate and devastating consequences.\n\n\n \nACLU YEAR-END MATCH CHALLENGE\nHelp us start the new year strong by ensuring our lawyers and organizers have the resources it takes to protect voting rights, abortion access, trans rights, racial justice, and all our civil liberties nationwide. Donate now and your gift will be matched.\n \n\nIn the face of this attack on women\u2019s rights and the bodily autonomy of all people who can become pregnant, we showed up and fought back with the full force of our organization. Alongside our affiliates, partners, volunteers, members, and clients, the ACLU worked to protect and extend access to care in statehouses, courtrooms, and at the ballot box. As we head into the legislative sessions that await us in 2023, we know the road won\u2019t be easy \u2014 but we\u2019re ready. Here\u2019s a look back at how we showed up for abortion access this year.\n\n\n1. Together, we fought back against abortion bans introduced in state legislative sessions earlier in the year, and post-Roe special sessions called in the summer. Though some passed, we were able to defeat bans in key states to preserve health care access.\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Allie Shinn\n\n\n\n\n2. After Roe was overturned, ACLU attorneys and our partners filed lawsuits in nearly a dozen states. We successfully blocked abortion bans in Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Utah, helping to keep abortion services legal for millions of people.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t  This embed will serve content from {{ domain }}.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee our privacy statement\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Alongside our affiliates, supporters, volunteers, and partner organizations, we came together to fight for abortion rights in Kansas and Kentucky and to enshrine reproductive freedom in the Michigan, Vermont, and California state constitutions, and we won every race.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Extreme Politicians Want to Ban Abortion.

In advance of Roe v.

We shared why it\u2019s important to use inclusive language when talking about abortion, and explained how the ACLU talks about this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Why We Use Inclusive Language to Talk About Abortion            \n\n\nWomen aren\u2019t the only people impacted by the fall of Roe v.

But the 2022 midterm elections made it clear where the public stands: a majority of voters do not want to see abortion banned, and they believe the people, not politicians, should have the power to make the best medical decisions for themselves and their families. Building on that momentum, we\u2019ll keep fighting to ensure women and people who need abortion can access the health care they need as we enter into our first year without a right countless people have relied on for 50 years.
