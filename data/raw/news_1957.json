Sign up for our daily newsletter.\nWith abortion bans becoming increasingly unpopular, Republican-led statehouses are walking a delicate line: Trying to advance bills that would restrict access to the procedure without drawing attention, circumventing normal processes to cram new policies through as legislative sessions come to a close.\nLast year, Republican lawmakers across the country pushed restriction after restriction in anticipation of the looming Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision, which in June of last year allowed states to begin banning abortion. But now that those laws can actually take effect, legislators are newly attuned to potential political consequences.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDobbs purported to be a state-by-state settlement, returning this to the states. We\u2019re seeing that play out,\u201d said Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University who focuses on reproductive rights.\u00a0\nLawmakers in a handful of states have pushed meaningful new restrictions.\nNorth Carolina legislators crammed a 12-week ban through last week; Gov. Roy Cooper has said he will veto the ban Saturday, and the legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, is likely to override that veto next week. Florida has passed a ban on abortions after six weeks \u2014 before many people know they are pregnant \u2014 and in South Carolina, where efforts to pass a total abortion ban fell apart after a legislative filibuster, lawmakers appear on track to pass a similar restriction, with plans to work past the end of their session to do so. North Dakota outlawed abortions entirely. And in Nebraska, where efforts to pass a six-week ban barely failed, legislators are pushing a 12-week abortion ban, with the lawmaking session set to end in early June.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        93 days: The summer America lost Roe v. Wade\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe unpopularity of abortion bans means that lawmakers pushing restrictions have in some cases relied on tactics that critics say helped insulate them from popular will.\n\u201cThe question of what to do now that there\u2019s no constitutional right to an abortion and states can ban it \u2014 it forces a set of conversations and questions and concerns that haven\u2019t happened in some of these places,\u201d said Rachel Rebouch\u00e9, dean at the Temple University School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to chart what\u2019s happening on the state level, but I do think it boils down to a question of politics and the importance of state politics.\u201d\nOverturning Roe appears to have made abortion bans more unpopular than ever. Nationally, only about 1 in 3 voters support banning abortion in most or all cases, recent polling suggests. Only about 1 in 10 support banning abortion in all cases. And Americans are now more likely to say that abortion should be easier to access. That data has translated electorally, too: When given the opportunity, voters in states of varying politics \u2014 Kansas, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Vermont and California\u2014 have turned out in large shares in support of abortion rights.\u00a0\nThat in turn has made it harder for states to pass new bans \u2014 at least, without attracting public scrutiny and criticism.\u00a0\nHundreds of abortion-rights demonstrators rally and march in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina in June 2022.\n (Travis Long/The News & Observer/AP)\nIn North Carolina, the state\u2019s 12-week abortion ban was pushed through with little time for debate. Instead of introducing a bill and then opening up legislation to a public committee hearing, a group of Republican lawmakers conferenced in secret to devise new legislative text.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was clear this was an attempt to limit the ability of Democrats to one, influence the bill and two, put things into the public record about the bill,\u201d said Rebecca Kreitzer, an associate professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.\nThe 12-week ban proposal was announced at a news conference during the legislature\u2019s busiest week of the year. The text was released at 11 p.m., attached in a 46-page conference report for another bill that was ostensibly about modifying the state\u2019s \u201csafe haven\u201d law, which allows parents to anonymously give up newborns in designated places. Legislators passed the bill less than 48 hours after the text was first made public.\u00a0\n\u201cThat the bill has a 72-hour waiting period [for abortion], and we had the bill for less than 72 hours is ironic and just horrible,\u201d said state Sen. Rachel Hunt, a Democrat from Charlotte whose father was the state\u2019s longest-ever serving governor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        North Carolina passes 12-week abortion ban\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nIn keeping with the typical rules of the legislature, Hunt said, Democratic state senators had intended to each speak for 30 minutes in protest of the bill. But the Senate\u2019s leadership adopted a different set of rules for the abortion debate, instead enforcing a 10-minute limit on how long people could speak and in some cases cutting lawmakers off if they went past that. That time limit \u2014 and strict enforcement of such \u2014 was \u201cvery unusual,\u201d Hunt said.\nGOP lawmakers in Nebraska, meanwhile, have pushed their 12-week proposal by attaching it as an amendment to a bill that would ban gender-affirming health care for transgender people younger than 19 \u2014 a surprise to many state legislators after the defeat of a proposed six-week ban. Abortion rights supporters in the state have argued that the move to include a 12-week restriction violates the rules of the state legislature, which allow bills to cover only one topic.\u00a0\nAnd in Ohio and Missouri, two states where abortion rights supporters are pushing to have voters weigh in directly on whether to protect abortion rights, Republican legislators are attempting to raise the threshold required for voter-initiated constitutional amendments. Neither such proposal has yet passed.\nStill, the pushback against abortion restrictions appears to have changed what lawmakers have been able to pass, at least in the short term. Anti-abortion activists began the year eager to push for abortion bans in states where the procedure remained legal, and to find ways to prevent people from accessing medication abortion pills \u2014\u00a0especially in states with abortion bans.\nBut states where abortion is already banned \u2014 such as Texas, Oklahoma or Missouri \u2014\u00a0have seen little anti-abortion activity this year. Oklahoma\u2019s session ended with no new abortion restrictions. Neither Missouri nor Texas has advanced a single anti-abortion bill thus far this year, despite lawmakers\u2019 introduction of proposals to limit access to medication abortion or to limit sources of funding for people trying to leave the state for an abortion.\u00a0\nInstead of abortion restrictions, those states have prioritized restricting access to gender-affirming care, focusing largely on trans youth, Kreitzer noted. In Texas, the government has also focused on putting more money to support anti-abortion centers, which attempt to dissuade people from terminating pregnancies, and offer free, but often inaccurate, ultrasounds.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        Florida advocates set to launch campaign to get abortion rights on the ballot in 2024\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nTexas has become the center of a new hotbed for the battle over abortion rights:\u00a0the federal courts, where judges will decide in the coming months whether to limit access to mifepristone, one of two pills used for medication abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen less state legislation in that area this year in large part because of the multiple federal lawsuits going on,\u201d Glenn said.\u00a0\nOne such case, which will be argued before an appeals court next week, was originally filed in Texas, where plaintiffs have more leeway in choosing who will hear their case \u2014\u00a0a practice known as \u201cforum shopping.\u201d\u00a0\nThat too, some scholars noted, could offer one of the most meaningful avenues to restrict access to abortion \u2014 and is also insulated from democratic pushback. Federal judges can have the power to effect policy that may not be able to get the votes to pass in a state legislature. They are also unelected, and not typically held accountable to voters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s revealing [Republicans are] focusing on the courts,\u201d Kreitzer said. \u201cIn the long term,\u00a0 Republicans know they are on the losing side of some of these issues, so they are trying to finalize things as quickly as they can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        Americans are becoming more supportive of abortion. So why aren\u2019t Republican politicians listening?\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the immediate term, that\u2019s been made difficult by the political reality of uniting enough lawmakers around strict abortion bans.\nBefore turning to a 12-week ban, Nebraska Republicans pushed a six-week restriction, which failed due to a legislative filibuster; Republicans fell one vote short of the supermajority needed to override that filibuster.\u00a0\nSouth Carolina\u2019s conservative House of Representatives tried to pass a total abortion ban but was unable to find support in the Senate , thanks to a filibuster by that body\u2019s five women members. Abortion opponents in the state have since framed a six-week ban as a compromise. The state legislature, whose session was scheduled to end Thursday, will have to return for extra lawmaking days specifically to find the time to pass a ban palatable to both chambers.\nAnti-abortion activists acknowledge they have had to scale back their ambitions this year in part because of the backlash to more onerous restrictions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reality of where the public is and even where the majority of lawmakers are,\u201d said Katie Glenn, state policy director for the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\u00a0\nIn states like Nebraska and South Carolina, she suggested, stricter limitations had the support of most Republican lawmakers \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t necessarily enough.\u00a0\n\u201cThat type of a process can be very frustrating, especially when you\u2019ve got 60 percent [lawmaker support], not the 65 we need. It can feel like, \u2018Why should we have to bend for one person?\u2019 But you can also understand it as a step-by-step process.\u201d\nBut even an incremental approach, she said, can over time dramatically curb access to abortion. Glenn pointed to Florida, a state where two years ago, it was impossible to get a 20-week ban out of committee. Last year, in the lead-up to Dobbs, a conservative majority passed the state\u2019s 15-week ban, which is currently in effect. This spring, the state\u2019s six-week ban sailed through the statehouse, where Republicans now hold a supermajority. The bill will not take effect unless the Florida Supreme Court rules this summer to strike down the state right to an abortion.\nOther states could take a similar path. In North Carolina, House Speaker Tim Moore told reporters that the 12-week ban was sufficient policy for now but indicated openness to revisiting abortion restrictions in future years. And if Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is elected governor in 2024, state legislators would no longer need a conservative supermajority to pass anti-abortion policy.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not clear if South Carolina and Nebraska could pass stricter laws in coming years \u2014\u00a0but the slim margins by which their proposed bans failed suggests it\u2019s likely, Murray said.\n\u201cThey overplayed their hand but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were rejected, but not overwhelmingly so. That to me is the bigger story.\u201d\nOnly two states \u2014 Florida and Idaho \u2014 have passed abortion ban exceptions for people pregnant as a result of rape or incest. Efforts to add such exceptions collapsed this week in Louisiana, and similar bills in Oklahoma and Tennessee died earlier this year.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how states plan to limit abortion \u2014 even where it is already banned\n\n\n\n\nThree GOP-led states are set to vote on new abortion bans today\n\n\n\n\nA proposed six-week abortion ban in Florida could threaten access for the entire South\n\n\n\n\nWhy so many abortion restrictions are working their way through state legislatures now\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
