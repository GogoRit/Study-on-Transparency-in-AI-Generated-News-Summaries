May 7, 2019:  Gov. Brian Kemp signed the \u201cfetal heartbeat bill\u201d into law Tuesday morning, CBS News reports, telling those in attendance: \n\u201cGeorgia is a state that values life. We protect the innocent, we champion the vulnerable, we stand up and speak for those that are unable to speak for themselves.\u201d\nThe bill, a clear challenge to Roe v. Wade, will be challenged by The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights before it goes into effect in January 2020.\nEarlier:\nGov. Brian Kemp is poised to sign a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d into law on Tuesday, banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, in one of the nation\u2019s strictest abortion laws. \nAccording to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Kemp is expected to sign the bill at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, although it is not clear where or what kind of ceremony will take place.\nThe signing of the bill is almost sure to cause a long legal battle that Republicans and other supporters hope will land in the U.S. Supreme Court as a challenge to Roe v. Wade, given that two new conservative justices currently sit on the Supreme Court, AJC notes.\nDemocrats, medical lobbies, and civil rights organizations have strongly opposed the bill, saying that it could force women to take desperate, dangerous steps to terminate a pregnancy, and could also put Georgia\u2019s pro-business reputation at risk. \nThe new law would completely ban abortions once a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat, which usually occurs at six weeks, before most women even know that they are pregnant. It is also a far step back from Georgia\u2019s current law, which bans abortions after 20 weeks. \nTOPICS:\u00a0  abortion law Brian Kemp Georgia heartbeat abortion law roe v wade\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
