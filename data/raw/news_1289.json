(WyoFile/Jackson Hole News&Guide/AP/Bradly J. Boner)\n\n\n\n \nWe appreciate you being a member of the WyoFile community. Our work is made possible by dedicated members like you who invest in our reporting - thank you!\n\n\nA judge has ordered that the suit challenging the constitutionality of Wyoming\u2019s abortion ban be certified, or advanced, to the Wyoming Supreme Court, and has enumerated 12 questions of law for justices to answer.\nNinth District Judge Melissa Owens issued the order Wednesday afternoon, siding with the state of Wyoming that sought to move the issue to the higher court.\nThree women and two pro-choice groups sued the state earlier this year claiming the abortion ban, which became law on July 27, was unconstitutional.\nOwens issued a temporary restraining order July 28 and then a preliminary injunction preventing the law from taking effect.\n\u201cThe matter involves questions of law which will be determinative of the cause and concerning which it appears there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Wyoming Supreme Court,\u201d Owens wrote. Under court rules, the high court \u201cmay answer questions of law certified to it by \u2026 a state district court\u2026.\u201d\nThe questions of law to be answered include whether the abortion ban bill as codified violates the Wyoming Constitution\u2019s Article 1, sections 2, 3, 6, 7, 18, 33, 34, 36, 38 and Article 21, section 25. Her order also asks the Supreme Court to answer whether the abortion ban bill is \u201cunconstitutionally vague on its face\u201d and whether it violates a Wyoming citizen\u2019s right to privacy.\nOwens on Wednesday also filed a 13-page order denying two legislators\u2019 and Right to Life of Wyoming\u2019s requests to intervene, or join, in the case.\u00a0\n\u201cThe court is sympathetic to the [legislators and Right to Life\u2019s] desire to intervene in this matter,\u201d Owens wrote. \u201cAs advocates and lawmakers, the Court recognizes that the issues before the Court strike at the very heart of RTLW\u2019s advocacy efforts as well as the individual Legislators\u2019 personal convictions and legislative efforts.\n\u201cHowever,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthe [legislators\u2019 and RTLW\u2019s] interests do not rise to the level of a significant protectable interest under the law.\u201d\n \n\n\nBECOME A WYOFILE MEMBER!\nStories like this are free to read, but not free to produce.

But if the abortion ban is upheld it will cease to be true.  Women will be denied, under the law and in contrast to men, the right to make medical decisions about their own bodies.\nThis denial of rights is usually applied to only minor children and mentally incompetent persons.   So if the abortion ban is upheld, the question arises as to whether women should even have the right to vote.\nRepublican women of Wyoming:  Be careful what you wish for.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas L.

I appreciate Wyofile\u2019s thorough and balanced reporting on the case. I am even more impressed with Judge Owens\u2019 work on this difficult and high profile case. Her even temperament, judicial demeanor, and thoughtful, reasoned and articulate decisions are impressive. Her work makes me proud of being a fellow UW College of Law grad. (Class of 1974) with Judge Owens, and to have served in the same profession as Judge Owens.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\nFacebook   \n\n\nInstagram   \n\n\nTwitter   \n\n\nLinkedIn   \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nReport: Wyoming needs more affordable housing, but challenges differ by county\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\nNon-woke Wyoming senators are asleep at the switch\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\nBattle of Republican factions moving to the ballot box\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\nWyoming\u2019s 988 suicide lifeline financially secure, even without a fully funded trust, lawmakers say\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\nAs disease threatens feedground elk, Wyoming mired in planning and consensus-seeking\nMarch 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nCareers\nFreelancing\nUnderwriting\nHow to Republish\nContact Us\nReport an Error\nNewsletter Archive\nWyoFile Mobile App\n \n\n\n\u00a9 2024 WyoFile .\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPowered by Newspack\t\t\t\t\n\nFacebook\nX\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.
