At Friday\u2019s hearing, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will decide whether that remaining challenge should be sent to the Texas Supreme Court or proceed in federal court.\nLawyers for Texas abortion providers have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and force the 5th Circuit to instead send the case to a federal district court. The Supreme Court has not yet responded to that motion and unless it does before Friday, the appeals hearing will proceed as scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday\u2019s hearing is unlikely to change much about abortion access in Texas, where abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy have been effectively banned for more than four months.\n\u201cThe best thing would have been for the Supreme Court to block this unconstitutional law, but we didn\u2019t get that,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas. \u201cSo we just have to keep trying to get some relief from this law.\u201d\nBut this last remaining challenge from the Supreme Court case will not substantially change the crux of the law, which empowers private citizens to sue anyone who, as the law says, \u201caids or abets\u201d in an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure people are fully appreciating the impact of that Supreme Court ruling,\u201d said Marc Hearron, senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the abortion providers. \u201cThe Supreme Court \u2026 has given the green light to these bounty-hunting schemes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvading judicial review\nThe Texas law, originally passed as Senate Bill 8, makes it illegal to help a pregnant patient obtain an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973 that states cannot ban abortion before the point at which a fetus could likely survive outside the womb, usually around 24 weeks. For decades, the courts have blocked states, including Texas, from enacting pre-viability bans.\nBut SB 8 was specifically designed to withstand judicial challenge by empowering private citizens \u2014 not state officials \u2014 to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d in a prohibited abortion for at least $10,000 per abortion.\nBy design, government officials are removed from enforcing the law, leaving abortion providers with no government entity to challenge in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFearing financial ruin, abortion providers in Texas have completely ceased the procedure after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is often before a patient even knows they are pregnant.\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health, which runs four abortion clinics in Texas, is the lead plaintiff on the case. Hagstrom Miller said the clinics have been serving less than 30% of their usual patient load since the law went into effect in September.\n\u201cSome people are going straight to Louisiana or another state where it\u2019s more accessible,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a lot of people are just disappearing. They know their options are gone, they know they are over the limit and those are the folks that you are going to see over the next generation be impacted in really long-term ways.\u201d\nIn November, lawyers for the abortion providers argued before the Supreme Court that the law is unconstitutional and could be blocked by preventing the judicial system from taking these cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the high court largely disagreed with the challenges brought by lawyers for the abortion providers. It did allow one challenge to proceed against state officials who would be responsible for revoking the medical licenses of anyone who was sued under the law.\n\u201cDoctors, nurses and pharmacists are at risk of losing their medical licenses if they violate this law,\u201d said Hearron.\nBut even if the court were to block these licensing officials from taking action, the primary threat of the law remains in place. Abortion providers could still face countless civil lawsuits, each for at least $10,000, for every abortion they perform.\nHagstrom Miller said her organization is committed to seeing this challenge through to the end, no matter how narrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll get some relief,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to predict how much relief we\u2019ll need for people to resume care.\u201d\nWhere the case goes from here\nThe 5th Circuit has said it will consider whether the case should now be sent to the Texas Supreme Court to weigh in on whether the challenge to the medical licensing officials can proceed.\nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. But in a court filing, lawyers for the state argued that sending the case to the Texas Supreme Court is the proper move.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court made clear that it was offering only a tentative interpretation of Texas law,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cThe court reaffirmed that federal courts must follow the state judiciary\u2019s interpretations of state law.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawyers for the abortion providers argued in a motion filed to the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit should instead have immediately sent the case back down to the district court. 5th Circuit Judge Stephen A. Higginson agreed, writing in a dissent that there is nothing left for the court to consider.\n\u201cThe defendants already lost this point in the Supreme Court,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey should not get a second bite.\u201d\nInvolving the state supreme court could add months, or longer, to the resolution of this case. The U.S. Supreme Court did not block the law while this is being litigated, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is unlikely to do so either.\nThe only real path to blocking the law runs through the district court, Hearron said. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman briefly blocked the law in October, and there\u2019s a pending motion for summary judgment before him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe plan for now is to keep trying to get back into district court to get a declaratory judgment,\u201d said Hearron. \u201cApart from that, providers are going to have to take a hard look at what they\u2019re going to be able to do.\u201d\nOne option is for providers to intentionally violate the law and then challenge the resulting lawsuit in court on constitutional grounds. In October, Dr. Alan Braid, an abortion provider in San Antonio, said he had performed a prohibited abortion. He was sued three times and has asked a federal judge to throw out the suits on the grounds that the law is unconstitutional.\nThat case is ongoing.\nHagstrom Miller said she \u201cfantasizes\u201d about all the abortion providers statewide banding together to violate the law. But that would require putting their faith in a court system that has proven increasingly hostile toward abortion access in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this new [Supreme] Court has done just this year, it\u2019s night and day from even six years ago,\u201d she said, referring to her 2016 victory at the Supreme Court knocking down a slew of abortion restrictions. \u201cI just don\u2019t think in this country generally we can look to the court system for the relief we\u2019ve gotten in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
