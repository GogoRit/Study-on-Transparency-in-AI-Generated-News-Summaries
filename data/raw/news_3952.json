Helena\u2019s case is the first to grapple with the issue of the violation of sexual and reproductive rights of ex-combatant women and girls during the 55-year civil conflict in Colombia. While the full judgment has yet to be handed down, here we set out the Colombian Constitutional Court\u2019s key findings based on the official summary, giving an overview of the significance of this landmark case brought by\u00a0Women\u2019s Link Worldwide.\nThe Constitutional Court of Colombia in session in 2015 (Avilajuan,\u00a0CC BY-SA 4.0)\nThe Colombian peace process\nFollowing the signing of the\u00a0peace accord\u00a0in 2016, Colombia is going through a transition to peace with a number of institutions set up to deal with the aftermath of the conflict.\u00a0 These include the JEP (Jurisdicci\u00f3n Especial para la Paz) a transitional body that started work in March 2018 and which considers cases regarding fundamental rights violations by the military and by the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). Alongside the judicial mandate of the JEP, there is also a Truth Commission which receives reports of fundamental rights violations.\nAs well as these special jurisdictions, the Constitutional Court in Colombia plays a significant role with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and\u00a0has made important decisions in respect of sexual violence against women in the context of armed conflict. In Colombia, individuals can file a legal action known as a\u00a0tutela\u00a0\u2013 a legal mechanism by which an individual can ask a court to protect their fundamental rights under the Constitution. This is an important mechanism which has been used to guarantee women\u2019s rights and other significant human rights issues including\u00a0environmental protection of the Amazon. The Victims Act (Ley de Victimas y Restiucion de Tierras, 1448 of 2011) is designed to provide comprehensive reparations for victims of human rights abuses incurred during the conflict, including human rights abuses suffered by women and children and land restitution.\nThe Helena case\nHelena was 14- year- old when she was forcibly recruited into the FARC. She was forced to use contraception and was also made to undergo an abortion and was thus subject to reproductive and sexual gender-based violence. Despite this, Helena\u2019s claim for recognition as a victim within the terms of the Victims Act (Ley de Victimas y Restiucion de Tierras, 1448 of 2011) was rejected by the Integral Attention and Reparation Unit for Victims (hereafter \u2018Reparations Unit\u2019).\u00a0 She had applied for recognition as a victim of violations of her right to health, human dignity and personal integrity and had sought reparations for these violations.\nThere were many female combatants within the FARC, including some that were recruited by force as minors (DEA, public domain)\nHowever, the Reparations Unit rejected Helena\u2019s application as a victim of the FARC even though she had been forcibly recruited as a minor had undergone a forced abortion and had been displaced. This was on the basis of\u00a0Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Victims Act\u00a0which excludes members of the FARC from the ambit of the Victims\u2019 Law, with the exception of boys and girls who were still minors at the time of demobilisation. This interpretation of the law favoured their identification as former combatants with FARC, obscuring the reality of the conflict-related sexual and reproductive violence they endured during their time in the FARC forces. This meant that there was no legal recognition of those abuses or mechanism for reparations for those who were forcibly recruited as children into the FARC and had become adults by the time of demobilisation.\u00a0As explained by Mariana Ardila, the lawyer who brought the case to the Court, this placed Helena in a judicial limbo in that she had no other effective judicial means to access reparations for the sexual violence that she had suffered.\nThe Constitutional Court upheld Helena\u2019s appeal and ordered the Reparations Unit to include Helena in the Registry of Victims (\u201cRUV\u201d). \u00a0On the facts before it, the Court concluded that Helena had suffered grave violations of her human rights and that the state has a responsibility to ensure that victims of sexual and reproductive violence committed in the context of the armed internal conflict have access to reparation measures.\nThe Court held that Article 3, paragraph 2 of Victims\u2019 Act should not act as an obstacle for victims of sexual violence including those who were former combatants, because at the same time, they were victims of forced recruitment. The summary shows that the Court reached its conclusion by reference to both international humanitarian law and international criminal law. The Court ordered the Reparations Unit to ensure that Helena would be provided with both physical and psychological gender-sensitive support, in order both to help her recover from the sexual violence that she had suffered and to re-establish her mental and emotional well-being.\nOn the facts before it, the Court concluded that Helena had suffered grave violations of her human rights and that the state has a responsibility to ensure that victims of sexual and reproductive violence committed in the context of the armed internal conflict have access to reparation measures.\nSignificantly, according to the summary, the Court also ordered the personnel in the Reparations Unit to ensure that within the reparations process they include a gender perspective and reminded them of their due diligence obligations in relation to fundamental rights in this regard. It also ordered the state to ensure that women and girls, including adolescents who are survivors of sexual violence perpetrated by armed groups, are provided with specialised and immediate medical and psychological attention for the abuse that was committed against them.\nSignificance of the judgment\nWhile the full significance of the decision will become clear once the Constitutional Court judgment becomes available, the decision nonetheless has significant repercussions for ex-combatant victims of sexual violence within Colombia. Moreover, the decision is significant for international law because it recognises the gendered nature of life within armed militia, including the control asserted over the sexual and reproductive autonomy of young girls. It thus confirms the obligation on states to recognise that they too are victims of conflict-affected violations of their rights and as such are entitled to reparations. This is an essential element for the removal of stigma, for building a comprehensive and gendered understanding of the different ways in which young girls were forced to support the armed groups and for moving forward in post-conflict societal reconstruction.\n\u00a0\nNotes:\n\u2022 The views expressed here are of the authors rather than the Centre or the LSE\n\u2022 This blog was written with the support of an Arts and Humanities Research Council grant called \u2018A Feminist International Law on Peace and Security\u2019 and a European Research Council (ERC) grant under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation\u202fprogramme\u202f(Grant agreement No. 786494)\n\u2022 First published by the\u00a0LSE Women, Peace, and Security Blog\n\u2022\u00a0Please read our\u00a0Comments Policy\u00a0before commenting\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nChristine Chinkin\n\n\nChristine Chinkin, Fellow of the British Academy, is Emerita Professor of International Law and founding Director of LSE's Centre for Women, Peace and Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeina Yoshida\n\n\nKeina is a Research Officer in the Centre for Women, Peace, and Security, where she works on the AHRC funded project Feminist Approaches to the International Law of Peace and Security (FILPS).
