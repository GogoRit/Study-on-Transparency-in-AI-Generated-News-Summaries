Long Garc\u00edaJuly 25, 2022A participant in the fourth annual Virginia March for Life in Richmond, Va., on April 27, 2022, carries a sign in Spanish reading \"Pray for an end to abortion.\" (CNS photo/Michael Mickle, The Catholic Virginian)A new survey from the Public Religion Research Institute hints at what could be a major swing in Latino Catholic views on abortion. According to this poll, 75 percent of Hispanic Catholics say abortion should be legal in \u201cmost or all cases,\u201d up from 51 percent in a P.R.R.I. poll in 2010.P.R.R.I. conducted the latest survey from June 24 to 26, immediately after the Supreme Court announced its reversal of Roe v. Wade. Overall, 65 percent of U.S. adults said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 55 percent in 2010. The pollster also reported a major swing in support for abortion among Black Protestants: 75 percent supported abortion in most or all cases, up from 56 percent in 2010.According to this poll, 75 percent of Hispanic Catholics say abortion should be legal in \u201cmost or all cases,\u201d up from 51 percent in 2010.The P.R.R.I. results are not conclusive, as researchers acknowledged that small sample sizes make it more difficult to determine statistically significant differences among the minority populations surveyed. (The study reached 2,038 individuals overall, 104 of whom identified as Hispanic Catholics.) But the 24-point shift among Hispanic Catholics in at least this one poll raises the question: Are views on abortion changing in the Latino community?Conversations with Latino and pro-life leaders revealed at least three reasons to be cautious about the poll results and suggested where discussions about abortion need to go next.Do Latinas see abortion as a women\u2019s rights issue?Whether Latino and Latina views on abortion are changing is not a simple question to answer, according to Gina Vides, the associate director of parish and community leadership for the Los Angeles Archdiocese\u2019s Office of Life, Justice and Peace.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that they\u2019re \u2018for\u2019 abortion, because that\u2019s not the case,\u201d she said. Many Latinos in California, she explained, are reluctant to say they\u2019re \u201cpro-life\u201d because they associate the term with the Republican Party, which is unpopular in this state. But that does not mean they agree with Democrats in California who talk about abortion access as a women\u2019s empowerment issue.\u201cIf you ask young Latinas what empowerment means to them, I guarantee the answer isn\u2019t abortion.\u201d\u201cIf you ask young Latinas what empowerment means to them, I guarantee the answer isn\u2019t abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say [it] means the opportunity to go to school, to work, to make a fair wage above minimum wage so that one day you can own a home, you can have your own family, you can be independent. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned that our communities want. That has nothing to do with abortion.\u201dDoes a single poll indicate a permanent shift in opinion?Another reason to view the new P.R.R.I. poll with caution is that the supposed shift in attitudes toward abortion among Hispanic Catholics has not been steady. In fact, it seems to have occurred only in the past couple of years, when abortion has become more politically polarized than ever. As late as 2019, P.R.R.I. reported 52 percent of Hispanic Catholics saying that abortion should be illegal in \u201cmost or all cases.\u201dThat same study from 2019, however, did find that 55 percent of Hispanic Catholics ages 18 to 24 thought abortion should be legal in most or all cases. And while 59 percent of Hispanic immigrants opposed legalized abortion in most or all cases, 57 percent of Hispanics born in the United States favored abortion legality in most or all cases. Given that migration to the United States has declined in recent years, the pro-life movement will need to make inroads with the U.S.-born Latino community just to stay in place.As late as 2019, P.R.R.I. reported 52 percent of Hispanic Catholics saying that abortion should be illegal in \u201cmost or all cases.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that there has been a real shift, but it may not be as large as the numbers make it look like,\u201d said Ken Johnson-Mondrag\u00f3n, the director of pastoral engagement for the California Catholic Conference.\u201cI was at a training for Pastoral Juvenil [Hispanic youth ministry] over the weekend, and the folks I was talking to were expressing very pro-life convictions. But they were saying, \u2018We are outliers. We\u2019re having a hard time talking to our peers who see things differently,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson-Mondrag\u00f3n believes that the frenzy of media coverage following the reversal of Roe likely boosted pro-choice numbers, at least for now. But he also noted recent signs of Latinos leaving the Democratic Party, which would seem to contradict the P.R.R.I. study\u2019s findings about growing pro-choice views in the community.Has the abortion conversation just been rebooted?Overall, Julie Fritsch Dumalet, the director of the pro-life office for the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, found the survey findings surprising. Ms. Dumalet did say, however, that she was recently invited to speak to a young adult group at a largely Latino parish where members were at odds about abortion. (More than 70 percent of Catholics under 30 in her archdiocese are Latino.)\u201cIt is something people are talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do I feel about this now that there's more freedom on the part of the state to ban this procedure outright? A lot of people are getting involved in this conversation, and they didn\u2019t feel like they needed to before.\u201dChanging attitudes on abortionIn 1973, Roe v. Wade \u201crudely interrupted\u201d a national debate that was taking place about abortion, according to Andrew Rivas, the manager for public policy and advocacy for the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. \u201cThe issue is now going back to the public square,\u201d he said, and the growing Latino community will be an important part of the debate.While he describes his family as generally pro-life, Mr. Rivas said has noticed tensions between relatives on the issue.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different conversation because it\u2019s a whole different environment now,\u201d he said.Latino Catholics and the faith communityAccording to the recent P.R.R.I. study, only 16 percent of respondents said they looked to religious leaders for guidance on abortion. The study also reported that 71 percent of Americans believed it was more \u201csocially acceptable\u201d to support abortion. Taking into account what appears to be the church\u2019s waning influence on the topic, how should Catholic Latinos engage in the conversation about abortion in the United States?Latino and pro-life leaders had a number of suggestions, including finding issues pro-life and abortion rights supporters can agree on and pushing for church action and legislative solutions that address problems like poverty, the high cost of child care and employer policies that make it harder for working women to have children.\u201cIt\u2019s contrary to human dignity for a woman to have to choose between an education and the life of her child,\u201d Ms. Dumalet said. \u201cIt\u2019s also contrary to human dignity that a woman would lose her job because she became pregnant. We don\u2019t want children to grow up in poverty with parents that didn\u2019t want to raise them and who have no other options. We can come to a meeting of the minds with these concerns. So let\u2019s work toward other solutions.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s contrary to human dignity for a woman to have to choose between an education and the life of her child.\u201dSolutions may come from state governments offering companies incentives to enact family-friendly policies, she said. And the church can do more to help families as well. In some ways, it has already started.Ms. Dumalet noted Walking With Mothers in Need, a U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops program that seeks to accompany mothers throughout the lives of their children. In Houston, the program helps mothers with children from 1 to 18 years of age.The 12 dioceses in California have teamed up to launch We Were Born Ready, an initiative overseen by the California Catholic Conference that seeks to mobilize the faith community in the state to serve women, children and families. That effort includes supporting proposals being considered by California legislators to expand paid leave, give vouchers for homeless pregnant women and provide better family support for incarcerated mothers.Such programs provide a stark contrast with abortion rights advocates who, Ms. Dumalet believes, offer abortion as the only solution. She noted the pledges to help fly women in states with abortion restrictions to other states to have the procedure. \u201cMy thought is, \u2018O.K., are you also willing to pay for paid parental leave for that employee should she decide that she wants to parent that child? Would you be willing to pay for health care for her dependent?\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Vides agreed. Legislators are considering 22 bills to expand access to abortion in California, but she said, \u201cMothers are not looking for abortion expansion, but for help with basic necessities that they need to survive and thrive here,\u201d adding that simple measures like rental assistance would lead to fewer abortions.Abortion rights proponents \u201clink abortion to poverty and say it\u2019s the poor women of color who need abortions,\u201d Ms. Vides said. \u201c[But] wait a minute. Our country has had abortion for the last 50 years, and that has not solved poverty. After an abortion, women return to the same space of oppression that they\u2019ve been living in. They\u2019re still in poverty. They\u2019re still homeless. They\u2019re still with an abusive partner.\u201dIn short, Ms. Vides said, Latinas with unexpected pregnancies want options beyond abortion.[Want to discuss politics with other America readers?
