These attacks are coming from all sides, whether in countries with autocratic rule or established democracies like the United States.\nOn October 1, world leaders at this year\u2019s virtual United Nations General Assembly have a chance to recognize and help neutralize this threat during a\u00a0high-level event\u00a0on gender equality and empowering women and girls.\u00a0\nThe landmark 1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women reinforced \u201cwomen\u2019s rights as human rights\u201d and created\u00a0a strong vision and\u00a0blueprint for action. On its 25th\u00a0anniversary, taking stock of progress made and challenges ahead is a mixed exercise, both inspiring and grim.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s inspiring because movements for gender equality have shattered norms, introduced rights-respecting legislation around the world, and in many areas significantly shifted access to education, health, jobs, and individual freedoms for women, girls, and gender-nonconforming people. For example, the number of\u00a0out-of-school girls dropped by 79 million\u00a0between 1998 and 2018, and 155 countries currently have\u00a0laws addressing domestic violence.\u00a0\nIn other areas, there has been significant progress, but simply too slow or not enough. For example, global maternal mortality dropped by\u00a038 percent between 2000 and 2017. Yet the goal is to eliminate preventable\u00a0maternal deaths \u2013 and most are preventable. The inequities in access to health care are stark across national borders, for\u00a0women and girls living amid armed conflict,\u00a0and across\u00a0race, ethnicity, and class. Women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights to access and claim property, including to\u00a0matrimonial property\u00a0or\u00a0inheritance, still lag behind.\u00a0\nWomen\u2019s representation in positions of economic and political power has advanced at a glacial rate. The\u00a0gender gap in labor force participation\u00a0has stagnated at 31 percent over the past 20 years. In 2019,\u00a0women held just 25 percent of parliamentary (lower-house) seats and 21 percent of ministerial positions\u00a0globally. In a stark and symbolic example,\u00a0\u00a047 male speakers took the floor in the opening days of this year\u2019s UN General Assembly before the first woman, President Zuzana Caputova of Slovakia, spoke.\nThe road ahead feels grim because as activists for gender equality, we face not only the hard work of moving forward, but pushing back against powerful attempts to roll back women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights. Disturbingly, if governments sat down together today to chart out a new platform on women\u2019s rights, it is unlikely they could agree on one as progressive as what was negotiated 25 years ago.\u00a0\nMargaret Atwood\u2019s haunting tale of reproductive servitude in\u00a0The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u00a0looks less like fiction than shades of reality. Real-world examples include horrific accounts of bride trafficking in\u00a0China\u00a0and attempts to\u00a0effectively eliminate access to safe and legal abortions\u00a0in the United States. Fifty-eight countries have signed a US-drafted joint statement ostensibly supporting the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u00a0\u00a0While it looks innocent enough on the surface, the goal of the US statement is actually quite sinister.\n\u00a0It seeks\u00a0to promote the Trump administration\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights, a regressive exercise attempting to undermine the universality of all human rights. In particular, it seeks\u00a0to\u00a0downgrade the rights\u00a0of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and the rights of women and girls, including access to reproductive health services. The list of countries essentially endorsing the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to redefine rights includes those with abysmal or worsening track records on women\u2019s rights\u2013Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.\u00a0\nActivists are under attack. Male politicians make an astounding number of\u00a0sexist, demeaning remarks\u00a0about women leaders and gender equality. Women human rights defenders\u00a0face increasing threats\u00a0to their physical and online security, and their\u00a0ability to organize and finance gender equality work.\nGender-based violence continues\u00a0\u00a0in the home, workplace, communities, and conflicts to subjugate women, girls, and gender-nonconforming individuals while reinforcing patriarchal structures and privilege. Governments often\u00a0fail to protect\u00a0lesbian, bisexual, queer, and transgender women\u00a0from violence, whether\u00a0domestic violence,\u00a0police violence, or\u00a0community violence.\u00a0One in three women\u00a0worldwide have experienced sexual violence or domestic violence in their lifetime, and as many as\u00a038 percent of women murdered\u00a0were killed by an intimate partner. Despite numerous resolutions and commitments to \u201cwomen, peace, and security,\u201d prevention and response to gender-based violence in conflict remains woefully weak.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has further altered the landscape for achieving the goals set out in Beijing and in the\u00a0UN Sustainable Development Goals\u00a0on\u00a0gender equality. Women make up\u00a070 percent of front-line health workers, and often in the most precarious and unprotected roles \u2014 home health aides, cleaning staff, community health workers, and nursing home staff. Caregiving falls disproportionately to women and girls, straining participation in education and employment. Reports of\u00a0domestic violence have increased\u00a0during lockdowns in many countries, while\u00a0services\u00a0such as\u00a0shelters\u00a0and psychosocial \u2013 mental health \u2013or legal support remain woefully under-resourced. Services that do exist often are not accessible to or do not consider the specific requirements of older women or\u00a0women with disabilities.\nWhat has worked, and where should advocates of gender equality invest? The greatest hope comes from the diverse movements that have exposed gender injustice and fought for change. Despite concerted political opposition, sexual and reproductive rights advocates have successfully liberalized abortion laws in\u00a0dozens of countries. Domestic workers have mobilized at national and global levels to expose labor and other abuses, push for and win\u00a0international standards, and translate them into\u00a0national reforms. The #MeToo movement\u00a0transformed public debate\u00a0about sexual violence and has launched sustained momentum to shift social norms, support survivors, and demand accountability.\u00a0\nWhat should governments do? They need to recognize that women\u2019s rights are not secondary but integral to addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, looming economic recession, armed conflict, elections, and climate change. Addressing the gender impact of these issues, promoting women\u2019s leadership, and backing up commitments with real economic resources and political will at all levels are essential.\nThe 25th\u00a0anniversary of the Beijing conference could have been a celebration of progress made instead of a somber assessment of current and future dangers. Governments meeting October 1 can give us reason for hope by committing to new and measurable concrete actions, backed with dedicated resources and timelines to expedite progress on gender equality. The time to stand for gender equality is now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nGlobal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nUnited Nations Women's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 3, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nWomen Face Rising Risk of Violence During Covid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nEnd Violence, Harassment at Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThis Is Why We Became Activists\u201d\n\n\nViolence Against Lesbian, Bisexual, and Queer Women and Non-Binary People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 18, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nFashion\u2019s Next Trend\n\n\nAccelerating Supply Chain Transparency in the Apparel and Footwear Industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 3, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nWomen Face Rising Risk of Violence During Covid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nEnd Violence, Harassment at Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
