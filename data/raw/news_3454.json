Anthony List, Americans United for Life, March for Life Action and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. \n    \n\n            The possibility that Roe v. Wade could be overturned has sparked fears that women who have abortions could face greater risk of criminal prosecution. Last week, Louisiana lawmakers advanced a bill that would have classified abortions as homicides, potentially allowing for women to be criminally charged for terminating their pregnancies, though most restrictive abortion bills typically exempt women from its criminal penalties or civil liability clauses. \n    \n\n\n    More from CNN\n  \n\nLeading anti-abortion groups urge state lawmakers not to pass bills criminalizing women for abortionsKey vote to protect access to abortion fails in the SenateOverturning Roe could have major repercussions for IVF treatments, fertility experts warnAnalysis: Leaked Supreme Court draft opinion in abortion case leaves questions about shape of final rulingAnalysis: Democrats are still searching for a coherent strategy to save abortion rights\n\n\n\n\n\n            Women have been punished under other laws, such as \u201cfetal assault\u201d laws, and charged with crimes that include drug use during pregnancy or self-managed abortion, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which opposes the criminalization of pregnancy. \n    \n\n            Louisiana\u2019s GOP-led state House on Thursday pared down the controversial measure to remove the bill\u2019s original language seeking to classify abortions as homicides after state anti-abortion groups opposed the bill, saying it was their \u201clongstanding policy that abortion-vulnerable women should not be treated as criminals.\u201d The House bill is effectively dead, the amendment\u2019s Republican sponsor said.\n    \n\n            Earlier in the week, Gov. John Bel Edwards, a rare anti-abortion Democrat, also spoke out against the bill, calling it \u201cradical.\u201d\n    \n\n            The national anti-abortion groups did not single out a state in their letter or mention specific legislation or policy. \n    \n\n            Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, told CNN that the letter was prompted in part by the Louisiana bill and the uncertainty of what states may do in the event Roe is overturned, and also to counter the abortion rights rallies this upcoming weekend, which may point to the bill as reason to back their cause.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in penalizing women,\u201d she said, adding that they would want abortion providers to be held accountable.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - A 33-year-old mother of three from central Texas is escorted down the hall by clinic administrator Kathaleen Pittman prior to getting an abortion, Saturday, Oct. 9, 2021, at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, La.

Wade, Republican-led states have enacted laws that restrict abortion \u2013 13 of which have passed so-called \u201ctrigger laws,\u201d which are abortion bans designed to go into effect once Roe is overturned. \n    \n\n            If Roe is overturned, nearly half of all the states have laws that aim to restrict abortion access, according to an analysis by the research group the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n\nCNN\u2019s Chuck Johnston contributed to this
