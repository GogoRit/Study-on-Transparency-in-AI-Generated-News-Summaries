(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputies from Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador\u2019s office filed a new brief in U.S. District Court with new arguments that take into consideration the Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s abortion laws.\u00a0\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office also asked the federal judge presiding over the case to again reconsider a preliminary injunction against the abortion ban.\nThe brief, written by Deputy Attorney General Steven Olsen, said the Idaho Supreme Court redefined the section of Idaho Code that bans nearly all abortions, with affirmative defenses for rape, incest and to save the pregnant person\u2019s life. Medical providers who violate the statute face felony charges and suspension or permanent revocation of a medical license.\n  Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador (Courtesy of the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office)\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against the ban in early August, arguing that it violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires hospitals that receive payments for the federal Medicare program to provide medical care to stabilize all patients who come to the hospital with a medical emergency. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill granted the government\u2019s request to protect doctors who are handling emergency medical decisions from criminal penalties in situations such as ectopic pregnancies, where a non-viable fetus can jeopardize a pregnant person\u2019s life, and miscarriages or other medical scenarios that fall into a medical gray area. Physicians submitted declarations supporting the federal government\u2019s case saying the law was too vague about what constitutes saving a person\u2019s life and when the physician could reasonably intervene without risking felony charges.\nWhile the injunction is in place, all state officials are prohibited from pursuing criminal prosecution or suspending or revoking medical licenses from medical providers or hospitals if an abortion is necessary to avoid jeopardizing a pregnant person\u2019s health.\nIdaho Supp Brief 2.10.22\nNo conflict between Idaho law and EMTALA, attorney argues\nOlsen wrote that the Idaho Supreme Court determined the ban does not require \u201cobjective certainty,\u201d a medical consensus or a certain level of immediacy before an abortion can be deemed necessary to save a pregnant person\u2019s life. The state also argues the court held that ectopic and other non-viable pregnancies do not fall within the definition of abortion that is outlined in Idaho Code.\n\u201cUnder what is now known to be the authoritative interpretation of Idaho law, this court\u2019s preliminary injunction decision would come out differently,\u201d Olsen said.\nOlsen argued the affirmative defense for physicians does not promote delays or worsen patient outcomes, and the Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s determination that ectopic and non-viable pregnancies do not meet the definition of abortion means there is no conflict between Idaho law and EMTALA.\n\u201cThe Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s decision renders essential parts of this court\u2019s preliminary injunction order unsupportable, and as a result, this court should deny the preliminary injunction that the United States seeks,\u201d Olsen wrote.\nFederal judge denies Legislature\u2019s new motion to file its own briefs in abortion case\u00a0\nDistrict Judge B. Lynn Winmill also denied a renewed motion to intervene in the case by attorneys for the Idaho Legislature, which has asked the court to allow briefs from the Legislature\u2019s perspective in the case. Winmill granted a limited intervention for the initial court appearance in August but said he would not allow the attorneys to file its own briefs moving forward.\n  Idaho District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill (Courtesy of District of Idaho courts)\nAfter the Legislature\u2019s attorneys, Monte Neil Stewart and Daniel W. Bower, asked Winmill to reconsider again this month and inferred he was purposely delaying the case to see if the Idaho Supreme Court would rule differently, he denied the motion.\n\u201cThe court can assure the Legislature that the state\u2019s supposed \u2018delays in acting on the Legislature\u2019s motion for reconsideration\u2019 did not result in the court\u2019s putting off its decision \u2026 other factors, primarily the fact this court remains overburdened, caused this delay,\u201d Winmill wrote in his decision. \u201cBecause the Legislature has again failed to show that the state is inadequately representing its identical interest in defending Idaho\u2019s abortion ban, its renewed motion to intervene as a matter of right is denied.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIdaho AG: No need to keep protecting ER doctors from abortion prosecutions\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun February 13, 2023\nIdaho AG: No need to keep protecting ER doctors from abortion prosecutions\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun February 13, 2023\n Deputies from Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador\u2019s office filed a new brief in U.S. District Court with new arguments that take into consideration the Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s abortion laws.\u00a0\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office also asked the federal judge presiding over the case to again reconsider a preliminary injunction against the abortion ban.\nThe brief, written by Deputy Attorney General Steven Olsen, said the Idaho Supreme Court redefined the section of Idaho Code that bans nearly all abortions, with affirmative defenses for rape, incest and to save the pregnant person\u2019s life.
