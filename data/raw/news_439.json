Zgut is a fellow at the German Marshall Fund and at Visegrad Insight.\nWARSAW \u2014 The Polish government is at war \u2014 and happily so.\nFollowing a Constitutional Court decision last week to impose new restrictions on Polish women\u2019s access to abortion, thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest, condemning the move and telling the government to \u201cfuck off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass demonstrations are drawing international attention to what are some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, prompting strong criticism of the Court\u2019s politicization.\nBut far from backing down, Poland\u2019s ruling party is fanning the flames \u2014 and setting itself up to bask in the glow of the public backlash.\nIf the strength of the outrage may have taken them by surprise, as some PiS politicians admitted to Polish media,\u00a0the party knows that waging war against women will pay off in the realm of domestic politics\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something the government has always prioritized over international opinion.\u00a0\nThe ruling party thrives on fear mongering and false enemies. The current protests are a perfect opportunity to exploit identity-based anxieties and convince supporters of the importance of protecting so-called traditional values.\nIn an address earlier this week, PiS party chief and Poland\u2019s de facto leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski said the country is in the midst of a \u201ccultural civil war.\u201d Defend the church \u201cat all costs,\u201d he urged supporters, or Poland will be \u201cdestroyed.\u201d\nBy framing the fight as one that centers on the church, the ruling party is portraying the protests as an attack on a pillar of Polish society and, by extension, an attack on \u201cthe people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn doing so, PiS ignores the fact that protests are largely taking place in front of its offices and the public institutions it controls, not just churches, and that a majority of Poles in fact disagree with the court ruling and approve of the protests. This is not a fringe protest.\nBut stoking culture wars is a tried and tested tactic for PiS.\nEarlier this year, Kaczy\u0144ski made a brief effort to appeal to younger, more moderate voters by passing new laws on animal rights. But the contested bill threatened to split the ruling coalition and failed to translate into more public support for PiS.\nThe narrative he is now spinning about the anti-abortion-law protests shows he\u2019s gone back to basics: He is seeking to galvanize his base and close any gaps to the right of the party that could be exploited by the far-right justice minister and would-be-rival Zbigniew Ziobro.\nOver the past two years, PiS has created a false dichotomy between itself as the protector of traditional Polish values and political opponents who are pro-LGTBQ rights or pro-migration and are thus supposedly seeking to undermine the Polish way of life. The party\u2019s success in the polls shows that a portion of the electorate responds well to these tactics.\nOnce again, PiS\u2019s conservative-values message appears to be resonating among right-wing and radical voters. On the streets, far-right nationalists are confronting female protesters and making human shields in front of churches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoking an \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative also has another upside: It serves to distract from the government\u2019s struggle to contain the coronavirus crisis, as Poland faces a spike the likelihood of a devastating second wave and the difficulty of navigating the economic fallout.\nAlready, Kaczy\u0144ski has claimed that demonstrators are committing \u201ca serious crime\u201d by taking to the streets while COVID-19 continues to rage. He has said their actions are putting the lives of ordinary Poles in danger. The timing of the protests is convenient for the government: It can easily blame demonstrators if the number of infections starts climbing again.\u00a0\nThe government\u2019s strategy does carry real risks, however, beyond the damage already done by the court decision to women\u2019s rights: An escalating culture war that plays on people\u2019s fears and sense of identity may well spill over into real violence, as happened two years ago, with the murder of Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, the liberal mayor of Gdansk who had criticized the ruling party\u2019s xenophobic politics and stood up for LGBTQ rights and migrants.\nEurope shouldn\u2019t be a silent bystander as Poland implodes. The European Commission has to speak up. Not only must it condemn the restriction of women\u2019s access to safe and legal abortion, and the attacks to children\u2019s right to sex education; it must also take a much harder stance on the deterioration of the rule of law in Poland. Warsaw cannot be allowed to get away with openly abusing, harassing and intimidating judges and prosecutors who are seeking to defend the rule of law.\nInstead of never-ending and ineffective dialogue, the EU should take more concrete steps. The Commission must finally act and launch an\u00a0infringement procedure in relation to the unlawfully composed\u00a0Constitutional Court and the National Judicial Council.\nIf PiS had not brought these institutions under its control, it would not have been able to roll back the human rights of Polish women and undermine the country\u2019s democracy. The EU cannot afford to let Poland off the hook on this one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Tags\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt decisions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocracy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHuman rights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolish Politics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRule of Law\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen's Health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Countries\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoland\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated People\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpinion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEU election needs to bring out the best of Europe \u2014 not the worst\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 16\t\t\n\n6 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpinion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomanian president: A vision for NATO\u2019s future\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 12\t\t\n\n6 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpinion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMainstream Europarties should spurn radical populists\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 12\t\t\n\n6 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpinion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWant to accelerate climate action?
