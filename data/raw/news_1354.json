It also says the law is unconstitutionally vague.\nHamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins previously decided to pause the law through Oct. 12, after it took effect in the wake of federal abortion protections being overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. His next task is to decide whether to extend that pause throughout the course of the lawsuit, which may take years.\nREAD MORE: Arizona judge won\u2019t suspend her ruling that makes abortion a crime\nThe testimony he heard Friday varied little from existing societal and political arguments for and against abortion.\nLawyers for abortion clinics presented witnesses who emphasized that abortion is safe, necessary health care and that pregnant Ohioans seeking the procedure were devastated when the law was briefly imposed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade case in June.\nDr. Steven Ralston, a maternal and fetal medicine doctor at the University of Maryland, said limited exceptions included in Ohio\u2019s so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d law are vague and worrisome to physicians, who face losing their medical licenses or felony charges for misinterpretations.\nHe testified to observing more danger to patients in pregnancy than in abortion.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many, many more patients end up in intensive care units after having a baby compared to women who have had an abortion,\u201d Ralston said in video testimony. \u201cIn fact, I can\u2019t even remember a time that I\u2019ve seen a woman end up in a care unit after an abortion.\u201d\nWATCH: Sen. Lindsey Graham unveils national proposal banning abortion after 15 weeks\nThe state\u2019s attorneys brought witness Dr. Dennis Sullivan, a bioethics expert from Cedarville University, a private Baptist institution, who testified that human life begins at conception and that\u2019s \u201cscientifically not open to debate.\u201d\nHe said Ohio\u2019s law is \u201cconsistent with good medical practice\u201d and that he views performing abortions under its limited exceptions \u2014 which include the life of the mother or risk of extensive internal organ damage \u2014 is medically ethical. The law contains no exception for fetal anomalies, which Jenkins raised as a question.\nHe asked a series of pointed questions of Sullivan after he was cross-examined, particularly a view he expressed in testimony that his positions on the nature of human life and the unethical nature of pregnancy termination in cases not involving medical emergencies should be imposed on others.\n\u201cMy question is what allows you uniquely, or someone else uniquely, to make that judgment any better than the individual whose rights we are being asked to limit, whose autonomy we are being asked to take away?\u201d Jenkins asked.\nSullivan responded with an example of a medical situation where a suffering woman\u2019s autonomy might be sacrificed when she arrives at a hospital in need of life-saving care. He also pointed to Ohio laws beyond abortion that limit citizens\u2019 autonomy, such as the state\u2019s ban on assisted suicide.\nThe challenged law was signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019. It prohibits most abortions after the first detectable \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, or before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                FILE PHOTO: Abortion rights protesters march through downtown Tucson in part with nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v.
