Stephanie Howse, D-Cleveland\nThe Black Maternal Health Caucus plans to spend the beginning of the year focused on a strategic plan to improve data about reproductive health and rights, increase education through events like Black Maternal Health Week in April, and see growth in patient health and the overall quality of life for women and girls.\nAcross the board, what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls \u201cpregnancy-related deaths\u201d have increased in the last three decades.\nAccording to the CDC, pregnancy-related deaths were at 42.4 per 100,000 live births for black non-Hispanic women between 2011-2016. For white non-Hispanic women, the number was just 13 deaths per 100,000 live births.\nCrawley cited a report from the Pregnancy Associated Mortality Review Board in introducing new legislation on maternal mortality.
