Michels, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, won the Republican nomination against former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who was endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence.  (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week we learned from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Wisconsin\u2019s Republican candidate for governor Tim Michels and his wife donated nearly $200,000 to anti-abortion groups in Wisconsin and New York in 2020 through their family foundation. The recipients include Pro Life Wisconsin, which opposes the use of all contraceptives and aims to revise Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban to remove language providing an exception if abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother.\nThe donations, Journal Sentinel reporter Corrinne Hess notes, \u201cprovide a window into how Michels may approach policymaking\u201d if he defeats Gov. Tony Evers in November.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a scary view.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for us to be able to help our patients make decisions based on science and evidence and data. And Tim Michels wants to take all that away,\u201d says Dr. Kristin Lyerly, the district legislative chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \u201cHe has no respect for the ethical principle of bodily autonomy, which is a cornerstone of medical science.\u201d\nMichels has said he supports Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban, passed the year after Wisconsin achieved statehood and 71 years before women won the right to vote.\nPro-life Wisconsin, a group to which Michels gave $25,000 in 2020, says the 1849 law doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nThe group plans to push for removing the life-of-the-mother exception from the law and replace it with language that requires \u201cequal protection\u201d for mother and fetus, Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin\u2019s lobbyist, told The Green Bay Press Gazette.\n\u201cHe wants me to just sit there and watch my patient die, which would kill both the baby and mother,\u201d says Lyerly.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then what happens to that family? It\u2019s just inhuman.\u201d\nIn polls, 60% of Wisconsinites consistently say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and large majorities of voters in both political parties say they abortion should be a legal option in cases of rape and incest. The 1849 life-of-the-mother exception is not exactly controversial.\u00a0\nBut anti-abortion groups\u2019 worldview is a long, long way from mainstream.\nOn its website, Pro-Life Wisconsin states that the group \u201cis opposed to all forms of artificial contraception.\u201d\n\u201cThe contraceptive mentality,\u201d the group states, \u201cviews pregnancy as a \u2018disease\u2019 state against which women must be \u2018protected\u2019 at all costs. \u2026 without the notion of \u2018unwanted\u2019 children that the contraceptive mentality fosters, there would be no abortion.\u201d\nMost Wisconsin voters are not up for relitigating the use of contraception in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a politician, Michels knows this. That\u2019s why he hastened to declare, during the Republican primary, that he does not oppose the use of birth control. But he was forced to issue that statement because his earlier comments had left his position unclear.\nAt a campaign event, Michels spoke reassuringly to a constituent who told him, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about babies\u2019 lives being lost to these abortion pills that are being passed off as contraception. \u2026 What are your plans for dealing with that?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be illegal in Wisconsin,\u201d Michels declared.\nLater, his campaign insisted that Michels was not referring to the emergency contraception pills known as Plan B, and that he supports birth control, including the morning-after pill. But the campaign would not answer a reporter\u2019s question whether Michels would sign legislation banning emergency contraception.\nWisconsin is on a razor\u2019s edge. Just last year Gov. Tony Evers vetoed five separate anti-abortion bills. And Republicans have floated a Texas-style abortion bounty bill in Wisconsin that would reward busybody neighbors who successfully sue grandmothers and aunts and boyfriends who drive their pregnant loved ones across state lines to seek an abortion.\nFormer Gov. Scott Walker, when he was in the Legislature, championed a \u201cpharmacists\u2019 conscience clause\u201d bill that would have allowed local Walgreens employees to refuse to dispense your birth control pills if, like Pro-Life Wisconsin, they were morally opposed to furthering the \u201ccontraceptive mentality.\u201d\nEver since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this year, eliminating federally protected abortion rights, \u201ceveryone is afraid,\u201d says Lyerly. \u201cIt\u2019s causing so much fear, even in people seeking routine pregnancy care.\u201d\nThe tone of regular OB visits has changed from joy and anticipation to caution and anxiety, she says. \u201cPatients are asking questions about what their options are in the case that something would change in what they anticipate would be a healthy pregnancy.\u201d\nOne patient, with a high-risk pregnancy, was fearful that if her life was in danger her doctor might choose to save the baby and let her die. \u201cShe needed a lot of monitoring, but she stopped going to her appointments,\u201d Lyerly says. \u201cHere she was putting her life at risk because of misinformation and fear.\u201d\u00a0\nIn this strained climate, Wisconsin doctors are trying to do right by their patients. To those who are scared about what might happen if something goes wrong in a pregnancy, \u201cwe try to provide reassurance that there is a path,\u201d Lyerly says. \u201cWe have colleagues in Illinois [who can perform abortions]. I provide abortion care in Minnesota, where I happen to be licensed. Some of us travel to border states.\u201d\nBut the pressure is still compromising the quality of care for patients in Wisconsin who are under extraordinary stress.\u00a0\nBecause of the 1849 law\u2019s requirement that three doctors sign off on the necessity of an abortion to save the life of the mother, there have been delays in the midst of crisis situations.\nLyerly herself has been in the agonizing situation of trying to decide when she can legally intervene: While a fetal heartbeat is detectable, even a doomed pregnancy and a dangerous prognosis don\u2019t necessarily meet the\u00a0 \u201cnecessary to save the life of the mother\u201d test.\u00a0\nShe summed up the agony in a tweet:\n\n14 weeks pregnantBroken bag of watersCardiac activity No signs of sepsis\u2026yetAnticipating a dismal outcome\nWaiting for a lawyer to tell me what I can offer to this devastated woman with a desired pregnancy\n\u2014 Kristin Lyerly, MD, MPH (@KristinLyerly) July 7, 2022\n\n\u201cOn conservative talk radio they use buzzwords like \u2018abortion up to birth,\u201d Lyerly says. That\u2019s misleading. Her patients who have abortions late in their pregnancies are devastated. \u201cThese are wanted pregnancies where something goes wrong. It\u2019s heartbreaking. People are grief-stricken. So to assault them and make them look like ugly, evil people is so wrong,\u201d she says.\nThat\u2019s one reason she is motivated to speak out for her patients. \u201cThey can\u2019t tell their stories, they\u2019ve been so shamed and hurt.\u201d\nThe misleading rhetoric about abortion is \u201call voter manipulation. It has nothing to do with medical care,\u201d in Lyerly\u2019s view.\nA few simple scientific facts deflate the fantastical claims of the anti-abortion crusaders.\nNeither Plan B, which prevents ovulation, nor the IUD, which causes an inhospitable environment within the uterus so fertilization doesn\u2019t occur, is an \u201cabortifacient\u201d as ProLife Wisconsin claims.\u00a0\nNor is the storied \u201cmoment of conception\u201d very easy to pin down.\n\u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of eggs and sperm unions that happen that just wash out,\u201d Lyerson explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a fertilized egg not to implant \u2014 we estimate it happens 50% of the time. So defining that moment [of conception] and making it sacred is really impossible.\u201d\nViews on pregnancy and the beginning of life have changed over time. Likewise Wisconsin\u2019s abortion policies have shifted since 1849, as documented in a 2022 Legislative Reference Bureau report, \u201cA Brief History of Abortion Laws in Wisconsin.\u201d\u00a0\nOriginally, Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban applied to \u201cthe willful killing of an unborn quick child.\u201d Quickening, or detectable fetal movement, was considered the point at which life began.\u00a0\nBut in 1858, legislators removed the world \u201cquick\u201d from the 1849 ban and imposed penalties of fines and imprisonment not just on doctors and midwives but also on \u201cevery woman who shall take any medicine, drug, substance, or thing whatever, or shall submit to any operation or other means whetever with intent to procure a miscarriage.\u201d\n\nDr. William Henry Brisbane, a doctor who crusaded against \u201cadministering drugs and injections either to prevent conception or destroy the embryo\u201d took credit for the changes to the law.\nOnly after the 1973 Roe decision did the Wisconsin Legislature revise the law\u00a0 \u2014 by then\u00a0 obsolete \u2014 to remove penalties for women who sought abortions.\u00a0\nReading about the legislators, all of them male, debating how to punish women who sought to control their own fertility gives you a feeling of revisiting the Dark Ages.\nIf Michels and his anti-abortion allies have their way, we will be going back there again.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXTim Michels and the anti-abortion extremist takeover of Wisconsin\nby Ruth Conniff, Wisconsin Examiner September 3, 2022\nTim Michels and the anti-abortion extremist takeover of Wisconsin\nby Ruth Conniff, Wisconsin Examiner September 3, 2022\n This week we learned from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Wisconsin\u2019s Republican candidate for governor Tim Michels and his wife donated nearly $200,000 to anti-abortion groups in Wisconsin and New York in 2020 through their family foundation.
