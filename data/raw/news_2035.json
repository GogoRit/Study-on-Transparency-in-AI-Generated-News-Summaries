Flowers was representing Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, whose appeal also asserts Preterm Cleveland and the other Ohio clinics that filed the lawsuit lack the necessary legal standing to sue. Flowers argued that the state has the right to appeal Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins\u2019 order if it can show it\u2019s suffering \u201cirreparable harm\u201d while the law is on hold. Flowers said each abortion that takes place that would have been prevented under Ohio\u2019s 2019 ban constitutes such harm.\n\nThe appeal plays out against the backdrop of a November election in which Ohio residents will vote on an amendment to enshrine a right to abortion in their state constitution, passage of which would likely impact both the suit and the law. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPedal coast-to-coast without using a road?

Mike DeWine in April 2019, prohibits most abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The legal battle over the law comes as a proposed constitutional amendment that would protect abortion access in Ohio will go before voters in November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem with the First District\u2019s ruling ( denying Ohio\u2019s request to appeal Jenkins\u2019 order) is that, if it\u2019s right, then all 88 (county) common pleas courts can unilaterally, indefinitely suspend operation of state law for as long as it takes to conduct discovery, to hold the trial and issue an injunction,\u201d Flowers told the court. \n\nThe appellate court ruled Yost\u2019s appeal premature, as the order was merely an interim step that paused enforcement of the law while the lawsuit is carried out. Preterm\u2019s attorney, B. Jessie Hill, argued that the state\u2019s decision to appeal the stay at the Ohio Supreme Court defies \u201clong-standing, well-established rules\u201d on such actions. On the question of legal standing, Hill told the court that the clinics, and their physicians, were the proper parties to bring such a lawsuit \u2014 not individual pregnant women who are seeking \u201ctime-sensitive health care\u201d. \u201cThey are not in a position to hire an attorney, bring a lawsuit, seek an injunction, and then, even if they were to bring it, they\u2019re not going to remain pregnant for very long,\u201d she said. Flowers challenged the notion, pointing out that the most celebrated abortion lawsuit in U.S. history, Roe v. Wade, was brought in the name of an individual patient. But when he suggested that abortion clinics also could not prove the necessary \u201cclose relationship\u201d to the category of people covered under the suit, and that their business interests in conducting abortions represent a conflict of interest, Justice Jennifer Brunner pushed back. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the Hippocratic oath, though. I mean the medical profession is a profession,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you would portray it as, as just some kind of monied factory.\u201dThe Ohio abortion law had been blocked as part of a different legal challenge until the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade decision last summer that had legalized abortion nationwide. That ruling left it up to states to decide the matter.Ohio clinics then brought their challenge to state court, arguing that a similar right to the procedure exists under the Ohio Constitution. Yost had also requested in his Supreme Court appeal that justices rule on the main premise of the case \u2014 that the Ohio Constitution protect the right to an abortion \u2014 but the court left that question to the lower courts. Data collected last year by AP VoteCast, a broad survey of the electorate, showed that 59% of Ohio voters believe abortion should generally be legal. Just last month, Ohio voters soundly defeated a measure that GOP lawmakers placed on a special election ballot that would have raised the threshold to pass constitutional amendments to 60% \u2014 a proposal seen as a first step  to defeating the abortion amendment that will be on the fall ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIE CARR SMYTH\n\n\n                Smyth has covered government and politics from Columbus, Ohio, for The Associated Press since 2006.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
