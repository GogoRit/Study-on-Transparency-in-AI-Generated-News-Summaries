Wade last month, ending the right to an abortion in the United States, Myisha Malone-King got a call from her insurance company. It said that the medication she takes for a condition totally unrelated to abortion would no longer be available to her. \n    \n\n            Malone-King has Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can come with life-threatening complications. She was taking methotrexate, an inexpensive drug that has been used to help with chronic inflammation and pain since the 1980s. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gather to protest against the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health case on June 24, 2022, in Austin, Texas.\n\nMaggie Boyd/Sipa/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhere state abortion bans stand amid legal challenges\n\n\n\n\n            Millions of people take the drug for chronic conditions. Doctors prescribe it to help with things like cancer, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. But it can also be used off-label in very high doses to treat a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. \n    \n\n            An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus, creating an unviable pregnancy that can be deadly for the pregnant person. \n    \n\n            Methotrexate is not used in what\u2019s known as a medication abortion, which involves mifepristone (sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym, and is also known as RU 486) and misoprostol. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks during an event on Capitol Hill on July 20, 2022 in Washington, DC. Pelosi joined other members of the Democratic caucus in discussing The Right to Contraception Act that the House will vote on tomorrow, a law that would codify the right to access and use FDA approved contraceptives.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nHouse votes to pass bill guaranteeing access to contraception\n\n\n\n\n            But in some states with restrictive abortion policies like Texas, the law classifies methotrexate as a drug that can induce abortion and groups it with the other two, meaning there can be restrictions on its use. However, Texas law also says that methotrexate can be prescribed for other purposes. And in that case, it is exempt from restrictions. \n    \n\n            Recent changes in abortion laws have sown confusion that has spooked insurance providers, pharmacies and medical offices into restricting the use of methotrexate, even in states where abortion is legal. It\u2019s not clear how many people may be affected, but about 500,000 methotrexate prescriptions were written each month for the past year, said IQVIA, a pharmaceutical market research firm.\n    \n\n    \u2018Like a miracle drug\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyisha Malone-King\n\nCourtesy of Myisha Malone-King\n\n\n\n            Malone-King lives in Maryland, which allows abortion up to the point of fetal viability. The decision to remove methotrexate from her care plan made absolutely no sense to her. \n    \n\n            \u201cMy feeling is, nobody should be making this decision over my body that my doctor and I have determined was right for me,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            Malone-King\u2019s doctor was able to switch her to another medication. But she knows that not everyone is so lucky. \n    \n\n            Malone-King, a patient advocate who runs a chronic illness support group called Game of Crohn\u2019s & Chronic Illness, worries about some of its members.\n    \n\n            \u201cI really feel for the ones who really need this medication and it\u2019s their only option and now they don\u2019t have access all because of a law that has nothing to do with their situation,\u201d she said. \n    \n\n            Like Malone-King, Becky Schwartz takes methotrexate for a chronic condition. She has lupus, a disease in which the person\u2019s immune system attacks their own tissues and organs.\n    \n\n            Not six days after the US Supreme Court decision, Schwartz said, she got a letter from her doctor\u2019s office that said it was pausing all prescriptions and refills of methotrexate. The form letter went on to explain that this decision was because of the Supreme Court decision on abortion. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarlena Stell\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nIn some states, doctors weigh 'ruinous' litigation against proper care for women who have miscarriages \n\n\n\n\n            She spoke to her rheumatologist, who told her that they would have to start weaning her off the drug, since her prescription would run out the first week of September. \n    \n\n            \u201cMethotrexate has really been effective with helping me get my disease under control,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cFor me, it really is like a miracle drug.\u201d\n    \n\n            Schwartz is dreading the medication change. Before she started methotrexate, flares would give her trouble walking, and it was so difficult to stand that she needed a shower chair to wash.\n    \n\n            \u201cWhat if something causes me to get a flare again?\u201d she asked. \u201cFor people who don\u2019t have this, it\u2019s hard to explain how such a change in my medicine could make such a drastic and terrible difference in my life.\n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m just going to have to decrease my activity until we can figure out what to do,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd for what?\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky Schwarz\n\nCourtesy of Becky Schwarz\n\n\n\n            Schwartz lives in Virginia, a state where abortion is legal, at least for now. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis feels like such an extreme reaction,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being babysat by the government. I\u2019m a grown adult. I am well aware of how to take my medication safely.\u201d\n    \n\n            When doctors prescribe methotrexate, they typically have careful conversations with the patient about its potential side effects, including severe birth defects. Schwartz\u2019s doctor recommended that she use birth control, which she said she does.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 28: The Department of Health and Human Services will be holding a press conference today on their coordinated public health response to the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 28, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Several groups set up special task forces to guide members on best practices, particularly in states setting limits on abortion.\n    \n\n            The Arthritis Foundation has also set up a helpline for people to report problems and a website to answer questions about methotrexate.  \n    \n\n    \u2018My doctor and I should not be treated like criminals\u2019\n\n\n            Abortion is now banned in at least eight states, and many more bans are expected. Legal experts think half the states in the country will either outright ban abortion or restrict it significantly.\n    \n\n            For Annie England Noblin, it wasn\u2019t her doctor\u2019s office that put a stop to her prescription for methotrexate. It was her pharmacy.\n    \n\n            England Noblin, a writer, lives in Missouri, where abortion is restricted except in case of emergency. She started taking methotrexate to help with her rheumatoid arthritis early this year. \n    \n\n            It wasn\u2019t until she went in to pick up a refill last week that the pharmacist told her that they needed a specific direction from the doctor that said the prescription was not for an abortion. \n    \n\n            The extra step is not unusual in certain states with restrictive abortion laws. CVS told CNN that that is the chain\u2019s policy now. Walgreens also said trigger laws in certain states require this extra step of verification. There are reports from some doctors, though, that some pharmacies are refusing to carry methotrexate at all. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small group gathers at the steps of the Georgia State Capitol protesting the overturning of Roe v.

She said that when she asked whether the pharmacy would be having that same conversation with men, the answer was no.\n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m not angry at my pharmacist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m angry at the policy. It just feels like they think I\u2019m going to go home and pop 12 of them and have an abortion.

The group is also looking into issues related to access to misoprostol for things like gastric ulcer prevention, and there may be other medications that are included in the definition of \u201cabortion-inducing drug.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThis comes back to the definitions of abortion-inducing drugs and state laws which sometimes are very detailed and very clear but sometimes are very vague and up to a lot of misunderstandings,\u201d said Michael Murphy, adviser for state government affairs with the American Pharmacists Association.\n    \n\n            The association has been observing how state pharmacy groups are handling the issue closely, as well. Kentucky\u2019s association, for instance, said in guidance for its pharmacists July 1 that any prescription or medical order for a drug that is known to possibly cause abortion should be presumed by a pharmacy \u201cto be for indications other than for the termination of a pregnancy. A pharmacy dispensing such prescription or medical order shall not be required to verify that the prescription or medical order does not violate any provision.\u201d\n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's

Court\u2019s decision.\n    \n\n            \u201cFor us as pharmacists, one of our biggest responsibilities is ensuring the safe and effective use of medications,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd right
