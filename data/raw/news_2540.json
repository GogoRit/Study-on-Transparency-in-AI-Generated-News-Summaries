Kenneth Griepp to share the stories behind their\u00a0compelling support of life. The event will also feature operatic tenor James Scott Berry performing the National Anthem.Organizer Dawn Eskew says each of the men speaking promote\u00a0the best interests of women at heart. \u201cWhile many label abortion a \u2018women\u2019s issue\u2019 and invalidate male discourse on the matter, these gentlemen illustrate how that categorization is far removed from reality,\u201d she explained.\u201cTake Robert Kollar \u2026 he\u2019s a filmmaker and actor, but he will tell you that his greatest role is that of father and grandfather \u2013 of a child conceived in rape. He stood by his daughter, Kristi, through the trauma of assault, pregnancy, and single motherhood,\u201d shared Eskew. \u201cTogether as a family, they speak out for voiceless children of violence \u2013 offering life-affirming help and compassion to sexually abused women and their loved ones.\u201d\u201cThey all have stories to tell,\u201d Eskew added. \u201cFrom Shawn Carney\u2019s role in the conversion of Abby Johnson from Planned Parenthood director to pro-life advocate, Dr. Haywood\u2019s journey from abortionist to defender of life, and Pastor Griepp\u2019s tale of persecution by the state of New York for sharing life-affirming alternatives to abortion-bound women. None of this is academic. It\u2019s personal.\u201dEskew noted that the parade route begins at Foley Square, also known as Thomas Paine Park, home of the African Burial Ground National Monument, commemorating an 18th-century burial ground for an estimated 15,000 Africans enslaved in New York City. Participants will also glimpse a view of Freedom Tower, where among the memorialized victims of 9/11 are 11 unborn babies listed as children.\u201cThese two historical points of reference highlight the tragedy of American abortion,\u201d Eskew pointed out. \u201cLess than 200 years ago slavery was legal. It was never morally right. Today, the same is true of abortion. Our mourning of the pre-born children murdered in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center underscores our innate recognition of their humanity.\u201dA few days before The International Gift of Life Walk, Eskew will receive the Sanctity of Human Life Award from the Queens Village Republican Club, the oldest GOP club in America.Click here to register for the walk.Tags:AbortionPro-lifeSupport Aleteia!Enjoying your time on Aleteia?\nArticles like these are sponsored free for every Catholic through the support of generous readers just like you.\nThanks to their partnership in our mission, we reach\u00a0more than 20 million unique users per month!\nHelp us continue to bring the Gospel to people everywhere through uplifting and transformative Catholic news, stories, spirituality, and more.\nSupport Aleteia with a gift today!\nDonate now!Daily prayerAnd today we celebrate...Prayer for this morningDaily meditationPrayer for this eveningTop 10See MoreNewsletterGet Aleteia delivered to your inbox.
