Activists secured an initiative to be placed on the November ballot constitutionally enshrining the right to abortion until fetal viability. To head off what promises to be a slam dunk for the pros, Ohio\u2019s anti-abortion Republican legislature proposed its own amendment, to raise the bar to amend the state constitution. That was Issue 1, the sole question on the ballot of the special August election.\nIssue 1 was a transparent ruse \u2014 polls showed 58 percent support for the abortion rights measure; the lawmakers specified a 60 percent majority to pass an amendment instead of the current simple majority \u2014 and voters soundly rejected it.\nNow Ohio is set to follow the six states that have conferred the highest level of state protection on reproductive freedom through popular referendum. Campaigners for a similar 2024 ballot measure in Arizona are psyched by Ohio\u2019s victory, and Nebraska is gearing up for one as well. Virginia Democrats were moved to elevate reproductive liberty to the top of their platform, in hopes of winning back the state House of Representatives and firewalling abortion from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s attempts to impose the most extreme prohibitions.\nIn Ohio, democracy prevailed \u2014 and the spirit is spreading.\nStill, you could see it the opposite way. Ohio\u2019s GOP contrived to upend a process of governance that\u2019s been uncontroversial since 1912. The party introduced a bill to allow for an August election on a constitutional amendment \u2014 formerly one could be held only in the case of a \u201cfiscal emergency\u201d \u2014 and when the bill stalled in committee, they held the election anyway. The party of skinflints magnanimously allocated $20 million in taxpayer funds to run the referendum, which set in motion the spending of another $26.6 million in advertising by organizations for and against the initiative. All in all, that\u2019s a slew of monkey wrenches in the gears of democracy, with one purpose: to force women to have children they don\u2019t want.\nYou can have abortion bans, or you can have democracy. You can\u2019t have both.\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriminalizing abortion is undemocratic in the most basic sense: Increasing majorities of Americans are against it. In fact, a new poll shows that given the chance, two in three would vote to protect the right to abortion in their state constitutions. That includes nearly half of Republicans.\nAbortion bans, moreover, could not have been achieved without a long prehistory of dubiously legal, anti-democratic shenanigans like those the legislature pulled in Ohio. The conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade would be a mere, potentially negotiable majority had Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not refused to hold confirmation hearings for President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, the moderate Merrick Garland, to fill the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in 2016.\nRepublicans would not hold seemingly permanent control of Ohio\u2019s statehouse if the party had not radically gerrymandered election districts and ignored seven court rulings rejecting the maps it drew. Anti-abortion initiatives on the 2022 ballots in Kansas and Kentucky also emerged from legislatures gerrymandered to insulate members from the will of the people.\nBallot initiatives aren\u2019t perfect: The biggest spenders tend to win. Still, when representative government is disabled by election rigging and voter suppression, direct democracy may be the citizens\u2019 last resort. Watching ballot initiatives land repeated blows against minority rule, Republicans in states including Florida, Missouri, North Dakota, Utah, and Michigan are doing their damnedest to waylay referenda on the way to the polling booth.\nIn Michigan, Republicans on the Board of State Canvassers voted to keep two legitimately petitioned referenda off the 2022 ballot. One measure, unironically, instituted pro-voting reforms; the other constitutionally enshrined abortion rights. Both were blocked on technicalities \u2014 the latter because of spacing errors in the document. After the state Supreme Court restored the initiatives, voters approved both. Similarly, the anti-abortion measures in Kansas and Kentucky were rejected at the ballot box. In 2024, Arizona and Florida Republicans will attempt to limit the ability of voters to direct ballot or amend the constitution\u2014 but they\u2019ll have to do it through popular referenda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement of abortion bans requires the violation of basic constitutional and human rights. Using legislation crafted by the National Right to Life Committee, South Carolina has passed a law and Texas a bill that stomp on free speech by shutting down websites that offer information on abortion. If the laws stand in the courts, other states are likely to follow.\nIn Idaho this month, six public university professors and two unions brought a federal lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s 2021 No Public Funds for Abortion Act, which criminalizes the use of public funds not just to perform abortions but also to \u201cpromote [or] provide counseling in favor of abortion.\u201d Educators have bowdlerized their syllabi, scrubbed their resumes, and pulled art from an exhibition in fear of overstepping the vague bounds of the law and losing their jobs or facing felony convictions that carry penalties of heavy fines and imprisonment. \u201cThis law censors teaching, discussion, and scholarship about abortion at Idaho\u2019s public universities, effectively stripping professors of their First Amendment right to academic speech,\u201d said the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the professors.\nNot content with prosecuting pill distributors as drug traffickers or prohibiting the \u201ctrafficking\u201d of fetal tissue, the antis have minted a new species of criminal trafficking. A statute signed this spring by Idaho Gov. Brad Little prohibits \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d; it defines as a trafficker anyone who \u201cprocures an abortion\u201d or \u201cobtains an abortion-inducing drug for [a] pregnant minor to use for an abortion by recruiting, harboring, or transporting the pregnant minor\u201d \u2014 language that suggests child sex slavery. Although \u201ctransporting\u201d refers only to the in-state portion of the trip, the law contravenes both the constitutional right to travel and, arguably, the human right to asylum from persecution.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n            Read Our Complete Coverage          \nThe End of Roe\n\n\n\n\nThe persistence and prevalence of pill abortions in defiance of the bans has compelled red-state law enforcers to step up surveillance, and we can expect more violations of privacy in the future. If the Supreme Court upholds the recent Texas ruling severely limiting distribution of the abortion drug mifepristone, the Comstock Act of 1873 could be resuscitated and the U.S. Postal Service authorized to open mail in search of contraband. Last year, Nebraska prosecutors used private Facebook messages and federally protected medical records to charge a teenager, Celeste Burgess, and her mother, Jessica, with self-managing the daughter\u2019s abortion using medication at about 28 weeks\u2019 gestation and attempting to burn the stillborn fetus.\nBut the invasion of the Burgesses\u2019 privacy was the least of it. Jessica faces up to five years in prison for violating Nebraska\u2019s abortion laws by buying the pills online and giving them to her daughter. (The law back then prohibited abortion after 20 weeks; in May 2023, Nebraska\u2019s governor signed a 12-week ban.) Celeste, who was 17 at the time and had no criminal record, pleaded guilty to the felony offense of \u201cremoving, abandoning, or concealing human skeletal remains.\u201d And while anti-abortion propagandists allege that they seek compassion, not punishment, for women who abort, the judge gave Celeste 90 days\u2019 jail time plus two years\u2019 probation. \u201cConfinement is necessary,\u201d he wrote, because its omission \u201cwould depreciate the seriousness of the crime or promote disrespect for the law.\u201d\nWhich law? It is fair to conclude that this teenager was locked up for three months for ingesting a legal drug to return her own body to its former, unpregnant state. So much for due process and proportional justice \u2014 the time fitting the crime.\n\n\n\n \n\n        Related      \nThe First \u201cWrongful Death\u201d Case for Helping a Friend Get an Abortion\n\n\n\n\nThe more intimate the target, the more intrusive the surveillance. That\u2019s why several states have deputized private citizens to inform on, and sue, those who \u201caid and abet\u201d abortions \u2014 the new American Stasi. At the same time, the more numerous the aspects of personal life the state seeks to police \u2014 sexual behavior, gender expression, unsavory thought \u2014 the more pressing will be people\u2019s desire and need to disobey the laws, just to carry on ordinary life. The more widespread such disobedience becomes, the greater will be the perception of crime and, with it, the state\u2019s self-justification for repression.\nThe Grand Old Party has long since abandoned even the appearance of caring about democracy. It wants only power, and to get power its politicians pander to the base of nosy, self-righteous, cruelly unchristian evangelical Christians, who care even less. American democracy has never been perfect, but for duking out our differences, it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. Still, some things are not proper subjects of democratic debate. Among these are people\u2019s decisions about whether and when to have a baby. In this case, democracy means leaving our bodies alone.\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Judith Levine          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The First \u201cWrongful Death\u201d Case for Helping a Friend Get an Abortion      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Where the Fight Is\u201d: Abortion Rights Movement Sets Its Sights on Key States      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Kentucky Voters Reject Amendment 2 in \u201cRepudiation of Extreme Anti-Choice Agenda\u201d      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Midterms Show Republican Anti-Abortion Agenda Relies on Minority Rule      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
