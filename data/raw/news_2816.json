The U.S. Catholic Church observes October as Respect Life Month. Respect Life Sunday falls on Oct. 4. CNS photo/Gregory A. Shemitz\nWASHINGTON. The U.S. Catholic Church\u2019s observance of October as Respect Life Month \u201cis a time to focus on God\u2019s precious gift of human life and our responsibility to care for, protect and defend the lives of our brothers and sisters,\u201d said the chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 pro-life committee.\n\u201cLive the Gospel of Life\u201d is this year\u2019s theme for the month, prompted by commemorations of the 25th anniversary of St. John Paul II\u2019s encyclical \u201cThe Gospel of Life\u201d (\u201cEvangelium Vitae\u201d), which was issued March 25, 1995.\n\u201cPope John Paul\u2019s masterfully articulated defense of the right to life for children in their mothers\u2019 wombs, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and the marginalized is more relevant today than ever before,\u201d said Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\nRespect Life Sunday falls on Oct. 4. New parish resources for the month\u2019s observance have been developed around the theme of \u201cLiving the Gospel of Life\u201d and are available at www.respectlife.org.\n\u201c\u2018The Gospel of Life\u2019 provides a blueprint for building a culture of life and civilization of love,\u201d the archbishop said in a Sept. 24 statement. \u201cThe important work of transforming our culture begins by allowing the Gospel of Christ to touch and transform our own hearts and the decisions we make.\u201d\nArchbishop Naumann noted that during their fall general assembly last November, \u201cthe U.S. bishops reaffirmed that \u2018the threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority because it directly attacks life itself, because it takes place within the sanctuary of the family, and because of the number of lives destroyed.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhile we noted not to \u2018dismiss or ignore other serious threats to human life and dignity such as racism, the environmental crisis, poverty and the death penalty,\u2019 we renewed our commitment to protect the most fundamental of all human rights \u2013 the right to live,\u201d he said.\nArchbishop Naumann also recalled how in January of this year he \u201cshared with Pope Francis that the bishops of the United States had been criticized by some for identifying the protection of the unborn as a preeminent priority.\u201d\nTheir conversation came during the \u201cad limina\u201d meeting of the bishops from Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska at the Vatican.\n\u201cThe Holy Father expressed his support for our efforts observing that if we fail to protect life, no other rights matter. Pope Francis also said that abortion is not primarily a Catholic or even a religious issue, it is first and foremost a human rights issue,\u201d the Kansas archbishop said in his Sept. 24 statement.\nLater this January, the archbishop relayed that story to pro-lifers gathered for the Jan. 23 opening Mass of the National Vigil for Life at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Pope Francis \u201chas our backs\u201d in the pro-life cause, he said in his homily.\n\u201cMay we strive to imitate Christ and follow in his footsteps, caring for the most vulnerable among us,\u201d he said Sept. 24. \u201cThrough the intercession of Our Lady of Guadalupe, may Our Lord grant us the grace to live courageously and faithfully his Gospel of life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPreviousPope to U.N.: Respect for each human life is essential for peace, equality \n\n\n\n\nNextAnonymous donor offers $250K matching gift for ACENext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our email list\nKeep your finger on the pulse of Catholic life in Middle Tennessee by subscribing to the weekday\nE-Register here.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSt. Mary\u2019s Bookstore a stop on Fontanini Tour\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 27, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNashvilleCatholic.org: a robust choir\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 20, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAquinas College alumnus Col.
