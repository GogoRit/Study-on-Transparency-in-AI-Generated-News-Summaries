Log in.\nWhile explaining that he had COVID-19 in February, West made untrue claims that vaccines paralyze children.He's also publicly expressed his opposition to Planned Parenthood, a non-profit organization that offers sexual health care, including providing birth control, hormones, and abortions. In a July 8 Forbes interview, West said Planned Parenthood was \"placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil's work.\"\nAdvertisement\n\nWest also said he's, \"pro-life because I'm following the word of the Bible.\"\n\n\n                              Related stories\n                            \n\n\nThe rapper's views seem to conflict with Kardashian-West's, who was shown both supporting Planned Parenthood and taking her whole family to get the whooping cough vaccine in previous episodes of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\"Kardashian-West visited Planned Parenthood after calls to defund the non-profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  People walk past a Planned Parenthood clinic in the Manhattan borough of New York,\n                                \n\n                          \n                          REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n                          \n                          \n\nIn an October 2017 episode of the show, Kardashian-West and her sisters, Khloe and Kourtney, go to Planned Parenthood's Los Angeles location to learn more about the services they offer.They took the trip after Kardashian-West asked, on-camera: \"What is all this Planned Parenthood talk where people want to protest for Planned Parenthood?\"\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was referring to protesters who were fighting against efforts to defund the organization.After Khloe explained that she was pro-choice, Kardashian-West decided to visit the non-profit.\"I want to have an opinion on this, but I just don't know enough,\" Kardashian-West said in the episode. \"I do like to speak up on social media about topics that mean something to me, and I want to be more informed.\"A Planned Parenthood executive gave them a tour of the facility and explained the work they do, and introduced them to three women who have had care at the nonprofit.\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterwards, Kardashian-West agreed as Khloe said, \"I'm a big fan of Planned Parenthood now,\" and added: \"I think people need to be more educated in how they form opinions.\"Kardashian-West came to the conclusion that efforts to defund the nonprofit on a pro-life stance miss the fact that it provides myriad services. \"The perception of Planned Parenthood is that it is an abortion clinic. That is nothing what it is like,\" she said.It's unclear if Kardashian-West and her husband's differing views have affected their relationship. After West announced his decision to run for president, Kardashian-West tweeted her support.Read more:Kim Kardashian is a rare pro-vaccine celebrity, but her husband Kanye West is running an anti-vaxx presidential campaignWomen deemed 'responsible' for having miscarriages could spend 30 years in prison under Georgia's new abortion law \u2014 but it's often impossible to determine the causeA Pennsylvania bill would require death certificates for fertilized eggs that never implant in the uterus\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Read next\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: How to get as fit as Kim Kardashian, according to her personal trainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHealth\nKim Kardashian West\nKanye West\n\n                      More...\n                    \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nClose icon\nTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.
