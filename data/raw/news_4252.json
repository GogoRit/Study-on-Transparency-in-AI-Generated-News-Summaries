All are created in the image of God and have equal rights. Sexual and reproductive health is one such right that should not be denied to any woman,\u201d said Rev. Evans Onyemara, general secretary of the Christian Council of Nigeria during a training on empowering women with disabilities on sexual and reproductive health care held at Umuahia, Nigeria from 9-11 March.\nThe training initiated by the World Council of Churches Ecumenical Disability Advocates Network and hosted by the Methodist Church Nigeria is part of a six-month project aimed at empowering women with disabilities in Nigeria on sexual and reproductive health rights through increased access to information and services.\nAs in most developing countries, women with disabilities in Nigeria are not empowered and have little or no access to information and essential services on sexual and reproductive health. They are perceived as unproductive and their sexual and reproductive health needs not met which shuts them out.\n\u201cWe have been made by God and given self worth and confidence. We must value God\u2019s creation and renew our minds to be like Christ\u2019s mind who accepts us the way we are,\u201d said Archbishop Raphael Opoko, Methodist Church Nigeria.\nThe church has direct contact with people and plays a major role in lifting the voices of the most vulnerable in the society. \u201cReligion plays a big role in shaping the daily lives of the society. The church can provide women with disabilities with opportunity to learn, dialogue and interact while journeying with them in advocating for attainment of sexual and reproductive health,\u201d said Anjeline Okola, programme coordinator for the Ecumenical Disability Advocates Network.\nParticipants of the training, church leaders and women with disabilities, were familiarised with national and international frameworks safeguarding sexual and reproductive rights, listened to experiences of women with disabilities on sexual and reproductive health, and received a presentation on the ecumenical response to sexual and reproductive health care.\nLearn more about Ecumenical Disability Advocates Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSubscribe to the WCC news!\n\n\nPlease fill in this form if you would like to receive news and updates from the WCC by email.\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated programmes\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nEcumenical Disability Advocates Network (EDAN)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nJust Community of Women and Men\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook grows the circle of \u201cdreaming and screaming\" about gender-based violence\n\n\n14 March 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn International Women\u2019s Day, \u201cwe want us alive\u201d \n\n\n13 March 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature story\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-religious voices of concern in lead-up to International Women\u2019s Day \n\n\n07 March 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn International Women\u2019s Day, find ways to end femicide\n\n\n29 February 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursdays in Black shares Valentine\u2019s Day messages from the heart\n\n\n12 February 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature story\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs femicide cases rises, Kenyan religious leaders move to act\n\n\n06 February 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit the WCC\nEcumenical Centre\n1 Route des Morillons\n1218 Le Grand-Saconnex - Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAbout the WCC\n\n\nMember churches\n\n\nNews\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nWhat we do\n\n\nGet involved\n\n\nResources\n\n\nContact & Press\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nAssembly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\nfacebook\n\n\ntwitter\n\n\nyoutube\n\n\nyoutube\n\n\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\u00a9 Copyright WCC 2024\n\nSite Map\n\n\nConditions for Use\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
