She wrote,\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe issue, however, was not whether we want people to create families (we\u2019re the pro-life movement \u2014 we love babies) but whether creating disposable children, a common event with IVF, is a good idea.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n(Click HERE to listen to an episode of Explicitly Pro-Life entitled, \u201cInfertility, IVF, and the Pro-Life Ethic\u201d with Kristan Hawkins and Stephanie Gray Connors.)\u00a0\u00a0\nHawkins uses the term \u201cdisposable children\u201d because the IVF industry in the United States is almost unregulated and therefore provides \u201ccontroversial services,\u201d according to the Washington Post. These services include sex selection, commercial surrogacy anonymous sperm donation, and screening for physical characteristics such as eye color. Such screening also includes screening for rare genetic diseases as an argument why certain lab-created embryos should be tossed. Hawkins asserted,\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis wild, wild west of science is well known to families dealing with rare diseases\u2026In my own family, two of my four children have cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease impacting the lungs and digestive system, requiring daily treatment and diligence to ensure enough calories are consumed and to keep fragile lungs clear.\u00a0\nBut\u202fJen Gann, a parenting editor of New York wrote a \u202fcover story\u202fabout her toddler Dudley who also has CF. She expresses the throwaway culture as she writes about her wrongful-birth suit and her desire for the chance to have ended his life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n(Click HERE to read an in-depth pro-life response to the IVF dilemma.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHawkins made the point in her article that it is unsettling that we are playing God with our children\u2019s lives by choosing to let them live or die based upon how pleased we are by their characteristics. After all, a human being\u2019s life is intrinsically valuable based solely upon the fact that they are human\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter what color their eyes are or what disease they may live with. Life is sacred and diverse; for us to say otherwise seems blatantly discriminatory. On top of that, it also turns children into a commodity, not a blessing. Hawkins explained this, saying:\u00a0\n\u201cIn the context in which we allow people to live\u202fif\u202fwe are satisfied with all their characteristics, society moves away from children as a unique gift, deserving of our acceptance, care, and love to a commodity, available for purchase\u2026We cannot tell children we love them unconditionally when we shopped for the perfect child and disposed of those that didn\u2019t measure up.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSFLA is not making a moral judgement of someone who has used IVF, but as members of the pro-life movement, we need to consider and be concerned over the culture of dispensability created using IVF. As a movement, we need to work on caring for families and women who are struggling with fertility while we also protect life at all stages\u2014from conception to natural death.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo read the entirety of Hawkins\u2019 article on IVF, click HERE.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: IVF and Abortion Are Commodifying Children\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 4,380\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
