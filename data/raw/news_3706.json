She is presenting \u201cEquipped for Life: A Fresh Approach to Conversations About Abortion\u201d Oct. 1 at Lumen Christi in St. Paul to prepare attendees for confident conversations about abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nBefore college, pro-life activism wasn\u2019t on Albrecht\u2019s radar. Her Catholic high school had a pro-life club, but the Oshkosh, Wisconsin, native wasn\u2019t a member. \u201cI was pro-life because that\u2019s what my parents told me to be, and that\u2019s what the Church told me to be,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, when I got to college, I had zero plans to get involved.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was Albrecht\u2019s roommate Meredith Maloley \u2014 now client services director at Northfield Women\u2019s Center \u2014 who encouraged her to join the college\u2019s pro-life club, Oles for Life. Members were painfully aware of campus animosity toward the pro-life movement, which had been on full display at the Northfield Women\u2019s Center banquet protest.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201c(Students) managed to organize themselves and line the hallways of the student union with signs, screaming at the mostly elderly members of the community that had come to support the pregnancy resource center. That is what the St. Olaf campus was like when I got there,\u201d Albrecht said. In that environment, she didn\u2019t want to tell anyone she was pro-life, but acquiesced with Maloley\u2019s persistence.\u00a0- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nHowever, \u201cevery single thing we tried failed epically,\u201d she said. Club members spent hours putting up a pro-life display with information they thought would appeal to students\u2019 interest in equality, and it was torn down 13 times in a single week.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the end of her freshman year, Albrecht became co-president of the club, which had only four members from a student body of 3,000. They knew they needed a new game plan and discovered the Equal Rights Institute. They all enrolled in its online Equipped for Life course.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe figured out in about the first two seconds that it was the game changer that we were looking for,\u201d Albrecht said. By the fall of 2019, \u201cour very tiny club was now completely trained through ERI on how to talk to pro-choice people, how to understand their arguments, how to respond to them, how to create dialogue.\u201d\u00a0\nThey set up a table in the student union with a poll: Should abortion remain legal in the United States? \u201cPeople would come up and voice their opinion on that \u2026 and we would engage in conversations with hundreds of students,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cWe did this constantly for three straight years \u2026 and if we fast-forward to three years later, everything about my campus had changed.\u201d\u00a0\nThe club witnessed an attitude shift on campus toward pro-life advocates, Albrecht said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI cannot tell you how many conversations I had at that table that ended with the pro-choice person saying to me something like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to think right now. I need to take some time to process this, but I just want you to know that I really respect your club,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe were taken seriously because even if people didn\u2019t agree with our stance, they respected us because they genuinely had never seen pro-life people be genuine and loving, and at the same time, be able to engage with good arguments, be able to have these conversations and be respectful.\u201d\u00a0\nDuring Albrecht\u2019s senior year in 2021, the Northfield Women\u2019s Center fundraising banquet returned to campus \u2014 and no students protested, she said.\u00a0\nA parishioner of St. Agnes in St. Paul, Albrecht has worked for ERI since 2020, and she\u2019s one of its most recognizable faces. She appears on ERI\u2019s social media including YouTube, Facebook Reels and TikTok, and she co-hosts its podcast \u201cEquipped for Life\u201d with Josh Brahm, president of the North Carolina-based organization. She cheekily describes her work as \u201c(helping) pro-life people to be less weird.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIn other words, what I\u2019m trying to do is help pro-life advocates to make more good arguments and fewer bad ones, and I try to help us connect relationally with people who are different from us so that we can actually engage with their ideas,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nAlbrecht said ERI has seen an uptick in speaker requests due to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which returned abortion policy-making to the states.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor a pro-life person, \u201cYour No. 1 goal is to show pro-choice people that you are not what they thought,\u201d she said. \u201cThese stereotypes are abounding right now, and pro-life people are feeling scared and betrayed. And I think that pro-life people have this incredible opportunity and even a little bit of an obligation to stand up to that, to demonstrate who we are.\u201d\n______________________________________\nHOW TO TALK ABOUT ABORTION\u00a0\n\u2013 \u201cEquipped for Life: A Fresh Approach to Conversations About Abortion\u201d\u00a0\n\u2013 9 a.m.\u20134 p.m. at Lumen Christi, 2055 Bohland Ave., St. Paul\u00a0\n\u2013 $15 half day, $20 full day.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2013 Emily Albrecht of the Equal Rights Institute will share a tested set of practical tools to use in conversations about abortion.
