They later realized the edited embryos also contained significant unintended edits that could lead to birth defects or other major medical issues later in life. The embryos were subsequently destroyed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sugarcoating this,\u201d Fyodor Urnov, a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, told OneZero. \u201cThis is a restraining order for all genome editors to stay the living daylights away from embryo editing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really terrible, what they\u2019re talking about, because gene editing for embryos, because it\u2019s germline changes, meaning that if these children survive, their children, this will be passed on, it\u2019s like changing the biology of the human being, the DNA of human beings,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Meaney, PH.D., speaking Friday in an interview on EWTN Pro-Life Weekly, said that the experiment gone wrong was predictable, because \u201cscience, as it emerges into new areas, makes a lot of mistakes.\u201d\nMeany said it is \u201cwonderful\u201d that secular scientists raised alarms about the experiment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see that there\u2019s a universal consensus that this should not be done,\u201d he said.\nHe also cautioned against arguments from some scientists who contend that such experiments are ethical because the embryos are not permitted to be carried to term and born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this to our youngest brothers and sisters,\u201d Meaney said.\nHe added that while there might be permissible uses of such technology for adults and children in the womb, \u201cyou can\u2019t conceive a child in a laboratory, and experiment on them in a laboratory.\u201d\n\u201cSo these little embryos, even though they were created in labs, are our brothers and sisters,\u201d he said.\nOn Thursday, the Vatican released an updated version of the Directory for Catechesis which contained new sections on bioethics. The 300-page book, which provides universal norms for pastors and catechists in the work of evangelization, said that \u201cbioethical questions challenge catechesis and its formative function.\u201d\nThe Vatican document states that scientific research and its applications \u201care not morally neutral,\u201d and that the morality of an action cannot be based on \u201ctechnical efficiency alone, from utility or from dominant ideologies.\u201d\nThe directory talks about genetic experimentation and the risk of it leading to eugenic practices, stating that \u201cit is important to distinguish the difference carefully between therapeutic intervention and manipulation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correction of genetic abnormalities is lawful \u201cas long as it promotes the good of the person without affecting his identity and integrity,\u201d it said.\n\n\nKeywords: \nbioethics\newtn pro-life weekly\ngene editing\nmedium\none zero\nuc berkeley\n\n\n\n\nKate Scanlon/EWTN News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed Moral Guidance on IVF?
