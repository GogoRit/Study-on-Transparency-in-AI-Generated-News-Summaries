It also said, however, that the Indiana Constitution protects a person\u2019s right to have an abortion when needed to save their life.Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky Inc. filed for a rehearing on July 31. The constitutionally protected right to a life-saving abortion is broader than the law\u2019s exception for abortions needed \u201cto prevent death or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function,\u201d the group said. If the constitutional right protects access to abortion in circumstances not covered by the law\u2019s current life-health exception, then allowing the law to take effect might cause abortion patients \u201cto suffer serious (and unconstitutional) consequences while the trial court\u201d considers evidence on a novel question, the group said in its petition.The court didn\u2019t give any reasons for Monday\u2019s order denying the motion for a rehearing. In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Loretta H. Rush said that Planned Parenthood improperly asked to keep the entire injunction in place while it went back to the trial court to ask for a narrower injunction defining the scope of the constitutional right to life. \u201cThere is simply no sound legal basis for an interim injunction that is even broader than the relief Plaintiffs intend to pursue in the trial court,\u201d Rush said.Justice Christopher M. Goff dissented from the rehearing denial. No one knows \u201cthe precise contours of\u201d the life-health exception, he said. \u201cHaving declared the right of a woman to protect her health, this Court should not now let that right go unprotected\u201d while the case proceeds, he said.Goff said he would put a limited, state-wide injunction in place so that the trial court could consider whether to issue a new injunction or for lawmakers to revise the statute.Post-Dobbs LawIndiana\u2019s law bans all abortions with three narrow exceptions, including a health-life exception. It was one of the first state laws to take effect after the US Supreme Court said in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization that there\u2019s no federal constitutional right to abortion.A state trial court had halted its enforcement based on the state constitution\u2019s inalienable rights clause, which mirrors language found in other states\u2019 founding documents. That court will now be asked to determine if the law\u2019s hospitalization provision violates the state constitution\u2019s equal privileges and immunities clause, which wasn\u2019t part of the appeal.The state high court said its decision also doesn\u2019t prevent future abortion litigation in Indiana, because there\u2019s been no showing that every single part of the law can be applied consistently with the state constitution in every conceivable set of circumstances.Planned Parenthood has received funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization founded by Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg Law is operated by entities controlled by Michael Bloomberg.The case is Members of Med. Licensing Bd. of Ind. v. Planned Parenthood Great Nw., Haw., Alaska, Ind., Ky., Inc., Ind., No. 22S-PL-338, 8/21/23.
