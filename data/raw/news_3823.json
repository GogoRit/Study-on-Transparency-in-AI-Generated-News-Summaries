Or if the meeting she organized had turned violent, or if she\u2019d been a man who started a revolution,\u00a0maybe then she would be famous.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what this 23-year-old Quaker schoolteacher did 169 years ago \u2013 on Oct. 15, 1851, in the little Indiana town of Dublin \u2013 was to start one of this country\u2019s first statewide campaigns for women\u2019s right to vote in America. And she is not famous.\nNeither are Grace Julian Clarke, Helen Gougar, Marie Edwards or the many other Indiana women who dared to be suffragists in a state where being conservative is almost a religion.\nThey were church ladies, schoolteachers, librarians; some were wives and daughters of the wealthiest men in town; some were the first female doctors and lawyers in Indiana. Unlikely rebels who knew risked what one southern Indiana newspaper reporter described as \u201ccertain ostracism based on horror of any progressive principle.\u201d\nThey were not the militant suffragists who staged public protests and picketed at the White House. Hoosier suffragists practiced what was called \u201cpetticoat diplomacy.\u201d They circulated petitions, set up booths at county fairs, made speeches on auto tours through small towns. In Evansville and Fort Wayne, they invited the public to suffrage teas. In Indianapolis, they hired a hot air balloon and dropped pamphlets over the state capital. Several filed lawsuits claiming a right to vote, but they always lost in Indiana courts.\nIn 1854, they filed their first petition asking the Indiana State Legislature for voting rights \u2013 then repeated the appeal for 66 years while lawmakers turned a deaf ear. In the end, Indiana was the last state in the Midwest and the 26th state in the nation to ratify the 19th Amendment, on Jan. 26, 1920.\nGov. James Putnam Goodrich called it \u201can act of tardy justice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen of the Century: Recognizing the accomplishments of women from the last 100 years\nUSA TODAY\n\n\nMuch like today\u2019s prolonged political wars over gun rights and reproductive rights, the suffrage movement was a state-by-state battle \u2013 because the U.S. Constitution gives states broad authority to set their own election laws. So until women gained the federal right to vote, women in each state had to petition their all-male state legislators for voting rights. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the 2 million member National American Woman\u2019s Suffrage Association, said Indiana was one of the five most difficult states for winning the franchise.\nIt\u2019s a story not told in the history books and movies that famously portray national suffrage leaders and their dramatic victory in 1920 when Congress finally approved the 19th Amendment. But that historic victory would not have happened if not for the 150-year revolution by incredibly persistent and courageous women in hometowns in Indiana and across the nation.\nWhat they achieved \u2013 without ever firing a shot \u2013\u00a0was the biggest expansion of democracy in America\u2019s history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you registered to vote?\n\nFind out\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment this August,\u00a0and to mark the occasion, the USA TODAY Network is naming 10 American women from each state and the District of Columbia to recognize their contributions to their state or the nation as Women of the Century.\u00a0Each has a documented track record of outstanding accomplishment in fields such\u00a0as art and\u00a0literature, civil rights, education, entertainment, law, media, nonprofits and\u00a0philanthropy, politics, science and\u00a0medicine, and\u00a0sports.\nIndiana\u2019s history of producing strong women made the selection difficult\u00a0because picking just 10 leaves out so many. The compelling stories of so many incredible women aren\u2019t told.\nTwo legendary suffragists not on the list are Marie Stuart Edwards of Peru, Indiana, who helped found the national League of Women Voters, and Helen Gougar, a Lafayette lawyer who challenged the injustices through the court system.\nA few others include the Olympic gold medalist from Evansville, 23-year-old Lilly King. She is the winningest female breaststroker in NCAA history,\u00a0the current world record-holder in the sport and a speaker for clean sports in the World Anti-Doping Association. King\u00a0won her first two gold medals at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Another is\u00a0Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who in 2014 became the first woman to be the state's chief justice. And France A. Cordova, who in 2007 became Purdue University\u2019s first female president.\nThose included here come from various generations and across the spectrum of categories But all are champions of the same pioneering spirit that has long\u00a0motivated women in Indiana.\n\n\nWho is your Woman of the Century?\n\nLet us know\nDid we miss a woman you think should be on our list? We\u2019d like to hear from you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbion Fellows Bacon\u00a0\nActivist\n(1865-1933)\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Library of Congress, Illustration: USA TODAY Network\n\n\nIn 1909, it would be another 11 years before women gained the right to vote in Indiana. But Albion Fellows Bacon was waiting for the ballot. Her two daughters had contracted scarlet fever that was spreading from Evansville\u2019s overcrowded and dilapidated tenements. Bacon began\u00a0campaigning for housing reforms and other changes, and by the time of her death in 1933, she was responsible for more social legislation than anyone else in Indiana.\nShe was instrumental not just in housing reforms, but also in child labor laws and school attendance laws. She drafted the bill that created the Indiana Department of Probation and its juvenile probation department. Through her efforts, the Child Welfare Association was formed.\nBacon is considered Evansville\u2019s \u201cmost famous and beloved woman.\u201d In the Progressive Era, she helped establish many of the social service and health agencies that serve the city today. At heart, she was an artist and musician. She wrote hundreds of poems and at least 16 books, including an autobiography, \u201cBeauty for Ashes,\u201d that was used as a sociology text at Union Theological Seminary.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEva Mozes Kor\nHuman rights advocate\n(1934-2019)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Karlheinz Schindler, Illustration: USA TODAY Network\n\n\nThe Mozes family was the only Jewish family in the tiny village of Portz, Romania, when it was occupied by the Nazis in 1934. Eva and her twin sister, Miriam, were 6. At age 10, they were packed into a cattle car and transported to the Auschwitz death camp.\nThere, they became human guinea pigs in genetic experiments under the direction of Dr. Josef Mengele. About 1,500 sets of twins \u2013 3,000 children \u2013 were abused, and most died as a result of those experiments. Eva survived and became an international champion of human rights, peace and the power of forgiveness.\nIn 2007, Eva worked with state legislators to gain passage of an Indiana law requiring Holocaust\u00a0education in secondary schools. She died in 2019 in Terre Haute, which had become her home and  where she established the nonprofit CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center, which continues\u00a0her teachings.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSallie Wyatt Stewart\nBlack rights activist\n(1881-1951)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: University of Southern Indiana David L. Rice Archives, Illustration: USA Today Network\n\n\nSallie Stewart was a young teacher in Evansville\u2018s elementary school for Black children in 1903 when the worst race riot in the city\u2019s history left 12 of her neighbors dead and more than 25 wounded. The event profoundly affected her, propelling her into action to improve life in Evansville.\nShe organized the Evansville Federation of Colored Women\u2019s Club and led its effort in 1918-1919 to establish the first day care center for children of Black working mothers. She served as first secretary of the local NAACP chapter in 1915 and was a founder of Evansville\u2019s first Inter-Racial Commission. She founded a boarding house and recreation center for young Black women. During World War II, she organized the local Colored Women\u2019s War Work Community that sold bonds and stamps to help support the war. She continued teaching for 50 years.\nHer influence was felt on a national scale. Stewart was president of the Indiana Federation of Colored Women from 1921 to 1928, then president of the 200,000-member National Association of Colored Women, leading efforts to raise the standards of living for Black women and\u00a0their families. She founded the National Association of Colored Girls in 1930, the same year she served as a delegate to the International Council of Women in Vienna, Austria, and was the first African-American to be elected president of the National Council of Women in the United States. She also was a founder and first secretary of the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association.\nHer husband, Logan Stewart, was the first Black Realtor in Evansville. \n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Murray Free\nChemist\n(1923-\u00a0)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: J. Scott Applewhite, Illustration: USA TODAY Network\n\n\nPeople around the world continue to benefit from the pioneering research by chemist Helen Murray Free, who in 1956 revolutionized many self-testing systems for diabetes and other diseases by developing the dip-and-read strips. Still in use today, the strips allow for testing to be more convenient and efficient, enabling doctors and patients to no longer have to rely on labs for results.\nShe was a student at the College of Wooster when Pearl Harbor was bombed, men went to war\u00a0and there were suddenly job openings for women in what had been male-dominated careers. She switched her major to chemistry and says it was the most exciting thing that ever happened to her.\nGraduating with honors in 1945, she applied for an opening in the biochemistry research group led by Alfred Free at Miles Laboratories. Within two years, the couple were married and became lifelong research partners. They had six children.\nFree retired in 1982 and\u00a0now promotes\u00a0science education\u00a0through programs such as Kids & Chemistry and Expanding Your Horizons. She focuses on\u00a0female and underprivileged students.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanet Carpenter\nNurse\u00a0\n(1966-\u00a0 )\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Eric Schoch, Indiana University School of Nursing, Illustration: USA Today Network\n\n\nA researcher at the Indiana University of School of Nursing, Dr. Janet Carpenter has led groundbreaking studies on the symptoms and management of menopause\u00a0to improve the lives of midlife women. She\u2019s considered a pioneer on hot flashes and how to mitigate or eliminate them, and she uses her research to test methods other than hormones to treat menopausal symptoms specifically to prevent breast cancer.\nCarpenter received postdoctoral training at the University of Kentucky and was on the faculty at Vanderbilt University before joining the IU nursing faculty in Indianapolis in 2003. Her \u201cdaily interference\u201d scale has been used by researchers worldwide and translated into 12 languages.\nWith an interactive exhibit titled \u201cHot Flashes?

During her single term in office, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She used her public position to discuss her diagnosis to reduce the stigma associated with the disease.\u00a0\nLloyd held a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and sociology from Howard University, a master\u2019s degree in counseling from Butler University and a doctorate in marriage and family counseling from Purdue University. While raising\u00a0four children, she protested segregation at the Indiana State Fair. She was also a member of\u00a0the NAACP and the League of Women Voters.\nAfter her term in the Legislature, she became involved in housing issues,\u00a0eventually starting\u00a0her own realty business and becoming active in the National Board of Realtors. She served on the Indianapolis Public Housing Authority and the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. She also helped found the Butler Tarkington Neighborhood Association and the Center for Leadership Development.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKathleen Flossie Bailey\nCivil rights activist\n(1895-1952)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Indianapolis Star photo archive, Illustration: USA TODAY Network\n\n\nCivil rights activist Kathleen Flossie Bailey led the successful campaign for adoption of Indiana\u2019s anti-lynching law in 1931 and lobbied for a national anti-lynching law, as well as for school integration and fair treatment of African Americans in hospitals,\u00a0movie theaters and other public spaces.\nShe was president of the NAACP chapter in Marion in 1930 when a mob broke\u00a0into the Grant County jail there, dragged two African American men to the courthouse square and hanged them from a tree. The lynching occurred after she had tried to obtain police protection for the two men, Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith. No one was ever punished for the crime.\nShe and her husband, Dr. Walter T. Bailey, moved to Indianapolis around 1940 after he suffered a stroke and closed his medical practice. Their home in Marion had served as Indiana headquarters for the NAACP for a time while she was state president. She was a recipient of the national NAACP\u2019s Madam C. J.

Afterward, she began racing airplanes\u00a0and was still at it in 2001, racing from London to Sydney at age 79. She logged more than 40,000 hours of flying time.\nShe picked up 150 trophies\u00a0as she raced in Powder Puff Derbies,\u00a0Air Race Classics, the Grand Prix and the Denver Mile High. As she grew older, she didn't slow down.\u00a0In 1994, at the age of 72, she completed the Round-the-World Air Race. She received the NAA Elder Statesman Aviation Award in 1999.\nHer interest in aviation began at age 8 when she saw a barnstormer land in a field near her family\u2019s farm outside Fort Wayne. She told Brokaw she initially wanted to be a flight attendant\u00a0but became curious about what would happen to the plane if the pilot couldn\u2019t function. She went to a flight training school and flew her first solo flight at\u00a019.\nAfter the war, she married banker Morris Ringenberg, who died in 2003. Their two children flew with her in many races and were in the winner's circle with her to receive trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDorothy Stratton\nFirst female officer in the U.S. Coast Guard\n(1899-2006)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Lafayette Journal and Courier file, Illustration: USA TODAY Network\n\n\nA trailblazer for women in the 20th century, Dorothy Stratton became a \u201cfirst\u201d in\u00a0several fields. She was the first woman to be commissioned an officer in the U.S Coast Guard and was the first director of its women\u2019s reserve unit, SPAR, from 1942 until January 1946.\nBefore that, she was Purdue University\u2019s first full-time dean of women from\u00a01933 to 1945. Under her tenure, the number of\u00a0women enrolled at Purdue increased from 500 to more than 1,400. Stratton worked to develop an experimental curriculum that attracted women who wanted to study subjects other than home economics. With more women enrolled, Stratton oversaw the construction of new residence halls to house them. She also\u00a0helped to establish a national training program for fraternity and sorority housemothers.\nAfter her service in the Coast Guard, Stratton\u00a0became the first director of personnel at the International Monetary Fund from 1947 to 1950\u00a0and then was national director of the Girl Scouts of the USA from 1950 to 1960. She lived to be 107.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay Wright Sewall\nSuffragist\n(1844-1920)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library, Illustration: USA TODAY Network\n\n\nMay Wright Sewall was the best known of Indiana suffragists, leading the fight for women\u2019s rights on a national and international level. As an educator, social reformer and peace advocate, she was considered one of the most influential Hoosiers in the world in the late 1800s and early 1900s. \u00a0\nHer home was Indianapolis, where she founded organizations that continue to serve the community today \u2013 the Indianapolis Propylaeum, which promotes educational opportunities for women in the sciences and the arts; the Indianapolis Woman\u2019s Club, the Art Association of Indianapolis (now the Indianapolis Museum of Art) and its affiliated art school which is now the Herron School of Art and Design at IUPUI. \u00a0She also started the Contemporary Club and the Fortnightly Club, still in existence. In 1882, she founded the Classical School for Girls, providing Midwestern girls the opportunity to get an Ivy League-level education.\u00a0\nBut Sewall became most widely known for her work in the organized woman\u2019s movement. An ardent suffragist, she worked tirelessly alongside Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton for a woman\u2019s right to vote not just in the United States but also across the world. She was chairman of the executive committee of the 2 million member National Woman Suffrage Association for eight years, served as president of the National Council of Women of the United States from 1897 to 1899 and president of the International Council of Women from 1899 to 1904. \u00a0\nIn 1915, toward the end of her life, she was among 60 delegates who joined Henry Ford\u2019s Peace Ship, in an attempt to halt the war in Europe prior to World War I.\u00a0\u00a0She believed that \u201conce educated and armed with political rights, women could stop war, clean up Society and create a better world for humankind.\u201d\u00a0\nShortly before her death in 1920, Sewall shocked her friends by releasing a book detailing her belief in spiritualism and her communication with her late husband, Theodore Sewall.\u00a0\nShe died two months before enactment of the 19th\u00a0Amendment that granted women the voting rights she had worked so hard for.\u00a0\nSources used in the Women of the Century list project include\u00a0newspaper articles, state archives, historical websites, encyclopedias and other resources.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy this url to your clipboard\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\nShare this woman\u2019s story\n\n\nMore coverage\nWomen of the Century: They didn\u2019t succeed despite adversity, but often because of it\n50 states: Learn about notable women from every state\nWho is your Woman of the Century?: Let us know\nRecognizing women past and present: See all of our coverage\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n\t\t7:10 pm UTC Aug. 13, 2020\nUpdated\n\t\t9:17 pm UTC Aug. 15, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n          \n\n\nTerms of Service\n          \n\n\nSubscription Terms and Conditions\n          \n\n\nYour California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n          \n\n\nSite Map\n          \n\n\nAccessibility\n          \n\n\nEthical Principles\n          \n\n\nCookie Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
