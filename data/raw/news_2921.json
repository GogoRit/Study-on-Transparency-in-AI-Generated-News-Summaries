Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJoe Rogan took on a conservative commentator during a heated discussion on abortion, during which he referenced his 14-year-old daughter to make a point about pregnancy resulting from rape.The controversial podcaster \u2013 who has received backlash for his polarising views on Covid-19 vaccinations \u2013 referenced the recent overturning of Roe v Wade with guest Seth Dillon during a recent taping of his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.When the two began discussing a woman\u2019s right to an abortion in the instance of rape, Rogan butted heads with the founder and CEO of the conservative satirical news site, The Babylon Bee. \u201cThere are women who have been raped who should not have to f**king carry some rapist\u2019s baby,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cThere\u2019s women who have been sexually assaulted before the age of 14.\u201dIn response, Dillon replied: \u201cThere are people who have been born of rape and are alive right now, and are pro-life. They go around speaking and say how: \u2018I had a right to live.\u2019 They will go around and make a case, and they were born of a rape.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to tell my 14-year-old girl she has to carry a rapist\u2019s baby,\u201d Rogan responded. \u201cDo you understand that? You don\u2019t have the right to tell my 14-year-old daughter she has to carry her rapist\u2019s baby.\u201dRecommended\u2018This is disgusting\u2019: Joe Rogan faces huge criticism over \u2018shoot the homeless\u2019 podcast commentJoe Rogan claims he\u2019s turned down Trump\u2019s requests to appear on his show: \u2018I don\u2019t want to help him\u2019Joe Rogan guest tries to blame Uvalde failings on \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement \u201cThat\u2019s a 14-year-old child,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf a 14-year-old child gets raped, you say that they have to carry that baby?\u201dDillon rebutted, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think two wrongs make a right. I don\u2019t think murder fixes a rape.\u201dRogan, 55, is a father to two daughters \u2013 Lola, 14, and Rosy, 12 \u2013 who he shares with wife Jessica. The former UFC commentator is also a stepfather to his wife\u2019s 23-year-old daughter, Kayja Rose, from a previous relationship.A clip of the exchange was shared on social media by pro-life advocate Lila Rose, where many viewers expressed their surprise at Rogan\u2019s stance on abortion given his public persona for having conservative views.\u201cThis is awesome. I\u2019m not a Rogan fan, but I think he\u2019s probably a good guy and he genuinely cares,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. \u201cHe is one of, if not the only, American with a big platform that is willing to listen and talk out opposing views.\u201d\u201cJoe talks about his own daughter. The other goof talks about some Christian influencers who give lectures about themselves,\u201d a Reddit user commented.\u201cWhat a breath of fresh air that he can at least see what\u2019s wrong with policy that directly impacts his daughter in a negative way,\u201d said another Redditor. \u201cA lot of people lack the empathy/compassion/desire to see how their beliefs would apply to others.\u201dRogan recently pushed back against claims that he\u2019s a \u201csecret conservative\u201d during an episode of his podcast on 25 July. While chatting with comedian Andrew Schultz about politics and same-sex marriage, Rogan defended the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalise same-sex marriage, and slammed Republicans like Ted Cruz who wish to ban it as \u201chomophobic\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s not just abortion rights, but now they\u2019re going after gay marriage too, which is so strange to me,\u201d Rogan said during the podcast episode. \u201cGay marriage is not silly. It\u2019s marriage - it\u2019s marriage from people that are homosexual and it\u2019s, for them, it\u2019s important. They want it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so homophobic,\u201d Rogan continued, adding that the GOP\u2019s opposition to gay marriage is \u201cthe kind of sh*t that keeps me from being a Republican\u201d.\u201cPeople will say, like: \u2018Oh, you know, you\u2019re a secret conservative.\u2019 Like you can suck my d**k,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the f**k you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m so far away from being a Republican.\u201dMore aboutJoe Roganabortionroe v wadeJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Joe Rogan shuts down pro-life guest in heated abortion debateJoe Rogan shuts down pro-life guest in heated abortion debateYouTube\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
