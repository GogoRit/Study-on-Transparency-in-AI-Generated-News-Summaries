AFP via Getty Images\n\nKEY FACTS\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood has long refuted the claims that it was founded on racist ideals and alluded to the allegation in a recent statement announcing its new CEO and president Alexis McGill Johnson, saying that it \u201chas publicly committed to reckoning with its history, investing in work aimed at engaging communities of color, and improving Planned Parenthood\u2019s health care delivery.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nMuch of the controversy stems from a 1939 letter Sanger wrote about her effort to open clinics in the rural south, which she called \u201cThe Negro Project.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanger recruited Black leaders to support the project and, in the letter, she said that white men should not run the clinics and that there would be more community involvement and support if the clinics were run by Black doctors because they could \u201cget closer to their members and more or less lay their cards on the table which means their superstitions, ignorance, and doubts.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first half of the sentence was referenced in a letter Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 25 House Republicans sent in 2015 urging the National Portrait Gallery to remove a bust of Sanger to support their claim that she \u201cfamously espoused birth control as a method for controlling the population of minorities.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHistorians have argued that the line has been taken out of context and that she was referring to people\u2019s suspicions, not Planned Parenthood\u2019s goal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nkey background\nAnti-abortion activists also point to the fact that Stanger, who is seen as the founder of the birth control movement, spoke about birth control at a women\u2019s branch of the Klu Klux Klan in 1926.\u00a0Planned Parenthood has since denounced the meeting with the Klu Klux Klan, saying that it \u201cstrongly disagrees with Sanger\u2019s decision to address an organization that spreads hatred.\u201d They also argue that, while Sanger believed in the \u201cbroader issues of health and fitness that concerned the early 20th-century eugenics movement,\u201d she believed that reproductive decisions should be made by individuals and that she \u201cconsistently and firmly repudiated any strictly racial application of eugenics principles.\u201d She did believe in some of the eugenics principles \u201cprogressives\u201d of the day favored that many would balk at today, including Planned Parenthood, which has said there are \u201cmajor flaws in Sanger\u2019s views\u201d and called them \u201cwrong.\u201d \"That Sanger was enamored and supported some eugenicists' ideas is certainly true,\" Susan Reverby, a health care historian and professor at Wellesley College, told NPR in a 2015 article about the allegations. But, she added, Sanger's main argument was not eugenics \u2014 it was that \"Sanger thought people should have the children they wanted.\"\ncrucial quote\n\u201cThe sentence may have been thoughtlessly composed, but it is perfectly clear that she was not endorsing genocide,\u201d Ellen Chesler, author of Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America, wrote in a 2011 Salon article.\n\nchief critic\n\u201cAny insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantlizing,\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s Director of Black Leadership and Engagement Nia Martin-Robinson told Forbes in an emailed statement. \u201cAt Planned Parenthood, we trust and we stand with Black women who have, and continue to lead the charge when it comes to the health, rights and bodily autonomy of those in their communities.\u201d\ntangent\nWest\u2019s famous wife Kim Kardashian West, has been supportive of Planned Parenthood. In an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, she and her sisters Khloe and Kourtney went to a Planned Parenthood center to talk to women. \"The perception of Planned Parenthood is that it's like this abortion clinic,\" Kardashian West said during the episode. \"That's nothing like what it's like. Hearing that first-hand really made it real for me.\" (West made his view of abortion clear in the four-hour Forbes interview saying, \"I am pro-life because I'm following the word of the bible.\u201d)\u00a0\n\nInstagram\nbig number\n600. Planned Parenthood runs more than 600 health centers across the country.\u00a0\nwhat to watch for\nWest says he will run for president in 2020, and likes his odds. \u201cLike anything I\u2019ve ever done in my life, I\u2019m doing to win,\u201d he told Forbes.\u00a0\n\nfurther reading\nWhat Margaret Sanger Really Said About Eugenics and Race (Time)\nWas Planned Parenthood's Founder Racist?
