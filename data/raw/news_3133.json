One of those individuals here in the Diocese of Columbus is uniquely qualified to defend the intrinsic value of all human life through faith, reason and medical expertise.\nDr. Ashley Fernandes, MD, Ph.D., is a committed Catholic and also the associate director of the Center for Bioethics at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and an associate professor of pediatrics at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus. And when he\u2019s not teaching or speaking about medical ethics, he\u2019s also a practicing pediatrician.\nNext month, the nationally recognized physician and ethicist will serve as a featured speaker at the 17th annual Divine Mercy Medicine, Bioethics & Spirituality Conference, a virtual event sponsored by Healthcare Professionals for Divine Mercy. His talks during the three-day conference for those in healing professions include \u201cThe Enduring Significance of the Hippocratic Oath in a Secularist Culture\u201d and \u201cPediatric Bioethics.\u201d\nSince Fernandes earned a master\u2019s degree in philosophy from Johns Hopkins University in 1999, a medical degree from Ohio State in 2003 and a doctorate in philosophy from Georgetown University in 2008, he has given hundreds of similar presentations focusing on the moral reasoning for every person, not just physicians, to protect all human life from the womb to the grave.\nThat\u2019s sometimes not easy when you\u2019re teaching at a public university and working in a secularist culture with medical students who are influenced by pervasive \u201cpro-choice\u201d arguments.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that some people don\u2019t like what I say,\u201d Fernandes said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not \u2018preaching Catholicism\u2019 in my job. I\u2019m simply trying to create an environment of openness where students who might not have heard another point of view not only can hear that point of view but also can reflect on the experience of the things we know in Catholicism to be true. This is a foundational principle of natural law philosophy, which saints such as Thomas Aquinas and Pope John Paul II used effectively to dialogue with those different from them.\n\u201cBy having courage in certain instances and speaking out against things that are wrong \u2013 censorship and one-sidedness within the ethics curriculum \u2013 I can hopefully be kind of like the \u2018restraining hand,\u2019 if nothing else.\u201d\nUsing euthanasia as an example, Fernandes explained that most medical schools likely present only a pro-assisted suicide viewpoint.\n\u201cSo if I teach a course on that, I\u2019m going to invite the students to read articles about the other side \u2013 our (Catholic) side. These articles are not explicitly theological \u2013 they are often empirical, showing that the medical and sociological evidence favors life. If a committed pro-euthanasia medical student reads (perhaps for the first time) an article expressing a philosophical opposition to it, that\u2019s a good thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, if a student brings up religion or their Christianity, I\u2019m not going to immediately shut it down. I\u2019m going to let them speak and create that environment of openness.\n\u201cGod made us to gravitate to the truth and to affirm truth things through our experience. So by just allowing people to engage in dialogue with one another, then I think there has to be this element of confidence, that if people are open minded, and they use reason, that they will be led to certain truths about the human person.\u201d\nAnother scenario that Fernandes presents to students to make them think beyond popular rhetoric on life issues is the human dignity of persons with disabilities.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can press students and push them to say, \u2018Well, people with disabilities can\u2019t function the same way able-bodied people can, so what is it that gives them their dignity?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever reflected on that? And when you guide them into an uncomfortable position of self-reflection, then they start to think, \u2018Well, if it can\u2019t be based on what they do or what they don\u2019t do or what they did, then what is our human dignity based on?\u2019\n\u201cAnd a lot of students find that they have to keep going back and back and back and trying to establish things like the dignity of human life for the sake of sanctity of human life, if you will, in things that are transcendent.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to most surveys, most medical students support abortion. They are offered training in abortion procedures, but there\u2019s a misconception that doctors are required to perform an abortion or provide referrals to individuals seeking one.\n\u201cI can give you one example that really comes to mind,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cI was teaching a class to fourth-year medical students who were about to graduate. I was explaining to them that conscience protection is given to medical students and residents and physicians who don\u2019t want to do certain things, because it violates their philosophical or religious convictions.\u00a0\n\u201cTwo of them were going into OB (obstetrics), and they were very pro-choice. And they said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not true. If someone wants an abortion, you have to give it to them, or you have to refer them.\u2019 I said, \u2018Actually, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not sure where you learned that,\u2019 but they said, \u2018Well, we learned it in our curriculum here.\u2019\n\u201cSo I went up to my office, I brought some of the evidence like a printout of the statute in Ohio and the federal laws, and they looked at this and they were stunned. They were visibly stunned. And they said to me, \u2018You know, we don\u2019t agree with the pro-life movement, but if we had known this, we wouldn\u2019t have been so angry.\u2019\n\u201cSo that\u2019s kind of an example where I feel like it opened their mind, not to necessarily becoming pro-life all of a sudden but to an understanding of the other points of view: \u2018Yeah, medical students who are pro-life are actually within their rights within the law, and they\u2019re using their conscience.\u2019 And once these pro-choice medical students understood that, they were more tolerant. I consider that a victory.\u201d\nFernandes\u2019 embrace of the intermingling of science, faith and reason is rooted in his Catholic upbringing.\u00a0\nHis deeply devoted Catholic parents came to the United States from the Goa state of southwestern India, a Portuguese colony that considers St. Francis Xavier its patron saint, in the early 1970s. Fernandes\u2019 father also was a physician, and the five boys in the family followed in his footsteps and were accepted to medical school. Three of them completed the curriculum, and one left to enter the priesthood. Another brother is a judge in Toledo.\n\u201cMy mom was kind of the pious half, and my dad was more of the intellectual \u2013 let\u2019s dissect this, let\u2019s look at the philosophy of theology,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cThe intellectual arguments for my mom were not really as important as how holy you were inside \u2013 whether you said your rosary and whether you prayed every day.\u201d\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Toledo, he knew he wanted to be a doctor but also became fascinated with philosophy. He graduated with a double major in biology and philosophy with an emphasis on bioethics. \u00a0\u00a0\nAfter two years of medical school at Ohio State, he left to pursue graduate studies in philosophy at Johns Hopkins and then returned to complete his medical degree. He then did a residency in pediatrics in St. Louis from 2003 to 2006 before returning to Ohio to start his professional career at the Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine and then coming to Columbus in 2014.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that the more I studied, the more I learned about science, the more I learned about medicine, the more I learned about philosophy, those truths didn\u2019t contradict Church teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a harmonious element. It made more sense the more I studied.\u201d\nFernandes describes his career as having his feet in two worlds \u2013 the secular, which is clinical, and medical ethics. From a Catholic perspective, the challenge is to spread the truth about human life that\u2019s palatable to Christians and non-Christians.\n\u201cThere\u2019s that conversion process, and you look at it from the point of view that a doctor takes an oath to preserve life and that we have to look at all human life having a value,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that element of medicine \u2013 that all human life has a value \u2013 is under the greatest threat.\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019re seeing the challenge on the other end of the spectrum to where medical students and doctors are talking about how is it really life if an advanced Alzheimer\u2019s patient can\u2019t remember anything about their previous life but can function?\u00a0\n\u201cOf if you\u2019re in the ICU in a persistent vegetative state, is that life, or maybe biological life but it\u2019s not human life, or even through these various iterations of this? And it\u2019s qualified in other respects like, \u2018Well, it may be human life, but it may be OK to take that life anyway.\u2019 It is a deep societal and cultural debate about what constitutes a person.\n\u201cAnd I think in medicine and science, we\u2019re really developing this materialism about the human person, that the person is the sum of genes and biology, and anything which was not empirical is not real (but) only the things that we can test, we can verify.\u201d\nFrom the secularist\u2019s perspective, he noted, the reasoning is that if people want to kill themselves, they should be allowed to do so.\u00a0\n\u201cIn Catholicism, we really place a value to suffering, but in the materialist view, as soon as you yourself are tired of suffering, there\u2019s nothing after this life, right?\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cYou just become worm food. You\u2019re just atoms. We\u2019re randomly here by accident. So if you suffer, it really doesn\u2019t serve a purpose beyond this life.\u201d\nWith more technological capabilities now available than at any time in human history, physical and spiritual healings are made possible that reinforce the natural law that states every life at every stage has worth.\n\u201cThere is no contradiction between faith and reason,\u201d Fernandes emphasized. \u201cAs Pope Benedict pointed out, and every pope has pointed out, technology has to be used at the service of the human person in a way that reveals, and not obscures, that person\u2019s dignity, which is why Catholicism is beautiful in that it\u2019s very well balanced.\u00a0\n\u201cUltimately, technology has one purpose, and that is to reveal the truth of the dignity of man. We can\u2019t just embrace something because it is science, or because it is a new medical technology. If you think about abortion, your ability to kill an unborn child in the womb is a technology, and simply because doctors do it doesn\u2019t mean doctors ought to do it.\u201d\nPartly due to the technology in place today, Ohio and other states have initiated heartbeat laws that prohibit abortion once a baby\u2019s heartbeat can be detected in the womb. There\u2019s also real hope that the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion in the United States will soon be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u201cThe law is always a reflection of the codification of a moral point of view,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cSo whenever you see a statute that\u2019s pro-life or a law that\u2019s pro-life, that to me is a good sign that the culture is changing underneath it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPriority Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail *\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPriority Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail *\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n Local\nUS/World\nFeatures\nFaith\nCulture\nObituaries\nSports\nVideo\nAudio\nPhoto Essay\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoices\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n About Us\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nPast Issues\nDiocese of Columbus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n Subscribe\nJoin our Email Newsletter\nChange of Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Catholic Times\n/\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMade on Tilma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
