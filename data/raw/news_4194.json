The restrictions would require doctors to have \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d at local hospitals, which are difficult to obtain.The abortion case that could threaten women's reproductive rights in the USRead more\u201cThis case is about respect for the court\u2019s precedent,\u201d said Julie Rikelman, lead counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing an abortion clinic in Louisiana.Just four years ago, the court ruled a nearly identical law unconstitutional, in a Texas case called Whole Woman\u2019s Health v Hellerstedt. That the highest court even took the case was incredibly rare, leading many to believe it is predisposed to restrict abortion rights.\u201cThe Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it,\u201d she said. If upheld, the law would \u201cleave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions\u201d.The issue of precedent has suddenly cast a spotlight on Chief Justice John Roberts. The court may be newly conservative-leaning, but it is not without competing interests. Roberts is often described as an institutionalist who does not like to disturb precedent, even as he has opposed abortion rights in the past.However, he did little to tip his hand Wednesday. He asked a question to all three attorneys arguing before the court: if this law is upheld, does each state have to evaluate its benefits?\u201cCounsel, do you agree that the inquiry \u2026 is a factual one that has to proceed state-by-state?\u201d Roberts asked early in the arguments.For many years, the court had four justice in a liberal wing, four in a conservative wing. That pattern held up on Wednesday, but with another divide apparent, this one along gender lines.Three of the court\u2019s four liberal justices are women \u2013 the bench currently has three women in total \u2013 and all had tough questions for Louisiana\u2019s attorneys in the case.\u201cIs it right that there is evidence on the record that Hope clinic\u201d \u2013 the Louisiana abortion facility in question \u2013 \u201chas served over 3,000 women annually for 23 years, so that\u2019s around 70,000 women, and has transferred only four patients ever to a hospital?\u201d asked Justice Elena Kagan.An attorney for Louisiana, solicitor general Elizabeth Murrill, said the real rate could be higher.\u201cYou don\u2019t dispute that, among medical procedures, first-trimester abortion is among the safest, far safer than childbirth?\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg went on to ask.If the justices uphold Louisiana\u2019s law, with a ruling expected in June, it would have wide-reaching, immediate and severe consequences for abortion access across the US. One potential outcome is that the court upholds a law, keeping abortion legal, but in practice almost impossible to access.The 50-year fight by radical evangelicals that could end US abortion rightsRead moreAnother question before the court was whether abortion doctors should be able to sue the government on behalf of their patients. That question, which looks at what is called \u201cstanding\u201d, could revolutionize how cases against abortion restrictions are litigated.Justice Samuel Alito Jr, who sits on the conservative wing of the court, was particularly interested in the question, and asked repeatedly whether a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d could rule out standing. Abortion opponents often argue doctors who provide abortions only want to make money, and describe reproductive health services as the \u201cabortion industry\u201d.The court can rule as narrowly or broadly as it chooses, and with a newly rebalanced court that tilts conservative since Donald Trump\u2019s pick Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court, it is extremely difficult to make predictions even after oral arguments.Already, more than 350 legal professionals and organizations have weighed in, with \u201cfriend of the court\u201d amicus briefs. Surveys of the American public show a majority support legal abortion.Outside the court, a large gathering of reproductive rights activists stood on the court\u2019s steps, shouting, cheering and chanting. A smaller, but still fervent, group of anti-abortion protesters gathered immediately opposite.Two women flew from Mississippi to protest outside the supreme court. Derenda Hancock and Kim Gibson came from Jackson, where they both escort patients past protesters into the state\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic.\u201cThis is the end-all game,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been through this in Mississippi,\u201d she said, referring to the \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d laws in question.In Mississippi, she said doctors performing abortions submitted 32-page applications to all seven of the state\u2019s hospitals, she said. None would give them rights to transfer patients.\u201cWe have protests constantly \u2013 they don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle,\u201d she said, referring to many hospitals\u2019 reluctance to deal with protesters and the bureaucratic burden of doctors\u2019 applications for a privilege that is very rarely used. Early term abortion is one of the safest medical procedures, statistics show.Explore more on these topicsAbortionUS supreme courtLaw (US)LouisianaWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
