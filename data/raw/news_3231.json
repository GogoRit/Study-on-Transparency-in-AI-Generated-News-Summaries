I believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drives these beliefs in me.

FLORIDA'S ANTHONY RICHARDSON DROPS 'AR-15' NICKNAME, NO LONGER WANTS TO BE 'ASSOCIATED' WITH GUN    Harbaugh previously mentioned his pro-life views in an interview with the National Review in 2020 ahead of the coronavirus-impacted college football season. He said at the time he saw a silver lining from the pandemic and saw it as a message from God.\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidence, personally, living a faith-based life,\" Harbaugh said. \"This is a message \u2014 this is something where, a time we grow in our faith. Having reverence and respect for God. You see people taking more a view of sanctity of life. I hope that continues \u2014 and not just in this time of crisis or pandemic.
