The policy is sponsored by Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia,\u00a0and Uganda, all countries where abortion is illegal or hard to access.\"There is so much work to do in terms of becoming a global force for good, in terms of global health care,\" said Carrie Coisman of Columbus, Ohio, a statewide organizer for #Fight4HER, a campaign against the global gag rule.\u00a0\"A Biden administration would be a welcome change.\"(Reporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, editing by Katy Migiro and Belinda Goldsmith.
