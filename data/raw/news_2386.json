The school will host this year's walk on Saturday, Jan. 18. \nCatholic News Agency\nDENVER | While hundreds of thousands of pro-life\r\nadvocates \u2014 including a 150-plus\r\ncontingent of high school students and young adults from the Archdiocese of\r\nMiami \u2014 will gather in Washington,\r\nD.C. for the National March for Life this Jan. 24, thousands will attend\r\nsimilar events in St. Augustine, and in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago\r\nand Denver.\nIn Florida, pilgrims can gather for the March for\r\nLife St. Augustine Jan. 17-18. Developed to uplift and create awareness for the\r\nsanctity of human life, the first March was celebrated in January 2007, to\r\ncoincide with the National March for Life, so that those advocates who cannot travel\r\nto Washington, D.C. can celebrate life closer to home. While it started with more\r\nthan 700 people of many different faiths, backgrounds and ages, recent marches\r\nhave drawn nearly 3,000 people, from across Florida and Georgia.\n  Photographer:  Students Lucy Weiss and Kayla Vergara, of Chaminade-Madonna College Prep in Hollywood, made their voices heard at the March for Life in Washington, D.C., Jan. 18, 2019. \nThe St. Augustine march, along with others across\r\nthe United States, will address serious subjects, but some events will also take\r\non a celebratory air, aiming to convey the joy of human life. \nIn St. Augustine, the two-day event will kick off at\r\nOur Lady of La Leche Church on San Marco Avenue for an evening of prayer,\r\npraise and worship and food trucks. The next morning, Jan. 18, will include an\r\noutdoor Mass at the historic site with Bishop Felipe Estevez, live music,\r\ninformation booths, and the procession through the streets of St. Augustine.\nAfterwards, pilgrims can listen to speakers, including Doug Tooke, vice president\r\nof ministry advancement for ODB Films in Los Angeles, and Ryan Neuhaus, Florida\r\nregional coordinator for Student for Life of America. Tooke also serves as an adjunct\r\nstaff member with Life Teen International, and Neuhaus spoke at the Florida\r\nRespect Life Conference this past October.\nA spaghetti dinner prepared by the Knights of\r\nColumbus will conclude the event, allowing for fellowship among the thousands\r\nof participants.\n\u00a0\nLOS\r\nANGELES\nIn Los Angeles, OneLifeLA\u2019s Sixth Annual Walk for\r\nLife will take place Jan. 18, beginning with a young adult rally, and\r\nculminating in a festival, and even an official after-party.\nParticipants will walk from the rally site through\r\ncity streets to Los Angeles State Historical Park, the venue for a pro-life\r\nfestival and food trucks. The event will have a children\u2019s area with face\r\npainting, balloon art and space for frisbee games.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels will host a\r\nrequiem Mass for the unborn, before events conclude with a young adult\r\nafter-party at the Imperial Western Terminal at Union Station.\nLast year\u2019s OneLifeLA event drew 30,000 people,\r\nAngelus News reports.\n  Photographer:  Father Michael Garcia, archdiocesan chaplain for the high school contingent to the 2019 March for Life, bottom right, poses with a group of students from Our Lady of Lourdes Academy and St. Brendan High School in Miami, along with Lourdes chaperones Martica Castellanos, center, and Maria Romero, second from right, as well as St. Brendan chaperone Rosa Mari Alvarez, far right. \nThe rally\u2019s keynote speaker is sex trafficking\r\nsurvivor and criminal justice reform advocate Cyntoia Brown-Long. The event\r\nwill also feature musical guests, including the group Love and the Outcome and\r\nsinger-songwriter Francis Cabildo.\nKathleen Buckley Domingo, senior director of the\r\nOffice of Life, Justice and Peace for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, reflected\r\non this year\u2019s theme: \u201cOne Mission, One Family.\u201d\n\u201cThe goal is always to get people to recognize our\r\nmission and do it all year-round, a groundswell of action in the community that\r\nloves, cherishes, and respects every single person, and doing it as part of one\r\nextended family. We want this to feel as if it\u2019s our own family reunion, and a\r\ntime to tell our family stories.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCHICAGO\nThe March for Life Chicago, held Jan. 11, bills\r\nitself as the largest pro-life event in the Midwest. Last year\u2019s event drew\r\nabout 8,000 attendees. The theme is \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman.\u201d\nKeynote speaker for the Chicago rally is Claire\r\nCulwell, who survived the abortion procedure that killed her twin sister, and\r\nwas born two months premature. She was adopted after birth and reconnected with\r\nher birth mother in 2009.\n  Photographer: COURTESY A selfie during the March for Life 2016 from the young adult members of Ablaze at Immaculate Conception Church in Hialeah. \nPolitical figures to speak at the event include\r\nU.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, one of the few remaining pro-life Democrats\r\nin Congress, who narrowly won a primary victory in 2018. U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood\r\n(R-Ill.) will also speak.\nCardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago is among the\r\nspeakers, as is Rev. Dr. Matthew Harrison, president of the Lutheran Church\r\nMissouri Synod.\nMorning and evening convention sessions at Congress\r\nPlaza Hotel will feature pro-life organizations from across the U.S. At the\r\nhotel there will be a morning youth rally, a Catholic Mass, as well as an\r\nevening banquet and a swing dance for young adult attendees.\nIn 2019, Illinois lawmakers passed legislation to\r\ndeclare abortion a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d It removed several abortion laws from\r\nthe state code, including a ban on partial-birth abortion, required waiting periods\r\nfor an abortion, and regulations on abortion clinics. Illinois\u2019 Catholic\r\nbishops criticized the goals of the bill and the manner of its passing, without\r\nhearings or the public release of the final text in the final days of the\r\nlegislative session.\nDawn Fitzpatrick, president of the March for Life\r\nChicago, placed the March for Life in that context.\n  Photographer:  In all the Dioceses of the United States of America, Jan. 22 (or Jan. 23, when Jan. 22 falls on a Sunday) is observed as a particular day of prayer for the full restoration of the legal guarantee of the right to life and of penance for violations to the dignity of the human person committed through acts of abortion. As individuals, we are called to observe this day through the penitential practices of prayer, fasting and/or almsgiving. The USCCB also sponsors an annual, nationwide novena called \u201c9 Days for Life,\u201d which surrounds the liturgical observance of the Day of Prayer. Each day for nine days, a different intention is featured, accompanied by a short reflection, suggested actions, and related information as we pray for the respect and protection of every human life. In 2020, the novena will take place Tuesday, Jan. 21 \u2013 Wednesday, Jan. 29. \n\u201cFurious that Illinois legislators have made this\r\nstate an abortion oasis for the Midwest, pro-life advocates from across the\r\ncountry are empowered to come together in a joyful gathering knowing we can\r\nbuild a brighter future,\u201d Fitzpatrick said Nov. 22. \u201cMore people than ever plan\r\nto turn out for the March for Life Chicago.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s pro-life events are significantly\r\nlarger in scope, she said.\n\u201cThis expansion gives participants the opportunity\r\nto connect with companies, organizations, and other individuals from across the\r\ncountry who share their values. Now, they will depart ready to take further\r\naction in their own communities,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, who is also senior\r\ncoordinator for Respect Life Ministries at the Chicago archdiocese.\n\u00a0\nCOLORADO\nIn Colorado, Catholic Charities of Denver\u2019s Respect\r\nLife office organized the Jan. 11 Celebrate Life Rally and March. The rally\r\nwill begin on the west steps of the state capitol in Denver followed by a march\r\naround Civic Center Park.\n  Photographer: COURTESY | Gloria Trueba St. Brendan High students, from left, Nicole Marti, Camila Pons and Catherine Martinez braved a blizzard to take part in the 2016 March for Life in Washington, D.C. \nThe event will begin with several morning Masses in\r\nthe area, including one at the nearby Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\nThe rally\u2019s keynote speaker is former Planned\r\nParenthood manager Ramona Trevino. Archbishop Samuel Aquila of Denver will also\r\nspeak at the rally.\nThe Denver event aims to emphasize a proposed 2020\r\nballot measure known as Initiative 120, which will ban late term abortions 22\r\nweeks into pregnancy, with exemptions for pregnancies that endanger a woman's\r\nlife.\n\u201cI urge all Catholics to get involved in this\r\neffort!\u201d Archbishop Aquila said Jan. 7. \u201cWe must not let up in our efforts to\r\nensure that the goodness of every human life is respected in our laws, our\r\nchurches and our families.\u201d\nBackers of the proposal must collect over 124,000\r\nsignatures by March 4 in order to qualify for the November 2020 election\r\nballot.\n\u00a0\nVIRGINIA, TEXAS\nIn Richmond, Virginia, the second annual Virginia\r\nMarch for Life is scheduled for Feb. 13 at the state capitol. The state event\r\nwas launched last year in response to abortion legislation in the state\r\nlegislature, including a bill that its own sponsor admitted could allow\r\nabortion up to birth.\nThe Texas Rally for Life, held in Austin Jan. 25,\r\nincludes a walk to the capitol at 1 p.m., a rally at the capitol at 2 p.m.,\r\nfollowed by a pro-life expo on the Great Walk of the Capitol Grounds.\r\nOrganizers estimated 10,000 people attended last year.\n\nMARCHES CLOSER TO HOME\nIn addition to taking part in the March for Life in\r\nWashington, D.C., Catholics in the Archdiocese of Miami have a tradition of \u201cwalking\r\nfor life\u201d around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. These walks also serve as\r\nfundraisers for the five Pregnancy Help Centers located in South Florida. If\r\nyou can\u2019t get to D.C. or St. Augustine, consider taking part in these \u201cwalks\r\nfor life\u201d:\n\nSaturday,\r\nJan. 18, 9 a.m., at Archbishop Edward McCarthy High School, 5451 S.
