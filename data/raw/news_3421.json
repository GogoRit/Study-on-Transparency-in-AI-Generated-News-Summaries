Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, and her fellow republican representatives from Missouri at an event at the Thrive St. Louis Express Women's Healthcare on Thursday, Dec. 16, 2021, in St. Louis, Mo. She has filed a bill proposing the ban on abortions modeled after an abortion measure the Republican-controlled Texas legislature passed earlier this year.(Neeta Satam for The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington PostSave this storySaveSave this storySaveAfter Texas passed S.B. 8, the law banning abortions after about six weeks, with no exceptions for rape and incest, its attorney general defended the move with the outrageous claim that forcing pregnant people to leave the state for medical procedures was stimulating interstate commerce. Not surprisingly, the response from groups and individuals who believe in reproductive rights and not treating women like property was a resounding \u201cWTF is wrong with you?\u201d In a statement, the ACLU shot back: \u201cAs thousands of pregnant Texans seeking essential, time-sensitive medical care are forced to flee the state in desperation, Texas is now claiming its blatantly unconstitutional abortion ban has \u2018stimulated\u2019 interstate travel. It is appalling that Texas is trying to capitalize on the catastrophe antiabortion politicians created.\u201d The whole thing was a depressing reflection of our current reality, wherein abortion rights are under daily assault from conservative elected officials\u2014a reality that one Missouri Republican is hoping to make even worse.On Tuesday, Missouri state representative Mary Elizabeth Coleman introduced a provision that would let private citizens sue anyone they suspect of helping a Missouri resident get an abortion in another state. If that vigilante legal system sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it was inspired by the one underpinning S.B. 8, wherein the Texas law is enforced not by the state but by random zealots who are now essentially deputized by the government to sue abortion providers and facilitators. \u201cIf your neighboring state doesn\u2019t have pro-life protections, it minimizes the ability to protect the unborn in your state,\u201d Coleman told The Washington Post. She said she\u2019s been trying to figure out how to punish pregnant people who cross state lines ever since Planned Parenthood opened a clinic on the Illinois-Missouri border, where 10,644 Missouri residents have obtained abortions since 2019. According to the Post, Coleman \u201cprayed\u201d outside the clinic on the day it opened, and has since talked to \u201canyone who would listen\u201d about how to decrease the number of Missouri residents getting abortions in other states. \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic,\u201d she told the Post of the number of people going to Illinois for the procedure. \u201cIt feels very sad and heavy.\u201d\\Coleman, who is running for State Senate, wants to end abortion not just in Missouri\u2014 where, as of 2021, there was just a single abortion clinic\u2014but throughout the entire country. She, like other antiabortion hardliners, likes to argue that letting pregnant people decide what to do with their own bodies actually hurts them, and that forcing them to give birth to and raise children against their own will will improve their lives. \u201cWomen deserve better than abortion,\u201d Coleman said at a crisis pregnancy center last year, not mentioning the fact that her state has the\u00a0seventh-highest maternal mortality rate\u00a0in the country, or that at times she has been able to afford not one but two nannies.According to the Post, the provision introduced by Coleman this week would \u201ctarget anyone even tangentially involved in an abortion performed on a Missouri resident, including the hotline staffers who make the appointments, the marketing representatives who advertise out-of-state clinics, and the Illinois and Kansas-based doctors who handle the procedure. Her amendment also would make it illegal to manufacture, transport, possess, or distribute abortion pills in Missouri.\u201dEven if Coleman\u2019s measure is defeated in the Supreme Court\u2014and, given who\u2019s on the Court, that\u2019s a big if\u2014it\u2019ll probably have a chilling impact anyway. Elizabeth Myers, an attorney for Texas abortion rights groups, said that as in the case of Texas, just the threat of the proposal may cause doctors in nearby states to stop performing abortions on Missouri residents.Speaking for the millions of people who are horrified by Coleman\u2019s proposal, Olivia Cappello, a Planned Parenthood press officer, said the measure is \u201cwild,\u201d \u201cbonkers,\u201d and \u201cthe most extraordinary provision we have ever seen.\u201d And legal experts say it is most certainly unconstitutional. But you know what else a lot of very smart people who are very well versed in the law say is unconstitutional?X contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click\u00a0here\u00a0to\u00a0subscribe.More Great Stories From Vanity Fair\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 \u200b\u200bImages of Russia\u2019s Attack on Ukraine\u2014Trump Calls Putin\u2019s Ukraine Moves \u201cGenius\u201d Because He Hates Democracy\u2014 The Zucker-Cuomo Saga Just Got Even Messier\u2014 Why Biden Wanted Americans to Know Exactly What Putin Was Planning\u2014 It\u2019s Been a Hell of a Week for Letitia James\u2014 \u201cIf Ukraine Matters, Tell Us Why\u201d: Joe Biden Is Talking to Everyone Except the American People\u2014 Republicans on Russia Crisis: It\u2019s Biden\u2019s Fault\u2014 Thieves in the Night: A Vast Burglary Ring From Chile Has Been Targeting Wealthy U.S. Households\u2014 Watergate\u2019s Central Mystery: Why Did Nixon\u2019s Team Order the Break-In in the First Place?\u2014 From the Archive: Russia\u2019s Dark Master\u2014 Not a subscriber?
