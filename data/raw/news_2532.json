(Jeffrey Bruno/Shutterstock)\n\n\nIn January 2020, an art exhibition called \u201cAbortion is Normal\u201d opened in New York City.\nThe art collection proclaims itself an \u201cEMERGENCY exhibition\u201d in response to the heavy abortion restrictions that 43 states passed last year, beginning with Alabama\u2019s near-total ban passed in May 2019.\nOne piece, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh\u2019s \u201cTo Be Without Choice,\u201d features two sketches of African American women staring solemnly at the viewer. Next to them is a polaroid photo of a woman holding a baby in her lap.\u00a0\nBelow the images are several lines of text from a 1989 brochure: \u201cSomebody\u2019s saying that we must have babies whether we choose to or not,\u201d the text reads. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what we say, doesn\u2019t matter how we feel. Meanwhile, those somebodies who claim they\u2019re \u2018pro-life\u2019 aren\u2019t moved to help the living.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion is Normal\u201d is not the only place voicing concerns about abortion restrictions. In a New York Times op-ed published on the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Ylonda Gault echoed the sentiment that limiting abortion means limiting women.\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s anniversary of the pivotal Supreme Court decision, Gault wrote, is \u201ca call for deliberate action to safeguard the most basic and ordinary right of all: to control your own body.\u201d\nArguments in favor of abortion range from denying the unborn child\u2019s identity (\u201cit\u2019s just a clump of cells\u201d) to justifying a necessary evil (\u201csafe, legal, rare.\u201d) Now, the mainstream argument preaches women\u2019s empowerment, which must entail giving them total control over their bodies \u2014 and whatever resides in it.\nTwo days after Gault\u2019s op-ed ran, the 47th March for Life filled the streets of downtown Washington, D.C. This year\u2019s theme offered a direct response to the popular pro-choice stance: \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Woman is Pro-Life.\u201d\nWhile the crowd waved several signs that read \u201cSave the baby humans\u201d and \u201cA person\u2019s a person, no matter how small,\u201d a host of women-focused messages permeated the streets: \u201cI am a pro-life feminist.\u201d \u201cPro-life, pro-health, pro-woman.\u201d\u00a0\nAt the front of the line, a group of young women, all students at Oakcrest School for girls, carried the March for Life banner to lead the way.\n\u201cBeing pro-life is supporting women at all stages, no matter what the circumstances,\u201d said Laura Cermak, an Oakcrest alum who attended the March.\nBoth the pro-choice and pro-life narratives profess to be adamantly \u201cpro-woman,\u201d but their vision for empowering women couldn\u2019t be more different. Where\u2019s the dividing line, and how did it get there?\nUnited we stand\nAs the March for Life crowd on Jan. 24 passed by the National Archives, which houses the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, a large banner stating \u201cRightfully Hers\u201d hung from the front of the building, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.\nAlthough the 19th Amendment passed in 1920, the suffragist movement had begun decades earlier, at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. This gathering focused on a range of women\u2019s rights, and its Declaration of Sentiments summarizes several issues that still motivate the feminist movement today.\nBesides the right to vote, the declaration included the assertion that men and women are equal, that women have a right to equal educational and professional opportunities, that men and women should be held to the same behavioral standards, and that women\u2019s role in society should not be confined to the \u201ccircumscribed limits\u201d of \u201ccorrupt customs.\u201d\nFor the next 60 years, women would fight to assert their equal place in society through the suffragist movement, led by ardent leaders like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\nBut among the rights that these women fought for, \u201creproductive rights\u201d was not one of them.\nAlthough modern-day abortion was a far-off phenomenon, abortion was not uncommon. Many original feminists saw the practice as a crime against women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention, wrote, \u201cWhen we consider that women are treated as property, it is degrading to women that we should treat our children as property to be disposed of as we see fit.\u201d\u00a0\nAlice Paul, who drafted the original Equal Rights Amendment, called abortion \u201cthe ultimate exploitation of women.\u201d And Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president, declared, \u201cEvery woman knows that if she were free, she would never bear an unwished-for child, nor think of murdering one before its birth.\u201d\nSo, what happened? Why is a nation so united in honoring the suffragists so divided on something they stood for?\nVictoria Claflin Woodhull, the first female candidate for president, addressing a congressional committee on women's suffrage in 1872. (Everett Historical/Shutterstock)\nIn her book \u201cWho Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women\u201d (Simon & Schuster, $19.99), philosopher and scholar Christina Hoff Sommers outlined the evolution of the feminist movement, and how its modern ideology has taken many steps back from the Seneca Falls Convention. Sommers herself is pro-choice, but her evaluation still identifies the radical changes in feminist values that have made abortion one of its token crusades.\u00a0\nAccording to Sommers, the shift partly had to do with women getting a little too zealous about their collective resentment toward society, building a groupthink that touts female power over universal human dignity.\u00a0\n\u201cThe aims of the Seneca Falls activists were clearly stated, finite, and practicable,\u201d wrote Sommers. \u201cThey would eventually be realized because they were grounded in principles \u2006\u2014 recognized constitutional principles \u2014 that were squarely in the tradition of equity, fairness, and individual liberty.\u201d\nOver time, however, some women drew motivation precisely from their anger against society, and particularly against patriarchy.\n\u201cMost of those [people today] who publicly bemoan the plight of women in America are moved by more dubious passions and interests,\u201d Sommers observed.\u00a0\n\u201cTheirs is a feminism of resentment that rationalizes and fosters a wholesale rancor in women that has little to do with moral indignation.\u201d\nThis \u201cwholesale rancor\u201d has fueled demands within the feminist movement that are not grounded in principles of equity, fairness, and individual liberty, but mainly with power. Gradually, many feminists held as their goal not so much to place women on equal footing with men, but to assert a position of control over what they saw as a misogynistic society.\nRenaissance feminism\nAs potent as modern feminism is today, it has not won over all feminists.\nIn 1972, a group of women decided to launch a \u201crenaissance to the original American feminism\u201d and founded Feminists for Life (FFL). Since then, the organization has provided support programs and educational resources for women experiencing crisis pregnancies, with the goal of \u201celiminating the root causes that drive women to abortion.\u201d\nAt the March for Life, FFL Board Secretary Sharon Serratore described how the organization upholds true feminism. \u201cThe feminist principles of justice, of nondiscrimination, of nonviolence, are completely contrary to abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen deserve better, [but they] too often feel that they don\u2019t have choices [and] have to resort to an abortion.\u201d\nThe numbers tell the same story: About half of the women who get an abortion live below the federal poverty line. Already desperate, an unexpected pregnancy could further aggravate their lives and intensify the idea that abortion is necessary.\u00a0\nBut like the suffragists, Feminists for Life believe that what really oppresses women is not abortion restrictions but abortion itself. A pro-abortion mindset, they argue, tells a woman that the only way for her to climb out of a crisis pregnancy is to reject her unborn child. In other words, there is no room for turning a crisis pregnancy into a normal pregnancy.\n\u201cTo support women means to support not just choice but choices,\u201d Serratore continued, \u201cso that women can keep their babies while they work, while they\u2019re in school.\u201d\nIn an effort to help women discover that range of choices, Women\u2019s Care Center, the largest national network of pregnancy support facilities, employs the same pro-woman, pro-life philosophy in its daily work.\n\u201cOur work is really woman-centered,\u201d vice president Jenny Hunsberger said. Founded in 1984, Women\u2019s Care Center\u2019s goal is to accompany each woman throughout her pregnancy, giving her the resources and support she needs to have and care for her child.\u00a0\nMembers of Feminists for Life, including FFL Board Secretary Sharon Serratore (right), stand on the steps of the National Archives in Washington, D.C., during the 2020 March for Life. (Courtesy Sophia Martinson)\nAdmittedly, many women face very difficult situations that make the prospect of having a child overwhelming, if not terrifying. One client, Hunsberger noted, had been in an accident that led her to get her arm amputated. Soon after, she got pregnant.\nIn response, the Women\u2019s Care Center team researched information about caring for a child with one arm. But even more importantly, said Hunsberger, the client\u2019s counselor affirmed her courage against all odds.\n\u201cOur counseling model is strengths-based,\u201d said Hunsberger. \u201cEach woman, no matter how challenging her situation is, is gifted with deep and abiding strengths. \u2026 Our work focuses on uncovering those incredible gifts and letting her see them.\u201d\nRather than sending the message that pregnant women \u201cmust have babies whether we choose to or not,\u201d Women\u2019s Care Center prioritizes empowering women to feel truly free and build a thriving future for themselves and their families. That approach has attracted nearly 30,000 women annually to its 32 sites. Last year, 16,246 babies were born to Women\u2019s Care Center clients.\nLiberty, justice for all (moms)\nThe day after the March for Life, Charlotte Pence, daughter of Vice President Mike Pence, gave a keynote address at the Pro-Life Summit in Washington, D.C. In it, she reminded her audience that women are stronger than abortion advocates make them out to be.\n\u201cThe pro-choice argument ultimately tells a woman that if she\u2019s met with an unforeseen circumstance, an unplanned pregnancy \u2026 she can\u2019t rise above those unforeseen circumstances,\u201d said Pence. \u201cShe can\u2019t have the best life that she wants if she chooses to keep this child. And that\u2019s a lie. And it\u2019s a message of defeat. Our message, the pro-life message of a post-Roe America, has to be one of victory.\u201d\nThe pro-life movement is often criticized for valuing the life of an unborn child over the life of a struggling woman. But as this growing movement stresses, being pro-life must be pro-woman.\nDespite the fact that abortion is still prevalent in our society, Hunsberger sees the tides turning.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is so much more to be hopeful about than there is to be discouraged about,\u201d she said. \u201cLife is winning.\u201d\n\n\n\nArticle Tags\nChildren, Feminism, March for Life, Motherhood, Pro-Life\n \n\n\n\n\nSophia Martinson\n                        Angelus News                    \n\n\n\nSophia Martinson\n                        Angelus News                    \n\nSophia Martinson is a wife, mom, and freelance culture writer for various publications.
