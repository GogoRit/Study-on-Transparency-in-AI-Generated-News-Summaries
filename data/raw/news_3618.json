Despite being a Wilberforce Fellow for Students for Life of America (SFLA) and attending a Christian college I was excited about, my pro-life work hasn\u2019t been as widely accepted as I thought it might be.\u00a0\nIn 2021, SFLA launched the Christian Schools Project. The project was an extensive research deep-dive into 784 Christian (Protestant and Catholic) colleges and universities in the U.S. to learn about their connections with the Planned Parenthood abortion behemoth.\u00a0\nWhile the Christian Schools Project found no ties with Planned Parenthood at Campbell, the university also does not promote nonviolent abortion alternatives (such as local pregnancy resource centers) on their website, and the culture of my classmates has been very aggressive and anti-life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nScreenshot from text messages sent to Taylor\nJust a few weeks into the fall semester, I ran for freshman Vice President for the Student Government Association and won. Through this, I quickly became known as not just the vice president, but primarily, the \u201cpro-life girl.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile I love having this title, I immediately realized the road ahead would not be as easy as I expected. Every time I would table for SFLA on campus, people would film me, follow me, and harass me. Being \u201cthe pro-life girl\u201d sometimes felt like a curse.\u00a0\nHowever, I knew I needed to fight for life even harder at Campbell. Fellow group members of my small but gritty SFLA group brought it to my attention that there were no available pregnancy resources on campus. I decided I was going to change that. As SGA Vice President, I began creating a pro-life pregnancy resource resolution. I expected everyone, even abortion supporters, to stand with this resolution that provided help for pregnant students.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nScreenshot from Snapchat sent to Taylor\nI was wrong. My resolution was vetoed, and I had to meet with higher up officials because I was apparently \u201cpushing my pro-life beliefs\u201d on others. I was told that I \u201ccan\u2019t pretend Christianity is pro-life.\u201d I felt defeated, and the messages I received from students on campus weren\u2019t inspiring.\u00a0\nAt the time, I was a Christian Leadership Fellow for SFLA, and everyone encouraged me to keep fighting. After Christmas break, I wrote up the same resolution and insisted upon it passing. By some miracle, it made it to our student Congress where the final vote would take place. However, I knew it would be nearly impossible to persuade them to pass it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe night before Congress, I was walking back to my dorm room alone when I was approached by a girl I didn\u2019t know. She asked if I was the pro-life girl, and I nervously told her I was. I was expecting to get harassed like normal, but instead, she told me that she was a pregnant student seeking an abortion but wanted to ask me for help. With my heart beating out of my chest, I gave her all the resources I could and told her I was there to support her. She thanked me and said she would reach out to SFLA\u2019s initiative Standing With You for help. As she left, I asked if I could share her story before Congress anonymously the next day. She agreed.\u00a0\n\nScreenshot from text messages sent to Taylor\nThe next evening, I presented my resolution before Congress, and I told them that if they vetoed it again, they would be neglecting pregnant students like the one I had just spoken to. Because of that story, not a single Congress member argued against my resolution, and it became the first pro-life pregnancy resource resolution ever passed at Campbell University.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the fight against abortion only got harder. I got more attention and received even more threats. On our college\u2019s anonymous social media app Yik Yak, people would post my location anytime I went somewhere. People would even slide death threats under my door. Anytime I tabled, I had to bring at least one other person with me for security. My expectations for my Christian college experience had been utterly demolished. But in the midst of it all, I saw victory. I founded my project, \u201cChange Minds For Life,\u201d and I persuaded 50 pro-abortion students on campus to become pro-life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nScreenshot from Instagram messages sent to Taylor\nAs I sit here now writing this, as the new President of Campbell Students for Life, I\u2019d like to tell you it got easier, and that through my work, Campbell is now anti-abortion. Unfortunately, that is far from the truth. I\u2019ve already faced even more hatred this semester and will likely face even more in the future. But I would like to encourage you to keep fighting for the preborn no matter what you face because despite everything I was up against, at least one child\u2019s life was saved because of it. \u00a0\nREAD NEXT: I Was Told to Get Raped at the Women\u2019s March; This is My Response\n\n Post Views: 5,001\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
