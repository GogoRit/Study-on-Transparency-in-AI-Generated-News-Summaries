But while Caring Families strives to give its clients a voice, the city of Hartford tried to silence the pregnancy center\u2014or at least drown out its voice\u2014by passing a law that required pregnancy care centers to speak misleading messages that undermine its mission.\nLet\u2019s take a more in-depth look at the details of this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pro-life pregnancy center in Connecticut saw its free speech rights threatened by the local government.\n\n\u00a0\nWhat is Caring Families Pregnancy Services?\nCaring Families Pregnancy Services is a private, faith-based, nonprofit organization that gives women and families the support they need to choose life for their babies.\nIt offers many important services, including free pregnancy testing, ultrasounds, options counseling, adoption referrals, parenting classes, Bible studies, and support groups. Caring Families also offers expectant and new mothers important material resources like baby clothes, diapers, cribs, and car seats. In order to reach more women in need, Caring Families even runs a mobile pregnancy center called MobileCare, which makes regularly scheduled visits to Hartford and other communities in Connecticut.\nThe mission of Caring Families is to bring hope to women who may feel like abortion is their only option and to empower those women to make life-affirming choices.\nCaring Families v. City of Hartford\nIn 2017, the city of Hartford passed Ordinance No. 25-17\u2014a law that forced pro-life pregnancy centers to post signs and begin conversations with a government-scripted disclaimer. The disclaimer incorrectly implied that the centers are not qualified to provide the free services they offer because there is not a licensed medical professional on site at all times. But many of the various free services Caring Families provides can be done safely, effectively, and lawfully without a medical professional present.\nIf Caring Families did not post this sign, it faced fines of up to $100 each day. Furthermore, the ordinance didn\u2019t apply to places providing abortion; it only applied to pro-life pregnancy centers. The city was openly hostile to pro-life views.\nHartford\u2019s ordinance resembled the California law the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in   National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra\u00a0in 2018. That law forced pro-life pregnancy centers to refer for abortions. Just like the California law, Hartford\u2019s law specifically targeted pro-life pregnancy centers and forced them to speak a message that hurts their own mission.\n\u201cHartford claims it\u2019s promoting comprehensive information about health care but only interferes with specific views about life, pregnancy, motherhood\u2014a double standard that\u2019s both troubling and unconstitutional,\u201d  said ADF Senior Counsel Denise Harle, director of the ADF Center for Life.\nHartford\u2019s ordinance threatened Caring Families\u2019 free-speech rights. So, with the help of Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys, Caring Families filed a lawsuit against the city of Hartford, challenging its unconstitutional law.\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\nEvery American has the right to speak freely. It\u2019s protected by the First Amendment.\nWe usually think about violations of free speech as censorship\u2014the government preventing someone from saying something. But it can be violated in the other direction, too: the government forcing someone to express something against their beliefs.\nThis is compelled speech. And the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in its 2018 decision in NIFLA v. Becerra, and numerous previous cases, that compelled speech of this sort is unconstitutional.\nCase timeline\n\nApril 2019: Caring Families  filed its lawsuit, challenging the City of Hartford\u2019s ordinance in federal court.\nMay 2019: ADF attorneys  filed a complaint\u00a0with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights to report discrimination against the pregnancy center.\nJuly 2020: City officials clarified what services are considered medical and conceded that the law does not apply to Caring Families because the center always has medical personnel on site when providing any medical services to women. Based on this understanding the parties  jointly dismissed the case.\n\nOutcome\nAs the settlement agreement in Caring Families v. City of Hartford states, \u201cThe City agrees that because Caring Families has licensed medical personnel on site at all times to provide and/or supervise such medical services, it does not consider Caring Families to be a \u2018pregnancy services center\u2019 under the Ordinance and will therefore not attempt to enforce the Ordinance\u2014as to either its required disclosures or its advertising requirements\u2014against Caring Families.\u201d\nThe settlement prompted ADF attorneys representing the center, Caring Families, and attorneys representing the city to jointly and voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit. \u201cHartford\u2019s law only made it harder for women to seek out all of their options and obtain support,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot. \u201cThe city was wise to abandon enforcement of a hostile regulation that singled them out.\u201d\n\u201cWe commend the city for changing course and deciding not to use the force of law to make this pro-life care provider imply through its own communications that it is anything but competent and tolerant,\u201d Harle added.\nThe bottom line\nPregnancy centers should be free to serve women and offer the support they need without fear of unjust government punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducators Have Rights, Too\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica's Largest Corporations Are Contributing to Our Censorship Problem\n\n\n\n          March 14, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious Discrimination in Broadcasting: It's 18 Times Worse Than You Think \n\n\n\n          March 11, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Middle School Silenced My Free Speech T-Shirts About 'Two Genders.'
