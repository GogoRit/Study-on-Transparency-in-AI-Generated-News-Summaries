However, a review of KNOP's website shows Standiford reported on the issue multiple times.The station's top broadcaster said she\u2019d been very fair covering abortion previously.\u201cThe lady that does the anti-abortion prayer chain in North Platte, Nebraska, said to me: \u2018I thought you were pro-choice,\u2019\u201d Standiford said. \"Everybody in North Platte thought I was pro-choice because I was so balanced and so careful to make sure that I never showed anything but that. I was very fair.\u201dCurtis, a town of around 800 people in southwest Nebraska\u2019s Frontier County, will vote to ban abortion this November. Standiford collected signatures for the ballot initiative at her church.She told the Flatwater Free Press that everyone in Curtis knew Standiford was a Christian and anti-abortion. In her mind, the Curtis ordinance would be so widely supported that it wouldn\u2019t be controversial.The Flatwater Free Press also asked Standiford about her involvement with the petition and how that impacts her coverage as a news director.\u201cYou\u2019re probably right, I probably, maybe shouldn\u2019t have even done that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut who knew it would be an issue?\u201dCurtis, also home to the Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture, is one of six towns where voters will determine the fates of local abortion bans, although some legal experts question the effort\u2019s impact on abortion access.The North Platte Bulletin reported and social media posts indicate there were some North Platte-area residents who objected to Standiford\u2019s firing and gathered outside the station\u2019s building on Monday.Shannon Booth, the KNOP vice president and general manager, said in a statement that Standiford has been fired and she wishes the best for her.\u201cKNOP can confirm that our long-standing company policy encourages civic involvement among our employees, so long as such activities do not give the appearance of interfering with journalistic impartiality,\u201d Booth said in a statement. \u201cIn furtherance of that qualification, KNOP\u2019s news personnel are not permitted, at any time and regardless of beliefs, to actively engage in any political activity for any candidate, party, or ballot initiative.\u201dPromoted to the news director role in 2021, Standiford had worked for KNOP for five years. Standiford said she\u2019s been contacted by lawyers and is deciding what to do next. In the meantime, she said she worried about the newsroom.\u201cI planned on anchoring the news and producing the news on Saturday and Sunday because I let one of my employees have the weekend off,\u201d she said.In her eyes, she was able to separate her personal beliefs and professional life. She also said she didn\u2019t force anyone else to sign the petition \u2013 she just merely presented the option.\u201cThis wasn't me saying vote this way,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wasn't me trying to influence anybody.\u201dEditor's note: A previous version of the story did not mention KNOP's website having multiple records of Standiford reporting on the anti-abortion initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\nGet the latest from around Nebraska delivered to your inbox\n\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Nebraska Public Media\nConnecting Nebraska through PBS, NPR and original content since 1954.
