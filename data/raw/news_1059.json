Wade was a significant victory, anti-abortion activists and some incoming members of the Idaho Legislature are now focusing on what restrictions could come next. (Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the day the U.S. Supreme Court released its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and return the regulation of abortion rights to the states, Idaho Family Policy Center President Blaine Conzatti told the Idaho Capital Sun that he was overjoyed, but that the work was not yet done.\nThe Idaho Family Policy Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has helped draft and pass several anti-abortion bills, and helped push for the passage of Idaho\u2019s trigger ban on nearly all abortions. The center also helped craft and pass a law modeled after legislation in Texas allowing individuals to sue medical professionals who provide an abortion.\nOther anti-abortion individuals and groups have also been thinking about their next battles in the weeks since the court issued its ruling. While the Supreme Court\u2019s action was a significant victory that activists have worked toward for years, Conzatti and some incoming members of the Idaho Legislature are now focusing on what\u2019s next.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the various Supreme Court cases come out and trying to figure out what opportunities we have in the state legislatively, and I\u2019m pretty excited about those opportunities,\u201d Conzatti said.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nFor him, those opportunities so far include banning emergency contraception and IUDs, removing the affirmative defenses for rape and incest from Idaho\u2019s abortion ban law, and placing limits on businesses or others who attempt to pay for a person to travel for an abortion.\nUnder the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, health care providers who determine a patient needs an abortion because of a medical emergency are protected regardless of state law. Those medical conditions could include ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy loss complications, or preeclampsia, according to previous States Newsroom reporting.\u00a0\nState bans on abortion don\u2019t apply to emergency health care, White House reminds providers\n\nRemoving the rape and incest exceptions is not an idea Conzatti sees as going very far with the Idaho Legislature, even as more conservative candidates will be seated in the state Senate by January. Many of the legislators are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has allowed for those exceptions in its doctrine regarding abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably going to be a long-term educational effort to convince LDS legislators that we never punish a child for the sins of the father, and no matter the circumstances of birth, every child deserves equal protection of the law,\u201d Conzatti said.\nOn the subject of contraception, Conzatti said there\u2019s no evidence that monthly birth control pills should be banned, but said emergency contraception and IUDs go a step too far because fertilization can still occur. The International Planned Parenthood Federation disagrees with the classification of IUDs as a device that causes abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cAnything that can end life after conception is problematic,\u201d he said.\nRestricting interstate travel for abortion could be unconstitutional, policy center director says\nAccording to the Washington Post, the National Association of Christian Lawmakers has started to work on model legislation that would restrict people from crossing state lines to get an abortion, but Conzatti said he isn\u2019t sure about that idea.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about it. There are interesting constitutional questions,\u201d he said.\nInstead, Conzatti wants to stop businesses and others from \u201cfurnishing\u201d an abortion, which he says he is modeling after other states that had similar laws on the books prior to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. Texas is one of those states, where it was a crime to perform or furnish the means for procuring an abortion prior to Roe.\nSeveral businesses in Idaho have stated intentions to pay for employees to travel for an abortion, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Citigroup Inc. and Chobani.\u00a0\nChobani, which employs more than 1,000 people in the Magic Valley, said it would cover expenses for employees who need to travel out of state or more than 100 miles for an abortion, cancer treatment, bariatric surgery and other special procedures, according to the Times-News.\n\u201cYou want to talk about crazy dystopia, like, \u2018Here, instead of us providing you with family leave and paying for your pregnancy and paying for all the accommodations that we\u2019re going to have to offer after you give birth, we\u2019re going to spend $5,000 and ship you out of state so that you can keep working for us,\u201d Conzatti said. \u201cIt\u2019s just bizarre stuff.\u201d\u00a0\nChobani provides six weeks of paid parental leave following the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child after six months of employment, along with medical, dental and vision coverage.\nAccording to the Idaho State Journal, Chobani President Kevin Burns said in an email to employees that he knows the issues are not without controversy or religious implications.\u00a0\n\u201cWe recognize that we have employees with strongly-held views on both sides of this issue and we respect the deeply-held beliefs on both sides,\u201d Burns wrote. \u201cFor Chobani, this is not a political stance or posturing \u2013 it\u2019s a reaffirmation of our core belief that we will strive to do what\u2019s best for the safety, health and well-being of our employees and their families.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\n\nWhat is the status of Idaho\u2019s trigger law?\n\nThe Idaho Legislature passed an abortion trigger law in 2020, making nearly all abortions a felony with prosecutorial defenses allowed only for rape, incest and to save the pregnant person\u2019s life. The law included a clause that would make it effective 30 days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued a judgment that returns the authority to regulate abortion procedures to the states. The U.S. Supreme Court took that action on June 24, overruling Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood case law.\nThe Idaho Supreme Court vacated its original plans for a hearing on Idaho\u2019s Texas-style abortion law allowing civil lawsuits against medical professionals who perform abortions, and will use the same date to hear specific arguments related to how that lawsuit and the case over the trigger law should proceed, according to two court orders.  \n\n\n\nHouse State Affairs chairman says next steps should be slow and deliberate\u00a0\nWhile new members of the Idaho Legislature next year will include Republicans in both chambers who are likely to support Conzatti\u2019s proposals, there may not be as much appetite for some of those changes from those in leadership positions.\u00a0\nRep. Brent Crane, R-Nampa, is chairman of the House State Affairs Committee and said he and Conzatti have not spoken about the bills Conzatti says he is drafting. Crane said he is committed to taking a measured approach to the issue and not messing with the trigger law too soon.\n\u201cWe have a very robust trigger law, and there is some time that\u2019s going to be needed to look at that and see if it\u2019s good as it stands or if there are deficiencies,\u201d Crane said. \u201cI have talked to a number of legislators who feel like that is a solid position and would love to let this trigger law go into effect and see what happens.\u201d\nCrane says he\u2019s been clear that he isn\u2019t interested in banning contraception such as IUDs, but said the Legislature probably will have a conversation about emergency contraception, including Plan B.\u00a0\nWhile Crane has been chairman of the House State Affairs Committee for the past two years, he may not be selected as chairman again in the 2023 session. That will be up to leadership to decide.\n  Rep. Brent Crane, R-Nampa, has been chairman of the House State Affairs Committee for two years. Abortion-related legislation would most likely be assigned to that committee. (Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)\nAs far as legislation restricting a person\u2019s ability to travel for an abortion, Crane said Americans have a fundamental right to travel freely. But he is working with Stanton Healthcare and other groups to discuss how to provide more support and care after the birth of a child, including providing formula, diapers and other resources. He\u2019s also working on legislation to help make the adoption process easier and more affordable. Conzatti expressed support for legislation on that subject as well.\u00a0\nBut most importantly, Crane wants to proceed deliberately around what he called an emotional and sensitive issue.\n\u201cThe advice I\u2019ve been giving to lawmakers is, I think we need to proceed slowly with prudence and caution and care as we move forward,\u201d Crane said. \u201cIdaho has already made a policy statement on where they believe the line should be drawn, let\u2019s put that in place and see if there\u2019s any deficiencies.\u201d\nSen. Patti Anne Lodge, R-Huston, will retire from the Legislature in December after more than 20 years, the last four of which she spent as chairwoman of the Senate State Affairs Committee. As chairwoman, Lodge drew criticism for holding some bills in committee, effectively killing them for the session. That has included several pieces of legislation Conzatti helped draft and push over the past two years.\u00a0\nA new chairperson of Senate State Affairs will be determined at the beginning of the 2023 legislative session.\u00a0\n\n Who\u2019s your legislator?\nFind your current legislators by typing in your address at this link. A new group of legislators will take office after the Nov. 8 general election for the 2023 legislative session.\n\nSeveral incoming senators have publicly voiced far-right views on abortion\nPerhaps more than any other, lawmakers in the next legislative session are likely to represent a broad spectrum of opinions, from left to the extreme right. While legislative seats won\u2019t be finalized until after the general election in November, some Republicans have no opponents in the general election and others that do have opponents are still likely to win.\nScott Herndon, the Republican nominee for Senate in North Idaho, has said publicly that Idaho\u2019s trigger bill should have treated abortion as homicide and has compared abortion to slavery, saying it is a human rights violation and a defilement of the image of God.\nHerndon said in a video on Facebook that in the next legislative session he will introduce a bill making changes to Idaho\u2019s trigger law. That will include taking out the exceptions for those who were victims of rape and incest. Under the existing law, those victims would have to prove they had filed a police report documenting the accusation, which can take weeks or months to obtain if it is an open investigation.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\nHerndon said in the video that those exceptions are \u201cabsolutely unjust\u201d and give mothers a \u201cfree pass.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t put to death the innocent child for the crime of its father, but that\u2019s what this law would allow,\u201d Herndon said. \u201c\u2026 If a mother really wants to kill her child, she could lie, say she was raped, file a police report and go get her child killed in the state of Idaho and nobody would be prosecuted.\u201d\nBen Toews, who won the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in the Coeur d\u2019Alene area and is unopposed in the general election, is also a board member of the Idaho Family Policy Center. In a candidate survey, Toews said he is passionate about ending abortion in Idaho from conception.\u00a0\n\u201cFor too long we have allowed the most vulnerable in our society to be killed in the name of women\u2019s rights or freedom of choice,\u201d Toews wrote.\nGlenneda Zuiderveld, the Republican nominee for a Senate seat in the Twin Falls area, posted on Facebook that the issue isn\u2019t over.\n\n \n\u201cThey can still (choose) the life of the mother over the baby,\u201d Zuiderveld wrote. \u201cWhich is very rare, I can\u2019t think of one woman who would (choose) her life over her child\u2019s. Most women would sacrifice their lives for their children.\u201d\u00a0\nDan Foreman, a Republican who served one term in the Idaho Senate from 2016 to 2018, will face Senate Democrat David Nelson, D-Moscow, and Constitution candidate James Hartley in November. Foreman has written that his top issue is for Idaho to abolish the \u201cunnecessary, harmful and wasteful curse of abortion,\u201d and said he would also introduce legislation eliminating the rape and incest exceptions.\nOther likely Idaho senators hold back on making more changes to abortion restrictions\nRep. Linda Wright Hartgen, R-Twin Falls, has a challenger in November from the Constitution Party named Paul Thompson, but said assuming she\u2019s in the Legislature next session, she doesn\u2019t see a need for removing the exceptions or going after contraception.\n\u201cThe majority of the people that I talk to actually wish we\u2019d just leave it alone. I think they like the exceptions for incest and rape, and obviously the health of the mother. Most of us have not walked in these people\u2019s shoes, so it\u2019s hard for us to know,\u201d Hartgen said. \u201cTo the bottom of my toes, I am pro-life, but there\u2019s just a few things there that I feel like the doctor and the mother and father need to give strong consideration to.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nWright Hartgen said she\u2019d like to see the Legislature focus on policy issues related to water and education. And she is of the mind that they should leave businesses alone and let them decide what they want to do for their employees.\nChris Trakel, who defeated Rep. Greg Chaney, R-Caldwell, for a Senate seat, will face Democratic challenger Toni Ferro and Constitution nominee Kurtis Berger. To Trakel, any type of abortion is murder, although there are justifiable defenses. He said he would be hard pressed to decide an abortion was acceptable because of rape or incest, but as a representative, he said he would listen to what his constituents wanted. The same is true for contraception, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to push my opinions through and what I think is right,\u201d Trakel said. \u201cI want as much input as I can from other people, and when I don\u2019t have that input, I go off my own principles and thoughts.\u201d\nMountain Home resident Geoff Schroeder beat six-term incumbent Rep. Terry Gestrin, R-Donnelly, for a seat in the Senate.

(Courtesy of Geoff Schroeder)\n\u201cMy grandfather was a doctor, and there\u2019s so many different situations, ranges of ages and medical history that are beyond the expertise of any legislator,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to weigh in, in advance of these things. It should be left to the doctor and the patient.\u201d\u00a0\nHe called the idea of the government regulating access to contraception absurd, and said he\u2019s not in favor of regulating business in this area either.\u00a0\n\u201cI am not in favor of the government interfering in contractual agreements between an employer and an employee,\u201d Schroeder said.\u00a0\nBoise Democrats vow to continue fighting future legislation\nWhile Republicans spar over upcoming abortion-related legislation, Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she is focused on knocking on doors and talking to people across the state. Regardless of party affiliation, Wintrow said she is hearing from many Idahoans that they don\u2019t like the direction of the state\u2019s political landscape.\u00a0\n\u201cI want folks out there, regardless of party, to vote for the person, not just the party,\u201d Wintrow said. \u201cI think there are a lot of people who feel that this is one bridge too far.\u201d\nTwo college students who are working as interns for Wintrow are knocking doors with her and encouraging people to vote, even if it\u2019s not for Wintrow.\u00a0\nBryn Harris, a Boise High School graduate who is attending the University of California San Francisco, said people are going to have their religious beliefs, but it\u2019s not their place to impose it on anyone else.\u00a0\n\u201cThis country was founded with the belief that there\u2019s separation of church and state,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEspecially regarding such a fundamental thing.\u201d\u00a0\nAlthough Democrats remain a small minority \u2014 with just 19 of 105 seats \u2014 in the Idaho Legislature, Wintrow said she will keep fighting for personal freedoms and separation of church and state.\u00a0\n\u201cIt behooves no one to incorporate one religion into government,\u201d Wintrow said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen where that\u2019s gotten us before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the Idaho Family Policy Center\u2019s role in the development of the trigger law banning nearly all abortions in Idaho.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWhat\u2019s next for Idaho\u2019s abortion policies?

Conzatti expressed support for legislation on that subject as well.\u00a0\nBut most importantly, Crane wants to proceed deliberately around what he called an emotional and sensitive issue.\n\u201cThe advice I\u2019ve been giving to lawmakers is, I think we need to proceed slowly with prudence and caution and care as we move forward,\u201d Crane said. \u201cIdaho has already made a policy statement on where they believe the line should be drawn, let\u2019s put that in place and see if there\u2019s any deficiencies.\u201d\nSen. Patti Anne Lodge, R-Huston, will retire from the Legislature in December after more than 20 years, the last four of which she spent as chairwoman of the Senate State Affairs Committee. As chairwoman, Lodge drew criticism for holding some bills in committee, effectively killing them for the session. That has included several pieces of legislation Conzatti helped draft and push over the past two years.\u00a0\nA new chairperson of Senate State Affairs will be determined at the beginning of the 2023 legislative session.\u00a0\n\n Who\u2019s your legislator?\nFind your current legislators by typing in your address at this link. A new group of legislators will take office after the Nov. 8 general election for the 2023 legislative session.\n\nSeveral incoming senators have publicly voiced far-right views on abortion\nPerhaps more than any other, lawmakers in the next legislative session are likely to represent a broad spectrum of opinions, from left to the extreme right. While legislative seats won\u2019t be finalized until after the general election in November, some Republicans have no opponents in the general election and others that do have opponents are still likely to win.\nScott Herndon, the Republican nominee for Senate in North Idaho, has said publicly that Idaho\u2019s trigger bill should have treated abortion as homicide and has compared abortion to slavery, saying it is a human rights violation and a defilement of the image of God.\nHerndon said in a video on Facebook that in the next legislative session he will introduce a bill making changes to Idaho\u2019s trigger law. That will include taking out the exceptions for those who were victims of rape and incest. Under the existing law, those victims would have to prove they had filed a police report documenting the accusation, which can take weeks or months to obtain if it is an open investigation.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\nHerndon said in the video that those exceptions are \u201cabsolutely unjust\u201d and give mothers a \u201cfree pass.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t put to death the innocent child for the crime of its father, but that\u2019s what this law would allow,\u201d Herndon said. \u201c\u2026 If a mother really wants to kill her child, she could lie, say she was raped, file a police report and go get her child killed in the state of Idaho and nobody would be prosecuted.\u201d\nBen Toews, who won the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in the Coeur d\u2019Alene area and is unopposed in the general election, is also a board member of the Idaho Family Policy Center. In a candidate survey, Toews said he is passionate about ending abortion in Idaho from conception.\u00a0\n\u201cFor too long we have allowed the most vulnerable in our society to be killed in the name of women\u2019s rights or freedom of choice,\u201d Toews wrote.\nGlenneda Zuiderveld, the Republican nominee for a Senate seat in the Twin Falls area, posted on Facebook that the issue isn\u2019t over.\n\n\n\u201cThey can still (choose) the life of the mother over the baby,\u201d Zuiderveld wrote. \u201cWhich is very rare, I can\u2019t think of one woman who would (choose) her life over her child\u2019s. Most women would sacrifice their lives for their children.\u201d\u00a0\nDan Foreman, a Republican who served one term in the Idaho Senate from 2016 to 2018, will face Senate Democrat David Nelson, D-Moscow, and Constitution candidate James Hartley in November. Foreman has written that his top issue is for Idaho to abolish the \u201cunnecessary, harmful and wasteful curse of abortion,\u201d and said he would also introduce legislation eliminating the rape and incest exceptions.\nOther likely Idaho senators hold back on making more changes to abortion restrictions\nRep. Linda Wright Hartgen, R-Twin Falls, has a challenger in November from the Constitution Party named Paul Thompson, but said assuming she\u2019s in the Legislature next session, she doesn\u2019t see a need for removing the exceptions or going after contraception.\n\u201cThe majority of the people that I talk to actually wish we\u2019d just leave it alone. I think they like the exceptions for incest and rape, and obviously the health of the mother. Most of us have not walked in these people\u2019s shoes, so it\u2019s hard for us to know,\u201d Hartgen said. \u201cTo the bottom of my toes, I am pro-life, but there\u2019s just a few things there that I feel like the doctor and the mother and father need to give strong consideration to.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nWright Hartgen said she\u2019d like to see the Legislature focus on policy issues related to water and education. And she is of the mind that they should leave businesses alone and let them decide what they want to do for their employees.\nChris Trakel, who defeated Rep. Greg Chaney, R-Caldwell, for a Senate seat, will face Democratic challenger Toni Ferro and Constitution nominee Kurtis Berger. To Trakel, any type of abortion is murder, although there are justifiable defenses. He said he would be hard pressed to decide an abortion was acceptable because of rape or incest, but as a representative, he said he would listen to what his constituents wanted. The same is true for contraception, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to push my opinions through and what I think is right,\u201d Trakel said. \u201cI want as much input as I can from other people, and when I don\u2019t have that input, I go off my own principles and thoughts.\u201d\nMountain Home resident Geoff Schroeder beat six-term incumbent Rep. Terry Gestrin, R-Donnelly, for a seat in the Senate. He is running unopposed in the general election, and is one of few Idaho Republicans who says he doesn\u2019t think the government should be in the position of making medical decisions for people.\n  Mountain Home resident Geoff Schroeder is running unopposed in the general election, and is one of few Idaho Republicans who says he doesn\u2019t think the government should be in the position of making medical decisions for people. (Courtesy of Geoff Schroeder)\n\u201cMy grandfather was a doctor, and there\u2019s so many different situations, ranges of ages and medical history that are beyond the expertise of any legislator,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to weigh in, in advance of these things. It should be left to the doctor and the patient.\u201d\u00a0\nHe called the idea of the government regulating access to contraception absurd, and said he\u2019s not in favor of regulating business in this area either.\u00a0\n\u201cI am not in favor of the government interfering in contractual agreements between an employer and an employee,\u201d Schroeder said.\u00a0\nBoise Democrats vow to continue fighting future legislation\nWhile Republicans spar over upcoming abortion-related legislation, Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she is focused on knocking on doors and talking to people across the state. Regardless of party affiliation, Wintrow said she is hearing from many Idahoans that they don\u2019t like the direction of the state\u2019s political landscape.\u00a0\n\u201cI want folks out there, regardless of party, to vote for the person, not just the party,\u201d Wintrow said. \u201cI think there are a lot of people who feel that this is one bridge too far.\u201d\nTwo college students who are working as interns for Wintrow are knocking doors with her and encouraging people to vote, even if it\u2019s not for Wintrow.\u00a0\nBryn Harris, a Boise High School graduate who is attending the University of California San Francisco, said people are going to have their religious beliefs, but it\u2019s not their place to impose it on anyone else.\u00a0\n\u201cThis country was founded with the belief that there\u2019s separation of church and state,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEspecially regarding such a fundamental thing.\u201d\u00a0\nAlthough Democrats remain a small minority \u2014 with just 19 of 105 seats \u2014 in the Idaho Legislature, Wintrow said she will keep fighting for personal freedoms and separation of church and state.\u00a0\n\u201cIt behooves no one to incorporate one religion into government,\u201d Wintrow said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen where that\u2019s gotten us before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\n            SUBSCRIBE\n        \n\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the Idaho Family Policy Center\u2019s role in the development of the trigger law banning nearly all abortions in Idaho.\n\nIdaho Capital Sun is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
