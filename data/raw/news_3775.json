It asks customers to list the medications they are taking and say whether they have certain medical conditions.It also has a section for the customer to state the reason for seeking emergency contraception, with one of the options being \u201csexual assault\u201d. Another section asks if the customer has burning or pain when urinating, pain during or after sex, unusual vaginal discharge or irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting.Pharmacists asking women sensitive questions about when they last had sex or if they were coerced could stigmatise and shame them, said Dr Deborah Bateson, the medical director of Family Planning New South Wales.\u201cPharmacies don\u2019t always have private areas,\u201d Bateson said. She said such stigma was a particular issue for women in rural areas and small communities, and worried it could deter them from seeking the medical care needed to prevent an unintended pregnancy.A PSA spokesperson said that the organisation does \u201cnot recommend the use of a checklist\u201d, and that the 2013 document is out of date.However, it appears some stores have been slow to catch up.The Medical Republic called 15 stores from four major pharmacy chains across the country.A Chemist Warehouse in Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, which uses the 2013 document, told the Medical Republic that filling in a form was a legal requirement. Another in Melbourne\u2019s St Kilda said it was company policy, adding that they would also need to see a driver\u2019s licence.An employee of a Priceline in St Kilda told this reporter she would need to complete the form in order to obtain the medication but would not need to write her name on it.A TerryWhite Chemmart in the Brisbane CBD and another in Victoria\u2019s Surrey Hills said the form was mandatory, while another in the Adelaide CBD said that only a name and address were needed.Cincotta Discount Chemists in inner Sydney and Armidale, NSW both said there was a form that needed to be filled in, but when asked if it was compulsory said no. The first said it was \u201crecommended\u201d to make sure the medication was safe to take, while the other said it could be done over the phone.Only three stores equivocally said that there was no need to fill in a form, while staff in the remaining stores were either not able to say whether the form was necessary, or said the checklist could probably be communicated verbally with the pharmacist.Hussainy, a pharmacist and advocate for wider access to emergency contraception, said some questions on the checklist were clinically necessary to ensure women get the best care. For example, a woman with Crohn\u2019s disease should be offered a copper IUD instead of the emergency contraception pill.However, she believes that filling in a physical form could be a depersonalising experience for women. Instead, that same information could be obtained \u2013 just as it is with other medication \u2013 by speaking to the woman, she said.Hussainy said  the document may be used as a \u201csafety net\u201d, and a holdover from when it was first made available over-the-counter and there were fears of women suing due to continued pregnancies. She said the forms would typically be filed in a folder and kept on the pharmacy premises, being treated as confidential private data, and shredded after about a year.Pharmacists can be a valuable source of information on topics such as ongoing contraception, referrals for STI checks or sexual assault services, Bateson said. \u201cBut we want to ensure there are not just routine questions being asked of everyone, because they can be a barrier.\u201dThe use of such a form highlights the way reproductive health often has restrictions that other areas of medicine don\u2019t, Bateson said. She added that the emergency contraceptive pill was a \u201cvery safe\u201d medicine that was even dispensed in supermarkets and vending machines in some parts of the world.Associate Prof Marie Bismark, a Melbourne public health physician and legal academic, said that customers may have grounds to complain about being told it is mandatory to fill in the form.Pharmacists abused by customers who have 'turned into animals' over medicine limitsRead moreAustralian Privacy Principles stipulate that organisations should explain why they are collecting information and whether it is required by law. Health information can be collected when it is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d and when it is obtained by \u201clawful and fair means\u201d. This means that the organisation is collecting the information without deception and in a way that is not unreasonably intrusive, Bismark said.\u201cI think those words \u2018unreasonably intrusive\u2019 are interesting. Asking for details about why somebody requires emergency contraception could potentially be an unreasonably intrusive question, unless the organisation can show the clinical relevance of those questions,\u201d Bismark said.Ideally a form would clearly state whether questions were mandatory or not, and explain why the information was being requested.A customer could also complain to the regulator, the Pharmacy Board of Australia, if they believed a pharmacist was not adhering to professional standards.A TerryWhite Chemmart spokesperson said: \u201cWe encourage all of our pharmacists to follow professional practice standards and fully support the PSA guidelines.\u201dThe other pharmacies had not responded at the time of publication.\nThis story was published in conjunction with the Medical Republic\nExplore more on these topicsReproductive rightsHealthWomennewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisUkraineFootballNewslettersBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
