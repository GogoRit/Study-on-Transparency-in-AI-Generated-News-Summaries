(Oscar Wong | Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nReproductive choice advocates are sounding the alarm, predicting the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban is a first step toward something more restrictive, even as restrictive as Texas\u2019 six-week ban. Those in reproductive medicine see a much more immediate threat: a challenge recruiting maternal fetal medicine specialists to a state that can imprison them for up to seven years and fine them as much as $100,000 if they perform an abortion after 24 weeks, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the baby will not survive outside the womb.\nThere are just seven maternal fetal specialists practicing in New Hampshire now, two of them part time, and four are expected to retire in the next two years, according to Dr. Barry Smith, who recruited most of them during his many years as chair of Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s OB-GYN unit.\nLate-in-pregnancy abortions are a small part of their work, and they are done only in dire circumstances, not for a change of heart. Also at stake, Smith said, is the specialists\u2019 expertise, which OB-GYNs here and across New England rely on for complicated pregnancies and deliveries.\n\u201cI cannot believe anyone in their right mind would come under the gun that they put in this new law because the toughest part of their life is to make these timely decisions,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s going to destroy the system\u2019s ability to provide the best health care.\u201d\nDr. Oge Young, a retired OB-GYN who practiced in New Hampshire for many years, counted on that expertise. \u201cI look at that time when I chose to come to Concord,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was nice to know I could call a fetal medicine specialist and have good backup and refer couples to.\u201d\nYoung, who has urged lawmakers to repeal the ban, said he doesn\u2019t think they understand its true impact.\n\u201cThey need to clearly know what this law is not going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to prevent abortions of normal pregnancy after 24 weeks. We never had a law and never had to have a law to prevent that because nobody is doing that.\u201d\nIt looks unlikely the law\u2019s criminal penalties are going anywhere this legislative session.\u00a0\nBills seeking to repeal the law have been rewritten to instead scale back and clarify when an ultrasound must be done. And, an attempt to leave the law in place but remove the criminal penalties failed in the Senate this month in a party-line vote.\u00a0\nNew Hampshire is not alone in putting criminal or civil penalties in its abortion law. No state or national public health or abortion access group could provide a list of states that do, but some examples include California, Texas, and Alabama.\u00a0\nThat list, however, does not include New York and Massachusetts, which Gov. Chris Sununu and other supporters of the ban have pointed to as examples of \u201cliberal\u201d states that have adopted abortion bans similar to New Hampshire\u2019s. Both, however, have dropped their criminal penalties, as did New Mexico.\nDuring testimony this session, OB-GYNs and other maternal medicine practitioners have echoed Smith\u2019s concerns about recruitment challenges criminal penalties will create.\u00a0\nThe Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth graduates about 90 students a year, 10 percent to 15 percent of whom go into obstetrics and gynecology, Dr. Ilana Cass, chair of the OB-GYN medical department at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, told a Senate committee recently. That\u2019s a first step toward subspecialties like maternal fetal medicine and neonatology.\u00a0\nAbout half of those OB-GYN graduates seek residency at Dartmouth. That connection increases the chance they\u2019ll remain in New Hampshire \u2013 a bit. Between the higher salaries paid in Boston and the rural nature of the state, Smith and Cass said recruiting often takes more, such as a spouse transferring here for a job or a personal connection to the area.\u00a0\nThe abortion law\u2019s criminal penalties combined with its lack of most exemptions, especially for fatal fetal anomalies, will be a \u201cfairly significant\u201ddeterrent to that recruiting effort, Cass said. That\u2019s especially true, Smith said, because nearby alternatives like Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts don\u2019t have criminal penalties.\u00a0\nThe law \u201cimperils lives and access to excellent health care that New Hampshire women and families deserve,\u201d Cass said. \u201cThis will steadily erode high-quality health care in New Hampshire by deterring the brightest from coming to New Hampshire.\u201d\nCass cited the existing shortage of OB-GYNs in the state and the closure of nearly 10 labor and delivery units in hospitals across the state in as many years.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you then put some of those providers in jail or start to limit the way that they practice medicine, I fear we \u2026 will actually be able to have fewer and fewer OB-GYN doctors practicing in the state, thereby further limiting the access and compounding the problem,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat\u2019s even more a concern, Smith said, given the Executive Council\u2019s repeated votes last year to defund the state\u2019s three largest providers of reproductive health care for low-income, uninsured, and underinsured Granite Staters. Providers say later pregnancy complications occur more often for women who do not have access to reproductive health care early on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXOB-GYNs say abortion ban will keep much-needed maternal fetal specialists away\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin February 21, 2022\nOB-GYNs say abortion ban will keep much-needed maternal fetal specialists away\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin February 21, 2022\n Reproductive choice advocates are sounding the alarm, predicting the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban is a first step toward something more restrictive, even as restrictive as Texas\u2019 six-week ban.
