It does not authorise criminal charges against a woman for receiving an abortion.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3US Muslim advocates weigh in on abortion rights battlelist 2 of 3US Supreme Court allows Kentucky official to defend abortion lawlist 3 of 3Michigan governor sues to secure abortion rights, vacate old lawend of list\n\u201cWe want to choose life in Oklahoma. We do not want to allow abortions in the state of Oklahoma,\u201d Stitt said during a news conference.\nState Senator Nathan Dahm, a Republican now running for Congress who wrote the bill, called it the \u201cstrongest pro-life legislation in the country right now, which effectively eliminates abortion in Oklahoma\u201d.\nIf it is not blocked by a court, the near-total abortion ban will come into effect later in the year, widening the US area in which access to legal abortion services is curtailed.\nThe Oklahoma legislation prompted condemnation from women\u2019s rights advocates and other groups, including reproductive rights organisation Planned Parenthood, which condemned it as \u201ccruel and blatantly unconstitutional\u201d.\n\u201cIf the courts let this ban take effect in August, people across the state will be forced to continue pregnancies against their will. This fight isn\u2019t over,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said on Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nBREAKING: Oklahoma Governor Stitt just signed a total ban on abortion into law.\nIf the courts let this ban take effect in August, people across the state will be forced to continue pregnancies against their will.\nThis fight isn\u2019t over.\n\u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) April 12, 2022\n\nA battle over access to abortion is raging in the US, where the nation\u2019s highest court is expected to rule by June on a Mississippi case that could see the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision overturned.\nThat ruling set out a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, and should it be overturned, more than two dozen US states are poised to pass legislation banning abortion, according to an October report by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.\n\u201cMake no mistake: the actions today in Oklahoma are a part of disturbing national trend attacking women\u2019s rights,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\u201cAnd the Biden Administration will continue to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures.\u201d\nLast year, Texas passed legislation that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy \u2013 the point at which many women do not even know they are pregnant \u2013 and allows citizens to sue anyone who provides abortion services in violation of that restriction.\nRights advocates denounced the measure as especially harmful to Black and other women of mixed races, as well as low-income women. They also warned that it could lead to similar laws being passed in other Republican-led states.\nA push to curtail abortion rights in the US has spurred mass protests [File: Andrew Harnik/AP Photo]\nSince the Texas law, known as SB8, came into effect, women have had to travel to neighbouring states to get abortions, including Oklahoma.\nAccording to researchers at the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at The University of Texas at Austin (PDF),\u00a045 percent of Texans who travelled out of the state between September and December of last year received abortion services in Oklahoma.\n\u201cOklahoma has just four facilities that provide abortion, and the number of Texans seen each month at these clinics since SB 8 went into effect is more than twice the monthly average of all abortion patients seen in Oklahoma in 2020,\u201d they found.\nThis week, a woman in Texas, Lizelle Herrera, was arrested and charged with murder over a self-induced abortion in what reproductive rights advocates said was a \u201cterrifying preview\u201d of what abortion bans across the US could lead to.\nAfter widespread outcry, the local Texas district attorney said on Sunday that the charges against Herrera would be dropped. \u201cIn reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms. Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her,\u201d Gocha Allen Ramirez said in a statement.\n\nRight now, reproductive rights are under attack in states across our nation. The Oklahoma legislature advanced a shameful bill that would prohibit almost all abortions if put into effect. If signed, this bill will only prevent women from getting the health care they need.\n\u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) April 6, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, back in Oklahoma, separate legislation introduced in the state this year proposes banning almost all abortions and relying on private citizens to sue any person who \u201caids or abets\u201d abortions, similar to the six-week abortion ban in Texas.\nThat bill contains an emergency clause, which would allow it to take effect immediately once it is signed by the governor.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
