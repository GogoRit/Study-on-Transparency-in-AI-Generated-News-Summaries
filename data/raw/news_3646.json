It's indicative of what has happened around the\u00a0U.S.\n\n\nDan Horn\nHaley BeMiller\nUSA TODAY\n\n\nPublished\n\t\t2:05 am UTC Oct. 27, 2022\nUpdated\n\t\t8:43 pm UTC Jan. 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Janet Folger Porter moved back to Ohio in December 2010, she invited some of her closest friends to her new home in suburban Cleveland.\nHer guests sipped coffee, made small talk and shared a breakfast of bacon and eggs. Meanwhile, Porter set up a white board in front of the fireplace. On it, the hostess wrote two words: \u201cHeartbeat Bill.\u201d\nPorter\u2019s gathering was a business meeting. And Porter, as everyone in the room knew, was in the business of banning abortion.\n\u201cThis is how we can do it,\u201d she told her guests.\nPorter planned to get a law passed that would ban all abortions in Ohio after about six weeks gestation, when embryonic cardiac activity can be\u00a0detected. There would be no exceptions for rape or incest.\nIt represented a bold challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed a right to abortion. If Porter's law\u00a0passed, it also would be one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, an idea so radical that even Ohio Right to Life and the state\u2019s top Republicans would spend years opposing it.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFaith2Action president Janet Folger Porter speaks in the atrium of the Ohio Statehouse in 2011.\n\t\tTom Dodge/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nYet today, the bill is the law of the land in Ohio. Considering the similar bans enacted in 23 other states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe in a 6-3 decision this summer, Porter\u2019s vision is no longer extreme in the world of Republican politics \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s the norm.\nThe story of how a onetime bellwether\u00a0state like Ohio led a slow, determined push to steadily weaken and then nearly eliminate abortion rights is in many ways a case study for what has happened around the country. Long before the Supreme Court reversed Roe, anti-abortion activists\u00a0like Porter recognized that demographic shifts and gerrymandered statehouse districts would entrench Republican majorities and allow them to push abortion restrictions that polls show are unpopular with most Americans.\nThe consequences came just a month after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, when a 10-year-old rape victim had to leave Ohio for an abortion in Indiana because her pregnancy had gone beyond the six-week limit. Nevertheless, members of Ohio\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature have pressed forward with plans for a near-total abortion ban either this year or next.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\nShare this article on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Pepper, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party\nWe are often viewed as a bellwether. I think we have become a bellwether in how an out-of-control statehouse can basically destroy your state.\n\n\nQuote icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are often viewed as a bellwether,\u201d said David Pepper, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. \u201cI think we have become a bellwether in how an out-of-control statehouse can basically destroy your state.\u201d\nBut 12 years ago, as Porter scribbled ideas on the white board, Ohio was a swing state that had gone for Barack Obama and would send a mainstream Republican like Rob Portman and a progressive Democrat like Sherrod Brown to the U.S. Senate. Democrats controlled most statewide offices, including governor.\nThat Ohio didn\u2019t work for Porter, the founder of the right-wing Christian group Faith2Action. She was a longtime culture warrior who opposed gay marriage, promoted false claims questioning Obama\u2019s birthplace and compared abortion to the execution of children during the Holocaust.\nShe was tired of watching fellow Republicans settle for measures such as licensing restrictions for clinics and waiting periods for patients \u2013\u00a0moves that made it harder, but not impossible, to get abortions.\u00a0\n\nShe said in a recent interview that she\u2019s been guided by the words of Martin Luther: \u201cIf we are not fighting where the battle is hottest, we are traitors to the cause.\u201d\nShe told her houseguests it was time to take on Roe. To succeed, they\u2019d launch what amounted to a decadeslong insurgency, a movement to change Ohio politics from the top down.\nThey\u2019d have to start with their own Republican Party. Over time, the fight would become personal, as Porter and her allies adopted tactics that some said were\u00a0as divisive as they were effective.\n\u00a0\"I wanted them to see, these people are crazy. They're not gonna quit,\" Porter said. \u201cWe were not gonna give up until this bill became law.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmboldened GOP\u00a0allows fetuses to 'testify'\n\nAbout three months after the gathering at Porter\u2019s house, she sat in a packed hearing room at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus for a March 2011 hearing. The fetuses were ready to testify.\nTwo pregnant women would take turns on an ultrasound machine set up in the house chamber so lawmakers could see and hear inside their wombs. The hearing was among the first for the heartbeat bill, which a team of lawyers and activists Porter assembled had written in the weeks following the meeting at her home.\nThe bill would require people seeking abortions to undergo ultrasounds to detect cardiac activity. If it was there \u2013 and it usually was at about six weeks \u2013 a doctor who performed an abortion would face criminal charges and up to a year in prison.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnne Renouf helps string red heart balloons along the south side of the Ohio Statehouse in 2011 in support of the six-week abortion ban, known by supporters as the heartbeat bill.\n\t\tChris Russell/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nDemocrats, who unanimously opposed the bill, condemned the ultrasound hearing as a shameless stunt.\nBut there was nothing they could do about it. The Ohio House had flipped to a 59-40 Republican majority after two years of Democratic control. Energized by opposition to the Affordable Care Act and the Tea Party\u2019s anti-government agenda, many of the new Republican members had little in common with Ohio\u2019s moderate Republicans.\nThis new group of Republican lawmakers helped elect Bill Batchelder \u2013\u00a0a member of a conservative group of lawmakers known as the \"Caveman Caucus\" \u2013\u00a0as speaker of the House, and they were more likely than moderate Republicans to embrace\u00a0legislation\u00a0like Porter\u2019s heartbeat bill.\n\u201cAfter Obama, Republicans statewide felt ignored,\u201d said Clarence Mingo, an Ohio Republican and former Franklin County official who has pushed back against extremism in his party. \u201cThe result of that was a shift to hard-right conservative thinking.\u201d\u00a0\n\nStill, the newly remade Ohio GOP was not yet strong enough to impose its will at the statehouse. Some of Porter's fellow Republicans worried the courts would reject her\u00a0six-week ban as unconstitutional, potentially strengthening Roe instead of weakening it. And they feared moderate voters might object to such strict abortion limitations.\nPorter had little patience for Republicans who didn\u2019t share her zeal for the cause. \u201cThey\u2019re pro-life pretenders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey use babies to get elected instead of using elections to save babies.\u201d\nAs the House opened hearings on her bill, Porter and her team flooded the offices of Republican lawmakers with calls and emails. In the months to come, they\u2019d send them red balloons shaped like hearts, teddy bears that played a heartbeat recording, and more than 2,000 red roses with cards that said, \u201cBring this bill to a vote before the roses and babies die.\u201d\nBut she expected that the fetus testimony would have the greatest impact.\nWhen the hearing began, one of the pregnant women took a seat near a large video screen. She leaned back in the chair, a hospital gown covering her torso, as a nurse ran an ultrasound wand over her belly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\tA pregnant Erin Glockner, left, is given an ultrasound by Julie Aber of Ashland Care Center during a committee hearing at the Ohio Statehouse in 2011. Anti-abortion advocates presented live ultrasounds to lawmakers in support of a bill that would outlaw abortion when cardiac activity can be detected.\n\t\tFred Squillante/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nThe lights dimmed and a fuzzy, black and white image of a fetus appeared on the video screen. Someone aimed a laser pointer at the pulsing tissue in the center of the picture.\nThe hearing room was silent \u2013\u00a0except for a rapid\u00a0dub-dub-dub\u00a0that matched the rhythmic movement on the screen.\nEveryone was watching and listening. Porter had a master\u2019s degree in communications and had done plenty of public relations work in her career, including for Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, John Kasich. But she\u2019d rarely seen anything grab people\u2019s attention like this. Even a Democratic House member who opposed the bill said the presentation brought back fond memories of her own pregnancy.\nPorter was thrilled.\n\u201cWhat we saw today was the beating hearts of these babies,\u201d she told reporters after the hearing.\nTo save those babies, she said, lawmakers needed to pass her bill.\nShe felt certain it was just a matter of time.\n\n\n\n\nClinic\u00a0lawyer fears Ohio's turn to the right\n\nA week later, civil rights lawyer Al Gerhardstein walked into the same hearing room to deliver a different message.\nA Cincinnati resident who\u2019d spent much of his career defending abortion clinics, Gerhardstein knew Porter\u2019s six-week ban violated the constitutional standard set by Roe. He also knew that was the point.\nThis was Ohio, after all, the birthplace of Right to Life and a frequent testing ground for anti-abortion legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tCincinnati attorney Al Gerhardstein has spent much of his career fighting in court against Ohio abortion restrictions.\n\t\tAP\n\n\nFor years, Gerhardstein had watched activists like Porter chip away at Roe in Ohio\u2019s legislature and courtrooms, imposing rules like 24-hour waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds and limits on the use of pills to induce abortion.\nThis death-by-a-thousand-cuts approach was the brainchild of John and Barbara Willke, a Cincinnati couple who founded the nation\u2019s first Right to Life chapter in the late 1960s. The Willkes weren\u2019t firebrands like Porter. They were devout Catholic grandparents who lectured college students about abstinence, went on \"Donahue\" to talk about fetal development and came up with billboard slogans like \u201cAbortion stops a beating heart.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\tJohn and Barbara Willke, founders of Cincinnati Right to Life, in 2000.\n\t\tMichael Keating/The Enquirer\n\n\nBut the Willkes, who mentored Porter when she was a budding activist in college, also worked behind the scenes, writing anti-abortion laws and lobbying politicians to pass them. Their mission was to keep up a steady attack on Roe \u2013\u00a0one voter, one law, one court ruling at a time.\n\u201cIt was a brilliant strategy,\u201d Gerhardstein said.\nWhile he respected the Willkes\u2019 approach, Gerhardstein fought them at every turn, representing Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic operators. To him, the clinics were more than clients. They were on the front lines of a battle to protect a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her own health and body.\nBorn and raised Catholic, Gerhardstein appreciated the religious and moral objections to abortion, especially among Catholics who formed the vanguard of the early Right to Life movement.\nYet he also felt the government shouldn\u2019t impose those beliefs on millions of women who wanted for themselves something different.\nBefore his first case involving an abortion clinic in the 1980s, Gerhardstein called his mother, Carolyn, who had worked for years in Catholic hospitals as an obstetrics and gynecology nurse. He asked how she felt about him taking on the case.\nHe said she told him she was glad he was doing it. She\u2019d seen many patients, before Roe, who\u2019d been victims of botched abortions they\u2019d attempted on their own or with unqualified practitioners. By the time some got to the hospital, they were in terrible shape.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about some abstract right,\u201d Gerhardstein said of how his mother viewed the abortion debate. \u201cIt was about what she saw.\u201d\nActivists like Porter were aggressively going after that right. Even John and Barbara Willke, who died in 2015 and 2013, respectively, abandoned their incremental approach and supported Porter\u2019s push for a six-week ban years before Right to Life and others would follow suit.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRight to Life founder Jack Willke, left, with Faith2Action President  Janet Porter in the atrium of the Ohio Statehouse in 2011.\n\t\tTom Dodge/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nGerhardstein saw the rationale behind the shift. Ohio was moving to the right. Republicans now controlled not only the statehouse, but the redistricting process that would allow them to gerrymander districts and tighten their grip on power. The heartbeat bill, Gerhardstein believed, showed that Republicans planned to use that power to topple Roe at the Supreme Court.\n\u201cThis was the final plunge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a direct attempt to challenge the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade.\u201d\nGerhardstein began his testimony at the hearing in 2011 by warning lawmakers the bill they were considering was unconstitutional. But he also urged them to think about the consequences if the heartbeat bill ever became law and Roe one day fell.\nIt would strip away a woman\u2019s right to follow her doctor\u2019s advice, he said, or even to follow her conscience. It would replace her judgment with theirs.\n\u201cTrust women to make their decisions,\u201d Gerhardstein said.\n\n\n\n\nA moderate pushes back on 'no exceptions'\n\nWhen Stephanie Kunze came to Columbus as a freshman member of the Ohio House in 2013, the heartbeat bill was stuck. It had passed the House two years earlier, but that\u2019s as far as it got.\nRepublicans in the Ohio Senate refused to bring it to a vote, and Gov. Kasich said he\u2019d veto the bill if it ever reached his desk. They said the bill wouldn\u2019t survive a court challenge and would mire the state in costly litigation for years.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSen. Stephanie Kunze drops off campaign literature in suburban Columbus during her 2020 reelection bid.\n\t\tFred Squillante, Fred Squillante\n\n\nKunze, a Republican from suburban Columbus, who describes herself as \u201cpro-life with exceptions,\u201d had her own problems with Porter\u2019s bill \u2013 mainly the lack of exceptions for rape, incest or serious fetal abnormalities. It was, she said, \u201can impractical way to legislate something that\u2019s important to families and women.\u201d\nKunze, the mother of two daughters, was passionate about curbing infant mortality and advocating for survivors of sexual violence. But when she arrived at the statehouse, the heartbeat bill was getting most of the attention.\nPorter was lobbying hard for another vote in the House so she could try again to get the Senate and Kasich on board. She had enough votes to win, but not enough to override a Kasich veto.\n\nThat increased pressure on moderate Republicans like Kunze. Without getting them on board, Porter\u2019s bill couldn\u2019t get past the governor.\nMost of Kunze\u2019s Republican colleagues\u00a0in the House didn\u2019t share her concerns about the bill and were in no mood to compromise.\nAfter the 2012 elections, they didn\u2019t have to.\nWhile Kunze\u2019s House district was politically competitive, redistricting had placed many of her fellow Republicans\u00a0in safe districts, where primary elections were the only elections that mattered. In those districts, voters who represented the activist wing of the Republican party often rewarded politicians for stances that once seemed radical.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\nShare this article on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\nEmail this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\nKathleen Clyde, former Democrat member of the Ohio House of Representatives\nExtreme gerrymandering is so toxic. It gives legislative leaders this outsized view of their own place in our government and of their own power.\n\n\nQuote icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExtreme gerrymandering is so toxic,\u201d said Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat who served in the House from 2011 to 2018. \u201cIt gives legislative leaders this outsized view of their own place in our government and of their own power.\u201d\nBut there was little Democrats could do. Republicans controlled the redistricting process, and now those same Republicans were dealing with a new political dynamic: Ohio\u2019s most consequential legislative battles no longer were being fought by Democrats and Republicans, but by conservative Republicans and more-conservative Republicans.\nThose fights intensified as Republican lawmakers debated Kasich\u2019s 2013 budget, clashing on issues from Medicaid expansion to a new oil tax. They then packed several new abortion restrictions into the budget late in the process, with no time for public input.\nOne measure required abortion providers to perform ultrasounds and predict the fetus\u2019 likelihood of surviving to full term.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRuth Clevenger waves an American flag during a protest at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus in 2013. The rally was organized to draw attention to legislation that will affect Ohio laws dealing with women's health care.\n\t\tBrooke LaValley/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nAbortion rights activists erupted. They swarmed the statehouse, shouting, \u201cShame on you!\u201d as Republican lawmakers approved the abortion measures. They then bombarded Kasich\u2019s office with 17,000 letters urging him to veto them.\nThe governor let the new restrictions stand, giving abortion hard-liners almost everything they wanted. Kunze, who voted for the budget, called it one of the most \u201cpro-life\u201d budgets in state history.\nBut it didn\u2019t include the heartbeat bill.\nThat meant Porter and her allies soon would be back, trying again to flip moderate Republicans\u00a0to secure a veto-proof majority.\nPorter made a list. And Kunze\u2019s name was on it.\n\n\n\n\nTurning up the pressure: No more 'Mr. Nice Guy'\n\nThe way Porter saw it, Republicans were wasting an opportunity. By early 2015, they held lopsided majorities in both the Ohio House and Senate, and voters had overwhelmingly sent Kasich back to the governor\u2019s office for a second term. They could do what they wanted.\nYet Senate President Keith Faber wouldn\u2019t bring her heartbeat bill to a vote; Kasich still vowed not to sign it; and Ohio Right to Life still wouldn\u2019t get behind it.\nPorter was sick of it. These Republicans had been running for years on anti-abortion platforms. They were, in Porter\u2019s view, hypocrites and liars. No better than Democrats, who at least didn\u2019t pretend to be on her side.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tOhio Gov. John Kasich smiles while signing the new two-year state budget during a ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus in 2013.\n\t\tBrooke LaValley/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nShe and her top lieutenant, Lori Viars, decided to get tougher.\n\u201cPlaying Mr. Nice Guy wasn\u2019t helping,\u201d Viars said. \u201cWe had to make their lives miserable.\u201d\nRepublicans who didn\u2019t back the bill, like Kunze and Kasich, found themselves on online lists under the headline, \u201cMeet the Republicans responsible for abortion in Ohio.\u201d\nDirect mail campaigns featuring photos of rhinos accused them of being RINOs, or Republicans In Name Only. Television ads and emails lampooned them, and their voicemail boxes filled with messages from Porter\u2019s allies. Some faced primary challenges from candidates Porter endorsed.\nPorter had helped make strict abortion restrictions a fundamental principle of Ohio\u2019s Republican Party, and accusations of being insufficiently anti-abortion could be fatal in a GOP primary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n15 photos\nView the full gallery\n\nFull screen icon\n\n\n\n\nPhotos: Thousands attend anti-abortion rally and march in Columbus\nThousands to rally and march during the first Ohio March for Life Wednesday at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus\n\n\n\u201cEvery Republican lawmaker in the state can tell you who is their Right to Life group in their district,\u201d said Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue.\u00a0\nThe primary challenges may have been Porter\u2019s most effective weapon. Over several election cycles, she rounded up candidates to run at least a dozen times against members of the House and Senate in Republican primaries.\nWhen she couldn\u2019t find someone to run in the primary against Republican State Senator Larry Obhof in 2016, Porter did it herself.\nNeither she nor her endorsed candidates ever won, but that wasn\u2019t the only goal. The real purpose, Porter said, was to make abortion a campaign issue and to force Republicans to spend cash to defend seats they thought were safe because of redistricting.\n\u201cThey hate working to keep their job,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe made them pay for their inaction.\u201d\nShe also did her best to embarrass them. Her most creative attack was a 2014 TV ad that took aim at Kasich, Faber and Batchelder, who at the time was reluctant to bring the heartbeat bill up for another vote in the House.\n\n\n\n\n Supporters of the heartbeat bill ran this ad on local TV stations in 2014, attacking some of Ohio's top Republicans, including then-Gov.

The lawmaker said he\u2019d always be willing to put Porter\u2019s bill up for a vote.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want a cartoon made of me,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\n\n\n\nTactics create divide in\u00a0anti-abortion movement\n\nBy early 2016, Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis had been saying the same thing about the heartbeat bill for five years: It was a good idea, but the timing wasn\u2019t right.\nHe knew this made Porter and her allies unhappy, because\u00a0they told him so at every opportunity. He also knew his stance put him and Right to Life in an awkward spot, because arguing against a bill that would end most abortions wasn\u2019t the kind of thing anti-abortion activists usually did.\n\u201cI understand the passion to want to end abortion,\u201d Gonidakis said. \u201cI want to end it yesterday.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\tOhio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis, pictured in 2022 at the Ohio Statehouse, played a central role in reshaping abortion access in Ohio for more than a decade.\n\t\tFred Squillante/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the bill, he said. The Supreme Court in 2016 still had a slim majority that could be counted on to uphold Roe. Gonidakis feared a defeat at the Supreme Court would further affirm Roe, making it even harder to overcome.\nHe\u2019d seen it happen before, in 1992, with Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Activists hoped it would end Roe. Instead, the court upheld the right to abortion and ruled states could not create an \u201cundue burden\u201d preventing someone from obtaining an abortion.\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Gonidakis said, \u201cnine men and women get to make the decision on this.\u201d\nAfter five years of debate, Gonidakis and Porter had come to represent a growing divide within Ohio\u2019s anti-abortion movement, a divide created in part by the heartbeat bill.\u00a0\nPorter was the outsider who saw little\u00a0room for compromise, an insurgent who would rather storm the palace gates than petition for change. Gonidakis was the insider, the steady hand who wanted to move cautiously and change the system from within.\nAfter working as a lawyer, a campaign manager and a lobbyist, Gonidakis understood the system better than most. He\u2019d run the political campaigns of two Ohio Supreme Court justices and served as a top deputy to former Republican Attorney General Jim Petro.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tMount Auburn's Planned Parenthood will remain open through May.\n\t\tThe Enquirer/ Liz Dufour\n\n\nHe\u2019d also been appointed by Kasich to one of three seats on the state\u2019s medical board not held by a doctor, a position that gave him influence over the way Ohio\u2019s abortion restrictions were enforced.\nGonidakis said he and Porter were working toward the same goal, just in different ways.\nPorter \u201ccaused division in the movement,\u201d Gonidakis said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t believe in vilifying other pro-life people like she did. She made no friends in her approach.\u201d\nAs 2016 ended, though, Gonidakis and Porter found common ground in Donald Trump\u2019s surprising win over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, a win he secured by flipping Midwestern states like Ohio. Trump\u2019s victory was the biggest of any president in Ohio since George H.W. Bush\u2019s election in 1988.\u00a0\nNo matter which side they\u2019d been on in the fight over the heartbeat bill, anti-abortion activists celebrated. Trump immediately would nominate an anti-abortion justice for a seat Republicans had refused to let Obama fill. And if more nominees followed, the court soon could overturn Roe and clear the way for Ohio\u2019s six-week ban.\n\n\n\n\nTrump transforms courts: 'It is within our grasp'\n\nThere\u2019s a man goin\u2019 \u2018round, takin\u2019 names\nAnd he decides who to free and who to blame\nA band played \"The Man Comes Around\" \u2013\u00a0a Johnny Cash song about the fate of mankind on Judgment Day \u2013\u00a0at Cincinnati Right to Life\u2019s annual dinner in October 2018.\u00a0\nIt felt like a victory party. The emcee praised anti-abortion activists as patriots. A Catholic priest led a prayer thanking God for Donald Trump and his Supreme Court nominees.\nMeg DeBlase, then the director of Right to Life in Cincinnati, shared the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. Porter\u2019s six-week abortion ban had passed the Ohio House and Senate. In a few weeks, Kasich would likely be replaced by a new Republican governor, Mike DeWine, who had pledged to sign the bill into law as soon as it landed on his desk.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tOhio Gov.

Bickel/Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nOhio Right to Life was behind the bill now, too. Trump was making good on his promise to fill the court with conservative justices, improving the bill\u2019s prospects and giving activists hope that Roe could be overturned.\nDeBlase had been involved in the anti-abortion movement since she was a child. She went to the National March for Life in Washington with her parents and prayed often with protesters outside Cincinnati\u2019s Planned Parenthood clinic.\nShe sensed the movement had more momentum than ever. The number of abortion clinics in Ohio had fallen from 16 to 11 in just eight years, as Republican-backed abortion restrictions had made it increasingly difficult for clinics to operate.\nFor DeBlase and the others who attended the dinner in 2018, a total ban on abortions felt like a real possibility.\n\u201cJust think about it,\u201d DeBlase told the crowd when she took the stage. \u201cIt is within our grasp.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTightening rules burden clinics and patients\n\nDr. David Burkons needed a better way to treat his patients.\nHe was struggling in early 2021 to comply with the array of rules the state had imposed on his three abortion clinics in northern Ohio. Even though Porter\u2019s six-week ban was still tied up in court, the existing regulations often felt overwhelming.\nFew frustrated him more than the rules dictating how his patients could receive abortion-inducing pills.\nThe treatment was safe and effective early in pregnancy. But Ohio law required patients to visit clinics in person, undergo an ultrasound, sign consent forms, receive a booklet about adoption, wait another 24 hours and then return to the clinic to receive the pills.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tDr. David Burkons consults with medical assistant Abby Ruggles as she juggles calls into Northeast Ohio Women's Center in Cuyahoga Falls following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June.\n\t\tJulie Vennitti Botos\n\n\nThose rules were part of the incremental change strategy the Willkes adopted at Right to Life decades earlier. Such requirements buried clinics in bureaucracy and confused patients, so much so that, by 2019, a survey found that one in 10 women in Ohio thought abortion was illegal.\u00a0\nBurkons didn\u2019t consider the rules medically necessary. The real goal, he believed, was to make it as difficult as possible to get abortions.\nHe\u2019d been dealing with this sort of thing since graduating medical school in 1973, the same year of the Roe decision. Burkons performed abortions as part of his gynecology practice and later at his three clinics in northern Ohio.\nIn the years that followed, Ohio became one of the most prolific producers of anti-abortion legislation in the nation, with more than a dozen rules and restrictions covering patient care, insurance, licensing and other matters.\n\u201cThey kept passing rules that really had nothing to do with patient safety,\u201d Burkons said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in the political conversation with our curated newsletter.\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nHe considered rules governing abortion-inducing pills especially onerous. Some patients drove for hours to see him, leaving behind jobs and kids. If they missed the appointments, they risked getting so far into their pregnancies they\u2019d need surgical abortions.\nThen inspiration struck. Burkons bought lockboxes \u2013\u00a0like the ones real estate agents use to hold house keys \u2013 and put the pills inside them. He gave the boxes to his patients and told them to call the next day after the 24-hour waiting period had passed. He would then provide the code needed to open the boxes so they could take their pills without making another trip to the clinic.\nBut Burkons knew more obstacles would come. By the end of 2021, President Trump\u2019s three nominees to the Supreme Court had shifted the court\u2019s balance so far to the right that he feared Roe could fall.\nIf it did, Ohio\u2019s six-week ban on abortion almost certainly would go into effect. Lockboxes would no longer be enough.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Roe falls, a 10-year-old must leave Ohio\n\nA few days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, a 10-year-old girl from Ohio became a cautionary tale for life in a post-Roe America.\nShe\u2019d been impregnated by her rapist and sought an abortion. But at just over six weeks, she was beyond the limit imposed by Porter\u2019s heartbeat bill. She and her family traveled to Indiana for treatment.\nAbortion rights activists made her case a rallying cry, and President Joe Biden lamented the cruelty of Ohio\u2019s law, which went into effect now that Roe had been overturned. Republicans, meanwhile, questioned the girl\u2019s story and suggested that journalists made the whole thing up.\n\u201cAnother lie,\u201d tweeted Jim Jordan, a U.S. congressman from north-central Ohio.\n\u201cThere is not a damn scintilla of evidence,\u201d Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said.\n\nThe girl\u2019s tragic story was confirmed days later, when the man accused of raping her appeared in court.\nPorter maintained that her heartbeat bill had produced a desired outcome.\u00a0\n\"We punish rapists, not babies,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's no reason to execute an innocent child for the crime of her father.\"\nPorter noted that Ohio\u2019s six-week ban allows exceptions if the woman\u2019s life is in danger, but some have questioned how those exceptions would be approved and whether a 10-year-old could get one.\nLost in the uproar over this one girl\u2019s case was the fate of hundreds of others whose lives had been upended by the fall of Roe and the imposition of Ohio\u2019s six-week abortion ban.\nAfter years of worrying about the threat to Roe, abortion providers struggled to adapt to an America without it. \u201cIt\u2019s not theoretical anymore,\u201d said Catherine Romanos, a doctor at a Dayton clinic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\tClea Saed, 14, of Columbus, yells during an abortion rights protest at the Ohio Statehouse following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June.\n\t\tCourtney Hergesheimer-The Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nClinics had to cancel scheduled abortions with barely a day\u2019s notice. Women scrambled to find alternatives. Burkons said he had to cancel a scheduled abortion for a 15-year-old girl who\u2019d come with her mother to his clinic the previous week. She was 13 weeks pregnant. He never heard from her again.\nHe\u2019s also unsure what happened to many of the patents who\u2019d left his office with abortion-inducing pills in lockboxes the day before Ohio\u2019s ban went into effect. If they were more than six weeks pregnant, Burkons wasn\u2019t allowed to give them the codes to unlock their boxes the next day.\nSome begged for the numbers, he said, but he couldn\u2019t help. Ohio\u2019s new law wouldn\u2019t allow it.\nBurkons said\u00a0many of the lockboxes that were supposed to be mailed back to him never arrived.\n\u201cI have a feeling there were people who took hammers and chisels to the boxes,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\nNot done yet: Republicans consider\u00a0a total ban\n\nToday, almost four months after the fall of Roe, Ohio remains a bellwether in the nation\u2019s abortion wars.\nThe state\u2019s six-week abortion ban, still known to many as the heartbeat bill, is again tied up in court. A common pleas judge in Cincinnati halted enforcement in September, saying Ohio\u2019s constitution may protect health care decisions like abortion. Yost, the state attorney general, is appealing that decision.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tMari Schoen hugs a fellow supporter as they celebrate the overturning of Roe v. Wade outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbus in June.\n\t\tCourtney Hergesheimer/The Columbus Dispatch\n\n\nIn the days after Roe was overturned, Ohio Republicans began discussing the possibility of a total ban on abortions in Ohio. Critics of the Supreme Court's decision warned of harsher action to come and decried Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion, which seemed to raise\u00a0the\u00a0possibility that same-sex marriage and access to contraception could be banned under the same legal principle that toppled Roe.\nMore recently, with the midterm elections looming, Republican politicians on the ballot have largely stayed silent on abortion restrictions. Polls show most Americans \u2013 and most Ohioans \u2013 oppose restrictions like Ohio\u2019s six-week ban.\nNot all conservatives are hesitant to talk, though. Porter continues to speak about the need for tougher abortion laws, while also promoting conspiracy theories about a stolen 2020 election and that Trump remains the \u201creal and rightful\u201d president.\nAt the Christian Patriot Rally in Houston in September, Porter spoke in front of a video screen that displayed giant, side-by-side photos of President Biden and Adolf Hitler.\n\nFor Porter, though, the political fights always are in service of her primary mission.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that compares with the importance of that issue,\u201d she said of banning abortions.\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Porter threw a party in the same house where she and her guests conceived the heartbeat bill more than a decade earlier.\nA celebratory banner still hangs on the wall:\u00a0Roe is dead. Babies will live. Thank you, Jesus.\nBut the excitement that day wasn\u2019t just about the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. It was about what comes next.\nIn Ohio, anything seemed possible.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0story includes previous reporting by The Columbus Dispatch, The Cincinnati Enquirer, The Cleveland Plain Dealer and The Associated Press.\nDan Horn is a reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer and the USA TODAY Network.
