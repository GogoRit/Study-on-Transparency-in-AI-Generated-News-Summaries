Lauren Chapman/IPB News\r\n\tIndiana physicians are sounding the alarm on the impact they say the state\u2019s impending abortion ban will have not just on pregnant people, but the entire community.\n\r\n\tThe law is currently on hold, but largely expected to take effect in the near future. And it will ban more than 90 percent of the abortions traditionally performed in Indiana.\n\r\n\tDr. Katie McHugh, an OB-GYN, said the most obvious effect is on maternal and infant mortality \u2014 two areas where Indiana is already among the worst in the country.\n\r\n\tBut she said the impact is far broader.\n\r\n\t\u201cWhen people who are pregnant cannot function, cannot work, they are busy taking care of families that they did not have the control to expand when they were ready, the entire family structure suffers and all members of the community are impacted,\u201d McHugh said.\n\nREAD MORE: Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban was set to take effect Aug. 1.

Dr. Ric Henderson is a second-year medical resident. She said as she decides where to practice, the abortion ban has made her and other new doctors hesitant to stay in Indiana.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s the direct result of the state legislation introducing fear into our medical practices,\u201d Henderson said.\n\r\n\tA quarter of Indiana\u2019s counties are already maternity care deserts, meaning they have no hospitals or birthing care centers, according to the March of Dimes.\n\nBrandon is our Statehouse bureau chief.
