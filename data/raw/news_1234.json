(AP) \u2014 Tennessee will soon strictly regulate the\u00a0dispensing of abortion pills, including imposing harsh penalties on doctors who violate them, under legislation recently signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee.\nThe measure, which Lee signed on Thursday, will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. Once enacted, a medical clinician will be required to be physically present when abortion pills are administered to a patient even though federal regulations now allow mail delivery nationwide.\nREAD MORE: Tennessee governor signs transgender athlete ban in girls\u2019 sports\nThe issue has become even more important as the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision as suggested through a\u00a0recently leaked draft opinion. Notably, Tennessee is among the 13 states with a so-called trigger law that would make abortion illegal should Roe be overturned.\nTo date, 19 states have placed strict restrictions on accessing medication abortion. Under the Tennessee version, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills.\nThe drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians \u2014 which would include barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine.\nHowever, according to abortion law experts, it\u2019s an unsettled question whether states can restrict access to abortion pills in the wake of the FDA\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThe general rule is that federal law preempts conflicting state law,\u201d Laura Hermer, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, recently told The Associated Press.\nCONTEXT: What is Roe v. Wade?\nNo lawsuit has been filed challenging Tennessee\u2019s newly enacted restrictions.\nMeanwhile, the in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients\nUse of abortion pills has been rising in the U.S. since 2000 when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone \u2014 the main drug used in medication abortions. More than half of U.S. abortions are now done with pills, rather than surgery, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\nTwo drugs are required. The first, mifepristone, blocks a hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy. A second drug, misoprostol, taken one to two days later, empties the uterus. Both drugs are available as generics and are also used to treat other conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Tennessee Governor Bill Lee speaks on protecting Americas seniors from the COVID-19 pandemic in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on April 30, 2020.
