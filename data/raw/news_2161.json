PBS News Hour, YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Irish American nun took to the podium during the Republican National Convention to proclaim Donald Trump \"he most pro-life president that this nation has ever had.\"\nSister Deirdre \"Dede\" Byrne, a member of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, addressed the Republic National Convention on August 26 and said that President Trump has \"defended life at all stages.\"\nSpeaking on Wednesday night, Sister Byrne said:\u00a0\"And while we tend to think of the marginalized as living beyond our borders, the truth is, the largest marginalized group in the world can be found here in the United States - they are the unborn.\"\n\nShe continued:\u00a0\"Donald Trump is the most pro-life president that this nation has ever had, defending life at all stages. His belief in the sanctity of life transcends politics.\n\"President Trump will stand up again Biden-Harris, who are the most anti-life presidential ticket ever, even supporting the horrors of late-term abortions and infanticide.\"\nThe Catholic nun said that the President had won the support of the pro-life community in America through his \"courage and conviction.\"\nYou can watch Sister Deirdre 'Dede' Byrne's remarks at the 2020 Republican National Convention here:\n\nRead more:\u00a0Zuckerberg admits Facebook banned pro-life ads in Irish abortion vote\nIn 2012, speaking during the Vice Presidential debate against Paul Ryan, Joe Biden said: \"My religion defines who I am. And I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And it has particularly informed my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.\n\n\"With regard to abortion, I accept my church's position that life begins at conception, that's the church's judgment, I accept it in my personal life.\n\"But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the congressman.\n\"I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that women can't control their body. It's a decision between them and their doctor, in my view. And the Supreme Court--I'm not going to interfere with that.\"\n\n\nEarlier this year, a Biden campaign spokesperson told Mic: \"Biden will repeal the Hyde Amendment and use executive action to on his first day in office withdraw the Mexico City 'global gag rule' and Donald Trump\u2019s Title X restrictions. And, he will build on the Obama-Biden administration work to fund and protect Planned Parenthood from baseless attacks.\"\nThe spokesperson added: \"As president, he will protect the progress we\u2019ve made, codify Roe vs. Wade, and guarantee that access to quality affordable care \u2014 including reproductive health care \u2014 is a right, not a privilege for everyone no matter their race or zip code.\"\n\nIn 1999, Trump, speaking on NBC News, said he was \"very pro-choice,\" but noted that he \"hates\" the concept of abortion. \"I am strongly for choice, and yet I hate the concept of abortion.\" Trump said that he would not ban abortion should he ever become president.\nHe has apparently reversed his pro-choice stance. Earlier this year, Trump became the\u00a0first sitting president to attend\u00a0the March for Life rally in Washington, DC.\nRead more:\u00a0Kimberly Guilfoyle's Irish cousins call her the \u201clunatic on the telly\u201d after RNC speech\n\nRelated: Catholic, Republicans, US Politics, Irish American\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\n\n \nIreland's most unique raffle, WIN a new McHale Fusion 4 Plus Baler or \u20ac75,000 cash\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWATCH: Taoiseach says in Washington, DC that Gaza ceasefire is \"well overdue\"\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGreat Irish Famine historians issue St. Patrick's Day statement on Gaza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland's most unique raffle, WIN a new McHale Fusion 4 Plus Baler or \u20ac75,000 cash\n \n\n\nWWII ship where five brave Sullivan brothers died discovered on St. Patrick's Day\n \n\n\nThe intersection of Saint Patrick and paganism in Ireland\n \n\n\nTUNE IN: St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade LIVE from Dublin today!\n \n\n\nUS leprechauns versus Irish fairies - a St. Patrick\u2019s Day death match\n \n\n\nNYC Saint Patrick's Day Parade announces line of march ahead of March 16\n \n\n\nSt Patrick's Festival is here!
