Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, speaks to members of the media in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 30, 2021.\nPhoto:  Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nAn adviser to Rep. Henry Cuellar, the conservative Texas Democrat whose home and campaign office was\u00a0raided by the FBI\u00a0this week, also leads a dark-money group that recently ran ads against Cuellar\u2019s primary challenger, Jessica Cisneros, according to Federal Election Commission and corporate records. Colin Strother, a longtime Cuellar aide and a consultant who has been embedded on Cuellar\u2019s campaign, is also the head of the secretive Voter Education Foundation. The staffing overlap reveals Cuellar\u2019s close proximity to one of Texas\u2019s most zealous anti-abortion activists.\nCuellar and his inner circle have aggressively pushed the limits of campaign laws. Election law stipulates a cooling-off period of 60 to 120 days, depending on the circumstances, before launching an independent spending effort on behalf of that campaign. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t meet the definition of independent as outlined in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Citizens United.\nStrother was Cuellar\u2019s campaign manager last cycle, though FEC records show he worked this year as an outside consultant. He was paid by the campaign in August 2021 \u2014 the most recent period for which records are available. Strother\u2019s Twitter account was also mysteriously\u00a0deactivated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism.

Her 2022 run marks her second attempt to oust the nine-term Cuellar, who is the largest Democratic recipient of private prison donations and was one of the most frequent Democratic supporters of Donald Trump\u2019s policies in the House.\u00a0(President Joe Biden won the district in 2020 with 52.8 percent of the vote.)\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrother has been director of the Voter Education Foundation since its founding in September 2020, according to public records. Strother has been on Cuellar\u2019s campaign payroll on and off since 2003. During that time, Strother became a well-known Democratic campaign strategist on Democratic campaigns across Texas, also working for Roland Gutierrez, a state senator.\nThough Strother was not working for Cuellar\u2019s office in Washington at the time, documents from a court case against Cuellar reveal Strother was involved in high-level staffing and policy discussions with the congressman. When Cuellar\u2019s acting chief of staff, Kristie Small, sued him in 2019 for allegedly firing her for being pregnant, Strother submitted testimony stating he vetted every senior staff hire since 2005 and found Small to be \u201clazy\u201d and a \u201cweak manager.\u201d After the Washington Post reported on an initial complaint she filed with a congressional office seeking counseling, Strother questioned staffers about their knowledge of Cuellar\u2019s supposed probationary rules for employees, and emails shared with the court also showed Strother was included in policy discussions with congressional aides.\nDespite Strother\u2019s consulting work for numerous Democratic politicians in Texas, a number of Republican political figures were also involved in the founding of the Voter Education Foundation he directs.\nRecords show abortion ban radical Bradley Pierce submitted the group\u2019s certificate of formation to the Texas secretary of state. Pierce is the executive director of Abolish Abortion Texas and the Foundation to Abolish Abortion, as well as the vice president and general counsel at Heritage Defense, a nonprofit law firm that advocates for \u201cthe God-given parental rights of Christian, homeschooling families.\u201d The Texas Observer in 2017 called Abolish Abortion Texas \u201cthe most extreme anti-abortion group at the Texas Lege\u201d and reported that the group helped advance the \u201cabolition of abortion\u201d to the Texas Republican Party platform at its state convention. The organization is also tied to\u00a0state Rep. Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington, who in 2019 introduced a bill that would force women who had abortions to face the possibility of the death penalty for homicide.\nCuellar is the most anti-choice Democrat in the House of Representatives, but his apparent links to such an extremist have not been previously known. He was the only House Democrat to vote against a historic bill to protect abortion access in September \u2014 just a few weeks after the most restrictive anti-abortion law in the country went into effect in Texas. Cuellar defended his vote by saying abortion is \u201cnot a health issue.\u201d He hasn\u2019t commented on the Texas law.\n\n\n\n \n\n        Related      \nTexas Admits Its Abortion Law Scheme Puts All Rights Up for Grabs\n\n\n\n\nCuellar has previously come under scrutiny for providing favors to border security lobbyists and pushing for funds for increased drone surveillance. His conservative record led corporate trade associations and Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC funded by billionaire Charles Koch, to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars boosting his campaign against Cisneros in 2020.\u00a0On Thursday, ABC News\u00a0reported\u00a0the FBI raid was related to a wide-ranging probe involving Azerbaijan business interests.\nIn addition to Bradley Pierce, the Voter Education Foundation\u2019s records referred to past San Antonio mayoral candidate Greg Brockhouse as a director at the time of its founding. When Brockhouse again unsuccessfully ran for San Antonio mayor last year, he sought to charm Trump voters on the campaign trail, such as when he skirted a reporter\u2019s question in December 2020 asking if Biden was the president-elect and instead highlighted the issue of voter fraud and Trump\u2019s right to challenge the results in court.\u00a0After publication, Brockhouse told The Intercept he was no longer an officer at VEF and had dropped his association in January 2021, before last year\u2019s run for mayor.\nPublic records reveal GOP political operative Thomas Marks and\u00a0San Antonio\u2019s\u00a0Mike Rodriguez are also serving as officers with the Voter Education Foundation. According to his LinkedIn account, Marks was chief of staff until this month for Bexar County Commissioner Trish DeBerry, a Republican who in December announced she was running for a county judge position \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t see enough Republican representation.\u201d He has also worked as a consultant for other GOP politicians, including former Speaker of the Texas House Joe Straus.\nStrother and Cuellar\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nUpdate: January 21, 2022\nThe piece previously stated that Greg Brockhouse\u2019s campaign for San Antonio mayor was troubled by reports showing his\u00a0wife and ex-wife\u00a0both\u00a0filed\u00a0separate domestic violence complaints against him years apart. After publication, Brockhouse told The Intercept he was the complainant in the first and that the second complaint was later retracted and, he said, expunged.\n\nCorrection: January 23, 2022\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated Mike Rodriguez, chief of staff for the Corpus Christi government, was an officer with the Voter Education Foundation. A different Mike Rodriguez was associated with the dark-money group.\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Sara Sirota          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      sara.sirota@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @SaraLSirota                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Texas Admits Its Abortion Law Scheme Puts All Rights Up for Grabs      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Jessica Cisneros, a Progressive Favorite, Loses to Incumbent Henry Cuellar      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Emails Show Rep.
