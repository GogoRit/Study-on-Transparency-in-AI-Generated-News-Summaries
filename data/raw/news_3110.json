Photos by T\u00e9a Smith.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been attending pro-choice rallies all her life, so she made a point to be at a State House protest on Thursday that drew 100 people.\nThe 69-year-old Columbia woman said she has held her views on the right to legal abortion since she was 15 when she worked as a candy striper hospital volunteer. Abortion was not legal at the time. On one of her shifts, a woman came into the hospital after attempting a self-induced abortion.\n\u201cShe had blood coming down her legs. Her dress had blood. And she literally bled out as soon as she walked in the ER,\u201d Pressley-Turner said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been pro-choice.\u201d\nThe rally, sponsored by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and the Women\u2019s Right and Empowerment Network, was held to protest two anti-abortion bills pushed by the S.C. Senate. The legislation was referred to the Medical Affairs Committee for discussion Thursday.\nOne bill, \u201cEqual Protection for Unborn Babies Act,\u201d would ban abortion completely unless the pregnant person\u2019s life is at immediate risk. This means that anyone who performed an abortion could be charged with murder and face the death penalty.\nThis would only happen if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortions.\nA second bill would legally require doctors to inform women about an abortion reversal pill if they request abortion medication.\n\u201cAbortion is not something to take lightly. It is a fundamental piece of healthcare that is integral to our ability to control our lives and control our futures,\u201d said Maya Ward, a development and communications associate for WREN. \u201cBut anti-abortion lawmakers don\u2019t seem to see it that way.\u201d\nThe rally drew people of all ages, some clutching handmade signs or sported pro-choice pins.\nBob Whitaker, 75, said it was his first time attending an abortion rally.\n\u201cI believe in a women\u2019s right to control their body,\u201d Whitaker, a Columbia resident, said. \u201cThat\u2019s a basic thing.\u201d\nFor others who had attended the event in past years, it evoked frustration because it felt like legislators weren\u2019t listening to their concerns.\n\u201cWe are having these hearings every year on the State House grounds, right here where a statue of J. Marion Sims still stands,\u201d said Kim Smith, co-founder of the Soda City Bail, an organization that bails out protesters. He was \u201ca man that did racist, horrific, medical, gynecological experiments on enslaved black women. I bring this up because this to me is a symbol \u2013 a symbol of how the ruling class of South Carolina seeks to remind us that they controlled my ancestors.\u201d\nWhile the future of the two bills is unknown, those in opposition hope that they will be overturned, keeping abortion legal and safe.\nThe legislation to reverse abortions remains controversial because of medical risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says science does not support the abortion reversal pill. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a group of about 4,500 physicians, supports the measure.\nSen. Mia McLeod, D-Richland, called out her Republican colleagues for promoting the legislation.\n\u201cBecause of their reckless disregard for women and girls across our state, you\u2019re witnessing the worst of South Carolina,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cBut tomorrow is a new day and hopefully a new opportunity to stop playing God and to try to be more godly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMartha Pressley-Turner has been pro-choice since she was 15 years old.\n\n\n\nAll abortions would be banned in South Carolina under one of the Senate measures if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRichland Sen. Mia McLeod said she would continue to fight until \u201cthe reproductive rights and freedoms of every South Carolina woman and girl are protected.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE JOURNALISTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarson Peaden\nCarson Peaden is a senior multimedia journalist with a passion for the arts.
