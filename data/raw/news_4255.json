Established by the United Nations, this date falls during Women\u2019s History Month, a month-long effort to amplify women's voices.International Women\u2019s Day asks us not only to consider broad issues of women\u2019s equality around the world, but to also reflect on our own lives and those of our mothers, sisters, daughters, spouses, cousins, and friends.International Women\u2019s Day is not about hypothetical women\u2019s equality; it\u2019s about real, tangible justice.\u00a0Jewish tradition teaches us that \u201cYou shall have one law for the stranger and the citizen alike: for I the Eternal am your God\u201d (Leviticus 24:22). Any disparity based on race, gender, or sexual orientation violates this concept. Only when we work together, hand in hand, can we ensure that women are paid fairly, treated justly, and have equal access to opportunities.Here are three ways to commemorate International Women\u2019s Day and fight for women\u2019s equality all year long:1. Learn about policy issues through a Reform Jewish lens.There are many important policy angles through which we can address women\u2019s equality, as outlined by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism (RAC). From\u00a0pay equity\u00a0and\u00a0reproductive rights\u00a0to\u00a0paid sick days\u00a0and preventing\u00a0gender-based violence, the Reform Movement prioritizes women\u2019s rights.Want to stay involved? Follow the RAC on social media and subscribe to their emails for updates on the issues that matter most to you and ways to take direct action.2. Advocate for reproductive freedom.Check out the RAC's reproductive health and rights page to learn about the Reform Movement's stance on reproductive healthcare. You can also find a current listing of proposed legislation on the page and use the RAC\u2019s easy, pre-written action alert template to contact your representatives. Writing to Congress is as easy as typing in your name and address!3. Support Women of Reform Judaism.Women of Reform Judaism (WRJ) has long been a powerful guiding force behind the Reform Jewish community\u2019s dedication to equality in Jewish life and in our secular lives.In \u201cFrom Suffrage to Hobby Lobby,\u201d former WRJ president, Rabbi Marla Feldman, writes, \u201cAs Jewish women deeply committed to the values of Judaism, we have played a critical role as agents of progress and change.\u201d To lend your support to the WRJ\u2019s vital work, you can become a member or donate now.The CCAR passed a resolution in 2023 which affirmed the rights of transgender and gender-expansive individuals, including trans women. \u00a0Want to learn more about racial equity, diversity, and inclusion?
