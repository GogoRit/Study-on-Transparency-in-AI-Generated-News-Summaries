The barriers include arbitrarily imposed gestational limits, lack of access to and\u00a0availability of abortion methods, fear of criminal prosecution, stigmatization,\u00a0and\u00a0mistreatment by health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\nA Case for Legal Abortion\n\n\nThe Human Cost of Barriers to  Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Argentina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the full report in English\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the Argentine Senate narrowly rejected the 2018 bill to legalize abortion, thousands of women and girls either had to overcome major barriers to access legal abortion or resort to clandestine, often unsafe, abortions that endanger their health and lives,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown have only exacerbated the limited access to reproductive health services, making legalizing abortion more urgent than ever.\u201d\nDuring\u00a0his\u00a0presidential campaign, President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0promised\u00a0to submit a bill to Congress to decriminalize abortion. Since taking office in December 2019, he has publicly supported decriminalizing abortion. One of\u00a0the first measures\u00a0by his health minister\u00a0was to update\u00a0and improve\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cNational\u00a0Protocol for Comprehensive Care of People Entitled to Legal Termination of Pregnancy,\u201d\u00a0which, if applied properly and consistently throughout the country, would contribute to improving access to comprehensive reproductive and sexual health services.\u00a0\nSubmitting the bill was delayed due\u00a0to the Covid-19 pandemic, but\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s top legal adviser\u00a0has\u00a0said that the government\u00a0hopes\u00a0to submit it this year.\nHuman Rights Watch visited\u00a0the provinces of\u00a0Salta, Chaco, Santa Fe, Entre R\u00edos, and Buenos Aires, as well as Buenos Aires City,\u00a0in\u00a0November and December\u00a02019,\u00a0and interviewed 30\u00a0people,\u00a0including\u00a0women and girls\u00a0who\u00a0sought\u00a0abortion care in the public and private health systems,\u00a0health workers,\u00a0lawyers,\u00a0and activists who support those seeking abortions.\u00a0Human Rights Watch also conducted follow-up interviews, requested information from the Argentine government,\u00a0and\u00a0analyzed\u00a0laws and policies, reports by United Nations agencies and\u00a0nongovernmental organizations, official health data and public health studies, and\u00a0medical journals\u00a0and\u00a0news outlets.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to expand Image\n\n\n\n\n\nCamila attends a rally in Buenos Aires, March 9, 2020 .\n\u201cWe will not be truly free as women until we recover the power to decide over our own bodies.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2020 Human Rights Watch\n\n\n\nA nearly century-old \u201cexceptions model\u201d\u00a0largely\u00a0bans abortion in Argentina. The only exceptions, under Section 86 of the 1921 criminal code, are when a pregnancy endangers the life or health of a woman or girl, or when it results from rape. In all other circumstances,\u00a0abortion is illegal and punishable with up to 15\u00a0years in prison. The sentence for\u00a0self-inducing\u00a0abortion or consenting\u00a0to\u00a0have an abortion\u00a0is up to four years.\nHuman Rights Watch documented\u00a0cases of women and girls whose situations fell within the\u00a0legal\u00a0\u201cexceptions\u201d\u00a0but who faced insurmountable barriers to access abortion and post-abortion care.\u00a0Obstacles\u00a0included\u00a0a lack of public information about the scope of legal grounds\u00a0for abortion;\u00a0health facilities imposing arbitrary hurdles\u00a0or waiting periods; health officials illegally requiring production of police reports or court orders\u00a0to proceed with the procedure under the rape exception;\u00a0and\u00a0lack of access to safe and legal methods or lack of nearby health facilities providing abortion\u00a0services. The invocation of conscientious objection by providers also created severe burdens or delays.\n\nWomen, health professionals, and feminist activists\u00a0said that stigmatization and\u00a0fear of legal consequences,\u00a0including criminal prosecution,\u00a0deter people from seeking \u2013\u00a0and health professionals from providing \u2013\u00a0abortions, even when\u00a0Section 86 of the criminal code exception\u00a0requirements are met.\u00a0Women and girls faced\u00a0abuse and mistreatment, including cruelty and humiliation by healthcare providers, denial of access to legal health services, and violation of medical confidentiality in health care settings.\nAccess to legal abortion and post-abortion care depends heavily on\u00a0a\u00a0person\u2019s\u00a0location and\u00a0socioeconomic background, Human Rights Watch found.\u00a0A\u00a0lack of clear and consistent regulations across the country\u00a0has\u00a0resulted\u00a0in a patchwork of practices that disproportionately harms\u00a0people\u00a0with limited resources or\u00a0little\u00a0access to information about their rights.\u00a0\nIn addition, the Covid-19 lockdown has made access to any reproductive health care more difficult. Furthermore, the need to visit multiple health centers and travel sometimes for hours to obtain access to services multiplies the risks of contagion.\u00a0\nCriminalizing abortion does not prevent people from ending unwanted pregnancies.\u00a0It\u00a0forces\u00a0them\u00a0to seek\u00a0abortions outside the\u00a0regulation\u00a0of the state,\u00a0and many\u00a0are performed\u00a0unsafely.\u00a0Many,\u00a0particularly those who live in poverty or in rural areas, resort to self-induced\u00a0abortions\u00a0or seek assistance from untrained providers.\u00a0\nUnsafe abortions\u00a0can lead to short- or long-term\u00a0health problems, and even death.\u00a0In 2018, Argentina\u2019s National Health Ministry reported 35 deaths from abortion,\u00a0constituting 13 percent of maternal deaths.\u00a0Many of these\u00a0deaths are preventable.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0the latest available statistics, for\u00a02016, 39,025 women and girls were admitted to public hospitals for health\u00a0complications arising from abortions or miscarriages. Sixteen percent were ages 10 to 19. That is most likely a fraction of the total amount of pregnant people facing health consequences from illegal abortions,\u00a0as stigmatization and\u00a0fear of criminal prosecution often keep women\u00a0who suffer\u00a0complications from seeking care.\nAuthoritative interpretations of treaties ratified by Argentina have long established that highly restrictive abortion laws violate the human rights of women and girls, including their rights to life,\u00a0to\u00a0health, and not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.\u00a0As long as Argentina criminalizes abortion, pregnant people will confront unjust difficulties in exercising their rights, particularly those who rely on the public health system, and\u00a0who live in provinces that lack or do not implement abortion regulations.\u00a0\nArgentina should decriminalize abortion in all circumstances and regulate it in a manner that fully respects the autonomy of those who are pregnant, Human Rights Watch said. Argentina should also ensure that pregnant people have access to legal abortion as currently regulated and that healthcare workers cannot invoke conscientious objection to refuse to perform abortions in public care services in a manner that imposes burdens or delays in accessing legal abortion services.For selected cases documented by Human Rights Watch, see below.Selected Cases\nVeronica R.\u00a0(pseudonym), 25,\u00a0was receiving\u00a0free\u00a0contraceptive injections at a health facility when, in February 2019, the providers\u00a0saw she had a\u00a0new address\u00a0and told her that, to continue getting free\u00a0services,\u00a0she would have to\u00a0visit\u00a0a health center closer to home.\u00a0She\u00a0went to a\u00a0health center nearer her home\u00a0and\u00a0requested a tubal ligation, she told Human Rights Watch. A\u00a0gynecologist\u00a0there\u00a0told her she was\u00a0\u201ctoo young and might want to have children in the future.\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0gynecologist, because of his personal beliefs, also refused to provide any form of contraception. Veronica had neither\u00a0the\u00a0time nor\u00a0the\u00a0resources to find an alternative source\u00a0of contraceptives,\u00a0and, in April 2019, she became pregnant. At six weeks\u00a0pregnant, Veronica sought a\u00a0legal\u00a0abortion, citing the health exception,\u00a0at a clinic in a small provincial city. Healthcare providers there refused,\u00a0offering\u00a0no\u00a0reason, so she went to another clinic, where a healthcare provider told her that she was too\u00a0far along in the pregnancy\u00a0to have an abortion there. Veronica became so desperate, she said,\u00a0that she considered getting hit by a car to end the pregnancy.\u00a0When she was\u00a020 weeks pregnant, a feminist organization referred her to a medical team\u00a0that\u00a0performed the abortion in a city a 4-hour drive from where she lived. \u00a0\nIn September 2019, Leticia H.\u00a0(pseudonym), 19, went to a public hospital in northern Argentina to end a pregnancy caused by rape. She was 17 weeks pregnant. The hospital denied the abortion, citing an informal rule\u00a0under which\u00a0the hospital provided\u00a0abortions only up to 16 weeks.\u00a0The rule\u00a0lacked\u00a0a legal basis. Leticia took medication to induce an abortion, a lawyer involved in the case told Human Rights Watch, but the abortion was incomplete;\u00a0tissue\u00a0remaining\u00a0in her uterus\u00a0placed\u00a0her at risk of infection. Recognizing\u00a0that\u00a0something was wrong and that she needed medical intervention, Leticia went to a hospital,\u00a0where\u00a0health personnel left her waiting for two hours before treating her.\u00a0Bleeding\u00a0profusely, she\u00a0lost consciousness several times in the emergency room corridor.\u00a0\u201cIf you liked having an abortion,\u201d a hospital employee told her, \u201cyou\u2019ll now\u00a0have to wait.\u201d\nIn November 2018,\u00a0Carmela Toledo,\u00a023,\u00a0found out that she was carrying a fetus with anencephaly, a condition that makes it difficult for the fetus to survive.\u00a0Carmela\u00a0was 25 weeks pregnant.\u00a0She\u00a0went to a public hospital in Buenos Aires province to request a legal abortion, but doctors told her that the\u00a0bill decriminalizing\u00a0abortion had not passed and added, falsely, that abortion was completely illegal.\u00a0They said she\u00a0had to wait until she was seven months pregnant,\u00a0so they could say she had had a premature birth. When she was seven months pregnant, health professionals tried unsuccessfully to induce birth. The doctor\u00a0involved\u00a0frightened Carmela by outlining\u00a0the\u00a0risks\u00a0of the procedure, including the possibility of difficulties in having a child later.\u00a0She\u00a0decided\u00a0to continue the pregnancy, and whenever\u00a0she felt the fetus move, she cried. She had a caesarean section at week 41 and\u00a0delivered a daughter\u00a0who\u00a0died eight days later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Argentina \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Case for Legal Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nDebate about Prisoners\u2019 Release in Argentina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Case for Legal Abortion\n\n\nThe Human Cost of Barriers to  Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Argentina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Case for Legal Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nDebate about Prisoners\u2019 Release in Argentina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
