On Tuesday, President Yoweri Museveni extended the initial 14-day lockdown for a further three weeks.\u201cI am really concerned [that] after [this] coronavirus situation we will have many, many women who will be pregnant. Actually we need to be careful. I want to call upon you women don\u2019t forget to use your contraceptives because we don\u2019t want [you] to have unwanted pregnancies,\u201d said Kazimba, who was enthroned as archbishop on 1 March.\u201cThese guys are there; they are eating and doing things [having sex]. Be careful because these men they don\u2019t care. You women [must] be careful.\u201dWomen in Uganda have an average of five children, but just 30% of women use a modern form of contraception.Simon Richard Mugenyi, advocacy and communications manager at Reproductive Health Uganda, welcomed the archbishop\u2019s comments.\u201cWe are happy with the church of Uganda stand on certain areas of reproductive health, including the use of contraceptives. For a long time, the church of Uganda has been progressive on these matters.\u201cOn his installation service, the archbishop spoke in support of sexuality education - one area that has received mixed reactions. And when he comes up and speaks about the reality - encouraging women who are sexually active not to forget their contraceptives \u2013 it show that the church is not living in denial,\u201d he said.\u201cWe applaud the archbishop for speaking out on an issue that is being left out in the Covid-19 messaging, yet is so crucial.\u201dAlain Sibenaler, the country representative for the UN population fund (UNFPA) in Uganda, said: \u201cThe call is a reflection of the daily realities and the \u2018new normal\u2019 [of] life in Uganda and elsewhere. Couples, women and men still have sex during outbreaks and crises, but forgetting that can be deadly.\u201dSibenaler added that the UNFPA had worked with the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda to tailor messages about sexual and reproductive health to suit respect different religious teachings.However, Asia Russell, executive director of the Health Global Access Project, said: \u201cArchbishop Kazimba attacked abortion and LGBT Ugandans during his first chance to address the country as archbishop \u2013 fuelling hate and stigmatising women for seeking essential health services such as abortion, [which] is extremely troubling. His latest comment doesn\u2019t change that.\u201dKazimba\u2019s comments have not been universally accepted by other members of the Christian community.Coronavirus in Africa: what happens next?Read more\u201cThat is his [Kazimba\u2019s] view. It\u2019s immoral to do that. The stand of the Catholic church is clear. No artificial use of contraception,\u201d said John Baptist Odama, archbishop of the Gulu archdiocese.\u201cWe don\u2019t support any form of modern family planning methods. They are not right. It\u2019s unacceptable. Let them [women] learn to follow their cycles. Let them use natural family planning and spacing of children, which will not interfere with their [birth] systems and will not cause harm.\u201dRussell added that before the outbreak, Ugandan women were facing \u201ctremendous barriers\u201d to access safe, quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services.\u201cThe government\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown policies are twisting the knife in, leading to new crises. There has been a massive and egregious failure by the government to protect pregnant women who need health care services,\u201d said Russell.Civil society is calling on the government to declare a blanket exemption on the travel ban for pregnant women, so they can seek proper obstetric care and prevent avoidable maternal deaths.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsWomen's rights and gender equalityCoronavirusUgandaAfricanewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
