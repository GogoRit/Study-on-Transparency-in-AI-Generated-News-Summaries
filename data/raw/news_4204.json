It called for equality in all spheres of life and \u2013 building on a landmark consensus reached the previous year \u2013 it affirmed that reproductive health and rights are central to achieving that goal.\n\u201cThe first mark of respect for women is support for their reproductive rights,\u201d said UNFPA\u2019s then-Executive Director, Nafis Sadik, at the 1995 conference in Beijing where the Platform for Action was created.\n\u201cReproductive rights involve more than the right to reproduce. They involve support for women in activities other than reproduction, in fact liberating women from a system of values which insists that reproduction is their only function,\u201d she said.\nThis year, UNFPA is taking stock of progress made since that critical moment in Beijing. And, with United Nations partners, civil society, governments and activists, we are ramping up efforts to reach the elusive goal of full and total gender equality, once and for all.\nProgress and backlash\nThe last quarter century has seen massive progress in women\u2019s rights and welfare. Governments and authorities now accept as bedrock fact that sexual and reproductive health and rights are an indispensable part of global development. Few people -- if any \u2013 would openly reject the full and equal humanity of women and girls.\n\nByllye Yvonne Avery urges women, \"Put yourself first.\" \u00a9 Marilyn Humphries\nYet the numbers show us how far we still have to go. Today, one in three women experiences physical or sexual violence in her lifetime. Twenty-one per cent of girls are married before age 18. An estimated 200 million women and girls alive have undergone female genital mutilation. Women are more likely than men to be poor and illiterate; they have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment; they are less likely to be politically active and far less likely to arise to positions of power.\nThese deprivations are too often expressed as a lack of reproductive autonomy and health: More than 200 million women around the world want to prevent pregnancy but are not using reliable contraception. Every year, nearly 300,000 women die of pregnancy-related causes; the vast majority of these deaths are preventable.\nMeanwhile, the opposition to progress is only growing louder.\n\u201cAround the world, there is a pushback on women\u2019s rights,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said last March. \u201cWe witness increased violence against women, especially human rights defenders and women running for political office. We see online harassment and abuse of women who speak out. In some countries, homicide rates are going down \u2013 but murders of women are going up. In others, we see a rollback of legal protection against domestic violence or even female genital mutilation.\u201d\nBut advocates of women\u2019s rights will not be intimidated.\nDr. Sadik\u2019s words from Beijing are as true today as they were 25 years ago: \u201cWe can go forward, but we must resolutely resist any attempts to go back.\u201d\nVoices of change\nThis year, as part of the Generation Equality campaign, UNFPA is celebrating earlier generations of women\u2019s activists, whose unflagging efforts and indomitable spirit enabled the progress we enjoy today. And we look to a new generation of activists, who are carrying forward the torch of equality.\nAna Pel\u00e1ez Narv\u00e1ez says women and girls with disabilities must be heard in every effort to advance gender equality. \u00a9 Juan Pagola ManterolaA century ago, Margaret Sanger founded the first \u201cbirth control\u201d clinic in the United States \u2013 which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She also played a pivotal role in convincing Gregory Pincus to work on the oral contraceptive pill. Her insights remain just as relevant now as they were a hundred years ago: \u201cNo woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body. No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother.\u201d\nAs an infant, Fawzia Koofi was abandoned to die under Afghanistan\u2019s burning sun \u2013 just because she was born a girl. Her parents had a change of heart in time, but she would experience the crushing weight of misogyny again when the Taliban regime took power. She eventually launched a campaign to send girls to school, and went on to become one of the first women elected to the newly established Afghan Parliament. \u201cI want my daughters to be respected as human beings; that\u2019s the country I\u2019m fighting for,\u201d she said.\nAs an international development official at the United Kingdom, Julia Bunting worked to reframe thinking around maternal mortality, transforming it from an intractable problem to a solvable one. She also galvanized the FP2020 global pledge to extend family planning to an additional 120 million women and girls. She said: \u201cAll women and girls have the right, and must have the means, to decide freely and for themselves if and when to have children. Evidence shows us that when you give women and young people this right, their life chances are transformed.\u201d\nDr. Nadine Gasman has spent decades fighting pervasive gender inequality and violence against women throughout Latin America. She wants the world to understand the full range of benefits that gender equality will yield: \u201cGender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are very good for women. But also very good for men.\u201d\nRenowned journalist Christiane Amanpour has spent decades training a spotlight on gender discrimination and gender-based violence, showing the world that women\u2019s news is not a marginal subject; it is real news. Her reporting showed that women and girls \u201cabsolutely wanted to have control over their bodies, over their own sexual satisfaction, over who were their partners, who they could choose or not choose....\u201d\n\"Women don't realize how strong they can be,\" said Enkhjargal Davaasuren. \u00a9 UNFPA MongoliaThree decades ago, Byllye Yvonne Avery founded the National Black Women\u2019s Health Project (now the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative), a movement to deal with mental and physical stressors affecting the health of black women. In 1984, the project identified violence as a key health issue\u2014long before others acknowledged its role. \u201cOur message to women: put yourself first,\u201d she said.\nA harrowing childbearing experience inspired prominent model Christy Turlington to direct the documentary No Woman No Cry, about maternal death and disability, and to launch the non-profit Every Mother Counts: \u201cIf we can\u2019t support a woman while she is giving life, then we don\u2019t support women.\u201d\nAcross Mongolia, domestic violence was once considered unspeakable. For Enkhjargal Davaasuren, this was unacceptable. She founded the National Centre Against Violence and started a campaign to criminalizing domestic violence. \u201cIn a male-dominated, patriarchal society, women don\u2019t realize how strong they can be. Be strong, but more importantly, be collectively strong.\u201d\nFor 20 years, Ana Pel\u00e1ez Narv\u00e1ez has advocated for women with disabilities. In 2018, backed by the global disability rights movement, she broke new ground by becoming the first woman with disabilities to be elected to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). \u201cI want to bring a disabilities perspective into the whole agenda of the CEDAW Committee, making women with disability visible in every single piece of work, not just a mention from time to time.\u201d\nAt just 16, Alejandra Teleguario Santizo began speaking out against sexual violence and acoso callejero \u2013 street harassment \u2013 in her community in Guatemala. She quickly became a recognizable leader and, with network of other empowered girls, she began campaigning against child marriage. \u201cPersistence is important, because we will be able to achieve what we want as women. And get involved. That\u2019s where change begins.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nFive reasons why: Women and girls must have equal rights in our digital world\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\n\nStatement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem on International Women\u2019\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
