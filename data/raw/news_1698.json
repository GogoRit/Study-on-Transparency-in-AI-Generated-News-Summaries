These bans violate the separation of church and state.\u00a0\nReproductive freedom and religious freedom are intertwined. When your most intimate, personal decisions are held hostage to intolerant religious beliefs you are not free.\u00a0\nThe American legal system has adopted a taboo against mentioning religion in legal cases involving abortion. Lawyers and judges go out of their way to avoid discussing religion and religious motivations for abortion restrictions, and treat abortion bans as if they are religiously neutral. Only rarely is someone willing to shatter this polite fiction\u2014to cry out that the emperor has no clothes. If they did, it would quickly become obvious that these bans give the force of law to one narrow religious doctrine.\u00a0\nThe American legal system has adopted a taboo against mentioning religion in legal cases involving abortion.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor broke the spell during oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. \u201cHow is your interest anything but a religious view?\u201d Sotomayor asked the lawyer for the state of Mississippi, \u201c\u2026 when you say [abortion] is the only right that takes away from the state the ability to protect a life, that's a religious view, isn't it?\u201d Mississippi had no answer.\u00a0\nOther states\u2019 abortion bans likewise impose a narrow religious doctrine on every citizen. For instance, Missouri\u2019s abortion ban openly declares \u201cthat Almighty God is the author of life\u201d (a phrase that one lawmaker who opposed the ban correctly noted was \u201citself \u2026 in violation of the separation of church and state.\u201d) Missouri legislators weren\u2019t shy about this when passing the state\u2019s sweeping abortion ban. One legislator supported the ban saying, \u201cGod doesn\u2019t give us a choice in this area. He is the Creator of life,\u201d and because, \u201cLife begins at conception. Psalms 119 says \u2018Your hands made me, and formed me.\u2019\u201d Another legislator justified the ban because, \u201cbeing from the biblical side of it, I\u2019ve always believed that life does occur at the point of conception.\u201d They have literally enshrined their holy books, their religious beliefs, and their religion into the law, with one lawmaker asserting, \u201cas a Catholic I do believe life begins at conception. That is built into our legislative findings currently in law\u2026\u201d\nAs a Jefferson City Baptist minister observed during these debates, Missouri\u2019s abortion ban is \u201cChristian Nationalism.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, leading experts in religious freedom and gender justice, are challenging Missouri\u2019s draconian abortion ban on behalf of thirteen clergy from six different denominations. Our plaintiffs include an Episcopal bishop, an orthodox Jewish maharat, a United Methodist pastor and state legislator, as well as Reform rabbis and United Church of Christ and Unitarian Universalist ministers, to name a few. Fittingly, we filed this suit just days after National Religious Freedom Day and just before the fiftieth anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\nBut our lawsuit isn\u2019t looking to nullify the ban only for those whose religion mandates otherwise. Instead, we\u2019re challenging the entire ban because when state legislators give their personal religious doctrine the force of law, they violate America\u2019s promise to separate church and state and protect everyone\u2019s religious freedom, from the devout to the nonbeliever. That\u2019s why so many religious leaders are suing. And it\u2019s why the entire ban has got to go.\nThe separation of church and state shields our shared laws from the influence of any one religion. It frees us to come together as equals and build a stronger democracy. America needs a national re-commitment to this separation.
