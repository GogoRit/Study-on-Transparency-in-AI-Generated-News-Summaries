S\u0142awomir Kami\u0144ski / Agencja Gazeta \n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 19 strongly condemns the ongoing crackdown on protests against the abortion ban in Poland, and police brutality against protesters and journalists. We call for the immediate cessation of persecution and violence against those exercising their right to protest and to report on protest related issues.\u00a0 The protests concern a matter of crucial public interest for women\u2019s reproductive rights, and participation in public life, and the right to protest on this issue must be protected.\u00a0\nFor more than a month, hundreds of thousands of people have gathered and protested across the country against the decision of the Constitutional Court to ban abortions in cases of foetal abnormality. The Constitutional Court has been criticised for its lack of independence in recent years. The protests, led by women and organised by the Women\u2019s Strike initiative, have reached an unprecedented scale including in small towns and communities.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the beginning of the protests, ARTICLE 19 has been concerned about a number of violations of the right to protest in Poland:\u00a0\n\nUse of excessive force against protesters and journalists by law enforcement: Police have used tear gas to disperse protests, dragging protesters from the crowd to detain them. On 18 November, in the center of Warsaw, in a practice known as kettling, police units cordoned off several hundred participants in a protest, mainly women and young people, blocking their ability to move or leave the protest. No reason was given for the use of containment strategies.\u00a0\nArbitrary detentions: Protesters are being detained, often following violent arrests by law enforcement. In many cases, protesters detained in Warsaw are brought to neighbouring towns outside Warsaw to impede supporters gathering and protesting outside police stations. Detained protesters are being denied access to a lawyer or contact with family members, in violation of human rights standards.\u00a0\nPersecution of and retaliatory actions against protesters: According to Women\u2019s Strike, protesters are being targeted by the police and visited at home by law enforcement in an effort to intimidate them. A 14-year old student from Krapkowice, Maciej Rahut, was visited by the local police that threatened him with criminal charges for re-posting information on Facebook about the upcoming local Women\u2019s Strike protest that he planned to participate in. The police accused him of calling for and organising an illegal protest. They indicated to his mother that he could get eight years in juvenile detention and then prison for co-organising such protests. Police officers also went to the boy\u2019s school to falsely inform the head teacher that he was the organiser of the protest, resulting in the boy receiving a warning at school. In another case, a 17-year old from a small town in the south of Poland has been accused by the sanitary-epidemiological station of violating sanitary COVID-19 restrictions and faces a fine for organising a local protest during the pandemic. Additionally, according to media reports, especially in small towns, policemen are requesting the local sanitary-epidemiological stations to fine protesters for participating in \u201cmass gatherings\u201d which are banned under the temporary COVID-19 response restrictions. Activists have also reported cases where policemen ask protesters to take off their masks and then take pictures of them which are later shown as evidence for breaking the rules of not wearing a mask.\nAttacks, violence, detentions and criminal charges against journalists reporting on protests:\u00a0 On 23 November, photojournalist Agata Grzybowska was detained, forced into a police van and taken to a police station. She was released later that day after protesters gathered in front of the police station where she was kept, however, she is facing charges of assaulting an officer. Angelika Pito\u0144, a journalist for Gazeta Wyborcza is facing charges of using \u201cindecent\u201d words and not wearing a mask during the protest in Zakopane. The journalist stated that she had her face covered. On 18 November, Onet.pl journalists Krzysztof S\u00f3jka and Bartosz Rumie\u0144czyk, photojournalist of Gazeta Wyborcza J\u0119drzej Nowicki, photojournalist of Gazeta Polska Codziennie Konrad Fal\u0119cki, citizen journalist W\u0142odzimierz Ciejka and OKO.press reporter Maciej Piasecki were teared gassed. During the 11 November Independence March in Warsaw organised by right-wing groups, journalists were also beaten\u00a0 with batons by the police, including Renata Kim from Newsweek who was hit in the kidneys, Adam Tuchli\u0144ski from Newsweek, Jakub Kami\u0144ski of East News Agency and Dominik \u0141owicki from Gazeta Wyborcza. A photojournalist, 74-year-old Tomasz Gutry from Tygodnik Solidarno\u015b\u0107, was injured by a rubber bullet in the face and had to undergo surgery.\u00a0\nUse of force by unidentified plain-clothed officers: On 18 November in Warsaw, masked plainclothes police officers appeared in a protest, beating people and pulling individuals out of the crowd. They used tear gas against protesters, telescopic batons and stun guns to disperse, contain and attack individuals. They were also carrying firearms. These police officers were initially working as groups, threatening the safety of the protesters and seeking to provoke violence. Those that tried to disarm them in order to prevent the escalation of violent incidents are now facing charges of assaulting police officers. Inhabitants of neighbouring houses helped the protesters to escape through their backyards after they were targeted by these officers. As reported by the media, these were officers from the Central Counterterrorist Subdepartment of the Police \u201cBOA\u201d. The authorities have not provided the basis and necessity assessment of the law enforcement decision to use such excessive force and exceptional measures against protesters.\u00a0\n\nThe Polish authorities claim that the use of force against protesters is necessary for the purposes of fighting COVID-19 and is in response to protesters breaking the temporary movement restrictions. Prosecutor General and Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro announced that activists will be prosecuted\u00a0 for organising and instigating \u2018illegal gatherings\u2019 \u201con the basis of\u00a0 causing danger to the health and life of people by spreading the virus\u201d. He also ordered the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Warsaw to initiate criminal proceedings against all persons who made public the names and faces of the police officers that practiced brutal and violent tactics against protesters and journalists.\u00a0\nThe criminalisation of protesters and those monitoring and reporting on protests\u00a0 in Poland is aggravated by two factors, on one hand, the lack of legal certainty on the imposition of COVID-19 restrictions related to public gatherings, and by\u00a0 an ongoing campaign to undermine the independence of the judiciary.\u00a0\nARTICLE 19 urgently calls on Polish authorities to protect protesters, journalists and protest monitors, and respect and guarantee the right to protest in compliance with their international and regional human rights obligations, including during a health emergency. The right to monitor protests is of utmost importance and does not cease if a protest is dispersed or declared unlawful, and it applies to independent reporters and citizen journalists as well as traditional journalists and media workers. Mandatory identification of journalists\u2019 in the context of protests goes against international human rights standards, and journalists as well as citizen journalists have a right to report on abuses by police in the context of protests.\nWe call on the Deputy Prime Minister for Security and head of the ruling Law and Justice party Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, Prosecutor General and Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro, as well as the Minister of Interior and Administration Mariusz Kami\u0144ski to:\n\nImmediately stop violence against protesters and journalists covering the protests and ensure the protection of the right to protest.\u00a0\nStop arbitrary detention and retaliatory criminal proceedings initiated against protesters. Authorities should drop all the charges against protesters and journalists where there is no evidence of nor participation in actual and serious acts of violence;\u00a0\nRefrain from criminalising the participation, organisation, promotion and monitoring of protests, particularly in the context of the COVID pandemic.\u00a0\nLimit the use of containment measures against protesters that unnecessarily and disproportionately deprive them of their freedom of movement.\nEnsure accountability for the actions of law enforcement officials during protests.\nEffectively investigate the use of excessive force against protesters and journalists, and other abuses and human rights violations by law enforcement officials.\nRespect and protect the right of protesters and journalists to record law enforcement officials in the context of protests.\nRefrain from imposing mandatory accreditation requirements on media and journalists to cover manifestations.\nComply with authorities\u2019 transparency obligations regarding\u00a0 the use of special police units, and stop intimidating protesters with groups of plainclothes policemen aiming to provoke the crowd;\nEnsure that the police engage in de-escalation of tensions and effective communication with protesters instead of engaging in provocation and excessive use of force.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis statement by ARTICLE 19 is part of the Media Freedom Rapid Response (MFRR), a Europe-wide mechanism which tracks, monitors and responds to violations of press and media freedom in EU Member States and Candidate Countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted In\n\n\n\nProtest\nSafety of journalists and human rights defenders\n Europe & Central Asia\n\nPoland\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou might be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05.02.2024\n15 min read\nPoland: Five priorities for restoring protection for freedom of expression\n\n\n\n\nClick here to go to article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.01.2024\n11 min read\nPoland: Media reforms must respect democratic values and the rule of law\n\n\n\n\nClick here to go to article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.10.2023\n4 min read\nEU: Polish election reinforces demands for the EU Media Freedom Act\n\n\n\n\nClick here to go to article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress and Media\n\nGovernance\nWork with us\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\nAbout this site\nRaising a concern\nSafeguarding\n\n\nContact us\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJoin our email list\n\n\n\nVisit us on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nVisit us on Twitter\n\n\n\n\nVisit us on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\nVisit us on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistered charity number 327421 | A company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales no. 2097222\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen toolbar\n\nAccessibility Tools\n \n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Tools\n\n\n\nIncrease TextIncrease Text \n\n\n\nDecrease TextDecrease Text \n\n\n\nGrayscaleGrayscale \n\n\n\nHigh ContrastHigh Contrast \n\n\n\nNegative ContrastNegative Contrast \n\n\n\nLinks UnderlineLinks Underline \n\n\n\nReset\nReset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
