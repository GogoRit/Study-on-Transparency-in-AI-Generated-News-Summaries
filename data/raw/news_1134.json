This was the last, narrowly cracked window that abortion providers had left to challenge the law after the U.S. Supreme Court decimated their case in a December ruling.\nThe law has a unique private-enforcement mechanism that empowers private citizens to sue anyone who, in the law\u2019s language, \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law is designed to evade judicial review, a goal at which it has been largely successful so far. Abortion providers have tried to argue that the law is actually enforced by state officials \u2014 the clerks who docket the lawsuits, the attorney general and medical licensing officials who could discipline doctors, nurses or pharmacists who violate the law \u2014 which would give them someone to bring a constitutional challenge against in court.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with all of those arguments but one, allowing a challenge against the medical licensing officials to proceed. That case then went back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent it to the Texas Supreme Court to weigh in on.\nIn a hearing last month, Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone argued that there was no \u201cordinary English interpretation that entertains any possibility of public enforcement.\u201d\nOn Friday, the justices issued a ruling that seemed to agree with Stone\u2019s \u201cordinary English interpretation\u201d of the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Court concluded that Texas law does not authorize the state-agency executives to enforce the Act\u2019s requirements, either directly or indirectly,\u201d they wrote.\nAbortion advocates, including those who brought this challenge, were unhappy with the ruling.\n\u201cWe have been fighting this ban for six long months, but the courts have failed us,\u201d Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health and Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, said in a statement. \"The situation is becoming increasingly dire, and now neighboring states\u2014where we have been sending patients\u2014are about to pass similar bans. Where will Texans go then?\u201d\nNancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, also issued a statement. \u201cThe courts have allowed Texas to nullify a constitutional right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to do everything in our power to right this wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, anti-abortion groups cheered the court\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThe court recognized what we already knew: this law is constitutional,\u201d said Chelsey Youman, state director and national legislative advisor with Human Coalition Action, in a statement. \u201cIt is the most successful piece of pro-life legislation in 50 years and should be replicated everywhere in states that are serious about rescuing pre-born lives.\u201d\nThere are other ongoing challenges to the law, including multidistrict litigation in which a state district judge found the law to be unconstitutional. That case is under appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth. Help us report it.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \n\n\r\n    Independent Texas reporting needs your support.
