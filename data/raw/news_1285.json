[STEPHANIE LECOCQ/EPA] \nEuractiv is part of the Trust Project >>>  \n\n\n\nLanguages: Fran\u00e7ais | Deutsch | ItalianPrint Email   Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram  \n\nWhile technically allowed in some cases, abortion in Poland may as well be forbidden, putting women\u2019s lives at risk, said Robert Biedron, EU lawmaker and leader of the Polish opposition party Nowa Lewica on Thursday (17 November).\nTwo years ago, Poland\u2019s constitutional court approved a highly-restrictive new law that de facto banned abortion.\u00a0Only 107 legal abortions were performed in 2021, approximately 90% less than in previous years, according to figures published by the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita.\nFour MEPs went to Warsaw between 2 and 4 November to assess the effect of the current law with representatives of civil society and women\u2019s rights organisations and then presented the results during a public hearing at the European Parliament.\n\u201cAbortion is de facto illegal in Poland as it is very limited. We have gathered information by NGOs and different organisations that express their deep worry for the lack of access to health of women, whose rights are completely violated,\u201d said Biedron during a press conference following the hearing.\nThe situation in Poland demonstrates a lack of access for women to health services, such as abortion, but also access to contraceptives and other medicines linked to reproductive health.\nFurthermore, in 2022, six women died due to carrying pregnancies to term that could have been aborted, said Biedron, adding that women\u2019s lives are at risk when they feel they cannot approach a doctor for obstetric care.\nHowever, \u201cwhen we speak with government authorities, they say that everything is fine\u201d, he added.\n\u201cThe European Parliament must continue to put pressure on the Polish government and use all the tools it has, or more women will die,\u201d Caroline Hickson, regional director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation\u2019s European Network, warned MEPs during the hearing.\n\n\n\nEU Parliament to look into Poland\u2019s deadly abortion laws\nEU lawmakers will soon hold a public hearing to present lawmakers with a list of the women who reportedly died due to tightened abortion laws which created a de facto ban.\nThe hearing will be held on 17 November before two \u2026\n\n\nAt the Thursday hearing, Polish lawyer Kamila Feren emphasised that decisions about women\u2019s bodies must not be \u201cin the hands of conservative politicians\u201d.\nMembers of the Polish association Abortion Dream Team (ADT) told EURACTIV that when abortions are performed, the methods used, such as the \u2018curettage method\u2018 has been designated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as \u201coutdated and the most invasive\u201d, ADT said.\n\n\n\nMEPs condemn rape as war weapon, call for refugees\u2019 access to abortion\nEU lawmakers condemned the use of rape as a war tactic in Ukraine and called on the EU to ensure women refugees can access contraception pills and abortion across the bloc, in a resolution adopted on Thursday (5 May).\n\n\n\u2018Women as incubators\u2019\nAmongst those testifying at the LIBE committee was Barbara Skrobol,\u00a0sister-in-law of Izabela Sajbor.\nSajbor died of sepsis in September 2021 after doctors refused to perform a caesarean section on her until the fetus\u2019 heartbeat stopped, despite the fact it had a known birth defect and was unlikely to survive.\u00a0\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t able to do anything because of the anti-abortion law,\u201d Skrobol said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. That is what the procedure is. They see women as incubators\u201d, Sajbor had texted her mother during her stay at the hospital.\n\u201cShe knew she was being tortured, forced to wait for the foetus to die\u201d, Skrobol said.\n\n\n\nEU Parliament condemns Poland's restrictive law on abortion\nA year after the Polish Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling that de facto banned abortion, the European Parliament called on the government in Warsaw on Thursday (11 November) to lift the ban that puts women\u2019s lives at risk.\n\n\nPregnancy registers and protests\nNowa Lewica\u2019s Biedron highlighted that in Poland, now, there are pregnancy registers.\n\u201cThere is a national pregnancy registry so that the government can follow them, and any eventual termination is visible. We have these kind of things in Poland in 2022,\u201d said Briedron.\nThe register means that even if a Polish citizen or resident goes abroad to terminate a pregnancy, they can face criminal charges upon their return.\nIn Poland, activists took to the streets to protest against the abortion ban in October and November 2021 following the death of Izabela Sajbor.\n\u201cBut they are being threatened and attacked physically during the protests,\u201d said Hickson.\n\n\n\nGridlock in Poland as thousands protest abortion ban\nThousands of people took to the streets of Poland for a fifth straight day of protests against a constitutional court ruling that would impose a near-total ban on abortion in the EU country.\n\n\nEU called to take action\nAbortion is legal in most European countries, with Malta and Poland the only two member states to heavily restrict it, the former having a complete ban on abortions with possible prison sentences for both the mother and doctor.\nFollowing the overturning of Roe v Wade by the US Supreme Court in July, the European Parliament called to include the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\u201cMEPs once again condemn in the strongest possible terms the rollback of women\u2019s rights and sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States and some Member States,\u201d the FEMM committee said in a statement.\nOn Wednesday, Malta announced it would amend its abortion laws to allow doctors to carry out procedures to save the mother in cases where her life is at risk.\n\n\n\nMalta to amend restrictive abortion laws\nMalta, one of the few European countries to have a blanket ban on abortion, is expected to amend its abortion laws in the coming months, Prime Minister Robert Abela told local media in an interview.\nUnder the current law, it is \u2026\n\n\n[Edited by Alice Taylor]\nRead more with Euractiv\n\n35,000 annual deaths in Europe due to superbugs, says EU agencyAs deaths due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rise, public health actions aimed at tackling AMR are insufficient, according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published Thursday (17 November). \n\n\n\nSubscribe to our EU 2024 Elections newsletter\n\n\nEmail Address *\n\nPolitics\n                            Newsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLanguages: Fran\u00e7ais | Deutsch | ItalianPrint Email   Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram  \n\n\nTopics\u00a0\u00a0\n Abortion Health Poland Politics \n \n\n\n\nAdvertisementSupportersAdvertisement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Euractiv\n\nAbout\nMediahuis\nPress Releases\nSubscribe to The Brief\nSubmit an Opinion\nNewsletters\n\nCommunication Services\n\nCommunication Services at a glance\nAdvertising at Euractiv\nEuractiv Events\nEuractiv Membership\nMultimedia at Euractiv\nEuractiv European Public Projects\nYellow Academy\nEuractiv Intelligence\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEURACTIV Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9 1999 - 2024 |     Efficacit\u00e9 et Transparence des Acteurs Europ\u00e9ens.
