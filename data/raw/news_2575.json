And, to be fair, whenever something seems ethically murky, it tends to be safest to err on the good side. You won\u2019t be catching us condemning anyone for choosing Dunkin Donuts over Starbucks for political reasons.\nBut when it comes to abortion-supporting businesses, the pro-life consumer\u2019s decision-making process is far more complex than most people realize. Consider some of abortion\u2019s biggest cash supporters:\n\nVerizon\nNike\nEnergizer\nJohnson & Johnson\nUnited Airlines\nMicrosoft\nNetflix\nKraft\nGeneral Electric\nFrito Lay\nAmerican Express\nAllstate\n\nAnd, interestingly, most major fuel companies (ExxonMobil, Shell, BP) and banks (Bank of America, Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo). The reality is: orienting our lives around a full boycott of any business with its money in Planned Parenthood\u2019s pocket is nearly impossible. Read on to learn more.\nDifferent Types of Abortion Support\nThere are two main ways a company can throw money at the abortion industry \u2013 direct donations (i.e. what the companies above are guilty of) and indirect support. The latter occurs when companies facilitate donations to Planned Parenthood from their employees or donating through third parties like United Way.\nObviously, both means of financial support are wrong. Planned Parenthood kills well over 340,000 babies every year, is caught in scandal after scandal, sells fetal body parts, covers up for abusers, and profits off fear and desperation. Whoever, in these\u00a0many\u00a0companies, decided to add Planned Parenthood to the \u201ccharitable giving\u201d list, needs to re-evaluate.\nThe Reality of Boycotts: Do They Work?\nWorth noting (again) is that Students for Life isn\u2019t telling anyone that avoiding certain businesses due to their support of abortion is silly. It\u2019s not. Every person should follow their moral compass. But there\u2019s more to the big picture that pro-life consumers should consider in order to be fully informed.\nBoycotts almost never have an impact on a company\u2019s revenue. The Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern writes:\n\u201cAccording to IPR associate Brayden King, a professor of management and organizations, activists who call for boycotts usually set out \u201cto put financial pressure on a company\u201d by convincing consumers to shop elsewhere. \u2018But it turns out that\u2019s not the way that boycotts usually work,\u2019 he explained. \u2018The typical boycott doesn\u2019t have much impact on sales revenue.\u2019\n\u2018The no. 1 predictor of what makes a boycott effective is how much media attention it creates, not how many people sign onto a petition or how many consumers it mobilizes,\u2019 he noted. His research shows that the most successful boycotts are those that generate the most media coverage, typically to a single, high-profile company. These headline-grabbing boycotts lead to a greater fall in stock prices and are more likely to cause a company to change its behavior.\u201d\nSo, quiet, individual decisions not to patronize certain companies does keep the conscience clear (a very valuable thing) but may not do much else. A recent example of a bigger pro-life pseudo-boycott that matches the parameters IPR lays out occurred when Georgia was debating their Heartbeat Bill last year.\nUpon learning that Georgia\u2019s legislature was working to pass a pro-life Heartbeat Bill, a monstrous list of companies and celebrities signed on to a letter condemning Georgia and threatening to boycott the entire state. Pro-lifers, in turn, threatened to boycott the entities on the letter.\n\nSo\u2026 Can I Shop at Starbucks or Not?\nHere\u2019s our philosophy: there\u2019s only so much time in a day. In the time it would take to find alternatives to the nation\u2019s biggest companies, we could have done something to advance the pro-life cause. We could have sidewalk counseled outside an abortion facility, volunteered at a pregnancy center, organized a protest, or had a mind-changing conversation with a pro-choice person in the time it would\u2019ve taken to ride our bike to work since every gas station seems to finance Planned Parenthood.\nPlus, intent matters. Pro-life advocates aren\u2019t ordering from Amazon because we want a percentage of our order to fund abortion (shameless plug, you can select Students for Life of America as your Amazon Smile charity so that a percentage of your order goes to\u00a0fight\u00a0abortion).\nSo make the little decisions where possible. Get ice cream from a local shop instead of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, fly Southwest instead of American Airlines, or buy Duracell over Energizer batteries. But our unwavering effort in the pro-life movement to reduce Planned Parenthood\u2019s influence and make abortion unthinkable is what will have the biggest impact on pro-abortion companies in the long run.\n\n Post Views: 2,856\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
