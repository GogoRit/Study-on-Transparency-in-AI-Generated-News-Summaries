It declared terminations in the case of foetal defects \u2013 which make up around 98% of all legal abortions in Poland \u2013 to be unconstitutional.\nHowever, the tribunal\u2019s judgements only enter into force once they are published by the government in the official Journal of Laws. The deadline for that to happen was 2 November, but the government failed to do so.\n\nPolish government under fire for delaying implementation of abortion ruling\n\nIt claimed that more time was needed for \u201cdialogue\u201d. The court\u2019s decision \u2013 which polls show is opposed by a large majority of the public \u2013 had prompted the largest demonstrations in Poland\u2019s post-communist history.\nMuch of the protesters\u2019 anger was directed against the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party rather than the court itself, which is widely seen as being under the government\u2019s influence. A contested judicial overhaul in 2016 saw PiS engineer its own judges onto the court, including appointing a close associate of party chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski as chief justice.\nThe government also said last year that publication of the ruling could be delayed until the tribunal released its full justification (an argument rejected by legal scholars, who say that the government acted unconstitutionally by delaying implementation of the ruling).\nToday, the Constitutional Tribunal finally published its justification. In the 154-page text, it argued that \u201ca child not yet born [is] a human being\u201d and therefore deserves protection under the constitution\u2019s decree that \u201cPoland shall ensure the legal protection of the life of every human being\u201d.\n\n\nThe justification of the ruling on Poland\u2019s abortion law by the illegally-constituted Const. Tribunal has been published. The ruling refers to embriopathological abortion as \u201ceugenic practices\u201d, despite the fact that nobody is compelled against their will to have an abortion. pic.twitter.com/fofslBUh8v\n\u2014 Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) January 27, 2021\n\nAfter news of the justification emerged, the government\u2019s spokesman confirmed that it would be published today in the\u00a0Journal of Laws, bringing it into force.\nSome commentators have noted that the ruling could still be interpreted in a way that does not eliminate all abortions justified by foetal defects. It may be possible, for example, for a doctor to argue that giving birth to a child with a severe defect could harm the mother\u2019s physical or mental health, which would make a termination permissible.\nYet however it is interpreted, the ruling will make Poland\u2019s abortion law \u2013 already the strictest in the European Union apart from Malta\u2019s \u2013 even tougher. And it is likely to significantly reduce the already relatively low number of legal abortions (around 1,000 of which are performed annually).\n\nThe symbols of Poland\u2019s abortion protests explained\n\nIn response to today\u2019s developments, Women\u2019s Strike (Strajk Kobiet) \u2013 the organisation that coordinated last autumn\u2019s mass protests \u2013 called on Poles to return to the streets to demonstrate against the ruling.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make hell for them that they will remember for the rest of their lives,\u201d tweeted the organisation. Women\u2019s Strike declared the ruling to be illegitimate and its leader, Marta Lempart, threatened to take legal action against any doctor refusing to perform abortions based on the judgement.\nWithin a few hours, crowds of thousands had gathered in many cities and towns, including Warsaw, Wroc\u0142aw, Pozna\u0144 and Krak\u00f3w. In the autumn, the government warned that such gatherings would spread the coronavirus, though in fact infections subsequently began to fall.\n\n\n#StrajkKobiet wchodzi na rondo Dmowskiego w centrum Warszawy. pic.twitter.com/sJWxBpjgMR\n\u2014 Marcin Terlik (@MarcinTerlik) January 27, 2021\n\nIn the capital, a crowd of around a thousand gathered outside the Constitutional Tribunal before moving towards PiS headquarters. They held banners declaring \u201cFreedom of choice instead of terror\u201d and \u201cThis is war\u201d.\nThe protests also received support from opposition politicians. Former prime minister Donald Tusk called for the \u201cdefence of [women\u2019s] rights and dignity against the cynical fanaticism of the authorities\u201d.\nA group of MPs from The Left, Poland\u2019s second largest opposition group, joined the demonstration outside the Constitutional Tribunal and called on centrist and centre-right opposition parties to join them in opposing the restrictions on abortion.\n\n\nJeste\u015bmy pod TK.

However, some participants vandalised Catholic churches and disrupted masses in late October, and also clashed with nationalists who had gathered to defend churches.\nAs the protests progressed into November, police began to use increasingly heavy-handed tactics against them. Officers \u2013 often in plain clothes \u2013 deployed batons and tear gas.\nThey claimed to be responding to aggression from the crowds, but activists and opposition MPs accused the police of unjustified and wanton use of force.\n\nClashes at abortion protest in Warsaw as police use tear gas and force against demonstrators\n\nMain image credit: Krzysztof Cwik / Agencja Gazeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel TillesDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0Notes from Poland.
