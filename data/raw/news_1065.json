A total ban \u2014 that includes an exemptions if a woman\u2019s life or health is danger \u2014 will take effect in the coming weeks following last month\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.\nThe letter, sent Wednesday to the Texas Medical Board, cited several examples in which medical care was delayed.\nIn one case, a central Texas hospital reportedly told a physician not to treat an ectopic pregnancy until it ruptured, the letter said. An ectopic pregnancy, which occurs when a fertilized egg attached outside of the uterus, is not viable.\n\u201cDelayed or prevented care in this scenario creates a substantial risk for the patient\u2019s future reproductive ability and poses serious risk to the patient\u2019s immediate physical wellbeing,\u201d the letter said.\nREAD MORE: Texas woman says unborn baby should count as a passenger in HOV lane\nThe Texas Medical Board confirmed it received the letter but a spokesperson said the board cannot confirm or deny any specific complaints.\nThe Biden administration issued guidance this week that said hospitals must provide abortion services if the life of the mother is at risk.\nTexas sued Thursday over that guidance, arguing that the federal government isn\u2019t authorized to require emergency healthcare providers to perform abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights demonstrators surround anti-abortion rights demonstrators outside of Denton City Hall and tell them to go home as Denton\u2019s city council meets to vote on a resolution seeking to make enforcing Texas\u2019 trigger law on abortion a low priority for its police force, in Denton, Texas on June 28, 2022.
