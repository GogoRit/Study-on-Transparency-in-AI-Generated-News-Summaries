SB 321 is a direct attempt by Kentucky lawmakers to take advantage of a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to undermine Kentuckians\u2019 constitutional right to abortion as much as possible.\u00a0\nLike the\u00a015-week ban our state\u00a0has already passed, the Mississippi ban still has not been held to be constitutional and\u00a0has never gone into effect.\u00a0Kentucky\u2019s existing 15-week ban, which passed in 2018, is still facing active legal challenges for its violation of the constitutional right to abortion. The Mississippi law is currently\u00a0blocked, with both a federal district court and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals recognizing it is unconstitutional.\u00a0\nMajor medical providers like the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics oppose this type of 15-week abortion ban, because they put safe and timely abortion care out of reach from patients, and put patients\u2019 health and wellbeing at risk. This bill is cruel and dangerous. It contains no exceptions for survivors of rape and incest. And it ignores\u00a0polling\u00a0that shows Kentuckians want legal access to abortion.\u00a0\nStatement from Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky State Director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates:\u00a0\n\u201cThis bill is cruel political theater at the cost of patients in Kentucky,''\u00a0said Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky State Director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.\u00a0\u201cIt is unacceptable that patients would be forced to wait until their health and lives are at extreme risk before accessing the care they need. People in Kentucky deserve policies that will make them safer and healthier, not attacks on their fundamental rights that strip people of the freedom to make the best medical decision for themselves.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real: the Kentucky General Assembly isn\u2019t wasting any time in its attempt to limit access to abortion ahead of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban. This bill along with House Bill 3, a 60+ page omnibus anti-abortion bill, shows that legislators will stop at nothing in order to ban abortion outright.\u201d\nAbortion restrictions fall hardest on our most vulnerable communities, pushing access out of reach for anyone who doesn\u2019t have the financial luxury to seek care out of state. We are at a crisis point here and across this country when it comes to abortion access. We need all health care champions to speak out against these bad bills, because silence in this moment is as good as being complicit in passing them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n###\nPlanned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, Serving AK, HI, ID, IN, KY, WA (PPAA) is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization educating residents and policymakers about reproductive health issues in Alaska, Hawai\u2018i, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky and Washington.
