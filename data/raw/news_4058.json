In Sierra Leone, 1 in 17 women will die while giving birth.\nIn general, global health problems include issues of inequality in wealth, access, and infrastructure. We know how to solve these problems but have not yet fully gotten those solutions to the poorest and most vulnerable people. CARE, through the Right to Health strategy, aims to bring these solutions to the most vulnerable people in the world with the goal of supporting 50 million people to achieve their right to health. This includes 30 million women and girls\u2019 sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) by 2030.\nWe will accomplish this by:\n\nStrengthening local health systems and community-based organizations\nSupporting marginalized population groups, especially adolescents, to exercise their right to health\nIncreasing access to quality health services, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights services, in humanitarian and fragile settings\nPreparing and responding to public health emergency preparedness by leveraging our long-term relationships with governments, frontline health workers, and communities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrengthening Healthcare\nWith communities at the center, CARE is working to support more effective and motivated health workers.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent Health\nMarried adolescents are especially vulnerable to health problems related to childbearing, and few global health initiatives reach this population.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n of girls in poor countries are married before they're 18\n\nof girls in poor countries are married before they're 18\n \n\n\n\n 1 in 3 women around the world experiences gender-based violence \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproductive Health\nThe story of global health in the last decade is one of staggering inequality.
