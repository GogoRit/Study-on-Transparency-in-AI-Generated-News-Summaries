Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which involves a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nBaltimore Archbishop William E. Lori, chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities, delivers the homily during the opening Mass of the National Prayer Vigil for Life Jan. 20, 2022, at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. (CNS photo/Bob Roller)\n\nIf the court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs, expected in June or early July, overturns the court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, it will leave abortion to the states. Already, lawmakers in several states are working to codify Roe in their laws; other states have passed bills similar to the Mississippi law.\nIn their statement, Los Angeles Archbishop Jos\u00e9 H. Gomez, USCCB president, and the chairmen of USCCB committees concerned with pro-life activities, domestic and international policy, evangelization and other issues reviewed the years of outreach by the Catholic Church through various initiatives, parishes, agencies other entities to pregnant women in need and their children and families.\nThey recommitted the USCCB and its various resources and ministries to these initiatives and urged Catholic dioceses, parishes, agencies and institutions to do the same.\n\u201cWe proclaim a vision for our society that upholds the truth that every human life is sacred and inviolable \u2014 a society in which the legal protection of human life is accompanied by profound care for mothers and their children,\u201d the bishops said.\n\u201cWe exhort our nation to prioritize the well-being of women, children, and families with both material resources and personal accompaniment so that no woman ever feels forced to choose between her future and the life of her child,\u201d they added.\nBesides Archbishop Gomez, the bishops who signed the statement and their committees are: Bishop Thomas A. Daly of Spokane, Washington, Catholic education; Auxiliary Bishop Robert P. Reed of Boston, communications; Bishop Andrew H. Cozzens of Crookston, Minnesota, evangelization and catechesis; Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, domestic justice and human development; Bishop David J. Malloy of Rockford, Illinois, international justice and peace; Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone of San Francisco, laity, marriage, family life and youth; Auxiliary Bishop Mario E. Dorsonville of Washington, migration; and Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, pro-life activities.\n\u201cThe Catholic Church has a long history of service to those who are most vulnerable and remains the largest private provider of social services in the United States,\u201d they said. \u201cThrough the sacrificial efforts of faithful Catholics, the church serves millions through diocesan ministries and agencies, Catholic hospitals and health care systems, immigration clinics, shelters, and Catholic schools and parishes.\n\u201cFrom religious communities to pregnancy care centers, from refugee resettlement services to foster care and adoption agencies, and from maternity homes to parish-based ministries, the church consistently bears witness in word and deed to the beauty and dignity of every human life \u2014 including both mother and child.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators are seen outside the Supreme Court Dec. 1, 2021, ahead of oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health, a case involving Mississippi\u2019s law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. (CNS photo/Evelyn Hockstein, Reuters)\n\nThe prelates said the U.S. church will recommit itself to its many pro-life efforts, including:\n\u2014 Accompanying women and couples facing unexpected or difficult pregnancies and during their early years of parenthood, \u201coffering them loving and compassionate care through initiatives such as Walking with Moms in Need and countless others.\u201d\n\u201cWalking with Moms in Need\u201d is a nationwide initiative launched by the U.S. bishops \u201cto engage every Catholic parish in providing a safety net to ensure that pregnant and parenting moms have the resources, love and support they need to nurture the lives of their children.\u201d\n\u2014 Ensuring \u201cour Catholic parishes are places of welcome for women facing challenging pregnancies or who find it difficult to care for their children after birth, so that any mother needing assistance will receive life-affirming support and be connected to appropriate programs and resources where she can get help.\u201d\n\u2014 Helping Catholics \u201crecognize the needs of pregnant and parenting moms in their communities, enabling parishioners to know these mothers, to listen to them, and to help them obtain the necessities of life for themselves and their children.\u201d\n\u2014 Being witnesses \u201cof love and life by expanding and improving the extensive network of comprehensive care including pregnancy help centers, maternity homes, and Catholic health care and social service agencies.\n\u2014 Proclaiming \u201cwith a clear and united voice that our society can and must protect and care for both women and their children.\u201d\n\u2014 Redoubling \u201cour advocacy for laws that ensure the right to life for unborn children and that no mother or family lacks the basic resources needed to care for their children, regardless of race, age, immigration status, or any other factor.\u201d\n\u2014 Continuing to support and advocate for public policies and programs directed toward \u201cbuilding up the common good and fostering integral human development, with a special concern for the needs of immigrants and low-income families.\u201d\n\u201cWe are deeply conscious that, after nearly half a century of legalized abortion, more than 65 million children have died from abortion and an untold number of women, men and families suffer in the aftermath,\u201d the bishops said.\nIn response to this suffering, they said the USCCB\u2019s committees and other Catholic entities will recommit themselves \u201cto proclaim God\u2019s mercy after abortion and compassionately accompany women and men who are suffering after an abortion.\u201d\nThey also said the church will expand diocesan \u201cabortion healing ministries,\u201d commonly known as Project Rachel Ministry, \u201cso that women and men receive forgiveness, healing, and spiritual renewal through Christ\u2019s infinite mercy.\u201d\nThe prelates also pledged to \u201ctransform our parishes into what Pope Francis calls \u2018islands of mercy in a sea of indifference'\u201d by raising Catholic awareness of \u201cthe great struggle involved in an abortion, and the guilt, pain and grief that follow.\u201d\n\u201cIn all these ways and more, the Catholic Church witnesses to the sanctity of all human life, from conception to natural death, and works to build a true culture of life in our nation,\u201d they said.\n\u201cMay a renewed commitment to life overflow into increased protection of unborn children and expanded support for their mothers and families,\u201d they said in conclusion.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The full joint statement can be found on the USCCB website at https://bit.ly/3IB9T0d.\n\nFollow Asher on Twitter: @jlasher\n\nRead More Respect Life\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. bishops urge prayer as high court poised to hear cases on pill used in abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life group deplores Harris\u2019 historic visit to Planned Parenthood abortion clinic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody of preterm baby found in Virginia pond prompts prayers, resource reminders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople touched by adoption look to St. Joseph in national novena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarchers at Maryland March for Life call for defeat of constitutional amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSister of murdered French priest tells story of forgiveness, friendship with killer\u2019s mother\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Catholic News Service/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nJulie Asher\n\nCatholic News Service is a leading agency for religious news.
