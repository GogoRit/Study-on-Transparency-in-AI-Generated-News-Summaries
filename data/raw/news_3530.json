Shawn McKnight of Jefferson City, Missouri, by a vote of 174-63.\nThe pro-life chair was one of several high-profile leadership decisions the bishops have made this week. Taken together, the moves signal that there will be no dramatic policy shifts within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) for the next several years.\nOn Tuesday, by wide margins, the bishops elected a new conference president and vice president: Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA, and Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, whom Burbidge will succeed as chair of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Broglio, 70, and Lori, 71, will serve three-year terms, commencing after the bishops\u2019 meeting ends Thursday.\nIn other key elections Wednesday, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley was elected USCCB secretary over Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark (130-104), and Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana, was tabbed as the next chair of the Committee for Religious Liberty over San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone (165-77).\nIn other USCCB committee chair election results:\nCanonical Affairs and Church Governance: Bishop Thomas J. Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, 147-91, over Bishop Alfred A. Schlert of Allentown, PennsylvaniaEcumenical and Interreligious Affairs: Bishop Joseph C. Bambera of Scranton, Pennsylvania, 128-111, over Bishop Peter L. Smith of Portland, OregonEvangelization and Catechesis: Indianapolis Archbishop Charles Thompson, 149-90, over Bishop William D. Byrne of Springfield, MassachusettsInternational Justice and Peace: Bishop W. Elias Zaidan of the Maronite Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon, 148-95, over Philadelphia Archbishop Nelson J. Perez\u00a0Protection of Children and Young People: Bishop Barry C. Knestout of Richmond, Virginia, 127-114, over Bishop Elias R. Lorenzo, OSB, auxiliary bishop of the Newark Archdiocese\nOutspoken abortion opponent\nBurbidge, 65, who has led the Arlington Diocese since December 2016, is regarded as an experienced teacher of the faith who has not shied away from weighing in on hot-button issues, including abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBishop Burbidge has been outspoken in his commitment to making pro-life issues a centerpiece of the activities in the Arlington Diocese and the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d Olivia Gans Turner, president of Virginia Society for Human Life, said in a statement to CNA.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cI have had the pleasure to know Bishop Burbidge since he was bishop of Raleigh,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe met while we were both speaking at multiple pro-life events there. I knew he would bring that same dedication and compassion to protecting all innocent human life with him to Virginia.\u00a0\n\u201cIt has been exciting to see him expand pro-life efforts in Northern Virginia. Pro-lifers of every faith and no faith congratulate him,\u201d Turner added. \u201cThe USCCB has made a good selection for this important position.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia CNA\nJeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, called Burbidge \u201ca joyful and energetic leader for life.\u201d \n\u201cHis dedication to evangelizing the dignity of every life and working for the protection and care of unborn children, their mothers, and their families resonates with clarity and conviction in the Diocese of Arlington, in Virginia, and well beyond,\u201d he said in a statement to CNA. \u201cI was excited to learn that he has been elected to chair the USCCB\u2019s pro-life committee.\u201d\nIn August 2021, Burbidge was the first U.S. bishop to publish a\u00a0catechetical letter\u00a0on the Church\u2019s teaching related to transgenderism, calling for charity while also discouraging practices such as gender \u201ctransitioning\u201d and using gendered pronouns disconnected from someone\u2019s sex.\u00a0\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nMore recently, in May of this year, Burbidge issued a\u00a0Communion ban against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0in the Arlington Diocese because of her pro-abortion stance. His action extended the ban Cordileone issued in San Francisco, her home diocese.\nIn October, Burbidge\u00a0denounced\u00a0U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s stated intention to codify a national right to abortion should Democrats win control of Congress, saying, \u201cThe role of Congress is to pass laws that serve the common good \u2014 and yet this priority of the president only brings about pain and death.\u201d\nBurbidge fills the chairmanship that Lori is vacating due to his new role as USCCB vice president. Burbidge will serve the remaining two years of Lori\u2019s term.\nThe other chairs elected Wednesday will serve as chairmen-elect of their respective committees for one year, beginning at the conclusion of this week\u2019s assembly. After that they will serve three-year terms as chairs.\nSecretary-elect\u2019s views on abortion, Pelosi\u2019s ban\nCoakley, the secretary-elect, has been an outspoken foe of the death penalty and has sought clemency for prisoners condemned to execution. In his role as chair of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development he has joined calls for stricter gun-control laws.\nLike Burbidge, the 67-year-old Oklahoma City bishop has voiced support for Cordileone\u2019s ban on Pelosi receiving Communion.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\u201cI applaud the courage of Archbishop Cordileone and his leadership in taking this difficult step,\u201d he said. He asked for prayers for the archbishop, for Pelosi, for the protection of the unborn, and for \u201cthe conversion of hearts and minds.\u201d\nArchbishop Paul S. Coakley preaching during Mass in the cathedral in 2021. Archdiocese of Oklahoma City\nAnother distinguishing feature of Coakley\u2019s episcopate in Oklahoma City, which began in February 2011, has been his response to Pope Francis\u2019 motu proprio Traditiones custodes restricting the Traditional Latin Mass.\nCoakley initially granted temporary permission for priests currently celebrating the old Mass to continue to do so, pending further study. In August 2021 he said he understood that the pope\u2019s document aimed to give bishops \u201cthe ability to address divisions or a lack of unity caused by the celebration of the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy in some places.\u201d\n\u201cI have not found that sort of division to be evident in parishes of our archdiocese,\u201d he said. He determined that Masses at specific parishes \u201cmay be retained.\u201d\nIn 2014, Coakley\u2019s archdiocese filed a lawsuit to stop Satanists from using a stolen host in a \u201cblack mass\u201d in Oklahoma City. The event organizers returned the host after the lawsuit was filed.\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new voice in defense of religious liberty\nRhoades, the chairman-elect of the Committee on Religious Liberty, is fluent in Spanish and able to celebrate in Spanish, Italian, Vietnamese, and English. He has led the Fort Wayne-South Bend Diocese since January 2010.\nBishop Kevin C. Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana, was tabbed as the next chair of the Committee for Religious Liberty on Nov. 16, 2022, in Baltimore. Shannon Mullen/CNA\nRhoades, who turns 65 on Nov. 26, hasn\u2019t shied away from public comment on the actions of pro-choice politicians. In 2016,\u00a0he said it was wrong\u00a0for the University of Notre Dame to honor then-vice president \u2014 now president \u2014 Joe Biden with its honorary Laetare Medal, which honors a Catholic with achievements in the arts and sciences.\n\u201cI believe it is wrong for Notre Dame to honor any \u2018pro-choice\u2019 public official with the Laetare Medal, even if he or she has other positive accomplishments in public service, since direct abortion is gravely contrary to the natural law and violates a very fundamental principle of Catholic moral and social teaching: the inalienable right to life of every innocent human being from the moment of conception,\u201d Rhoades said at the time.\nIn 2012, Rhoades\u00a0said it was an attack on religious freedom\u00a0for the Obama administration to mandate that all employers, including religious, must offer coverage of sterilization, abortifacients, and contraception.\nJonah McKeown and Joe Bukuras contributed to this story.\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nBishop Kevin Rhoades, \nBishop Michael Burbidge, \nArchbishop Paul Coakley, \nUSCCB Fall General Assembly 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Mullen is the editor-in-chief of the National Catholic Register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
