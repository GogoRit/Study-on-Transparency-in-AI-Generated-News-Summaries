Alcorn, who was sentenced to seven years  in the Idaho Penitentiary for manslaughter after a 20-year-old woman died following an abortion procedure performed by Alcorn in 1899. He appealed the jury\u2019s decision to the Idaho Supreme Court, but lost the appeal in 1901. He served three of the seven years before he was paroled. (Courtesy of the Idaho State Archives)\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho drafted its original abortion statute at the First Territorial Session in Lewiston \u2014 25 years before Idaho became a state and drafted the state constitution \u2014 in the winter months between December 1863 and early 1864.\nThe wording of the statute is almost identical to statutes several other states were passing to ban abortion around the same time, including Montana and Nevada.\u00a0\nLike the ban that took effect in Idaho in August, that law allowed for abortion to save the woman\u2019s life, but not for rape and incest.\nBetween 1864 and 1973 \u2014 when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Roe v. Wade declared a constitutional right to abortion throughout the U.S. \u2014 Idaho successfully prosecuted and imprisoned only six people for crimes related to the abortion statute. Three of those were prosecuted because the pregnant woman died following the procedure.\nTwo additional cases in the 1950s were prosecuted but dismissed for lack of evidence and a hung jury.\nThat\u2019s according to research from a thesis written by Rosemary Wimberly at Boise State University in 1996. The thesis is one of the only comprehensive studies of abortion in that period of Idaho history. Copies of the thesis are kept at the Idaho State Archives and at Boise State University\u2019s library.\nWimberly wrote that, because of \u201cpopular tolerance\u201d of abortion, prosecutors found it difficult to get convictions in cases where the woman did not die as a result of the procedure. American historians point out that, prior to the 1850s, most people were not against abortion prior to \u201cquickening,\u201d the point in a pregnancy when a fetus\u2019s movements can be felt by the pregnant person. That typically occurs around 16 to 20 weeks, in the second trimester.\u00a0\nA few of the convictions were appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court \u2014 the same court that is expected to soon rule on whether Idaho\u2019s new abortion bans will remain unchanged.\u00a0\nMany judges see sticking with legal precedent as part of maintaining a stable legal system and don\u2019t want to be thought of as policymakers. But, at the moment, Idaho Supreme Court justices are faced with a difficult decision: break with a legislative history restricting abortion that dates back to Idaho\u2019s territorial days, or interpret the Idaho Constitution\u2019s right to privacy as one that extends to abortion.\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\nWhat are Idaho\u2019s current laws on abortion?\nIdaho now has in effect a ban on nearly all abortions, with legal defenses allowed for rape, incest and to save the pregnant person\u2019s life. If someone is prosecuted under the existing law, those are acceptable as a defense in court. In the case of rape or incest, the victim must also provide a copy of a police report.\u00a0\nThe state also enacted a civil enforcement law that is modeled after a similar law in Texas to allow civil lawsuits against medical professionals who perform abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is typically around six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe law awards no less than $20,000 to the mother, father, grandparents, siblings, aunt or uncle of the fetus or embryo in a successful lawsuit. It includes exceptions for rape, incest or a medical emergency that would cause death or create serious risk of substantial harm to the patient.\u00a0\nA third law banned abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, but that law was rendered unenforceable when the near-total abortion ban went into effect.\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAbortion was one of the worst crimes, an Idaho justice wrote in 1901\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood filed separate lawsuits against all three of Idaho\u2019s most recent laws related to abortion. The organization\u2019s attorneys argued before the Idaho Supreme Court in early October that the state\u2019s courts have historically held that, under the Idaho Constitution, there is a fundamental right to privacy and to make familial decisions. Article I of the Idaho Constitution mentions certain inalienable rights, such as enjoying and defending life and liberty, pursuing happiness and securing safety.\nAlthough Idaho\u2019s constitution does provide protection for privacy \u2014 and abortion is one of the most private decisions a person can make \u2014 justices are likely to take precedent into consideration, said Richard Seamon, a University of Idaho professor who teaches constitutional law. That may be an especially salient point, because without the backing of Roe v. Wade, the state is, in a way, starting from scratch, he said.\n\u201cThis is a decision that each justice has to make for him- or herself, but I think almost all of the justices agree that they\u2019re bound by precedent, and they have to have a good reason for breaking precedent,\u201d Seamon said in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun. \u201cJustices who reach the state or U.S. Supreme Court tend to be conservative with a small c, or humble, in a sense. They\u2019re coming into an office where there have been lots of brilliant judges in the past, and they have to kind of approach their task with humility.\u201d\u00a0\nBut the cases that were specifically related to Idaho\u2019s abortion statute make it clear how some past justices viewed abortion.\n  A newspaper clipping from the Idaho Statesman in 1901, when the Idaho Supreme Court denied Dr. E.J. Alcorn\u2019s appeal.\nIn 1901, a 20-year-old Kootenai County woman named Cora A. Burke sought an illegal abortion from a doctor named E.J. Alcorn. Burke had been a widow for about five months, and already had a 4-year-old son.\nTwo days after the procedure, she died of septicemia, or blood poisoning, resulting from infection. Alcorn was charged with manslaughter for the crime and sentenced to seven years at the Idaho Penitentiary. Today, such a death is rare, due to medical advances and antibiotics.\nAlcorn\u2019s appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court was denied, and Chief Justice Ralph P. Quarles wrote, \u201cThe crime for which appellant has been convicted is one of the worst known to the law. An unnatural abortion, brought about by means of drugs or instruments, violates decency, the best interests of society, the divine law, the law of nature, the criminal statutes of this state, and is not only destructive of life unborn, but places in jeopardy the life of a human being \u2014 the pregnant woman.\u201d\n \n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\nAbortions were a hard crime to prove, history professor says\u00a0\u00a0\nEvan Hart, an associate professor of history at Missouri Western State University, has studied abortion history specific to Missouri and nationwide. She said 20 abortion-related crime cases made their way to the Missouri Supreme Court between the 1860s and 1945, and from her research, Idaho is an outlier in terms of just how few cases were prosecuted.\nHart said abortion laws were rarely prosecuted in part because it was difficult to prove a woman had been pregnant, and because if nothing went wrong and the woman survived, few people were likely to know it occurred; even if they did, they probably weren\u2019t going to report it to authorities.\n\u201cOftentimes police and prosecutors were saying, \u2018If they\u2019re not hurting people, if they\u2019re not causing deaths, infections or illness, then we stay out of it,\u2019\u201d Hart said. \u201cEspecially before the turn of the century, lots of people still kind of believed, ultimately, that this was not a matter for the courts. If someone died, then yes, it was. But if it\u2019s a familial issue, for a lot of prosecutors, it was like, \u2018That\u2019s their business.\u2019\u201d\nQuarles seemed to take a tougher stance, based on his opinion in the State v. Alcorn case.\n\u201cBoth actors, when there are two \u2026 are guilty of felony, and ought to be punished by the law, if the woman survives,\u201d Quarles wrote in 1901. \u201cAnd, if she does not, then the person or persons participating in the abortion should be punished. This crime is one of grave consequences to society. The law prohibits it and prescribes severe penalties. The law ought to be strictly enforced.\u201d\nAnother Idaho case in 1934 was a civil matter that involved a married couple named Clyde and Jean Nash, who said a doctor named John S. Meyer performed an abortion on Jean Nash that he claimed was necessary to save her life, but the couple said the doctor was negligent and deceitful in his actions. In that case, Chief Justice Raymond Givens wrote about his interpretation of the intent of the statute as written in 1864.\nGivens wrote that the abortion statute was designed for the protection of the general public interest, not the protection of the woman. While Idaho\u2019s assault and battery and dueling statutes were designed for the direct protection of the individuals involved, that did not extend to abortion.\n\u201cThe exception must rest not on the tender care or protection of the statute for the woman, but, generally, that an illegal act is inherently fraught with danger to the life, health and safety of the individual,\u201d he wrote.\n  Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan and Justice John R. Stegner hear arguments from Monte Stewart, representing the Idaho Legislature in lawsuits over Idaho\u2019s near-total abortion ban. (Darin Oswald/Idaho Statesman)\n\u00a0\nIdaho Supreme Court\u2019s ruling is unlikely to be the last word on abortion in Idaho\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court made its initial decision on Roe v. Wade on Jan. 22, 1973, the Idaho Legislature was in session. According to legislative records and newspaper articles from the Idaho Statesman in the weeks after the decision, legislators from both parties initially argued over whether the state\u2019s abortion law had to change to comply with the new constitutional protection.\u00a0\nA deputy attorney general at the time, Kent Taylor, told legislators they would have to comply with Roe v. Wade, so they agreed to write the most restrictive abortion law possible within the confines of the high court\u2019s ruling.\n\u00a0Some Democratic legislators at the time were staunchly opposed to changing the law, including Sen. E.H. Tacke of Cottonwood, who was quoted in the Statesman saying, \u201cTo me, abortion, no matter what trimester, is taking the life of an infant, a creature of God, who has the right to life.\u201d That recent history, coupled with what\u2019s on record from earlier days, could make the decision a difficult one for justices, said Seamon, the University of Idaho constitutional law professor.\n\u201cThey have to be thinking about how there is a pretty long legislative record of opposition and a restrictive approach towards abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would have to break with that tradition, to interpret the Idaho Constitution (as protecting) a right of access to abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nThe court doesn\u2019t have to explicitly rule one way or the other, Seamon said, although not addressing the central question of abortion could present other challenges for the court. If the justices determine the way the law is written is the issue \u2014 not the idea of restricting abortion itself \u2014 that would force the question of which parts of the law are upheld and which aren\u2019t, he said. That would be particularly true with regard to what physicians can or cannot do in dangerous medical situations, he said.\nIf the court finds any of the law\u2019s provisions to be unconstitutionally vague, it would \u201cessentially send the law back to the Legislature and say, \u2018We can\u2019t enforce this as it\u2019s written now because it\u2019s too vague. Go back to the drawing board,\u2019\u201d Seamon said.\nThe court may also consider the fact that, during the more than 100 years when abortion was strictly illegal in Idaho, it was rarely prosecuted.\n\u201cJudges do look at the difference, they realize that the laws on the books often differ from the law in operation. I think a judge would need to take that into consideration,\u201d Seamon said. \u201cBut even if the Idaho Supreme Court comes out with some sort of ruling that the Idaho Constitution protects some access to abortion, that\u2019ll just open more doors as to, what are the limits of that right? So there will still be lots of open questions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWhat does history tell us about how the Idaho Supreme Court might rule on abortion?\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun November 14, 2022\nWhat does history tell us about how the Idaho Supreme Court might rule on abortion?\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun November 14, 2022\n Idaho drafted its original abortion statute at the First Territorial Session in Lewiston \u2014 25 years before Idaho became a state and drafted the state constitution \u2014 in the winter months between December 1863 and early 1864.\nThe wording of the statute is almost identical to statutes several other states were passing to ban abortion around the same time, including Montana and Nevada.\u00a0\nLike the ban that took effect in Idaho in August, that law allowed for abortion to save the woman\u2019s life, but not for rape and incest.\nBetween 1864 and 1973 \u2014 when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Roe v.
