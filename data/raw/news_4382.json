Seven Reasons to Celebrate the Biden-Harris Win.\n\nNov. 7, 2020   min read\n\n\nBy\nMiriam Berg\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can't contain our excitement (and relief) that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the 2020 election. Here\u2019s to a new beginning!\n\n\nAnd who made this win possible? You. You never gave up. It was your hard work, your persistence. This is YOUR win.\u00a0\nAs part of an unstoppable grassroots movement to protect reproductive freedom, Planned Parenthood Votes, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and local Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations contacted more than 5.5 million voters to get out the vote. Record turnout and wins for reproductive health champions up and down the ballot\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0again that a supermajority of Americans support the right to access sexual and reproductive health care, and politicians who oppose abortion are out of step with the country.\u00a0\n\n\nBlack women proved, yet again, to be an electoral powerhouse \u2014 propelling wins\u00a0for candidates who value justice, and sending a message to Trump that hostility to people of color and immigrants is for losers. Turnout was higher overall, but it looks like some of the biggest increases may have been among young people of color. They demanded change and they did it loudly.\nNow, with new leaders and new vision, we get to reimagine what it means to take full control of our bodies and our lives.\nSo, let\u2019s revel in it. Here are the seven wins putting the biggest smiles on our faces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. We kicked Trump out of office! Rejoice!\nNow, we can work with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to undo the damage of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. We\u2019ll hold them accountable to their campaign promises and the voters who elected them. That includes taking back what we lost during the last administration \u2014\u00a0like reduced access to safe and legal abortion, affordable birth control, care at Planned Parenthood health centers, and protections for LGBTQ+ people and other groups facing discrimination.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s reign of terror on communities\u00a0 of color is over. But it\u2019s not just about him. Systemic inequities and biases are woven into the fabric of this nation\u2019s policies and institutions, and we\u2019re ready to demand that the new administration honor their commitment to righting those wrongs.\nWhat\u2019s more, Biden and Harris actually listen to scientists and believe in facts. They have a plan for the nation\u2019s COVID-19 response that calls for equitable access to tests and treatment and increased health care system capacity. We\u2019re prepared to help them begin the hard work of addressing racial disparities in the COVID-19 response, as the pandemic disproportionately ravages the health of Black communities.\n\n\nFired Up? Become a Virtual Volunteer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Kamala Harris is the first Black person, first woman, AND first Asian American to become vice president of the United States. \nWith Kamala Harris as vice president, we\u2019re optimistic about what the future can hold for women and people of color in office. Harris lives and thrives at the intersection of multiple identities.\u00a0\nHarris is also the child of immigrants, with a Tamil heritage through her mother and a Jamaican lineage through her father. She has said she\u2019s dedicated to protecting immigrants\u2019 rights, and we\u2019ll be there to remind her of that dedication.\u00a0\n\n\nHarris told DACA recipients she and Biden \u201cstill have your back\u201d and will protect DREAMers from deportations.\n\n\nHarris and Biden will work to reduce immigrant detention, stop the inhumane treatment of immigrants at detention centers, and reunite families who were ripped apart by Trump\u2019s cruel policies.\n\n\nThey promise to freeze deportations of immigrants and stop building the U.S.-Mexico border wall in their first 100 days in office. They\u2019ll also create new pathways to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Planned Parenthood has champions in the White House again.\u00a0\nBiden and Harris understand that Planned Parenthood plays a crucial role in the nation\u2019s health care system. They promised to stop efforts to \u201cdefund\u201d Planned Parenthood and protect patients who rely on federal health care programs. In particular, they plan to end the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s dangerous gag rule on Title X, the federal program for affordable birth control and reproductive health care. The gag rule has left millions of patients without access to full information about their care, and put their health in jeopardy.\nBut we know these policy changes will not happen automatically. Even our champions need us to let them know we\u2019re watching. So, get ready to join Planned Parenthood Action Fund in leveraging our collective power to make sure that Biden and Harris support the 2.4 million patients who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for essential services like birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing and treatment.\n\n\nPower the Fight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Our country\u2019s leaders once again understand that abortion is health care. \nWhat happened to abortion access in the last four years has been a nightmare. Thankfully, Biden and Harris have committed to defending access to safe, legal abortion.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not just protecting access \u2014\u00a0they pledged to expand it too. \n\nBoth Biden and Harris have advocated ending the Hyde Amendment, a restriction that blocks people who rely on federal health programs from using their insurance to pay for abortion. We\u2019ll be front and center to ensure they keep their word.\u00a0\nWe also expect the Biden White House to reverse the global gag rule, which bans overseas groups from getting U.S. funding if they provide or even mention abortion. Trump made the global gag rule more restrictive, and more dangerous. It\u2019s linked to unsafe abortion \u2014 as well as women dying from pregnancy-related complications \u2014 in the poorest and hardest-to-reach communities around the world. And right now, the Trump administration is attempting to expand it even more before they leave office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Biden and Harris will fight to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and health care equity overall.\nWe\u2019re so grateful that the people who\u2019ll be in charge of our country will protect health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and the 20 million Americans who didn\u2019t have insurance before the ACA.\u00a0\nBiden and Harris will also create federal policies to reduce racial disparities in health care, particularly for maternal health. The maternal mortality rate is more than three times higher for Black patients than white patients, because of systemic barriers to health care coverage and services.\nWe\u2019ll also work to ensure that efforts to expand the ACA and other health care programs include comprehensive coverage for sexual and reproductive health care, including for abortion and for immigrants. In fact, more than 90 organizations have already laid out a blueprint for the Biden-Harris administration to take bold executive and agency actions in its first days in office.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Birth control will once again be treated as what it is: essential health care.\nBirth control is basic reproductive health care. And our country\u2019s new leaders know birth control access is not up for debate. That\u2019s why they pledged to defend the ACA\u2019s requirement that insurers cover birth control without a copay, reverse harmful Trump policies that undermined this requirement, and stand up for employees whose bosses want to take away that guarantee.\nWe said it before and we\u2019re thrilled to say it again: Biden and Harris pledged to repeal the Trump administration\u2019s dangerous gag rule on Title X. This is huge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Sex education will get more support \u2014\u00a0not less.\u00a0\nThe old, bad news: The Trump administration cut funding for evidence-based, comprehensive sex education programs that can help young people prevent unintended pregnancy \u2014 and refocused that funding toward abstinence-only and risk avoidance programs, which are proven to be ineffective.\nThe new, amazing news: Biden and Harris know that all young people deserve sex education. We\u2019ll make sure they back those beliefs up with action.\u00a0\nWe won\u2019t give up until everyone has access to sexual and reproductive health information and services. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Congressional and State Wins!\nWe\u2019re equally thrilled that health care champions secured seats in the Congress and state legislatures across the country. Here are several more reasons to jump for joy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. House: Retaining Majority and Making History\nIn a major victory, the people voted to retain the pro-reproductive majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Their votes show that supporting safe, legal abortion is a winning political issue.\nThe U.S. House also saw some major firsts:\n\n\nTwo\u00a0openly LGBTQ+ candidates won seats in the House. They\u2019ll join seven openly LGBTQ+ representatives who won reelection in the House (and two in the Senate). That will give the 117th Congress the biggest and most diverse group of openly LGBTQ+ representatives in history.\n\n\nThe election of Cori Bush makes her the first Black woman to represent Missouri in Congress, and the first Black Lives Matter activism leader elected to Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four women have confirmed that they have all successfully won their reelection campaigns, securing another term in the House of Representatives. https://t.co/B0KL0qoW71\u2014 Black Enterprise (@blackenterprise) November 5, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning, Holding U.S. Senate Seats\u00a0\nMany pro-reproductive rights senators held onto their seats in the Senate, including Sen. Mark Warner from Virginia, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire, and Sen. Cory Booker from New Jersey.\nVoters also showed up to elect many reproductive health champions to the U.S. Senate.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Colorado, John Hickenlooper defeated incumbent U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner. Plus, voters defeated a dangerous 22-week abortion ban ballot measure.\n\n\nArizonans elected Mark Kelly \u2014\u00a0who understands the stakes for reproductive rights in the Grand Canyon State \u2014\u00a0to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\nMichiganders reelected Sen. Gary Peters to the U.S. Senate. He is the first sitting senator to share a personal family experience with abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's to Senator-elect @benraylujan!! You've ALWAYS fought to protect access to sexual and reproductive health care and we know you'll keep fighting in the Senate. Congratulations! #WeDecide2020 pic.twitter.com/3E3VGTIZZX\u2014 Alexis McGill Johnson (@alexismcgill) November 4, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Planned Parenthood Staff and Patients Won Big\nSeven former Planned Parenthood staff and self-identified patients endorsed by Planned Parenthood Action Fund will be heading to Congress or run-off elections in January, including:\n\n\nTina Smith, who won reelection to the U.S. Senate for Minnesota. She once served as executive vice president of external affairs for Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota.\n\n\nNikema Williams, who won the election to represent Georgia\u2019s 5th district. She spent almost eight years as vice president of public policy for Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf89 HUGE congratulations to @RoyCooperNC on his reelection victory! We're excited to continue to have a Governor who is a true champion for reproductive health and rights and look forward to another four years! #ncpol pic.twitter.com/DRddgo6WJ8\u2014 PP South Atlantic NC (@PPSATNC) November 4, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nRainbow Wave in the States\nThe LGBTQ Victory Fund and The Advocate are describing a Rainbow Wave in state legislatures.\u00a0\n  On election night, the number of trans state lawmakers nearly doubled.   In Delaware, Sarah McBride became the first openly transgender state senator nationwide and the first trans member of Delaware's legislature.\u00a0   Mauree Turner became Oklahoma\u2019s first Muslim state legislator (representing HD-88) and the nation\u2019s first nonbinary legislator\u00a0in U.S. history. \n\n\n\n\nTo @PPact's members, volunteers, and supporters who showed up over the past 4 years: Thank you. No matter the election results, you organized, you spoke up, and you fought like hell. The 2.4 million people who get care at Planned Parenthood health centers will never forget it. pic.twitter.com/uRawtM16AH\u2014 Alexis McGill Johnson (@alexismcgill) November 4, 2020\n\n\n\nToday We Celebrate. Tomorrow, We Get to Work.\nBut this isn\u2019t where our work ends.

We\u2019ll do everything we can to keep our health and rights at the top of their priority list.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd in the places where the outcome didn\u2019t go our way: We\u2019ll be there, fighting on until everyone \u2014 regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, income level \u2014 can live the life they want.\n\n\nWe won\u2019t stop until we achieve true health equity, and when we all can take full control of our bodies and our lives.\n\n\n\n\nGet Involved\nJoin our movement of activists building a world in which everyone gets to live the life they want.\u00a0\n\n\nContinue taking action from home.
