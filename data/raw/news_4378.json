But the government\u2019s framing of the consultation betrays a lack of understanding of the diversity of people who sell and buy sex. \u00a0It also excludes the approach that best reflects international human rights law and research on how best to protect the safety of people who exchange sex for money \u2013 full decriminalization. The consultation asks people which of four approaches they see as most effective at preventing violence against woman and girls, but those options do not include full decriminalization.\nAs Human Rights Watch wrote in our submission, our research in countries including \u00a0Cambodia, China, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United States has led us to support full decriminalization of sex work. Our findings indicate that even when only buying sex is criminalized, it makes it harder for sex workers to protect themselves from violence. Laws prohibiting \u201cbrothel-keeping\u201d often prevent sex workers from sharing work premises and protecting each other.\nLaws such as those in Scotland criminalizing loitering and soliciting can force sex workers to make hurried and less cautious decisions about potential clients, or to work in more dangerous locations. These laws also leave many sex workers with criminal records that can make it harder to transition into other forms of work and access benefits and services.\nThe consultation also highlights \u201clinks between human trafficking, prostitution and serious organized crime.\u201d Human Rights Watch has also conducted extensive research on human trafficking and works to end human trafficking. Sex work is the consensual exchange of sex between adults. Human trafficking is a separate issue\u2014it is a serious human rights abuse and a crime and should always be investigated and prosecuted. Laws and policies that clearly distinguish between sex work and the crime of human trafficking help protect both sex workers and crime victims.\nScotland\u2019s consultation on sex work could help inform a new approach that better protects the safety and well-being of sex workers\u2014if the government is prepared to hear those views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia United Kingdom \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Sex Work \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 23, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSingle Women in South Korea Have Rights to a Family Too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal Rolls Back Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cViolence with Every Step\u201d\n\n\nWeak State Response to Domestic Violence in Tajikistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 23, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSingle Women in South Korea Have Rights to a Family Too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal Rolls Back Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
