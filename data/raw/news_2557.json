That test has now been strengthened, meaning two doctors will have to agree an abortion is the right decision.\u00a0\nIt won't be necessary for many women. Just 0.5 percent of abortions take place after 20 weeks, usually due to extreme complications. It's a serious procedure that takes place in a hospital.\u00a0\nLittle says the changes will allow women to know they're making the best choice for themselves.\n\"It reflects what's happening anyway. I think women that have to make that decision when it gets to that point - they want to know they are getting the best possible advice,\" he told Newshub.\nProgress of the abortion reforms have been fraught with painstaking negotiations to get to this point, especially between New Zealand First and Labour.\nAnother hurdle is in the works - NZ First wants it all to be decided by voters in a referendum, though that's unlikely to be voted through.\u00a0\n\"We want the people to speak not a group of temporarily empowered politicians,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters.\nPoliticians will deliver a conscience vote on the referendum on Tuesday night.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\nWebsite Terms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\nAdvertise with Us\n\nComplaints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Copyright \u00a9 2023  Discovery NZ Limited (Warner Bros.
