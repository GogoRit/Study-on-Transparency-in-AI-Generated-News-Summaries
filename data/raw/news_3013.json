Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Father Frank Pavone, a firebrand pro-life activist who has stirred controversy over the issue within the Church, was removed from the Roman Catholic priesthood this fall.    Pavone was officially removed from the clergy on November 9 following receipt of a letter from Pope Francis' representative in the U.S., according to the New York Times. The letter ordered that Pavone was to be removed with no possibility of appeal.\"This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,\" the letter reportedly reads, without specifying the communications.  Pavone claimed he had received no communication from the Vatican in an interview with the Catholic News Agency Saturday. Nevertheless, he said his removal comes as little surprise.  \"I\u2019ve been persecuted in the church for decades, decades. This is nothing new for me,\" he told CNA. \"They just don\u2019t like the work I\u2019m doing for these babies.\"  HILLARY CLINTON SAYS OVERTURNING ROE V.

In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.\"  Demonstrators march and gather near the state capitol following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.
