This year's march is expected to be similarly small, yet pro-life advocates remain excited at the prospect of a possible reversal of Roe v. Wade. (Valaurian Waller | Detroit Catholic)\n\n\n\nMarchers will contend with COVID-19 restrictions in D.C., scaled-back events; Archdiocese of Detroit to host prayer vigil day of the march\nDETROIT \u2014 Fr. Jim Kean and Footprints for Life Michigan are more than thrilled to be heading to this year\u2019s March for Life in Washington, D.C., even if it might have a different feel than prior marches. \nThe fact that a march is happening at all \u2014 after the March for Life had a smaller gathering in D.C. and encouraged pilgrims to join virtually in 2021 \u2014 is a blessing, Fr. Kean said. This year's march is happening in person Friday, Jan. 21, albeit numbers are expected to be smaller.\nFr. Kean is chaplain for Footprints for Life Michigan, which will have 110 people in two buses going to Washington this year. \nThe group won\u2019t be visiting its usual restaurants and spots around the capital, and will forgo the Vigil for Life at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception the night before the march. Even the popular Youth Rally and Mass hosted by the Archdiocese of Washington is canceled this year. \nBut the loss of such opportunities can lead to other ones, Fr. Kean said. \n\u201cIt is a sacrifice, but it\u2019s a good reminder for us that we are about the march,\u201d Fr. Kean, pastor of St. Joseph Parish in Lake Orion and St. John Fisher Chapel University Parish in Auburn Hills, told Detroit Catholic. \u201cWe are seeing the first serious consideration of overturning Roe v. Wade, and for those who\u2019ve been doing the march for years, we want to be there for this historic year.\u201d \n \n\n\nMarch for Life participants walk past St. Joseph's on Capitol Hill Church on their way to the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington Jan. 29, 2021, amid the coronavirus pandemic. (CNS photo/Tyler Orsburn)\n\nThe annual March for Life commemorates the Jan. 22, 1973, Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. This year\u2019s march takes place in the foreground of the upcoming Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Clinic decision slated to be announced this summer, adding to the excitement for this year's march.\nFootprints for Life is partnering with Farmington Hills Mercy and Warren Regina high schools, as well as Novi Detroit Catholic Central, who will travel with the group. The group will stay in Falls Church, Va., the night before the march, where they will celebrate Mass at St. James Parish with pastor Fr. Paul Scalia, son of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for smaller venues that are spiritually enriching, so we\u2019re not putting people at risk (of COVID-19) that you\u2019d get at the (Verizon Center) or the rally,\u201d Fr. Kean said. \u201cOn the day of the march, we\u2019ll have Mass in the morning, breakfast at the hotel, depart later than we normally would, and instead of trying to get to some of the many elements of the march early, we\u2019ll stay at St. James, keep it spiritual, go to the National Mall for the life speakers, then march, ending at St. Peter\u2019s Church on Capitol Hill.\u201d \nThe Archdiocese of Detroit has a series of events related to the march, including a livestream rosary at noon the day of the march, a young adult Holy Hour for Life at Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Detroit at 7 p.m., and a Mass for the Protection for the Unborn at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament on Sunday, Jan. 23, at 11 a.m. \n \n\n\nArchbishop Allen H. Vigneron preaches last year during a Mass for the Protection of the Unborn at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Detroit. The archbishop will celebrate the Mass again this year at 11 a.m. Sunday, Jan. 23. (Valaurian Waller | Detroit Catholic)\n\n\u201cWe would love to fill the cathedral for that, knowing many pilgrims will not be able to travel to D.C.,\u201d said Kathleen Wilson, coordinator of pro-life ministries for the Archdiocese of Detroit. \u201cOnline, we have a list of 17 wonderful outreach, evangelical charity service projects young people or families could do to defend the vulnerable, to be in solidarity with the unborn, to reach out to moms in need.\u201d \nEven if Roe is overturned, Wilson said, it is incumbent on pro-life advocates to do more than just attend the March for Life. \n\u201cBeing pro-life is not about joining a movement or being part of a political event; it\u2019s part of our baptismal call to live a consistent life ethic, and this is a beautiful opportunity as we commemorate those vulnerable who have lost their lives,\u201d Wilson said. \"This is a chance to re-examine our own witness to the sanctity of life, beginning with our own, recognizing our own identity as a beloved son and daughter of God.\u201d \nOther events around the state include a memorial and march in Lansing on Jan. 19 at 1 p.m. at the state Capitol, hosted by Right to Life of Ingham County.\nAs the Archdiocese of Detroit transitions to Families of Parishes, each family is being asked to bolster its resources available to help mothers and expectant moms, said Chris Leach, director of evangelical charity for the Archdiocese of Detroit. The archdiocese and its parishes also are participating in the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' \"Walking with Moms in Need\" initiative.\n \n\n\nEverest Collegiate students hold signs for drivers passing by the school during a pro-life rally last year. (Valaurian Waller | Detroit Catholic)\n\n\u201cIn the transition to Families of Parishes, we are working with all the directors of evangelical charity, a staff position within each Family of Parishes, to work through the lens of pro-life ministry,\u201d Leach said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with each of the Families of Parishes to make sure they have a handle on the needs within their own families and community, asking how they can be a pro-life witness in the Church.\u201d \nLeach said its incumbent on each Family of Parishes to assess the particular pro-life needs in their geographic area in order to respond to those needs. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge blessing we started 'Walking with Moms in Need' right before Families of Parishes were announced,\u201d Leach said. \u201cInstead of each parish trying to do their own thing, families (of parishes) can do something together, knowing it will make a bigger impact.\u201d \nEven if Roe v. Wade is overturned, and the abortion debate is kicked to the states \u2014 there is currently a movement to enshrine abortion as a right in the Michigan constitution \u2014 the pro-life movement's mission of caring for the poor, the unborn, mothers, the elderly, the environment, the rights of workers and the dignity of all remains.\n\u201cWe still have a ton of work to do,\u201d Leach said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about changing the laws; it\u2019s about changing our whole social system to respect life, to support moms in need specifically, but also parents who are struggling, families who are struggling. We have a lot of work to do to really open hearts and open minds to the suffering of the least among us.\"\n \n\n\t\t\tShare:\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Copy Permalink\n Print\n\n\n\t\t\tSuggested reading\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nWhen it comes to changing hearts, prayer works, former abortionist tells volunteers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nSeminarians host 14th annual Dinner for Life to support those \u2018on the front lines\u2019\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nGospels hold clues for role of women, men in the Church, panel says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a hostile world, the vocation of Christians is to hope, pope says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPapal envoy asks prayers for peace, solidarity with victims of war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidates, catechumens take final steps on their journey to Catholic Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints Detroit\u2019s Bishop Battersby to lead Diocese of La Crosse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nLocal\nNational/World\nVatican & Pope Francis\nSports\nArts\nClergy Assignments\nObituaries\nEspa\u00f1ol\nArchives\n\n\nMedia\nVideo\nPodcasts\nGalleries\n\n\nVoices\nArchbishop Allen H.
