If the same scenario were to happen later this year, she would likely be forced to carry to term.That\u2019s because Idaho, which bans abortion after six weeks, is one of at least 22 states with laws banning abortion before the 15th week, many of them lacking exceptions for fetal viability, rape or incest, or even the health of the woman. Several of those bans would take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court issues a ruling overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, as a leaked draft of the opinion suggests.\n\nSuch exceptions were once regularly included in even the most conservative anti-abortion proposals. But as the battle over abortion access heats up, experts on both sides of the issue say the exceptions were a temporary stepping stone intended to make anti-abortion laws more palatable. \nMany of the current abortion bans are designed as \u201ctrigger laws,\u201d automatically going into effect if the high court overturns the nationwide right to abortion. That ruling is expected to be released by late June or early July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlabama and Oklahoma have enacted bans with no exceptions. Alabama\u2019s 2019 law is blocked in federal court but could be reinstated based on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. The Republican sponsors envisioned the legislation as a vehicle to challenge Roe in court, and said they could add rape and incest exceptions later if Roe is overturned. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically using people \u2014 in this particular situation, women \u2014 as collateral damage,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Chris England, the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party. \u201cIn the debate, we tried to talk reasonably to them and say, \u2018What happens if you win? This is the law, You\u2019re not going to have the opportunity to change it before people get hurt.\u2019\u201dSeveral other states, including Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas, also have bans or trigger laws in place that lack exceptions for rape or incest, according to the Guttmacher Institute and Associated Press reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion laws without Roe v. Wade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho and Utah have exceptions for rape or incest, but require the pregnant woman to first file a police report and then prove to the abortion provider the report was made. Only about a third of sexual assaults are reported to police, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.Texas and Idaho allow exceptions for \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d but leave that interpretation up to physicians, making some critics fear doctors will wait to intervene until a woman is near death.\n\nPublic support for total abortion bans appears to be low, based on a Pew Research Center survey released Friday and conducted in March. The survey showed that just 8% of U.S. adults think abortion should be illegal in all cases with no exceptions, and that 61% of adults say abortion should be legal in most or all circumstances. Surveys consistently show that many Americans have nuanced attitudes around the legality of abortion depending on the stage of pregnancy, circumstances of conception and health of the mother or fetus.Arkansas has two near-total abortion bans \u2014 a trigger law from 2019 and one passed last year that is blocked in federal court. Neither have exceptions for rape or incest, though they do allow abortions to save the woman\u2019s life. The state also never repealed its pre-1973 total abortion ban with no restrictions. Republicans in the state were split on the issue last year, with Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Sen. Missy Irvin expressing reservations about the lack of protections for sexual assault survivors.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many young girls are on suicide watch because they were raped, because they were a victim of incest?\u201d asked Irvin, who ultimately voted for last year\u2019s bill.The sponsor of last year\u2019s ban, Republican Sen. Jason Rapert, defended the lack of exemptions, saying it still allowed the use of emergency contraception.Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst for the abortion-rights supporting Guttmacher Institute, said that of 86 pending proposals for abortion restrictions this year, only a few \u2014 including one each in Idaho, New Jersey and West Virginia \u2014 include rape and incest exceptions.The exceptions were always \u201cincredibly limited,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might think these exceptions are helpful. But in fact they\u2019re so restricted, they\u2019re very hard to use.\u201d\n\nTroy Newman, president of the national anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, said exceptions to abortion restrictions for rape and incest and to protect a pregnant woman\u2019s life in the past have been \u201cthrown in there to appease some centrists.\u201dNewman said his group, based in Wichita, Kansas, opposes rape and incest exceptions. Their rationale: \u201cDon\u2019t punish the baby for the crime of the father.\u201dThe Ohio Legislature is weighing a trigger law that lacks sexual assault exceptions. During a hearing last month, the bill\u2019s GOP sponsor, Rep. Jean Schmidt, caused controversy when she called pregnancy resulting from rape \u201can opportunity\u201d for the rape victim to \u201cmake a determination about what she\u2019s going to do to help that life be a productive human being.\u201dShe was responding to a question from Democratic Rep. Rich Brown, who asked if a 13-year-old impregnated during a rape would be forced to carry to term.Rape \u201cemotionally scars the individual,\u201d Schmidt conceded, \u201cbut if a baby is created, it is a human life.\u201dDemocratic Rep. Tavia Galonski countered that pregnancy is often traumatic and dangerous on its own, adding: \u201cTo then force a survivor of rape to carry a pregnancy to term and go through childbirth is utterly vile and only adds to the trauma they have already suffered.\u201d In South Carolina, supporters of a 2021 abortion ban added exceptions for rape and incest because it was the only way to get the law passed. During debate, Republican Sen. Richard Cash argued against the exceptions.\u201cPunish the rapist ... but it doesn\u2019t belong on the baby,\u201d he said.Democratic Sen. Mia McLeod responded that it was obvious Cash had never been raped.\u201cWell, I have. You\u2019re looking at a sexual assault survivor,\u201d she said, adding that requiring rape victims to carry babies to term could lead them to desperate measures, including dangerous illegal abortions or suicide.\u201cI\u2019m just asking that the men in this body give the women and girls of this state\u201d a choice, McLeod said.New Hampshire has banned abortion after 24 weeks of gestation except for when the woman\u2019s health is threatened, though the state will soon add an exception for fatal fetal anomalies. The Republican-led legislature has rejected attempts to add rape and incest exceptions. Republican Rep. Beth Folsom, who said in January that she is a rape survivor, argued the exceptions aren\u2019t necessary because rape victims carefully track their menstrual cycles and wouldn\u2019t wait 24 weeks to seek an abortion. An incest exception wasn\u2019t needed, she added, because \u201cthat aggressor is going to make sure that young girl or woman has an abortion before anyone finds out.\u201dMallory Schwarz, executive director of Pro-Choice Missouri, expressed concern that provisions in laws like the one in Texas that allow abortions past six weeks in medical emergencies, will require doctors to wait until a patient appears to be dying to perform an abortion.\u201cAny of those kind of pieces that are left up to interpretation are generally going to have a broad chilling effect on providers who don\u2019t want to jeopardize their career and livelihood and practice and ability to care for other patients,\u201d Schwarz said.Many bans outlaw abortion after six weeks, when vaginal ultrasounds can first detect electrical activity in embryonic cells that may later become the heart. Proponents call them \u201cheartbeat laws,\u201d arguing that cardiac activity is a reliable indicator of life.In Idaho, Housley has repeatedly testified against the state\u2019s abortion bans in the Legislature, but said the lawmakers were uninterested in hearing about her experience.\u201cMy baby had a heartbeat, but that\u2019s not the only thing a baby needs,\u201d said Housley. Anti-abortion politicians \u201care not at all interested in the reality of this issue. They\u2019ve hijacked this discussion, and that\u2019s why we are where we are.\u201d___Hanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.
