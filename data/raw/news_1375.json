Wade overturned, according to new dataBy Amelia Templeton (OPB)Nov. 1, 2022 12:18 a.m.The number of abortions per month in Oregon went up by 18% in August, after the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Abortion remains legal without restrictions in Oregon, and providers have been anecdotally reporting an increase in travelers.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorNow there\u2019s data documenting that change, from a national effort called, #WeCount. Led by the Society of Family Planning, it is gathering data from clinicians and tracking changes to abortion nationwide.The data compares the number of abortions performed in April, before the high court\u2019s decision, to July and August, just after it.In the Pacific Northwest, the greatest changes occurred between April and August, when a near total ban on abortion went into effect in Idaho. That month, there was a 48% decrease in abortions in Idaho, amounting to 70 fewer abortions. In Oregon over that time period there was an 18% increase in abortions, or 150 more. In Washington, there was a 5% increase in abortions, or 90 more.Alyssa Colwill, the director of family planning clinical services at Oregon Health & Sciences University, says anecdotally, the majority of patients traveling for abortion are coming from Idaho, but she\u2019s also seen patients from Texas, Wisconsin and other states.Colwill says women who need to leave their home state for an abortion face steep obstacles. Appointments can be hard to schedule, and many patients are struggling with the cost of travel on top of the cost of an abortion.A file photo from an Aug. 25, 2022, event at which Gov. Kate Brown reaffirmed Oregon's abortion access laws. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, prompting near-total abortion bans in Idaho and other states, abortion procedures in Oregon have climbed by 18% according to new data.Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPBTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorA patient from Idaho she saw last month drove eight hours to get to her appointment, and lived in her car for three days during the appointment and follow up visits.\u201cShe had come with her 3-year-old, with her partner,\u201d Colwill said. \u201cThe only way for them to access abortion is to literally pack up their life in their car.\u201dColwill added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is an exception.\u201dEastern Oregon residents who used to have access to abortion at Planned Parenthood in Boise have also been impacted by Idaho\u2019s ban and now have to travel 350 miles to the closest provider.OHSU has expanded its telehealth abortion options, increased the number of spots available in its clinic, and expanded the amount of operating room time for abortions to help manage the surge in demand.The teaching hospital is also providing rural health care providers new training on contraception, abortion, and miscarriage management, to reduce disparities in access to family planning within the state.Nationwide, the number of legal abortions dropped by 6% following the Dobbs decision, according to the data shared by #WeCount.Research has shown that women who seek an abortion and can\u2019t get one are more likely to live in poverty and more likely to continue to be exposed to domestic violence than women who do obtain abortions.The data includes abortions provided by clinics, private medical offices, hospitals, and virtual-only providers in the U.S. known to offer abortion care. The majority, 79%, of known providers agreed to participate.The data does not reflect any self-managed abortions.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorOPB\u2019s First Look newsletterSign up to get important news and culture from around the Northwest, delivered to your inbox six days a week.EmailPlease leave this field blankSign UpRelated StoriesFrom a Planned Parenthood clinic, Oregon governor vows fight for \u2018fundamental\u2019 abortion rightsOn the day the near-total ban on abortions goes into effect in Idaho, Planned Parenthood leaders in Oregon say visits from out-of-state patients needing abortions are already up.Aug. 25, 2022In Oregon-Idaho border town, planned abortion clinic receives little welcome from localsRepublicans outnumber Democrats three to one, and if you ask most people in town what they think of abortion, their first answer is that they\u2019re pro-life. And yet, the new clinic in their town will likely be the only place offering abortions for about 200 miles in any direction.July 27, 2022What the end of Roe v. Wade means for Oregon and WashingtonThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade yesterday puts the power to allow or ban abortions in the hands of state governments. In Oregon and Washington abortion remains a fully legal health procedure, protected by state law. But that\u2019s not the case in several other states, here abortion clinics are already closing.
