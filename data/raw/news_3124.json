I believe, as the Constitutional Court itself also stated a long time ago, that life begins with conception.\u201d\nThe president then warned that the court's decision could lead to \"abortion in Colombia becoming a means of contraception.\"\nDuque stressed that \"we also need to address this discussion in the body whose competence it really is, which is the Congress of the Republic, as several of the judges have noted in their vote.\"\nThe president of Colombia also explained that the Constitutional Court \u201cis breaking the principle of constitutional res judicata (irreversibly decided already) because the Court had already ruled on this matter quite some time ago, in 2006, and the Court had established three exceptional reasons for interrupting a pregnancy.\u201d\nThe president also pointed to the fact that with a 24-week-old baby \u201cwe are talking not about a life in gestation but a life with expectation of being born. We are talking about interrupting a life that has a very clear developmental process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Colombian bishops also decried the ruling Feb. 22, say that \u201cto hold that the rights to life and to receive the protection of the State, protected by the Constitution, aren\u2019t protected from the moment of conception, is an affront to human dignity.\u201d\n\u201cProtecting the supposed right to take an innocent human life puts at risk the very foundation of our social order and the rule of law. Direct abortion is an immoral act and a violent practice contrary to life.\u201d\nThe bishops said that sometimes \"the reality of abortion responds to human dramas that entail multiple difficulties and anguish for the mother and those in her life especially when the pregnancy is the consequence of sexual violence or must be faced in conditions of abandonment, exclusion or economic hardship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn these cases, when the woman is a victim, it is reasonable that both civil society and the legal system provide for her defense and protection. However, we consider that claiming a right ceases to be legitimate if it involves denying or trampling on the rights of others.\u201d\nThe bishops recalled that \"the fact that every pregnancy involves the existence of another human being, distinct from the mother, in conditions of helplessness and vulnerability, who in turn has the right to be part of the human family, cannot be covered over or minimized.\u201d\nThe bishops questioned whether \"there weren\u2019t other ways to safeguard the lives of the mothers together with that of their unborn children,\u201d saying that \u201cthe problem of abortion cannot be limited only to pregnant women, but demands the solidarity of the entire society.\u201d\nThe bishops stated that \"where evil stands as the only option, we want to be the first to help find the good option when abortion seems to be the solution\" and that they do this \"in the name of the One who came to bring life in abundance.\u201d\n\nMore in Americas\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis accepts resignation of Dominican Republic auxiliary bishop\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bishops\u00a0 proposed this \"in the hope that the State, as well as all compatriots of good will, will spare no effort to protect and promote human life, even in the most complex circumstances.\"\nIn a Feb. 21 video, Archbishop Luis Jos\u00e9 Rueda Aparicio of Bogot\u00e1, president of the Colombian Bishops\u2019 Conference, recalled that \"the Colombian Constitution says that life is the fundamental right of all citizens and from here proceed the other rights that are defended in Colombia and around the world.\u201d\nThe archbishop said that \"for us believers, in addition to being a natural right,\" life \"is a gift from God and we will continue to announce, defend and promote human life, from gestation to natural death.\"\n\n\nTags:\nColombia, \nCatholic News, \nprolife, \nAbortion in the United States, \nIv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, \nConstitutional Court of Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter S\u00e1nchez Silva is a senior writer for ACI Prensa (https://www.aciprensa.com).
