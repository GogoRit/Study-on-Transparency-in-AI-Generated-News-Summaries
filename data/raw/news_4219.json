Haynes of Seratones is a volunteer at one of the clinics at the center of the landmark abortion access case headed for Trump's Supreme Court.By Ariana MarshPublished: Mar 03, 2020 5:30 PM ESTSave ArticleDylan Glasgow GuiceMarch 4 will mark a pivotal day for reproductive rights in America. The Supreme Court will hear June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, the first abortion access case it\u2019s presided over since conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were confirmed.At the center of the case is Act 620, a Louisiana state law that prevents doctors from performing abortions unless they have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortion is performed. Considering abortion is one of the safest outpatient procedures and patients rarely require emergency care, admitting privileges requirements do not make patients safer, they just reduce access. If upheld, Act 620 would shut down all but one remaining abortion care providers in Louisiana (three exist now), leaving a single doctor to provide abortion services for the roughly 10,000 women who seek them in the state every year. \u201cWhenever people don\u2019t have access to abortion that is safe, they will resort to other means,\u201d says A.J. Haynes, the front woman of the Louisiana-based soul rock band Seratones and an abortion counselor of 10 years.Passed in 2014, the law was immediately challenged by three plaintiffs, including Hope Medical Group\u2014the Shreveport, Louisiana, clinic where Haynes volunteers\u2014subsequently preventing it from going into effect. In 2016, an identical Texas law was presented to the Supreme Court in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. Ultimately, it was deemed unconstitutional on the grounds that limiting clinic availability was an undue burden on women seeking legal abortions, which is a constitutional right as determined by Roe v. Wade in 1973. \u201cWhat\u2019s pivotal about this case is that it\u2019s not just about abortion, this is about the integrity of the Supreme Court,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cThe state of Louisiana is openly defying the constitutional precedent that was established in 2016. How massive is that?\u201dWhy are we creating barriers for people to have access to something they need?The case is the latest in a string of attacks that signals a larger national assault on women\u2019s reproductive rights. As of June 2019, six states\u2014Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia\u2014had only one abortion clinic left, and according to a May 2019 report by The New York Times, 11.3 million American women of reproductive age are more than a one-hour drive to the nearest abortion facility. On a state-by-state basis, dangerously strict laws pertaining to when and if abortion should be allowed have been proposed all over the country: In Alabama, Republican Governor Kay Ivey signed a 2019 law banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy, including in cases of rape and incest; in Georgia, Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed a 2019 \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law that would effectively ban abortion after six weeks. These are just some of the onslaught. As Haynes points out, abortion restrictions disproportionally affect women of color and low-income women. A 2014 study by the Guttmacher Institute reveals that 75 percent of U.S. abortion patients are poor or low-income, and 62 percent identify as non-white. \u201cThe people, who are the most vulnerable and the most marginalized, are going to suffer the most,\u201d she says. \u201cThis case is about stopping cycles of poverty in states like Louisiana, which has the third-highest poverty rate in the country. Why are we creating barriers for people to have access to something they need?\u201dHaving volunteered at Hope Medical Center since her senior year at Centenary College of Louisiana in 2009, Haynes has become all too acquainted with the threats that abortion rights have long faced. Though it would be easy to chalk the affront on abortion access up to the rule of the Trump presidency and the Republican-majority senate, the reality is this has been going on far longer than the last four years. It\u2019s only because of the increasingly polarized political climate, says Haynes, that people are finally paying attention. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in reproductive health for over a decade, so I\u2019ve known what time it is. It didn\u2019t take a complete dumpster fire of an electoral college and people\u2019s apathy for me to realize the reality of what the most marginalized and vulnerable people have been dealing with, regardless of what happened in 2016. I saw the writing on the wall. That\u2019s what\u2019s been happening in Louisiana.\u201dRebecca Santana/AP/ShutterstockThe Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana.Haynes first became involved with Hope Medical Center after her college cover band played a set at the clinic\u2019s Christmas party. (Two of the band members went on to cofound Seratones with Haynes.) She struck up a conversation with Kathleen Pittman, the clinic administrator, and asked if they needed any help. The following week, she started her role as a part-time counselor, meeting with patients ahead of the state-mandated 24-hour waiting period\u2014which Haynes describes as \u201cjust another barrier to access\u201d\u2014to ensure they understood everything about the abortion process and felt supported and informed. \u201cPeople walk in with all these preconceived ideas and a lot of misinformation\u2014they\u2019re really scared sometimes because of the stigma that surrounds abortion,\u201d says Haynes, emphasizing its safety. \u201cMy role is to be a listener, to make sure that people are informed about their decision, and to make sure they have all the resources they need. Above all, I just need to sit there and shut up, and let people explain to me what they feel.\u201dThroughout her time as a counselor, Haynes\u2019s music career has bloomed. She went from playing in a college cover band to make money for textbooks to founding the Seratones with three other musicians in 2013. Two years later, they were featured in NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk Concert series; in 2016, they released their first album, Get Gone; and between it all, they toured internationally, playing festivals with the likes of South by Southwest and Hangout Fest Stateside, and Reading and Leeds in the United Kingdom. \u201cIn a lot of ways, coming home to work at Hope is a stabilizing force in my life as an artist,\u201d she notes.Most recently, Seratones released Power (2019), a rousing 10-track album that, as its name suggests, is meant to inspire strength in anyone who gives it a listen. \u201cThe way I\u2019m interested in creating is very rooted in the day-to-day struggle of people and the day-to-day victories of people,\u201d explains Haynes. \u201cWhat are the daily things that we don\u2019t talk about, how do we reflect on our own narratives and really find the power that\u2019s in those? I feel like oftentimes we\u2014especially women, especially marginalized people\u2014don\u2019t feel like our stories are worth telling. Part of working at Hope has informed the necessity and the importance of people\u2019s stories.\u201dView full post on YoutubeThe album\u2019s title track has become an anthem of sorts for fighting for change in the face of adversity. \u201cWe take two steps forward / They take one step backward / We take each step to lift us up higher,\u201d sings Haynes, later adding, \u201cWe take each step / \u2019Cause we have the power.\u201d Fittingly, Seratones performed the track at the Center for Reproductive Rights\u2019 2019 gala held in New York City\u2019s Lincoln Center. \u201cThat was like, man, that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do as an artist. I\u2019m supposed to take something, this frustration and anxiety, and figure out how to position it as power and create something that we need to hear,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cNo matter what happens [with this case], we\u2019re going to move forward and make sure we have access to the things that we need. I have that hell-or-high-water mentality, because what else is there? We need this win, and it needs to happen.
