Wade be overturned, this narrowing would devastate a majority of people in this country,\u201d she said.\n\nSupreme Court case\nLast year, alarm bells sounded about the future of abortion rights in the US when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a Mississippi case, \u200b\u200bDobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The case centres on the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law that banned abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nWhile a decision is expected around the middle of the year, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority appears ready to weaken or overturn Roe v Wade, paving the way for dozens of states to restrict or ban abortion entirely.\nA Texas law that prevents abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and allows private individuals to sue providers and anyone who aids them after that period has also raised concerns, pushing tens of thousands to protest across the US last year.\nThe Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case three times, most recently in December, effectively continuing the ban while allowing lower courts to debate it. The case has been sent to the Texas supreme court, thus delaying proceedings.\nBut ultimately, all eyes are turned to the Mississippi case \u2013 and its potentially historic implications for American women of all races and religions.\n\nIslamic law\nFor decades, discourse among Muslim scholars and jurists centred on the premise that there is no clear prohibition of abortion in Islam, and that many agree that a woman\u2019s life should be prioritised over an unborn fetus.\nIslamic law, also known as Sharia, is not static or monolithic; it has evolved over time in response to cultural, social, and political contexts and societal changes, to stay relevant to Muslims.\nOn reproductive and sexual health, it offers a wide range of rulings, which can vary from extremely restrictive, to more flexible or permissive on questions of birth control, family planning, abortion, pregnancy, and assisted reproductive technology that helps with infertility, such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nAmong various schools of thought and religious communities, there can be a very wide diversity in how certain issues are interpreted \u2013 and abortion is one of those topics. Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) scholars have given a range of time during which they said it is appropriate for a Muslim to have an abortion \u2013 from a few weeks to a few months.\nBut the key reason they said the procedure is allowed at all is that verses in the Quran \u2013 the Islamic holy book \u2013 indicate that a fetus is not a \u201clife\u201d until the soul is breathed into it; that does not happen at conception, but at some later time.\nAbortion rights advocates hold cardboard cutouts of Supreme Court justices [File: Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo]\nJonathan C Brown, a professor of Islamic civilisation at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, said, \u201cThe process of a life being created extends from 40 days to 120 days, when ensoulment occurs.\u201d\n\u201cSome schools of law at various times have been more restrictive, saying that, regardless of when it happens, abortion is not allowed except in necessity (if the mother\u2019s life is endangered),\u201d Brown told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe second approach goes off the later date of ensoulment and is much more flexible for anything before 120 days.\u201d\nMore conservative scholars of Islamic law said that after 120 days, abortion is prohibited, except in a case where the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Abortion after 120 days, some Muslim community members say, amounts to \u201cmurder\u201d. The Texas and Mississippi laws, the conservative scholars have argued, are not far from what scholars with the most expansive interpretations would have allowed.\nIn early December 2021, seven Muslim American organisations, including HEART, published a letter arguing that Muslims must oppose the abortion ban. Some Muslims disagreed with their position, including Ihsan Bagby, associate professor in the department of Islamic Studies at the University of Kentucky. Speaking at a webinar also in December, Bagby argued that Muslims should not be publicly behind either side of the argument.\n\u201cThe Islamic view is in the middle, and we should stick to it. We don\u2019t need to be cheering on the \u2018women have a right to their body\u2019, as if it\u2019s an absolute right, and we don\u2019t need to be on the right of the pro-life people, because their intentions are to make abortions illegal across the board in all situations,\u201d Bagby said.\nBagby cited a non-written consensus made by the Fiqh Council of North America, an association of Islamic scholars, that abortion should be allowed up to 120 days, basing it on an authentic hadith about when ensoulment occurs. \u201cBefore that it\u2019s a life, after that, it becomes a human and killing it is the same or approximate to the killing of a human. I don\u2019t think we should give that up,\u201d Bagby said.\n\nReligious freedom\nThe imminent threat to Roe v Wade has elicited concern from many religious communities, including some Muslims who fear the decision will affect 26 states that have abortion bans ready to go. Muslims live in all of these states, and a few in particular \u2013 Michigan, Texas, Florida and Ohio \u2013 have very large Muslim populations.\n\u201cThis will not only impact Muslim women\u2019s reproductive rights but the rights of all Muslims who have reproductive lives \u2013 all Muslims with uteruses,\u201d said Sahar Pirzada, West Coast programming and advocacy manager at HEART. \u201cThis decision [could restrict] the religious freedom of Muslims given that Islam makes space for reproductive choice,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\nA majority of Americans \u2013 54 percent \u2013 believe that abortion should be legal, according to estimates from a 2018 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. While the anti-abortion rights perspective on abortion has been predominant in US public debate, the same poll showed that only 45 percent of all Christians think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.\nAdherents of other faiths also show similar, if not more robust, support for abortion rights; 70 percent of Jews, 69 percent of Buddhists, and 62 percent of Hindus support a woman\u2019s right to abortion, for example. According to the same 2018 poll, a majority of Muslims, 51 percent, said they supported legal access to abortion in all or most cases.\nPeople attend the March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington, DC, January 21, 2022 [Susan Walsh/AP Photo]\nBut the Texas and Mississippi laws were motivated by a particular Christian view that forbids all abortion, said Asifa Quraishi-Landes, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specialises in comparative Islamic and US constitutional law.\n\u201cI, and many women of religious minorities who don\u2019t happen to agree with the restrictive Christian view that life begins at conception, are concerned that the Christian Right is trying to use the legislative power of democracy to impose their view of abortion on everyone else,\u201d she told Al Jazeera in an email.\nQuraishi-Landes also stressed that the rules of Islamic jurisprudence are not the only thing to consider in a Sharia worldview. There is also what is known as siyasa \u2013 the law of the ruler or state \u2013 which is based not on scriptural interpretation, but rather on \u201cmaslaha amma\u201d \u2013 the public good.\n\u201cA state law banning abortion does not serve the general public good because it could cause serious harm to a lot of people (e.g. women dying from botched self-abortions),\u201d she said. \u201cMuslims should not support it. To do so would be to support the legislation of one\u2019s individual religious views on others, and I believe that Muslim history shows that Muslims are better than that.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
