But some health care advocates in the remote community worry that a plan to have Adventist Health, affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, lease the hospital and other medical services in town might impact the availability of abortion services.

The letters noted that the state constitution requires public hospitals to offer abortions if they offer other pregnancy-related care.\nLate last year, district CEO Wayne Allen granted a doctor at its North Coast Family Health Center permission to start providing medication abortions, which involve two drugs that can end a pregnancy.\nBut Hofberg and others worry that the community\u2019s newly won abortion access could be in peril. With a net loss of $1.2 million in the 2018 fiscal year alone, the district says its only shot at survival is to lease its operations to Adventist Health, a Roseville, California-based system affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which opposes most abortions.\nDawn Hofberg, a physician assistant in Fort Bragg, California, turned to other local health care providers and the American Civil Liberties Union to help persuade the local hospital to make abortions available to some patients in her community.(Courtesy of Dawn Hofberg)\n\nVoters will decide whether to approve the 30-year lease agreement on March 3.\nAdventist officials said that despite their religious teachings that abortions should be limited to cases of life- or health-threatening pregnancies, rape, incest or severe fetal anomalies, they will not restrict the use of medication abortions at the clinic.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t control our physician practices in the way some others do and we don\u2019t put constraints around what they can and can\u2019t prescribe,\u201d said Bob Beehler, an Adventist Health mergers and acquisitions executive.\nBeehler said the introduction of abortion-inducing pills had changed the system\u2019s approach to abortions. \u201cOur historical position has been based on the way they used to be done, in a hospital.\u201d\nBut abortion-rights supporters still fear what could be coming.\n\u201cObviously, we do have a lot of concerns about Adventist\u2019s position with respect to restricting abortion access in its facilities, and so we\u2019re going to keep a close eye on the situation,\u201d said Phyllida Burlingame, director of reproductive justice and gender equity for the ACLU of Northern California.\nBurlingame said the deal also raises broader concerns about the spread of religious health systems that restrict care. \u201cNot only are they taking over the private marketplace, but now they\u2019re even spreading into these public spheres,\u201d Burlingame said.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\tEmail Sign-Up\t\t\n\nSubscribe to California Healthline's free Daily Edition.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYour Email Address\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tSign Up\t\n\n\n\nSimilar objections from the ACLU and staff at the University of California-San Francisco last year scuttled a proposed affiliation between UCSF Medical Center and Dignity Health, a Catholic-affiliated system that restricts reproductive and transition-related care for transgender patients.\nThe expansion of religious systems can leave leaders of struggling hospitals with few choices when they seek to affiliate. Of the five systems to which the Mendocino hospital district issued its request for proposals last year, three were faith-based. Two responded, and Adventist was the only one that met the community\u2019s needs, according to the district board\u2019s treasurer, John Redding.\nNationwide, four of the largest 10 health systems and 1 in 6 acute care hospital beds are Catholic-owned or -affiliated. Seventh-day Adventists are Protestant Christian, and Adventist-affiliated systems run 87 hospitals and more than 300 other facilities in the United States, according to the Adventist Health Policy Association.\nAs these systems have grown, rural health care districts across California are struggling with waning patient volume and a lack of leverage to negotiate with insurers, said Sherreta Lane, senior vice president of finance policy at the District Hospital Leadership Forum, a trade association that represents all the state\u2019s district and municipal hospitals. Many of these hospitals have closed or affiliated with private systems.\nWhen the forum launched a decade ago, 45 districts or municipalities ran hospitals; now 35 do, Lane said.\nWhile Catholic-affiliated systems like Dignity have received greater scrutiny for policies that restrict access to abortion, contraception, sterilization and end-of-life care, the impact of Adventist teachings on church-affiliated health systems is less known. In October, the Seventh-day Adventist Church raised concerns among reproductive health care advocates when it approved a statement saying it \u201cconsiders abortion out of harmony with God\u2019s plan for human life.\u201d\nOfficials said at the time that they would develop updated protocols for church-affiliated health care institutions, where, they emphasized, few abortions are performed.\nAdventist Health spokesperson Jill Kinney said in an emailed statement that the hospital system\u2019s usual practice \u201cis not to provide elective abortions, but we respect that patients may wish to have them.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, she added, \u201cclinicians help coordinate referral and transfer to capable facilities without prejudice.\u201d\nIn a response to detailed questions from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra before his office approved the system\u2019s takeover of Delano Regional Medical Center in November, Adventist Health said it bans \u201celective abortions\u201d but allows the procedure \u201cfor fetal distress and other medical reasons.\u201d It added: \u201cMedical abortions are performed in Adventist Health facilities,\u201d without providing details.\nIn 2014, Adventist Health purchased a clinic in Fort Bragg where Dr. Eric Gutnick and his colleagues had provided reproductive health services since the 1970s. Under a contract with Adventist, Gutnick continued to see abortion patients for preoperative care in the clinic and performed surgical abortions at the Mendocino Coast District Hospital, until he retired later that year.\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church\u2019s teachings can influence other issues, too. It has opposed what it calls \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d stating that gender identity \u201cis determined by our biological sex at birth,\u201d and has called homosexuality \u201ca manifestation of the disturbance and brokenness in human inclinations and relations caused by the entrance of sin into the world.\u201d\nArneta Rogers, an attorney for the ACLU of Northern California, voiced concern about these beliefs. \u201cIt\u2019s not about shutting down religious entities; we just don\u2019t want people to be discriminated against,\u201d Rogers said in an interview.\nJason Wells, president of the Adventist Health hospitals in Ukiah and Willits, said the system cherishes diversity and its LGBTQ employees. In its statement to the attorney general, Adventist said some of its physicians provide hormones for transgender patients but none of its facilities offer \u201cgender reconstruction surgery.\u201d\nIn a statement provided by Kinney, Adventist Health said that it \u201cstrives to be free from biases related to gender identity\u201d but that its hospitals \u201care not currently equipped to offer the complex, comprehensive programmatic approach necessary to provide gender reassignment treatments and surgeries.\u201d\nFor many in the Mendocino community, uncertainty over the hospital\u2019s finances has overshadowed concerns about Adventist Health\u2019s religious affiliation as residents prepare for the vote next month. \u201cIf the affiliation doesn\u2019t go through, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll stay in business,\u201d said Karen Arnold, secretary of the district board.\nRedding said lease payments from Adventist would allow the district to afford the estimated $24 million needed to finance upgrades required by the state to protect against catastrophic earthquake damage to its facilities.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how we were going to do this, and now I feel that we\u2019ve secured the future of a hospital here on the coast,\u201d Redding said.\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\nHealth Industry Insight Rural Health \n\nAbortion LGBTQ+ Health Women's Health \n\n\n\n\n\nShare This Story:\nTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailPrint\n\nRepublish This Story\n\n\n\n\nRepublish This Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nCopy And Paste To Republish This Story\n\n\nAbortion-Rights Supporters Fear Loss Of Access If Adventist Saves Hospital \n\n\t\tBy Amy Littlefield \n\n\t\t\tFebruary 13, 2020\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArticle HTML\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAbortion-Rights Supporters Fear Loss Of Access If Adventist Saves Hospital\t\n\t\tBy Amy Littlefield\t\nFor more than two years, physician assistant Dawn Hofberg fought to bring access to abortions back to California\u2019s Mendocino Coast, a picturesque stretch of shoreline about three hours north of San Francisco and 90 minutes from the nearest facility offering abortions.\nHofberg enlisted help from local health care providers and the American Civil Liberties Union, which sent letters to the Mendocino Coast Health Care District that operates the hospital in Fort Bragg and other medical services.
