Pence's speech heralded the Trump Administration's successes and commitment to pro-life issues. [\u00a0DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times\u00a0]By Kirby WilsonTimes staffMargo SnipeFormer Times ReporterPublished Aug. 5, 2020|Updated Aug. 5, 2020CLEARWATER \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence spent Wednesday afternoon in Tampa Bay shoring up a passionate evangelical base that will be critical to Donald Trump\u2019s reelection efforts.During a noon speech, Pence reminded a crowd at a Baptist church in Seminole that Trump is, has been, and will be an anti-abortion president. His opponent, Democrat Joe Biden, would not be, he said.\u201cMake no mistake about it, Joe Biden would appoint activist judges to our courts who would legislate from the bench and trample on our most cherished liberties,\u201d Pence said before a crowd of about one hundred at the Starkey Road Baptist Church.Later, Pence addressed a ballroom crowd of about 200 at the Hilton Clearwater Beach Resort & Spa.\u201cThe American comeback has begun,\u201d  announced Pence after defending the administration\u2019s pandemic response. Pence also expressed confidence in Gov. Ron DeSantis, who, like Trump, has seen his poll numbers dip as the COVID-19 crisis has worsened.Central to Pence\u2019s remarks was support for pro-life policy including calls to end late term abortion and support freedom of religion. He proclaimed Trump to be the most pro-life president in the nation\u2019s history citing Trump\u2019s March for Life address in January of this year. Trump was the first sitting president to address the march in person.Pence\u2019s visit was a part of a multi-state \u201cLife Wins\u201d tour with the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. Pence also toured A Woman\u2019s Place medical clinic in Pinellas Park, which offers medical advice to pregnant women while discouraging them from choosing abortion.Vice President Mike Pence emerges from Air Force Two with his daughter Charlotte Bond moments after arriving at Tampa International Airport on Wednesday Aug. 5, 2020, with plans to visit the Hilton Clearwater Beach Resort & Spa in Clearwater as part of his 'Faith in America' tour. His visit comes just days after President Donald Trump came to Tampa Bay on Friday for a campaign fundraiser. The Trump Campaign says the Vice President will highlight the Trump Administration's \"strong actions to protect the sanctity of life, religious freedom, and the American family.\" [\u00a0DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times\u00a0]Wednesday\u2019s visit folds into a broader effort by Trump\u2019s campaign to appeal to conservative voters in the home stretch of a presidential campaign limited by the pandemic. There are fewer than 90 days until the Nov. 3 election.The \u201cFaith in America\u201d tour kicked off in Wisconsin back in June. Earlier this summer, Pence was slated to bring the tour to Sarasota, but the July 2nd event was canceled as the number of coronavirus cases increased in the Sunshine state at an alarming rateAbortion remains the go-to issue for the Trump campaign\u2019s outreach to conservative voters, even though both Trump and Biden have changed their views on abortion over the years. In 1999, before he was a politician, Trump said he was \u201cvery pro-choice.\u201dUntil Biden\u2019s run for the nation\u2019s highest office this election cycle, the Democrat was a supporter of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion services except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the life of the mother. Biden now said he\u2019d like to see that policy overturned.Since 2017, Trump\u2019s administration has won over the Christian right through its actions, stocking the federal judiciary with conservative judges. Those jurists are more likely to be skeptical of the idea that abortion rights are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution \u2014 the precedent established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.But not all religious groups welcomed Pence. Ahead of his visit, Florida faith leaders held a conference call to criticize Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cAs a pastor that has served the LGBTQ community, it is sickening ... to hear how our faith is hijacked by the current administration,\u201d said Rev. Gina Durbin of King of Peace in St. Petersburg. \u201cAs we hear about the Vice President coming to do a faith in America tour, it is not to promote equality, it is not to promote inclusion, it is a political stance to try to get votes and not pay attention to what\u2019s happening in our country.\u201dThe trip\u2019s backdrop made religion unavoidable, especially at the location of Pence\u2019s first speech: a church. Under IRS code for tax exempt organizations, churches are generally listed as 501c(3), a classification that prohibits them from participating in political campaigns. However, Susan B. Anthony\u2019s List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said Pence spoke at an event hosted by her organization, which is a 501c(4) \u2015 a classification that is legally allowed to participate in such speech.Seminole, where Pence made his first speech, is 87 percent white, according to a 2019 U.S. Census estimate. The vice president\u2019s visit underscored the extent to which the 2020 Trump campaign will lean on the white evangelical vote in key swing states.According to the Pew Research Center, white protestant evangelical Christians, who are by and large fervently anti-abortion, harbor much more favorable views of the president than evangelicals of other racial and ethnic backgrounds.Secret Service work to secure a sanctuary at Starkey Road Baptist Church on Wednesday Aug. 5, 2020, for Vice President Mike Pence who was giving a speech as part of his 'Faith in America' tour. [\u00a0DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times\u00a0]A full 81 percent of white evangelical voters say Trump is fighting for what they believe in, according to the March Pew study.Future Florida House Speaker Chris Sprowls and state Sen. Kelli Stargel, both Republicans, also made brief addresses at Starkey Road Baptist Church. U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, who served with Pence in Congress, joined Pence at the Hilton in Clearwater Beach.Pence paused throughout his speech there as supporters echoed his message chanting \u201cFour more years!\u201d Occasionally, Pence\u2019s remarks drew a standing ovation. \u201cAmerica is a freedom loving nation and this is a nation of faith,\u201d said Pence. He also praised Trump for his calls for \u201claw and order\u201d in response to the racial justice protests across the country.The Biden campaign blasted Pence\u2019s visit in a statement, calling it a \u201cphoto-op.\u201d The campaign statement didn\u2019t mention abortion, emphasizing instead the coronavirus outbreak in the state.\u201cThe state continues to see some of the highest number of cases in the nation right now and that is in large part due to Donald Trump\u2019s failures,\u201d the Biden campaign statement read.But like those who showed up for Trump\u2019s visit last week to the Pelican Golf Club in Belleaire, supporters didn\u2019t seem to question or doubt the administration\u2019s leadership. Vice President Mike Pence acknowledges a crowd who gathered to hear his speech at Starkey Road Baptist Church on Wednesday Aug. 5, 2020, as part of his 'Faith in America' tour. His visit comes just days after President Donald Trump came to Tampa Bay on Friday for a campaign fundraiser. Pence's speech heralded the Trump Administration's successes and commitment to pro-life issues. [\u00a0DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times\u00a0]The streets leading to the Hilton were lined with supporters waving \u201cTrump 2020\u201d flags. And, like last week\u2019s event, supporters didn\u2019t seem to mind the lack of COVID-19 safety precautions. While masks were required for entry into the Hilton, as the event progressed inside the ballroom some attendees removed masks to speak to each other.
