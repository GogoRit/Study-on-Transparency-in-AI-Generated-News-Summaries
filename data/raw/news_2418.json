Kanye West sparked more controversy on Wednesday by tweeting and then deleting a pro-life message shortly after giving an interview in which he voiced his distaste for Planned Parenthood.    The 43-year-old musician, who announced his plans to run for president in 2020 earlier this week, took to Twitter again to share a decidedly pro-life stance with a photo that showed fetuses at the six-month mark of gestation.According to TheBlast, West shared the images from a Google search of the phrase \u201cwhat does a 6 month fetus look like\u201d along with a tweet that read, \u201cThese souls deserve to live.\u201d The outlet reports that the tweet was quickly removed from West\u2019s account. He then replaced it with photos of\u00a0his\u00a0and wife Kim Kardashian's\u00a0four children: North, 7, Saint, 4, Chicago, 2 and Psalm, almost 11 months.\u00a0Each image is accompanied by a heart emoji.  KANYE WEST NO LONGER SUPPORTS TRUMP, SAYS BIDEN NOT 'SPECIAL'  The now-deleted tweet came the same day that West spoke in an interview with Forbes in which he not only discussed his presidential run,\u00a0his opinions on Donald Trump and Joe Biden, but also targeted Planned Parenthood, accusing it of being part of a larger conspiracy backed by White supremacists.  Kanye West tweeted and then deleted a pro-life message. (AP Photo/Michael Wyke,File)  The outlet reported that he believes \u201cPlanned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by White supremacists to do the devil\u2019s work.\u201dWest did not elaborate on his opinions on the matter other than to say:\u00a0\u201cI am pro-life because I\u2019m following the word of the Bible.\u201d  In a statement to TMZ on Wednesday, Nia Martin-Robinson -- the director of Black Leadership and Engagement at Planned Parenthood's national headquarters -- said: \"Black women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available.\"KANYE WEST, KIM KARDASHIAN SLAMMED BY SHARON OSBOURNE FOR FLAUNTING BILLIONAIRE STATUS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC  \"Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantilizing,\" Martin-Robinson continued. \"The real threat to Black communities' safety, health, and lives stems from lack of access to quality, affordable health care, police violence and the criminalization of reproductive health care by anti-abortion opposition.\"    Forbes spoke to West from his ranch near Cody, Wyo., in what the magazine called \u201cfour rambling hours of interviews.\u201d West, who says he\u2019s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, often referred to himself in the third person and claimed he was \u201cone of the most powerful humans\u201d although acknowledged there were \u201ca lot of alien level superpowers.\u201d  Kanye West shared his thoughts on Planned Parenthood in a recent interview with Forbes. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)In the same interview, he made it clear that his tweet over the weekend, in which he declared that he will run for president against both Biden and Trump, was serious. West had previously been vocal about his support of the current president, leading to a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office in 2018. However, he declared to Forbes that his support of the 45th president has ended.He said that, if he won the presidency, he would model his White House on the fictional land in \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get back to Wakanda.\u201d    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHowever, West has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it\u2019s unclear if he has the ability or willingness to collect the signatures required to qualify in others.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
