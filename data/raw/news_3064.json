(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Perry Johnson declined to rule out banning abortions for survivors of sexual assault during an event Wednesday to officially launch his campaign to be the Republican nominee for governor in 2022.\n\u201cI will tell you this: Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. I am pro-life,\u201d Johnson told reporters Wednesday.\nJohnson, who is one of 13 Republicans vying to oust Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, has the same stance on abortion as some of his rivals, including former Detroit Police Chief James Craig and chiropractor Garrett Soldano, who said last month that rape victims who become pregnant must \u201cprotect that DNA and allow it to happen.\u201d\nGOP gov. candidate Garrett Soldano: Rape victims must \u2018protect the DNA\u2019 by giving birth\n\nAsked whether he believes the 2020 presidential election was stolen from former President Donald Trump \u2014 which it wasn\u2019t; President Joe Biden won the Electoral College 306-232 and Michigan by more than 154,000 votes \u2014 Johnson used Trump\u2019s misinformation about the election as justification for why he would support voter ID mandates.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to campaign on quality, because I believe it\u2019s very important that we have voter integrity in every possible way. The very matter of fact that we have to talk about this means we have issues that we need to resolve,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIn this state I\u2019m going to have voter ID \u2013 voter ID will be mandatory. It means that we\u2019re going to make it so that everyone can have a voter ID. I\u2019m not going to do anything to suppress votes; I will go out of my way to make voter ID the easiest thing in the world to possibly achieve.\u201d\nJohnson, a businessman and self-described \u201cquality guru,\u201d announced his campaign the day after Whitmer\u2019s fourth State of the State and aired an ad during the Super Bowl.\nIf elected, Johnson said he would donate his salary, something GOP former Gov. Rick Snyder said, as well. Snyder also dropped a Super Bowl ad to kick off his 2010 gubernatorial campaign and they share the same Republican consultant, John Yob, who was at Wednesday\u2019s event.\n\u201cI have just about anything I can imagine, but I want to give something back,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m running for governor to give something back to the state. Now, I\u2019m not going to take a salary. I will donate that money. I don\u2019t need the money.\u201d\nState Reps. Matt Hall (R-Marshall), Ryan Berman (R-Commerce Twp.) and Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) attended Johnson\u2019s campaign kick-off in Lansing Wednesday but did not speak.\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010, submitted a video question about education to the campaign. Hoekstra also is a former Yob client who ran a Super Bowl ad during his unsuccessful 2012 U.S. Senate bid.\n\u201cIf you take a look at the background, yes, I am calling from the free state of Florida,\u201d Hoekstra said in the video. \u201cAnd I look forward to the day when Michigan again will be a free state and we will have moved out from the heavy hand of government.\u201d\nMichigan has no wide-ranging pandemic restrictions left in place.\nJohnson said during his stump speech that he is \u201cnot going to go and condemn our governor because she shut our state down like everybody else.\u201d\n\u201cI condemn the action because she did not pay attention to science \u2013 the science of statistics,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cWhat we needed to do is to recognize the basic foundation on which this country was founded: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. \u2026 Liberty is important to every American because it\u2019s what separates us from the rest of the world. And by golly, if we\u2019re going to take that liberty away, let\u2019s pay attention to giving it back as soon as we can.\u201d\nJohnson listed a number of complaints he had with Whitmer\u2019s pandemic restrictions, including which businesses were deemed essential and thus allowed to be open.\n\u201cIt was OK to open a liquor store, because that was essential, you could be six feet away,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t have a health studio, even though you could be 26 feet away.\u201d\nJohnson also pointed to the closure of gardening centers in retailers larger than 50,000 square feet, which was misrepresented by many right-wing figures in the early days of the pandemic as a total ban on selling gardening supplies.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Home Depot, right? Home Depot was fine. But, we have to rope off the flowers and plants,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHow are flowers and plants going to kill you? Come on. Do you really think flowers and plants are going to kill you?\u201d\nJohnson brought up an auditor general report that suggested Michigan had underreported COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities by 2,386 people, though the cause for the discrepancy was using different definitions for the data and adding deaths from unlicensed facilities that were not required to report to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\u201cWe have a disease, we know it\u2019s contagious, the most vulnerable part of the population is the elderly. So what decision do we make? We decide that when we have these infected people with COVID in the nursing homes, we\u2019re going to force them back into the nursing homes, thereby infecting all those people,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe auditor general just did a study. And that study said there were an additional 2,400 deaths in our nursing homes. So we actually covered up the deaths.\u201d\nJohnson also brought up Whitmer\u2019s husband, Marc Mallory, asking a small business if being the governor\u2019s husband would move him up the queue to get their dock and boat in the water at their second home back in 2020. That was news story that Trump often pointed to during his presidential campaign, often getting chants of \u201clock her up\u201d \u2014 even after state and federal law enforcement arrested men in an alleged far-right plot to kidnap and possibly kill her over her COVID measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhitmer had described the call as a \u201cfailed attempt at humor.\u201d Michigan did not have restrictions on boating at the time, but had earlier in the pandemic, and Whitmer had encouraged Michigan residents to \u201cthink long and hard\u201d before making trips to second homes during the early months of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to go up north. Couldn\u2019t go to our second home if you had a second home. I don\u2019t have a second home, but they did. They went to their second home,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to travel; it was OK for them to travel.\u201d\nJohnson also pointed to Whitmer violating social distancing orders at the Landshark in East Lansing after she was fully vaccinated and taking a private jet to Florida to visit her father with a severe chronic illness as examples of hypocrisy.\nIn 2018, Whitmer campaigned on a slogan of \u201cfix the damn roads.\u201d\nJohnson told the audience Wednesday that the governor had failed at her main campaign promise and missed an opportunity to address them during the pandemic.\n\u201cWas there ever a better time to fix the roads than when nobody\u2019s on them? There\u2019s nobody there. We aren\u2019t interrupted, we don\u2019t have to worry about stopping, we have no inconvenience,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the most perfect time to fix the roads?\u201d\nJohnson incorrectly said that \u201cshe raised the taxes on your gasoline, so when you go the pump, realize some of that goes to your buddy, Gretchen.\u201d\nWhitmer\u2019s proposal for a 45-cent gas tax increase was shot down by members of both parties in the Legislature in 2019. However, the federal bipartisan infrastructure law signed by Biden last year will mean billions for Michigan to repair roads, bridges and water infrastructure.\nJohnson has loaned at least $2.5 million to his campaign to match Whitmer\u2019s fundraising haul in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nKevin Rinke, one of his opponents in the Republican primary who owns a car dealership, has donated $2 million and has pledged to invest up to $10 million in his campaign. He has only raised $4,938 from supporters.\nSeveral other Republican gubernatorial candidates spent more than they raised in the final quarter of 2021. Craig raised $607,831 and spent $728,733; commentator Tudor Dixon raised $158,115 and spent $227,598; and Soldano raised $251,747 and spent $410,167.\nVoters will select the Republican nominee for governor in Michigan\u2019s primary Aug. 2. The winner will go on to face Whitmer in the general election Nov. 8.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRepublican Perry Johnson launches gov. bid, won\u2019t rule out banning abortion for rape survivors\nby Andrew Roth, Michigan Advance February 24, 2022\nRepublican Perry Johnson launches gov. bid, won\u2019t rule out banning abortion for rape survivors\nby Andrew Roth, Michigan Advance February 24, 2022\n Republican gubernatorial candidate Perry Johnson declined to rule out banning abortions for survivors of sexual assault during an event Wednesday to officially launch his campaign to be the Republican nominee for governor in 2022.\n\u201cI will tell you this: Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.
