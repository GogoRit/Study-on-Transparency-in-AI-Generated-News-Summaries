One staff member has left the organization over the issue, while numerous community members say they\u2019ll no longer engage with the group.A screening of the controversial film \u2018Unplanned,\u2019 organized by Right to Life Thunder Bay, was hosted at the Urban Abbey\u2019s Red River location Sunday evening. The event drew more than\u00a0100 protestors, who held signs and chanted pro-choice slogans outside. A similar number of people gathered inside to watch the film.\u2018Unplanned\u2019 is based on the memoirs of Abby Johnson, a former director at the American women\u2019s health non-profit Planned Parenthood. It tells the story of her journey to become a prominent anti-abortion advocate, using graphic imagery that earned the film an R rating, and painting Planned Parenthood as callous and profit-driven. Health experts have taken issue with the film\u2019s exaggerated portrayals of the procedure.An online furor over the screening at Urban Abbey, which has generated hundreds of posts and comments on Facebook in recent weeks, took the organization\u2019s head of staff Scotland Morrison by surprise. Morrison said\u00a0he was led to believe the screening was a \u201chighly personal\u201d private event, and was not aware it was organized by a formal pro-life group until recently.\u201cI feel like things were misrepresented to me, and I feel a little betrayed and a little upset \u2013 maybe a little isn\u2019t the right word,\u201d he said Sunday evening.Morrison says the Abbey hosts many events organized by outside groups \u2013 sometimes up to 40 per week \u2013 which aren\u2019t always closely vetted. Staff are working on drafting more detailed event policies following the controversy, he says.Morrison is critical of the film and its approach, but says he decided to let the event go ahead largely because he felt obliged to defend the pro-life group from online attacks.\u201cIt got fairly nasty, fairly quickly,\u201d he says of the online reaction, adding he felt the group was being bullied.It\u2019s a decision that has cost the organization one staff member and the support of an untold number of community members.Outside the building on Sunday evening, a number of protestors who had previously attended the Abbey for events or frequented its coffee shop, The Habit, said the organization\u2019s willingness to host the film would keep them away in future.Amy Sellors was one of those protestors. She sees the film as an attack on women\u2019s rights, and believes providing a venue for it crossed a line.\u201cThe Abbey\u2019s allowed to do whatever they choose to do, that\u2019s their right as an organization \u2013 and I\u2019m allowed to spend my money and my time where I want to,\u201d she says. \u201cThe free speech argument has come out a lot. My feeling is when your free speech tramples my human rights and freedoms, that walks a line closer to hate speech than free speech, and I\u2019m not comfortable with that.\u201dInside,\u00a0Rob Freeman, a Right to Life member, said it was important to hear the protestors\u2019 message.\u201cI think both sides need to listen well when the other side is saying, \u2018hey, you\u2019re starting to be hateful,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cHaving friends on the other side is the best way to have a healthy community, and I think the Abbey here does a great job at that. They love bringing people together who agree that our community needs help for the poor, the marginalized, and the disadvantaged, people who are suffering. They come around that central ethos, even though they might disagree on a lot of things.\u201dBut for Freeman, the concerns over the film just reinforced the need for the screening and continued discussion on the issue.\u201cI certainly respect their right to express their views, as much as I believe Canadians have given us the right to express our views,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I think is mostly up for debate right now, what we\u2019re trying to sort out, is what are the limits of that freedom?Sarah DiBiagio, who helped organize the protest, says the Abbey\u2019s role as a social service provider made the issue about more than free speech.\u201cDe-platforming is not the same thing as suppression of speech,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying pro-life people can\u2019t exist, we\u2019re saying there\u2019s no space for them in a community service centre where they can be terrifying women.\u201dFor DiBiagio, the episode raises questions about the Urban Abbey\u2019s commitment to the vulnerable community members is serves, such as the women in its Thrive program, which supports pregnant women and mothers of young children recovering from addiction.\u201cI don\u2019t want them to cancel the screening, I want them to have never considered screening it in the first place,\u201d she says. \u201cThey should have researched this movie and have been accountable to the people who use this space. You have young pregnant women using this space, and you invite a place like Right to Life and their propaganda in here. That\u2019s not fair to the vulnerable sectors you\u2019re supposed to be protecting.\u201dUrban Abbey staff at times came outside to speak\u00a0with protesters,\u00a0offering\u00a0coffee and cookies. Morrison said the Abbey respected their right to protest, and wanted to make them feel welcome.At least one of those joining protestors outside was a long-time Abbey volunteer. He\u2019s been inspired by the organization\u2019s ability to bring people of diverse backgrounds together and support the disenfranchised in Thunder Bay. He believes Abbey leadership made the wrong call in going ahead with the screening of the film, which he called \u201cpropaganda.\u201dHe says he considered disassociating himself from the organization, but ultimately believes the group\u2019s good work \u2013 and the good faith of its leadership \u2013 outweighs one poor decision.\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut because I know so many people in the community, and because I know their intentions and what they\u2019re setting out to do with this organization, I still believe in them as a whole. I think they will grow from this.\u201d\u201cThis has cost the Abbey a lot, and I\u2019m really saddened by that,\u201d Morrison acknowledged. \u201cI naively entered into an agreement hoping for the best and assuming some things, so that\u2019s on me. I feel in a way this entire thing is on me, and if I had just dug a little deeper, I would have been able to discern, \u2018oh, wait a minute, this isn\u2019t what it\u2019s being presented as.\u2019\u201dMorrison says the Urban Abbey avoids taking stances on politicized issues like abortion. Most members share pro-life views, he says, but don\u2019t believe the confrontational approach of \u2018Unplanned\u2019 is the right way to act on them.\u201cThe reason why the Abbey started the Thrive program is we are a little tired of the message, \u2018we don\u2019t want you to do this,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIf we say we actually care about women and children, then let\u2019s start a program that supports women and children, instead of investing in things that simply cause events like this to occur, which I don\u2019t find particularly fruitful.\u201dMorrison says the divisive event will cause the Abbey to be more careful in the future.\u201cWe\u2019ve rarely said no to anything, because we\u2019ve tried to be open to all sides,\u201d he says. \u201cMoving forward, there might be a couple more nos.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:  Ian Kaufman\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\n\n\n0\nShares\n\n\n\n\n\nShare by Email\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\nShare via Text Message\n\n\n\n\n\nGet your local Thunder Bay news briefing \n\nEmail\n\n\nSign Up \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n \n\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nSort \n\n\nOldest\nNewest\n\n\n\nAdd\nShow\n\n\n\n \n\r\n            This story was important to me or our community:\r\n            view results >\n\n\nNot Very\nSlightly\nFairly\nVery\nExtremely\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListings Today\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto\nview all\n\n\n9\nThis Week\n\n\n189\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nview all\n\n\n18\nThis Week\n\n\n37\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nEvents\nview all\n\n\n10\nThis Week\n\n\n38\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nFor  Sale\nview all\n\n\n4\nThis Week\n\n\n10\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements\nview all\n\n\n0\nThis Week\n\n\n0\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated:     Mar 19, 2024 12:33 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsLocal NewsBreaking NewsAround the NorthColumnsCity HallCommunity SubmissionsCity policeOPPLocal SportsLetters to the EditorMonday Morning 'MUG'ingOntario ElectionTBT NewshourTBT News StoriesTBT SportsNorthwest NewsweekCurlingNewsletter SignupSubmit a News TipMoreSpotlightWeatherMonday Morning 'MUG'ingLet's EatPursuitBoldPets & AnimalsWomen and GirlsWisdomInspirePrimeHelpersFollowing UpColumnsEvents CalendarLive Music ListingsYour PhotosVideosObituariesObituariesIn MemoriamClassifiedsPost an AdAll ListingsMy AdsMy AccountToday's AdsYard SalesJob PostingsAnnouncementsLocal FlyersShopLocal Business DirectoryAutosReal EstateAdvertisingFlyersReid\u2019s Furniture FlyersAshley Homestore FlyersLowery's Limited Flyer'sLocal FlyersNational FlyersPower Centre FlyersHome Hardware FlyersHomesOpen HousesFor Sale - HousesFor Sale - WaterfrontFor Rent - ApartmentsFor Rent - HousesFor Sale - CondosAll Listings and BusinessesJobsPost a Job AdAll PostingsBusiness & FinanceGovernment & Public AdministrationInformation TechnologyFoodRestaurantsAuto*Tbnewswatch's Insurance HotlineToday's Gas PricesUsed Vehicle ListingsUsed Dealership DirectoryNew Dealership DirectoryGamesJob Fair\n\n\nAbout\nPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceDownloadsCommunity GuidelinesPolitical Ads RegistrySponsored Content\nSocial Media\n\nFacebook\nX\n\nContact Us\n\nAdvertising\nNews\nSubmit a news tip\n\n\nVisit our network of sites:\n\nNWOnewswatch\nSNnewswatch\nTBnewswatch\nGlobal Thunder Bay\nCKPR Thunder Bay\nRock 94\n91.5 CKPR\nEnergy 103-104\nCFNO\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dougall Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to read breaking stories.\nEnable push notifications on your device.
