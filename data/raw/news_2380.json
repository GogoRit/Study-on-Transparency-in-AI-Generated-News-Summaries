It notes:\n\nLyric Gillett, the president of the group, explained the situation to Washington Times. \u201cAfter providing storyboards and fielding questions about her organization, she said, she was told by the sales division that she would have a response from the legal department by a date in late November.\u201d\nGillett noted that they had begun negotiating with Fox back in July.\n\u201cAfter providing storyboards and fielding questions about her organization, she said, she was told by the sales division that she would have a response from the legal department by a date in late November.\u201d\n\nAnd to be clear, the Super Bowl is not immune to political ads; they are reportedly airing ads from both the Trump and Bloomberg presidential campaigns, and another ad will reportedly feature drag queens.\nIrony of ironies, pro-life and Christian views are going to be represented at the Super Bowl. The winner of the Super Bowl wins the Vince Lombardi trophy, named for pro-family, committed Catholic Vince Lombardi, the long-time coach of the Green Bay Packers. The Kansas City Chiefs are owned by a strongly Christian family, the Hunt family.\n\n\nHad the opportunity to see an early showing of @UnplannedMovie ! Highly recommend this riveting movie. Coming to theaters March 29! #Unplanned \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u201cFor thou didst form my inward parts, thou didst knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb.\u201d\u2013 Psalm 139:13 pic.twitter.com/ELn0HF2t5m\n\u2014 Harrison Butker (@buttkicker7) February 17, 2019\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has publicly stated his Christian beliefs, as have Catholic kicker Harrison Butker and Catholic punter Dustin Colquitt live out their Catholic beliefs. Butker has also tweeted in support of the \u2018Unplanned\u2019 movie and said in an interview with EWTN that his son was with his wife and him for 9 months when he was in the womb.\nFox has made a very poor decision and pro-lifers should consider what they did when deciding what networks to watch.\n\n Post Views: 2,153\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
