These are the same values my parents instilled in me, and they are the same values my wife Chrissy and I are instilling in our four children. I believe one of the most important principles we can pass on to our children is fighting for the right to life, and as I have traveled across the state, standing for the most vulnerable among us is clearly something Tennesseans value too.It is extremely disheartening and alarming to see and hear of so many Washington liberals advocating for policies like late-term abortion as a means of population control. Unfortunately, this radical push for abortion as a health care right has spread beyond the borders of Washington and into states like Virginia - just across our state line, where the Governor there believes in a right to choose infanticide. It\u2019s heartbreaking. We cannot allow this injustice against the unborn to continue. Abortion is not a human right; it takes a human life.President Trump has been a true champion for life from day one of his presidency, and I am proud to have his \u201ccomplete and total\u201d endorsement. In addition to becoming the first sitting president to speak at March for Life, his Administration has nominated and the U.S. Senate has confirmed almost 200 constitutionalist judges, has declared January 22nd National Sanctity of Life Day and is fighting on the international stage to eliminate the concept of abortion as a human right by organizing and leading a coalition of 24 nations. As Tennessee's next U.S. Senator, I will fight alongside President Trump to uphold our conservative way of life and protect the unborn.The right to life is enshrined in our First Amendment, and I believe it is our Constitutional duty to be a voice for the voiceless. That is why in the Senate, I will fight first and foremost to stop the taxpayer funding of abortions across the country, which begins with defunding big abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood once and for all. As it is written in our Fourteenth Amendment, no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d This includes every human life \u2013 even the lives of those who are not yet born.The stakes of the 2020 election could not be higher. My opponent has received the endorsements of NARAL and Planned Parenthood, which performed nearly 350,000 abortions in 2019. As a Christian father of four children, I will always protect the precious gift of life from the radical liberals who seek to destroy it. I am proud that Tennessee is leading the way in standing up for the right to life, with Governor Lee and the leaders of the General Assembly announcing one of the most comprehensive, pro-life legislative packages to date.It\u2019s time for us to send a clear message to Washington that Tennesseans do not support their radical pro-abortion policies. As I seek to represent you, I guarantee to you that I will stand with President Trump to be a strong advocate for the voiceless from day one as I carry our Tennessee conservative principles to the U.S. Senate.Bill Hagerty served as the United States Ambassador to Japan in President Donald Trump\u2019s Administration.
