by the government due to widespread protests over the measure.\n    ADVERTISEMENTNew anti-government protests broke out in Polish cities on Wednesday, shortly after the country's top court confirmed its highly divisive ruling that will further tighten the predominantly Catholic nation\u2019s strict anti-abortion law.The ban on abortions in nearly all circumstances is to come into effect after the law was published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday.Thousands of people gathered outside the court building in Warsaw in the evening, responding to calls for new protests by women\u2019s groups who masterminded weeks of massive demonstrations last year against the initial ruling in October.Protesters later marched through the city centre to the ruling party's headquarters with signs of the leading \u201cWomen\u2019s Strike\u201d group and pro-LGBT rights rainbow flags.Protests were also held in many other cities, under a heavy police presence. More demonstrations are planned for Thursday.Delayed law takes effectThe law, originally passed in October, was subsequently delayed due to widespread protests throughout the country against the measure, which took place amid the coronavirus pandemic and saw clashes between demonstrators and police. No violence was reported at Wednesday's protests.Poland\u2019s ruling conservative government said on Twitter: \"The Constitutional Court presented a written justification of the ruling on the protection of life. In accordance with constitutional requirements, the ruling will be published today in the Official Gazette.\u201dThe Constitutional Court, which was reformed by the religious, conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS), has banned abortions of fetuses with congenital defects. Termination of pregnancy will now be allowed only if the woman's health is threatened or if the pregnancy is the result of a criminal act, such as rape or incest.Critics argue that it narrows the already tight law to a near total ban of abortions.Poland already had some of the strictest abortion laws in the European Union. Even before the ruling, many Polish women sought abortions in neighbouring Germany or the Czech Republic.An estimated 200,000 abortions are performed illegally or abroad every year, according to feminist organisations.Poland abortion protests reflect a deep schism in country's society'We're standing with you': MEPs hit out at Poland over abortion crackdownThe main opposition Civic Platform party condemned the court's move Wednesday as \u201ca provocation\u201d by the ruling party Law and Justice (PiS). It is widely seen as having undue influence on the judiciary following reforms it passed affecting the way judges are appointed.Leader Borys Budka attacked the decision on Twitter, accusing Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of PiS and deputy prime minister, of using the ban to \u201ccover up the traces of the government\u2019s defeat in the fight against COVID\u201d and \u201cthe failure of the vaccination programme\u201d.Another opposition leader, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, tweeted urging the government to \u201csave the economy, don't set Poland ablaze.\u201dNew law fails to deter activistsThe government announcement led to immediate calls for activists to take to the streets in Warsaw and across the country.\"We urge everyone to take to the streets...Express your anger as you see fit,\" Marta Lempart of the Women's Strike, the main movement behind the protests, told reporters on Wednesday.\"The whole of Poland is mobilising, not just Warsaw, we are ready! When we talk about women's hell, we can now talk about government hell,\u201d added Klementyna Suchanow, also from the movement.The new law was made in response to a motion from over 100 ruling party lawmakers, whose names have not been made public.ADVERTISEMENTThe unrest shows growing discontent among many Poles with the right-wing government, which has been criticised by European officials and politicians for eroding democracy.Share this articleComments\n                You might also like\n            \n                                        Protests in Poland, Holocaust Memorial Day, a US tornado and other events of the week in pictures\n                                    \n                                        Polish farmers protest against Ukrainian imports and EU Green Deal\n                                    \n                                        Polish president Andrzej Duda calls on NATO members to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP\n                                    \n                    Poland\n                \n                    Women's rights\n                \n                    Abortion rights\n                ADVERTISEMENTTop stories\n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              Euronews unveils new EU election poll, interviews politicians\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          EU Policy. \n            \n                               Exclusive: Commission eyes Biotech Act to boost bloc\u2019s life science sector\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          EU Policy. \n            \n                              Cybersecurity investment needs to be doubled, EU official says  \n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              German politician takes to TikTok to compete with far-right AfD\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              These European festivities turn satire into a popular celebration\n                          ADVERTISEMENTMost read\n                                      \n                              'Pseudo-election': European leaders condemn Putin's victory\n                          \n                                      \n                              What do you really know about St. Patrick's Day?\n                          \n                                      \n                              \u2018Stinking of tourist\u2019: Why M\u00e1laga locals have had enough of visitors\n                          \n                                      \n                              The EU passed the first AI law.
