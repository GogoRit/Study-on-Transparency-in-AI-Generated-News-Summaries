(AP) \u2014 A Republican-controlled South Dakota House committee declined Wednesday to consider a proposal from Gov. Kristi Noem aimed at banning nearly all abortions, stifling a top item on the governor\u2019s agenda.\nThe Republican governor loudly trumpeted her proposal this year, which would have mimicked the private enforcement of a Texas law and prohibited abortions once medical professionals can detect fetal cardiac activity.\nBut it quickly met resistance when lawmakers on the House State Affairs committee declined to give it a hearing \u2014 a move rarely seen in the Legislature that signaled defiance of the governor.\n\u201cThey showed up late to the game last minute, even last hour type stuff and it didn\u2019t pass,\u201d said House Speaker Spencer Gosch, a Republican. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGosch and other lawmakers on the committee refused to discuss their reasons for rejecting the proposal. However, Gosch earlier Wednesday told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader that while he shared Noem\u2019s goal of outlawing all abortions, he worried that her proposal would have jeopardized the state\u2019s involvement in a separate legal battle with Planned Parenthood, which operates the state\u2019s only clinic that regularly provides abortions.\nNoem has touted support for the proposal from several national groups opposed to abortion access, but in-state groups have remained silent on the bill.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s better if there\u2019s agreement in the pro-life community, and it\u2019s clear we don\u2019t all agree,\u201d Republican Sen. Lee Schoenbeck said of the bill Wednesday.\nNoem unveiled the proposal last month. It would all but outlaw abortions in the state by prohibiting abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around the sixth week and is before some women even know they\u2019re pregnant. It would also leave enforcement up to private citizens through lawsuits instead of through prosecutors and criminal charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House committee\u2019s move gave the governor\u2019s office just hours to find a legislator willing to carry the bill, though it could also be brought before lawmakers later in the session through other maneuvers.\nNoem told reporters she was caught off-guard by the committee\u2019s decision not to hear the bill.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not listening to national leaders in the pro-life movement on the momentum we have in front of the Supreme Court and what this legislation means to South Dakota,\u201d she said, adding that she didn\u2019t believe her proposal \u201ctakes any credibility away from the case in front of the Supreme Court.\u201d\nThe majority-conservative Supreme Court last month refused to speed up the ongoing court case over Texas\u2019 ban on most abortions, declining to order a federal appeals court to return the case to a federal judge who had temporarily blocked the law\u2019s enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if South Dakota were to pass a similar ban, the law would be considered by a separate federal circuit court and give another opportunity for federal judges to weigh in on the law.\nKristin Hayward, the advocacy manager of Planned Parenthood South Dakota Action Fund, said in a statement that the governor\u2019s setback doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is trying to wipe out abortion access in the state.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the political games because the fact remains that Governor Noem is pushing a Texas-style abortion ban and fully supports decimating reproductive rights in our state,\u201d Hayward said.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n \nIdaho needs doctors.
