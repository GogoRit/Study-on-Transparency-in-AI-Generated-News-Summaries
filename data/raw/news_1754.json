rotunda, as the Iowa Legislature convenes for special session to pass a 6-week abortion ban, July 11, 2023. \n\nZach Boyden-Holmes/The Des Moines Register/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Iowa\u2019s state House passed a bill Tuesday night that would ban most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy, acting quickly in the special session ordered by GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state.\n    \n\n            The bill now heads to the Senate, where it must earn approval before it can move to Reynold\u2019s desk for her signature.\n    \n\nSenate File 579 prohibits physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. \n    \n\n            The bill includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant\u2019s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days.\n    \n\n            The state House voted 56-34 largely along party lines to advance the measure following a roughly 12-hour day that saw the measure move through rounds of consideration and debate. Debate in the state Senate continued late into Tuesday night.\n    \n\n            The bill would immediately take effect with Reynolds\u2019 expected signature.\n    \n\n            However, while the bill language makes clear it is \u201cnot to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division,\u201d guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowa\u2019s board of medicine to decide \u2013 leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim.\n    \n\n            \u201cThere may or may not ever be rules promulgated,\u201d said Iowa Senate President Amy Sinclair, a Republican, amid several questions from Democrats on the floor. There were no legal penalties for physicians added in the bill, she said.\n    \n\n            \u201cAs far as clarity, this is about as clear as mud,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Molly Donahue said on the floor.\n    \n\n            Reynolds last week called for Iowa\u2019s legislature to convene for the special session \u201cwith the sole purpose of enacting legislation that addresses abortion and protects unborn lives,\u201d weeks after Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state\u2019s 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the law unconstitutional. \n    \n\n            The new bill and its 2018 predecessor are nearly identical, though the latter was not enacted immediately, granting the board of medicine time to flesh out how it planned to administer the law.\n    \n\n            Democratic backlash to the bill and Reynolds\u2019 special session grew throughout the day, with state House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst saying in a statement, \u201cWomen are not free when they cannot make their own healthcare decisions. And after today, women won\u2019t be free.\u201d\n    \n\n            Iowa\u2019s Senate Democratic Leader Pam Jochum said in a statement that her Republican colleagues were \u201cignoring Iowans in their rush to pass an extreme ban\u201d and that \u201ctheir actions today threaten the health and futures of all Iowa women.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThis extreme Republican power grab infringes on the personal freedom of every Iowa woman and girl. There are women alive today who will not be alive in six months because of this law,\u201d Jochum added. \n    \n\n            Iowa\u2019s position as the first-in-the-nation caucus state for the coming GOP presidential primary has thrust its state politics onto the national stage, with Republican candidates jockeying for the favor of its voters.\n    \n\n            Former Vice President Mike Pence posted his support of the bill on Twitter Tuesday night, writing, \u201cGrateful to see Iowa Republicans and Governor @KimReynoldsIA Standing For Life! Pro-Life Americans are Cheering You On!\u201d\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner, Sydney Kashiwagi and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
