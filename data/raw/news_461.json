It was Kollontai\u2019s visionary leadership that led to Russia being the first country in the world to legalise abortion in 1920.\nAlong with Kollontai\u2019s role we recall the leadership of another visionary: in November 2006, Dr. Dorothy Shaw, the then newly elected-FIGO President, rose to make her inaugural address:\n\n\u2018\u2026The evidence is clear. Restrictive laws on abortion have clearly been shown to increase maternal mortality. The highest abortion rates are in countries with no legal access to abortion and restricted access to contraception\u2026\nIf we look at the evidence, it is clear that unsafe abortion is a problem that affects poor women in countries where abortion may be legal or illegal. How can we prevent these senseless deaths and disabilities? Can we come to a place of understanding, so that we can save women's lives literally and broadly? Women who resort to unsafe abortion are desperate, poor, uneducated, have no access to financial resources, have no power to negotiate in their sexual relationships\u2026 How does blaming women and prosecuting them solve this problem? \u2026\nThe human cost also involves others who are unable to be helped by a healthcare system unnecessarily burdened with very ill women suffering the consequences of preventable unsafe abortion\u2026\u2019\n\nWith those words Dr. Shaw declared that the prevention of maternal mortality due to unsafe abortion was to be one of her key priorities, thus laying the foundation for FIGO\u2019s initiative to address unsafe abortion and its consequences\u00a0which has evolved into FIGO\u2019s Advocating for Safe Abortion project.\n2020: 100th anniversary of the world\u2019s first law that legalised abortion\nThis year, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grip our global community and further exacerbating the inequalities of the most marginalised women and girls, FIGO, in solidarity with the international safe abortion campaign, calls on governments around the world to ensure access to safe abortion for women and girls is guaranteed.\nTelemedicine is a safe and private way to have an abortion in early pregnancy without having to visit a clinic, reduces exposure to stigma and increases access to services for women and girls living in remote communities. The evidence is clear that an in-person meeting is not essential to the provision of safe and effective abortion services, with the World Health Organisation recommending that women can safely self-manage medical abortion in circumstances where they have access to appropriate information and to health services should they need or want them at any stage of the process. FIGO recognises telemedicine as an effective tool that can ensure women and girls have access to safe, non-judgmental abortion services at all times.\nNew data from countries such as England and Wales, where telemedicine for abortion was introduced as a temporary measure during the COVID-19, illustrates that women were successfully able to self-manage their abortion. Further evidence on telemedicine and self-managed abortion also highlights the benefits for task-sharing among health professionals, which places less strain on (already over-stretched) public health systems.\nFIGO advocates that all governments acknowledge that abortion is time-sensitive essential healthcare, respect, protect and fulfil women\u2019s reproductive rights, support women\u2019s autonomy over their own lives, and ensure universal access to safe abortion \u2013 both during COVID-19 and afterwards.\nWomen will always need abortions. Whether they can access them safely and with dignity depends upon every one of us to rise to the challenge to provide them.\nLearn more: OB-GYN member societies advocating on safe abortion\n\u2018Unsafe abortion results in 13 percent of maternal mortality worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of survivors living with long-term complications, including infertility and chronic pain. Of these unsafe abortions, 97 percent take place in South-Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.\u2019\nOn the 28th September 2020 FIGO endorsed Amnesty International\u2019s updated abortion policy which reaffirmed that FIGO regards reproductive choice, including access to safe abortion services, as a basic and non-negotiable tool for ensuring the human rights of every woman, girl and pregnant person, not just in one country or region, but globally.\nOver the coming days we spotlight the work of our OB-GYN member societies in low-middle-income countries, and the activities and innovative approaches they are employing to stand in solidarity with the \u00a0International Safe Abortion Campaign and address stigmatisation of abortion as part of the Advocating for Safe Abortion project. Examples will include:\nHow OB-GYNs are engaging with adolescent DJs in Zambia to provide accurate information and address questions from young people on safe abortion \u2013 starting dialogues where young people are at.\nWe will learn from our OB-GYN colleagues in Cote D\u2019Ivoire and the initiatives they have organised, recognising quality journalism on the theme of safe abortion.\nFrom our OB-GYN colleagues in Benin we will learn of their peoples\u2019 carnival which aims to promote the importance of safe abortion in Benin.\nFrom OB-GYNs in Cameroon we will learn of the collective power of bringing diverse stakeholders together to explore ways to strengthen women/girl-rights-centred safe abortion. Keep visiting our website to find articles about these activities being published in the next days.\nDetails of FIGO\u2019s 28th September activities and resources including\u00a0the recording of our webinar on Telemedicine\u00a0(available in 3 languages) and downloadable\u00a0infographics and other resources\u00a0are available here.\n\u00a0\nFacts and Statistics: Global abortion legal landscape\nAbortion on request (gestational limits vary): 590 million women of reproductive age (36% of women of reproductive age) live in 67 countries were abortion is available on request. The most common gestational limit for countries in this category is 12 weeks.\nTotal abortion ban: 90 million women of reproductive age, (5% of women of reproductive age) live in 26 countries where the law does not permit abortion under any circumstances, including when the woman's life or health is at risk.\nSave a woman\u2019s life: 360 million women of reproductive age (22% of women of reproductive age) live in 39 countries where the law permits an abortion to save the woman\u2019s life.\nWomen\u2019s health: 240 million women\u00a0 of reproductive age (14% of women of reproductive age) live in 56 countries where the law permits an abortion on the basis of health or therapeutic abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nBroad social and economic grounds: 380 million women of reproductive age (23% of women of reproductive age) live in 14 countries where the laws are generally interpreted liberally to permit abortion under a broad range of circumstances. These countries often consider a woman\u2019s actual or reasonably foreseeable environment and her social or economic circumstances in considering the potential impact of pregnancy and childbearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nResources\n\n\nDivisions & Committees\n\n\nOur History\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nOther Information\n\n\nVacancies\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nPrivacy Notice & Cookies\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 FIGO\nWebsite design by Fat Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
