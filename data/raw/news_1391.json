RFRA, a law that passed the Indiana legislature in 2015, prohibits government action that interferes with a person\u2019s religious exercise, unless the government can prove it has a compelling reason for doing so that is the least restrictive alternative available.\u00a0\nAccording to the ACLU of Indiana lawsuit, although some religions believe that human life begins at conception, this is not an opinion shared by all religions or all religious people. \u00a0\nThe plaintiffs represent a wide variety of faiths including, Judaism, Islam, and independent spiritual belief systems. This group represents the larger class of Hoosiers whose religious beliefs are burdened if they are unable to obtain an abortion in situations prohibited by S.E.A. 1. The ACLU of Indiana has filed a request for injunctive relief on behalf of this class. \u00a0\nWithout judicial relief, this law\u00a0will effectively eliminate abortion access in the state on September 15, 2022 for more than 1.5 million people of reproductive age in Indiana.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIndiana\u2019s RFRA law protects religious freedom for all Hoosiers, not just those who practice Christianity,\u201d\u00a0said Ken Falk, ACLU of Indiana Legal Director. \u201cThe ban on abortion will substantially burden the exercise of religion by many Hoosiers who, under the new law, would be prevented from obtaining abortions, in conflict with their sincere religious beliefs.\u201d\u00a0\nThis lawsuit comes on the heels of another lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Indiana, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Lawyering Project, and WilmerHale on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center, which claims the abortion ban violates both the Indiana Constitution\u2019s right to privacy and equal privileges protections. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestore Abortion Access Now\n\n\n \n\nSIGN THE PETITION \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLet's Talk About Abortion, Indiana \nView Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated IssuesReproductive Freedom & Women's Rights\nReligious Liberty\n\n\n\nDocumentspdfSB1_RFRA_complaint.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related content    \n\n\n \nAbortion Access in IndianaJuly 6, 2022\n\n \nIndiana\u2019s Abortion Ban: A Violation of Religious FreedomSeptember 8, 2022\n\n \nCourt Temporarily Blocks Indiana Abortion BanSeptember 22, 2022\n\n \nHealth Care Providers and Pregnancy Resource Center File Suit to...August 30, 2022\n\n \nChaplain Offices Have No Place in Indiana Public SchoolsFebruary 26, 2024\n\n \nStatement Against SB 50, Chaplains in Public Schools Bill February 1, 2024\n\n \nChaplains in Public and Charter SchoolsJanuary 23, 2024\n\n \nMedicaid Coverage for Pregnancy ServicesJanuary 17, 2024\n\n \nPregnancy AccommodationsJanuary 17, 2024\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch aclu-in.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress\nCareers\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on YouTube\nACLU on Instagram\nACLU on Threads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 ACLU of Indiana\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
