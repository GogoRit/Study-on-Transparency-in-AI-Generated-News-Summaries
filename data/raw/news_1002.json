The narrow exceptions included in this extreme ban will undoubtedly put Hoosiers\u2019 lives at risk.\nA block remains in effect as a result of a separate lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Indiana, which claims the law violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). This aims to allow abortion access for Hoosiers who have sincere religious beliefs that they must be able to obtain an abortion. But uncertainties surrounding the ban have already forced providers to stop providing abortions in Indiana.\nWe are continuing to fight in the courts and the Statehouse to reinstate access to abortion care.\u00a0\u00a0Take action and learn more below.\n\n\n\nTAKE ACTION\nTell Indiana politicians to restore our right to make decisions about our own bodies.\nAdd your name to stand with the majority of Hoosiers who want abortion to be legal in our state.\nSIGN THE PETITION\nRESOURCES\nNeed help accessing abortion care?

That very vocal anti-abortion minority has drowned out the views of most Hoosiers.\nSincere conversations with people we trust and love are the best way to change opinions.
