These agencies promote human rights by keeping countless people, especially women and girls, healthy and alive.\nAfter a ham-fisted attempt to \u201creform\u201d the UN Human Rights Council \u2013 a plan more focused on ending UN rebukes of Israeli abuses than improving the UN\u2019s top rights body \u2013 the US withdrew completely in 2018. Amidst criticism of its own bungled response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced plans to exit the World Health Organization (WHO).\nFor years, the Trump administration has aggressively lobbied at the UN and other multilateral forums against any mention of sexual and reproductive health and rights for women and girls. Last year it threatened to veto a UN Security Council resolution on sexual violence in conflict because it mentioned women\u2019s reproductive health services. It has also tried to use the UN to promote its fundamentally flawed Commission on Unalienable Rights, attempting to rewrite internationally accepted human rights obligations and protections.\nBut there are also areas for continuity. Both Presidents Barrack Obama and Donald Trump were right to highlight the Chinese government\u2019s \u00a0nefarious influence at the UN, which has only grown as the US has walked away from UN bodies.\u00a0\nUpon taking office, the Biden administration should promptly restore funding to UNRWA, UNFPA, and the WHO. It should support sexual and reproductive health and rights in all UN negotiations. It should fully participate in the Human Rights Council. At the UN Security Council, it should stop shielding countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and North Korea from criticism over rights abuses. And it should counter China\u2019s anti-rights agenda at the UN through multilateral engagement and coalition-building.\nThe Trump administration, by focusing on the rights abuses of its enemies and ignoring those of allies, further damaged the US\u2019 already shaky credibility. Biden\u2019s victory opens the door to a new U.S. approach. By making human rights a priority in all its UN actions, the new administration might repair some of the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUS Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nUnited Nations \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Biden Should Act to Ensure Rights for All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nUS: President Should Set a Human Rights Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1, 1995\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nHaiti: Security Compromised\n\n\nRecycled Haitian Soldiers On the Police Front Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Biden Should Act to Ensure Rights for All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nUS: President Should Set a Human Rights Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
