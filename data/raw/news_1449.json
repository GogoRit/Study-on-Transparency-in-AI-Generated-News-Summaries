(AP) \u2014 A near-century old abortion ban that fueled one of the largest ballot drives in Michigan history was repealed Wednesday by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, just months after voters enshrined abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution.\u201cToday, we\u2019re going to take action to make sure that our statutes and our laws reflect our values and our constitution,\u201d Whitmer said at a bill signing outside of Detroit. The 1931 abortion ban made it a four-year felony to assist in an abortion. Roe v. Wade had made the law null and void until the landmark decision was overturned in June by the U.S. Supreme Court.Courts blocked the ban from taking effect while a citizen-led initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution received more signatures than any other ballot proposal in state history to put the question before voters. Voters overwhelmingly approved the proposal in last November\u2019s midterms, making the 1931 law unconstitutional and unenforceable.\n\nThe 1931 ban could have been enforced in the future had voters collected enough signatures to once again amend the state constitution and repeal abortion rights. Whitmer\u2019s signature Wednesday eliminated that possibility, erasing the law completely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court prepares to weigh in on recall election question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice confirm a blanket found during search for missing Wisconsin boy belongs to the 3-year-old\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial of former Milwaukee election official charged with illegally requesting ballots begins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow archaic laws to remain on our books under the assumption that they\u2019ll never be used again,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future will hold and we don\u2019t know what plans abortion opponents have.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the Michigan House and Senate \u2014 each with a two-seat Democratic majority \u2014 voted to send a repeal of the abortion ban to the governor. A majority of Republicans opposed the bill, speaking out ahead of the vote on the legality of abortion as a whole.Pohutsky, who sponsored the legislation repealing the law, said at the event Wednesday that \u201cthis is far from the end of the story,\u201d and that the Democratic-controlled Statehouse will continue expanding access to reproductive health care. \n\nWednesday\u2019s signing marked another victory for abortion rights supporters in Michigan, who joined California and Vermont last November in enshrining abortion rights in their state\u2019s constitution. Kentucky, a reliably red state, rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any state constitutional protections for abortion.Voters in Wisconsin elected a Democratic-backed Milwaukee judge Tuesday to the state\u2019s Supreme Court, ensuring liberals will take over majority control of the court with the fate of the state\u2019s abortion ban on the line.\u201cWho would have thought two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, that we would be as Democrats looking to Michigan, Kansas, Wisconsin, Montana and Kentucky to be on the frontline of protecting reproductive freedom for women across this country,\u201d said Laphonza Butler, the president of EMILYs List.Whitmer joined other speakers at the event in Birmingham in calling out Republican-led states for restricting abortion rights, saying laws in Texas and South Carolina were \u201cun-American, anti-free and, frankly, sickening.\u201dFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for a six-week ban in his state, is scheduled to appear in Michigan on Thursday to speak at a Midland County GOP event before heading to southern Michigan to speak at Hillsdale College.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOEY CAPPELLETTI\n\n\n                Cappelletti covers politics and state government for The Associated Press in Michigan.
