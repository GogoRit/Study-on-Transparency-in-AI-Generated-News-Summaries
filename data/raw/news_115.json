It\u00a0passed the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month.The amendment would state that the Iowa Constitution \"shall not be construed to recognize, grant or secure a right to abortion or to require the public funding of abortion.\"The Iowa Senate has already passed an identical version of the amendment on a party-line vote of 32-18, with every Republican in favor and every Democrat opposed. With the conclusion of Tuesday's hearing, House Republicans can schedule the bill for debate whenever they choose.Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, supports\u00a0the amendment, although the governor plays no role in the process of amending the state's constitution.Speakers share personal stories about abortionFrieda Bequeaith, a doula who lives in Des Moines, said\u00a0the amendment is rooted in the idea\u00a0that abortion is shameful. She talked about her own abortion, which she got after becoming\u00a0pregnant after she was sexually assaulted when she was 15 years old.\"I will not let this legislation shame me because I have worked hard to overcome the shame that I felt when I was 15 years old and I am proud of the strength that I have to make the right decision for myself,\" she said.Laura Limmex, who runs an Ankeny-based nonprofit called Restored by Grace, said she was traumatized by the abortion she had when she was 16. Her organization works with other women who have had abortions.\"Today I deeply regret my abortion, and I'm not afraid to share the truth that abortion ends a life and leaves another wounded,\" she said.\u25ba More:What do I need to know about a proposed anti-abortion amendment to Iowa's Constitution?Republican lawmakers advance amendment stating Iowa Constitution doesn't protect abortion rightsIowa Legislature: Here's where key bills stand after first 2020 'funnel' deadlineA number of speakers said making abortion illegal or decreasing access to the procedure would not reduce the number of abortions.\"We know that making abortion illegal or difficult to get doesn\u2019t decrease the number of abortions. It doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t save any unborn children. It just increases the number of unsafe abortions and maternal mortality,\" said Clare Harney, an OB-GYN who works in Davenport.Supporters describe amendment as corrective to Iowa Supreme Court decisionSeveral people who spoke at the hearing said the amendment would not ban abortion. Instead, they said it\u00a0would correct what was judicial overreach by the Iowa Supreme Court.The amendment is a response to a\u00a02018 Iowa Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that found a fundamental right to abortion in the Iowa Constitution. Republicans have criticized the 5-2 decision, which cited the Iowa Constitution's equal protection and due process clauses,\u00a0as \"illegitimate.\"\"This amendment became necessary when a handful of unelected members of Iowa\u2019s supreme court overstepped their constitutionally outlined mandate and chose in essence to create law rather than to interpret it,\" said Kim Laube, the director of life ministries for Lutheran Family Services.\"Amending the Constitution is legally supposed to be approved by we the people. That\u2019s the law. Not by unelected judges. That\u2019s why the pro-life amendment needs to be passed. This is not a Republican versus Democrat issue,\" said Renee Aamodt of Des Moines, who described herself as a feminist who is pro-women and pro-democracy.The amendment, if enacted, would nullify the Iowa Supreme Court\u00a0decision, which currently grants Iowans greater protections to abortion access than the U.S. Constitution. If the amendment were in effect, abortion rights in Iowa would only be protected by federal court decisions.But opponents\u00a0said they feared\u00a0the amendment is part of a Republican effort to ban abortion in Iowa.\"I see what you\u2019re doing. You didn\u2019t get your way the first time so you\u2019re trying to once again usurp the will of the people to make an end run at our rights,\" said Amanda Acton, who described having an abortion when doctors determined her child would have been born without lungs.Constitutional amendments must be approved in two consecutive two-year sessions of the Iowa Legislature and then be voted on\u00a0in a statewide election. That means that if the Iowa House approves the measure this year, lawmakers in both chambers would have to pass it again in 2021 or 2022 before it could be put on the ballot in a statewide vote.The amendment would only take effect if the public were to vote in favor of it.Stephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.
