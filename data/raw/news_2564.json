The phone ships with the same 30W charger as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but supports the new Warp Charge 30T standard for faster charging.\nDespite the relatively large size on paper, the battery life on the OnePlus 7T Pro is fairly underwhelming. It's not terrible, so you're not exactly having anxiety about when this phone is going to die on you during the course of the day. However, you expect a phone this big and heavy to also have a bigger battery and that's one area where the OnePlus 7T Pro disappoints. The battery life is adequate at best but you definitely need to charge the phone by the end of the day.\n\nThe wired charging experience is as great as always. The Warp Charge 30T on the OnePlus 7T Pro makes the phone charge even faster than the OnePlus 7 Pro despite shipping with the same charger and having a slightly larger battery. The phone does get fairly warm while it's charging, despite the company's claims to the contrary but it doesn't get as hot as some of the Qualcomm Quick Charge devices out there.\nThe lack of wireless charging is still a bummer. At a time when competing devices can even wirelessly charge other devices, the complete lack of any kind of wireless charging on the OnePlus 7T Pro sticks out like a sore thumb in this price range. There are rumors that the next generation OnePlus phones will have wireless charging, so let's hope they materialize.\nConclusion\nIt's not often we pick a device and simply choose to run with it as our daily driver for several months. This job affords us some privileges, and one of them is being spoilt for choice when it comes to picking a phone to use as your primary from the several on offer. So then why did some of us choose the OnePlus 7T Pro, and the OnePlus 7 Pro before it?\n\nInitially, it wasn't an easy decision. We have to admit we weren't fans of the massive size and weight of the device, and the camera quality wasn't the greatest at launch. However, we loved the design and performance of the phone, and while we never quite got used to the size or weight, over time, it felt like a fair tradeoff. OnePlus also did what OnePlus often does and released several updates after launch that improved the performance, especially for the camera.\nThere's a lot more we could say about this phone but to avoid the risk of repeating ourselves, we'd stop here. What we'll say in the end is that despite its flaws, it is still one of the best phones on the market, especially when you consider the price. It really makes us look forward to what OnePlus has in store for us this year, as these usually end up being the products we use and recommend the most. If you are on the lookout for a new phone, you'd be wise to wait. But if you want one right now, the OnePlus 7T Pro and the cheaper OnePlus 7T are still some of the best options on the market today.\n\n\n\n\n5. Battery Life, Conclusion\n\n\n1. Introduction2.
