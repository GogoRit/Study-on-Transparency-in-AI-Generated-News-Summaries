In August 2019, her family said she\u00a0rejected a proposal\u00a0to secure her release from prison in return for a video statement denying that she was tortured. During her first court appearance in March 2019, she was charged with promoting women\u2019s rights, calling for the end to the male guardianship system and contacting foreign organisations including the media, other activists and Amnesty International.\nThe Saudi government lifted the ban on women driving\u00a0in Saudi in the summer of 2018 and pledged to \u201crelax\u201d male guardianship laws in July 2019.\nBut all this has coincided with the jailing of the women activists who had championed the campaign. In the world of logical politics, if a demand is addressed positively, then those who called for it ought to be \u201cnormalised\u201d in the eyes of the government (if not recognised as champions). In Saudi, the opposite has happened.\nThe crackdown on female activists by the Saudi government reached its peak when the authorities arrested and\u00a0detained al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef on May 15, 2018. Al-Nafjan and al-Yousef were temporarily released in March 2019 on the condition that they attend future court hearings.\u00a0\nOther leading women\u2019s rights advocates and feminist figures were also arrested. These include\u00a0Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah, who were arrested on July 30, 2018, and remain in jail; Nouf Abdelaziz, who was arrested on June 6, 2018, and remains in jail; Hatoon al-Fassi, who was arrested on June 27, 2018, and granted temporary release in May 2019; Shadan al-Anezi, who was arrested in May 2018, and remains in jail; and Amal al-Harbi, who was arrested in August 2018, and was granted temporary release in May 2019.\nHuman Rights Watch says the\u00a0charges\u00a0against these women are limited to their human rights activities and lack substantiation or evidence. Both it and Amnesty International reported to have acquired\u00a0evidence of ill-treatment, sexual assaults and abuse against some of these activists.\u00a0\nWhile the campaign to end the driving ban for women gained the most international attention, these women activists have been working to bring all of Saudi Arabia\u2019s\u00a0deeply enshrined patterns of discrimination and exclusion to an end.\u00a0\nThey have made tireless efforts to protest against their lack of freedom with grassroots-level mobilising and campaigning against the\u00a0male guardianship system that limits women\u2019s freedom of movement.\nMost of these women have also engaged in contesting a socio-economic regime of law and order that is constructed to prevent women from participating in society and the economy, to fundamentally disempower them to the maximum extent.\nWhile there is a movement of women and men calling for reforms in Saudi Arabia, a large proportion of this movement consists of women activists who are fearlessly spearheading causes like the arbitrary detainment of political prisoners, freedom of expression and participation in public life.\u00a0\nSome have received international recognition for their struggles. Samar Badawi, for instance, was awarded the 2012 International Women of Courage Award by the US Department of State, recognising among other things her role in bringing a lawsuit for women\u2019s suffrage. She remains in prison.\nOn May 21, 2019, PEN America, the non-profit human rights literary organisation, awarded Nouf Abdelaziz, Loujain al-Hathloul, and Eman al-Nafjan the \u201c2019 PEN America/Barbey Freedom to Write Award\u201c.\nActivists\u00a0have been imprisoned arbitrarily, without due process or fair trial. The use of sexual abuse and torture against jailed women is more than just ill-treatment, and should rather be seen as a weapon that is designed to serve as an aggressively chilling warning to other women not to walk the same path.\u00a0\nThis is a particularly effective deterrent because many women activists\u00a0are care providers to children and immediate family members. By separating them from their children and families, the Saudi government is hugely increasing the price paid by women for feminist activism.\nObservers might argue that feminist movements in Saudi Arabia have gained traction and that imprisoning women and treating them so brutally has only led to a heightening of support for their causes\nHowever, it remains highly dangerous to engage in this sort of activism. In societies where civic space is restricted, and where opportunities for organising and engaging peacefully in social action are nonexistent; these activists become vulnerable to isolation because associating with them and their causes carries severe consequences.\u00a0\nIf Saudi Arabia was serious about relaxing its restrictions on the freedom and autonomy\u00a0of women, the safe spaces in public spheres necessary for women to participate in public life and to lead and engage effectively would exist.\u00a0No such spaces exist.\u00a0\n\u201cFemisecution\u201d is a combination of persecution and prosecution of female voices within our societies, because of what they are: independent voices who aim to help women claim their rights and status within a society which is topped by oligarchic and discriminatory classes.\nWomen\u2019s activism in Saudi Arabia is a movement that not only brings hope, but also challenges an outdated \u201csocial contract\u201d that has been proven to be a tool for de-development and exclusion that damages everyone, not just women.\u00a0\nJailed Saudi women activists are the first layer of such a social movement in their country \u2013 to let them fade away in jail, means, among other things, the killing of the movement, and of hope.\u00a0\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.\naj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
