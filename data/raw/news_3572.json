On November 8, 2022, Michigan will vote whether or not to codify the right to an abortion into the Michigan State Constitution.        Shari Maxwell has been a gynecologist for 34 years and she is committed to abortion rights. She is seen here in her office in Dearborn, Michigan, on October 21.  ALI LAPETINA FOR 'LE MONDE'   Shari Maxwell has 34 years of gynecology and obstetrics experience. Listening to her share her memories is like seeing the suffering of the women who pass by her office at Beaumont Hospital in Dearborn, Michigan. \"I think of a young girl being gang raped. I think of poor women in poor health, whose pregnancy will significantly worsen diabetes or heart problems. I think of a woman with a very aggressive cancer. We know that chemo and radiation are harmful to the fetus, should she wait nine months for this urgent care, taking the risk of giving birth to her child and dying? I have to give them the option of abortion. These are difficult decisions. Women cry here. I've had women tell me they would rather pray than have an abortion. It's their choice and nothing else, but at least we discuss it. What happens here is between me and them, and I don't want anyone else in my office but myself and my patients. I don't want any politicians in my office.\"  Those politicians got in though, completely legally and with the blessing of the US Supreme Court, which abolished the federal right to abortion in June. So Dr. Maxwell came out of her office with her stories and her firm voice. The gynecologist had never been an activist before, but she now feels she must defend the still legal but fragile right to abortion in Michigan. \"You know, as a practitioner, when I think of all the things that need to be done in this world, I often say, 'I don't have the time, I'm overwhelmed,' but in this case, I found the time. It's about women. It is about us. It's about what I've dedicated my whole life to. I had to do something. I was devastated when the Supreme Court decision came down. I was sickened by it. I had severe heartburn. How did it come to this?\" A proposal submitted to a vote The \"this\" she referred to could be summed up by the home page of the federal website AbortionFinder.org. \"1. Enter your address. 2. Enter the first day of your last period. 3. Give your age. 4. Click on 'Find an abortion facility.'\"  You get there from the Planned Parenthood site in Wisconsin, where abortion is now banned, or from the Texas site, which says, \"As a result of the US Supreme Court's decision to break with Roe vs. Wade, abortion services are suspended at our centers for now and may be disrupted in other states.\" AbortionFinder.org can send you to the Northeast, to the Great Lakes and the ruins of the industrial age: to Michigan doctors and clinics.

It's allowing Michigan women the freedom to make their choice, and their doctors the freedom to be with them without fear of being sued.\" She's campaigning.
