The proposal comes from a citizen initiative, and it is unclear if the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party will support it, but president Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has said he would sign the law if it reaches his desk.\u201cFor them, this is the best time to pay the debts they have to ultra-conservative groups,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, an opposition MP who was active in the protests four years ago. \u201cWe are really afraid that they will use the fact that citizens of Poland are really focused on their future and health right now, and not on values, sexual education, women rights.\u201dOn Tuesday, dozens of women protested in central Warsaw, in cars and on bicycles, honking horns and displaying posters against the law. Police used megaphones to warn protesters they risked fines for breaking lockdown regulations.View image in fullscreenA woman rides her bicycle in Warsaw during a protest by Polish women\u2019s rights activists. Photograph: Wojtek Radwa\u0144ski/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Polish proposal comes amid global concerns over access to abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Amnesty International called on governments across Europe to ease \u201conerous administrative requirements to access abortion services\u201d, which it said was making safe access difficult.Earlier this month, Marie Stopes International estimated that there could be as many as 3 million additional unintended pregnancies and 2.7 million unsafe abortions in the 37 countries in which it works, as well as 11,000 pregnancy-related deaths.In Poland, abortion is already illegal except in cases of rape, incest, severe foetal abnormalities or in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk. In 2016, a citizen\u2019s bill aimed to outlaw even these types of abortion, leading to huge protests in towns and cities across the country. The government backed away from its support.The bill was re-submitted in a less severe form in 2018, seeking to outlaw abortions in the case of foetal abnormalities. It has since been stalled in parliament but is now due for mandatory review, with discussions expected on Wednesday and Thursday. Some have suggested that this is merely a formality, and they are not expecting the government to push the law through quickly. Others, however, fear the difficulty of protest during the coronavirus pandemic could provide the perfect cover.There have been protests online, and with people hanging flags in their windows. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t have the same impact as a massive protest on the streets,\u201d said Nowacka.In an interview with a Catholic news outlet earlier this month, president Duda said \u201ckilling disabled children is simply murder\u201d and promised he would sign the law if it reached him. Duda is up for re-election next month, a vote the government is controversially insisting will go ahead, despite the restrictions in place due to the pandemic. PiS has courted a conservative, Catholic voter base with rightwing rhetoric against abortion rights, LGBT rights and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d.Natalia Broniarczyk, of the Abortion Dream Team organisation, said that even without the new legislation, the coronavirus pandemic has made life harder for women seeking abortion. The organisation\u2019s helpline has received around 550 calls in the month since lockdown was imposed in Poland, which is twice as much as during a usual month.Many Polish women with pregnancies in the first trimester are able to get around the current legislation by ordering pills online for medical abortion at home. Some women were concerned at whether the postal service would still function to deliver pills, while others were considering abortions due to the unexpected difficult economic situation.\u201cMany people lost their job from one day to the next and they don\u2019t have money even to live. For them, an unwanted pregnancy is the worst scenario,\u201d Broniarczyk said. Some Polish women travel abroad for abortions, something which has also become extremely difficult due to recently imposed travel restrictions.Rights groups have warned the Polish government not to support the new legislation. \u201cThe chaos and anxiety surrounding Covid-19 shouldn\u2019t be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.Explore more on these topicsPolandAbortionCoronavirusEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
