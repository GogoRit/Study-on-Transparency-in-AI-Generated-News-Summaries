Photograph: Jazzmine BeaulieuArt This article is more than 4 years oldAbortion is Normal: the emergency exhibition about reproductive rightsThis article is more than 4 years oldIn an ambitious, multi-disciplinary exhibition, a range of artists from Cindy Sherman to Nan Goldin, are aiming to dismantle stigma and raise fundsLaura FeinsteinMon 13 Jan 2020 11.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Oct 2022 10.12 EDTShareA week into 2020, and the US political discourse on reproductive rights is already at a crossroads. On 6 January, 39 Republican senators signed an amicus brief urging the supreme court to reconsider Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court case that secured the legal right to an abortion. This comes on the heels of a year in which Alabama\u2019s governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law the Human Life Protection Act, stating that doctors who perform abortions can be sentenced to life in prison. On 15 May, the day the law was signed, Jasmine Wahi, co-founder and director of Newark-based arts not-for-profit Project for Empty Space, texted artist, activist and fellow SVA MFA instructor Marilyn Minter. \u201cWe have to do something,\u201d she wrote. Within minutes, Minter responded that she was game.\u2018People were afraid of me\u2019: the artist who turned her breasts into a cinemaRead moreBorn from this exchange is the ambitious, multi-disciplinary Abortion is Normal: An Emergency Art Show, a two-part exhibition co-curated by Wahi and Project for Empty Space co-founder Rebecca Pauline Jampol, in collaboration with Minter, Gina Nanni of Downtown for Democracy, the artist Laurie Simmons and the art historian Sandy Tait. The essayist Lynne Tillman provided a launch statement and the project features marquee names such as Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, Hank Willis Thomas and Catherine Opie, along with the emerging artists Shirin Neshat, Wangechi Mutu, Chloe Wise and dozens of others. The project is a continuation of a show which debuted at Project for Empty Space in 2019 featuring Dominique Duroseau, Yvette Molina, Viva Ruiz, and Christen Clifford, all of whom have pieces in the current exhibition. The title may shock, but Abortion is Normal is meant to create \u201can inclusive and empathetic entry point\u201d into the conversation, dismantling the stigma surrounding abortion, and working as an urgent call to action. The exhibition includes participants of all races and genders; some of whom have had abortions, and others who are soon-to-be or current parents. \u201cIt was important for us to have an intersectional exhibition, that ranged not only in gender demographics,\u201d said Wahi, \u201cbut, because we have people of all gender identities between the two spaces, addressing a variety of reproductive rights issues.\u201dView image in fullscreenMarilyn Minter and Laurie Simmons.

Most attendees at the opening last Thursday learned about Abortion is Normal directly through participating artists or via social media. In the DIY spirit, zine-style foldouts were distributed rather than catalogs, and several luminaries contributed new works specifically created for the show, including Marilyn Minter\u2019s CUNTROL, Jane Kaplowitz\u2019s homage to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jon Kessler\u2019s short video incorporating archival footage from abortion clinic bombings of the 1970s.Proceeds from the show will be split between Planned Parenthood and Downtown for Democracy, a Pac launched in 2003 in response to the US invasion of Iraq. The latter is volunteer run and supports cultural and political shows, as well as other forms of activism including educational efforts and advertising in swing states, voter registration, and youth outreach.Last year, the group launched the Protest Factory, a show and series of events at Jeffrey Deitch in New York meant to kickstart local activism which saw Cecily Brown and Kembra Pfahler leading sign-making classes, readings by Eileen Myles and Luc Sante, and a \u201cT-shirt debut\u201d featuring Richard Hell, Barbara Kruger, and Richard Prince, in collaboration with Supreme.View image in fullscreenMarilyn Minter, Cuntrol, 2020. Photograph: Courtesy of artist\u201cThere are those chipping away at reproductive rights and they never stop,\u201d says Gina Nanni of Downtown for Democracy. \u201cThere is a generation that came up before Roe v Wade that will never forget, but a younger generation that takes certain rights for granted. We want all to be educated, that you can never let go of issues that are important, that being involved in the political process is the only way that we can maintain a society and law that reflects the will of the people.\u201dThe show, which came together in a matter of weeks rather than months or years, reflects this immediacy. Wahi and Jampol continued to vet submissions up until launch. \u201cPeople were really enthusiastic about making this happen, especially at the beginning of an election year,\u201d explains Wahi. \u201cSo, we pulled all hands on deck, with volunteer help picking up work, and with consignment and loans. It was a huge team effort, but it\u2019s something that I hope will change people\u2019s minds about choice.\u201d That several blue chip artists, whose work fetches in the tens of thousands on auction, were willing to donate is truly unique. \u201cLiving in these times, \u2018no\u2019 is not an option,\u201d said the artist Rob Pruitt, who donated a full-scale work. \u201cSo many have worked so hard, and for so long, to safeguard these rights that the thought of this work being undone would be a tragedy. I said yes without thinking twice.\u201dDriving outreach was the team of Minter and Simmons, both longtime activists who frequently collaborate on causes and events. \u201cThere\u2019s very little time when we\u2019re not working on something together, and rarely does a project that\u2019s political come across my visions or hers that we don\u2019t share,\u201d said Simmons, who contributed a 1976 piece from her collection. Both Minter and Simmons remember life before Roe v Wade, which fueled their hands-on approach to the show. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our children and our younger female friends.\u201d Simmons pointed out that the show is not a contribution to one candidate or campaign \u2013 it\u2019s issue driven, and in support of autonomy and empowerment.View image in fullscreenInstallation image works by Elektra KB.

In Christen Clifford\u2019s I Want Your Blood, the artist and her collaborators literally bleed for the cause, creating a menagerie of vials and bottles containing blood meant to act as a totem for the sacredness of the human body. \u201cI found the process very satisfying,\u201d said participant and writer Jillian McManemin, whose donated blood sits in an antique Avon bottle. \u201cLike I was in on a naughty ancient ritual.\u201dThe exhibition comes as part of a wave of art and social projects meant to normalize abortion, including Shout Your Abortion and Abortion Out Loud, and fits into the larger history of using art to power social change. There is a particularly strong thread to past downtown New York provocateurs such as Keith Haring, Gordon Matta Clark and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who used their generous creative spirit to shape and change prevalent attitudes.If you\u2019re unable to attend the second installment of the exhibition, Keith Corso, chief development officer of PPNY, offers a few words on participation. \u201cVote!\u201d he urges. \u201cGet your friends out to vote. Make sure everyone votes. It\u2019s going to be a very important year for all of us to stand up. Reproductive health rights are hanging in the balance!\u201d\nAbortion is Normal: Part One will be showing at Eva Presenhuber, New York until 18 January and Part Two will be showing at Arsenal Contemporary, New York from 21 January until 1 February\nExplore more on these topicsArtAbortionHealthWomenCindy ShermanNan GoldinWomen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
