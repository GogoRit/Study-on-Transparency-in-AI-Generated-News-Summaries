(AP) \u2014 Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed a Republican-priority measure on Friday that would ban abortions in Kentucky after 15 weeks of pregnancy and regulate the dispensing of abortion pills.\nThe governor raised doubts about the constitutionality of the bill and criticized it for not including exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.\nState lawmakers will have a chance to override the veto when they reconvene next week for the final two days of this year\u2019s 60-day legislative session. The abortion measure won overwhelming support in the GOP-dominated legislature. A state Republican Party spokesman called the veto the latest example of the governor\u2019s \u201cideological war\u201d on conservative values.\nThe proposal reflects the latest attempt by Kentucky lawmakers to put more restrictions and conditions on abortion since the GOP took complete control of the legislature after the 2016 election.\nWATCH: Brooks and Capehart on Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s confirmation, restrictive new abortion laws\nThe proposed 15-week ban is modeled after a Mississippi law under review by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that could dramatically limit abortion rights. By taking the preemptive action, the bill\u2019s supporters say that Kentucky\u2019s stricter ban would be in place if the Mississippi law is upheld.\nKentucky law currently bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\nBeshear on Friday condemned the bill for failing to exclude pregnancies caused by rape or incest.\n\u201cRape and incest are violent crimes,\u201d the governor said in his veto message. \u201cVictims of these crimes should have options, not be further scarred through a process that exposes them to more harm from their rapists or that treats them like offenders themselves.\u201d\nThe governor said the bill would make it harder for girls under 18 to end a pregnancy without notifying both parents. As an example, he said that a girl impregnated by her father would have to notify him of her intent to get an abortion.\nBeshear, a former state attorney general, also said the bill is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d noting that similar laws elsewhere were struck down by the Supreme Court. He pointed to provisions in the Kentucky bill requiring doctors performing nonsurgical procedures to maintain hospital admitting privileges in \u201cgeographical proximity\u201d to where the procedures are performed.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has ruled such requirements unconstitutional as it makes it impossible for women, including a child who is a victim of rape or incest, to obtain a procedure in certain areas of the state,\u201d the governor said.\nWATCH: Oklahoma Legislature bans most abortions following a national trend\nOpponents of the Kentucky bill say its restrictions are so onerous that no abortion clinic could comply.\nThe state Republican Party sharply criticized Beshear for the veto. It will likely surface as an issue again next year when the governor runs for a second term in Republican-trending Kentucky.\nOn Friday, state GOP spokesperson Sean Southard said the governor\u2019s veto was \u201cthe latest action in his ideological war on the conservative values held by Kentuckians.\u201d\nAbortion rights supporters defended the governor\u2019s action. Jackie McGranahan, policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, said the bill aims to \u201cshame and ostracize patients\u201d and \u201cpush a safe and effective method of abortion care out of reach.\u201d\nAnother key part of the bill would set regulations for the dispensing of abortion pills. It would require women to be examined in person by a doctor before receiving the medication.\nThat part of the bill is part of a nationwide push by anti-abortion groups to limit the ability of physicians to prescribe abortion pills by telemedicine, and comes in response to the increased use of pills rather than surgery to terminate early pregnancies.\nAbout half of all abortions performed in Kentucky are the result of medication procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Kentucky\u2019s Democratic Governor Andy Beshear speaks to the crowd gathered during his public swearing-in ceremony in Frankfort, Kentucky, U.S. December 10, 2019.
