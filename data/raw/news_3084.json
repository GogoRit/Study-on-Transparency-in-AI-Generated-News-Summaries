She is currently an MPH student at Harvard University.Much attention has been focused on Texas\u2019 newly passed \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d and Mississippi\u2019s case in the US Supreme court. However, Georgia\u2019s own law, HB 481, also effectively banning abortion with the detection of fetal cardiac activity and introduced in 2019, continues to dance its way through courts.If the law is given consideration again, an important question arises. Is the bill our best method of reducing abortions?If the goal is to decrease abortions, we need to start with decreasing unwanted pregnancies. A heartbeat bill is inefficient in doing so. More effective methods, such as prevention, have not been given due consideration in Georgia but should be prioritized.Texas gives us a good case study. The New York Times Daily podcast recently highlighted the impact on Texan women after the law, focusing on their steps to find abortion clinics. They interviewed two high-school educated women. I was struck by information the interviewers glossed over. Both women (and their partners) were sexually active, not using any birth control, and admittedly did not think of pregnancy at the first missed period.More on abortion issues:Rally for women's rights also draws pro-life advocates to downtown AugustaDid their school sex education fail them so miserably? A better option was preventing pregnancy in the first place. They still had to pay thousands of dollars they didn\u2019t have for a procedure with medical risks. In a better world, they would not have felt the need for an abortion.In public health, we see the benefit of prioritizing prevention and not relying on curative measures. If we imagine for a moment that skin cancer is only caused by sun exposure, we could make a comparison. We have the option to cure the skin cancer, but it takes thousands of dollars with some risk of complications. Some might advocate for abstaining completely from sun exposure. However, if there were options to use an easily inserted device good for 3-10 years, or a shot every three months\u00a0or even a pill taken daily to prevent 99.9% of skin cancer even while enjoying the sun, why wouldn\u2019t we initiate a full-court press on prevention? Why would we continue to fight whether staying out of the sun or having a procedure is a better option?To decrease unwanted pregnancies, we must act preventatively, but Georgia has barriers. Georgia allows each county school system to choose their sex education curriculum, and over a third elect abstinence-centered curriculum, including Richmond County. While abstinence is effective, a curriculum emphasizing it as the only option is not. Per the CDC, in Georgia, we have a teen birthrate of 19.7 per 1000 females, the 14th highest in the nation.In 2020, 31,248 abortions were performed in Georgia, increasing over the last 3 years. Studies show\u00a0that comprehensive sex education, that teaches about birth control methods and birth control access, decreases unwanted pregnancies. In 2020, GPB news reported a comprehensive sex education program, FLASH, is being tested in Macon-Bibb counties. FLASH was developed in King County, Washington, by the public health department and used for over two decades, where the teen pregnancy rate decreased 62% in the last decade.The landscape of birth control has changed drastically in the last 60 years, but it has had little effect on the political conversation of abortion and prevention, especially in Georgia. We have allowed a politically charged issue distract us from supporting effective pregnancy prevention.Both Pro-Life and Pro-Choice camps would be hard-pressed to disagree that their goal is to decrease unwanted pregnancies. With this goal in mind, we could employ more creative solutions that integrate societal support systems, such as public health departments, schools, places of worship\u00a0and independent education groups. We can also begin to tackle the issue of birth control access.Comprehensive sex education will not prevent every pregnancy. Community and family support are important for youth in encouraging responsible sexual behavior and preventing sexual assault. Georgia has work to do here, as well.Pro-Life Georgia, to see abortions decrease, prioritize prevention. Valuing life starts with our current Georgians who need better education to make informed choices.Pro-Choice Georgia, valuing women\u2019s freedom starts with comprehensive sex education in schools. An abortion is a choice a couple shouldn\u2019t feel compelled to make if they have more choices in the first place.We have a common goal: decrease unwanted pregnancies. Let\u2019s have a better conversation.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Place a Legal NoticeSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper NIE ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.augustachronicle.com.
