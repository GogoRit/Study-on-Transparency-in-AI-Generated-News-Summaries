Abortion providers are suing the state to block old statutes criminalizing the procedure, in the hopes of resuming abortions in Texas for a while longer.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Kaylee Greenlee Beal for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nTexas abortion providers are making a last-ditch effort to temporarily resume procedures by challenging a pre-Roe v. Wade abortion ban that has not been enforced for nearly a half-century, but that some abortion opponents argue could be enforced after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion.\nThe providers filed a lawsuit on Monday, and a Harris County judge will hear arguments on Tuesday for implementing a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the old ban, which criminalized both performing abortions and assisting anyone who performs abortions in Texas.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, some Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists have argued that old state statutes banning abortion may have instantly gone back into effect following the Supreme Court\u2019s announcement that it would overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas abortion clinics stopped all procedures, and abortion funds ceased operating in the state after the Supreme Court ruled Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that affirmed abortions as a constitutional right for nearly five decades. Some doctors had to halt procedures moments before they were set to perform them because of concerns that old state abortion laws that had been blocked by Roe could now once again be criminally enforced.\n\u201cWe will fight to maintain access for as long as we can,\u201d Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights \u2014 one of the plaintiffs challenging pre-Roe restrictions \u2014 said in a statement. \u201cEvery day, every hour that abortion remains legal in Texas is a chance for more people to get the care they need. The clinics we represent want to help as many patients as they can, down to the last minute.\u201d\nLast year, Texas passed a \u201ctrigger law\u201d to ban abortions if the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade. The law will go into effect 30 days after the court issues a judgment repealing Roe.\nThough the court issued its opinion signaling its intention to overturn Roe on Friday, it\u2019s unclear when the formal judgment will come. Paxton said the judgment could take a month. He said his office will announce the effective date for the trigger law as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, laws predating Roe v. Wade in Texas that ban abortion are still on the books \u2014 leading some to argue they\u2019re valid again and that there\u2019s no need to wait for the trigger law to seek criminal penalties for performing abortions in the state. Paxton noted this on Friday, saying \u201csome prosecutors may choose to immediately pursue criminal prosecutions.\u201d\nBut a 2004 case in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that by passing abortion laws \u2014 such as regulations on the availability of abortions for minors and the practices of abortion clinics \u2014 the Texas Legislature repealed its old bans and replaced them with regulations that implied those statutes were no longer in effect. And because the Supreme Court has yet to issue its formal judgment, it\u2019s unclear whether the pre-Roe statutes can be enforced until that happens.\nLawyers for anti-abortion groups argued that the 2004 case, McCorvey v. Hill, was wrongly decided.\n\u201cThe final interpreter and the ultimate authoritative interpreter of state law is a state court, not some federal court, not even the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Paul Linton, special counsel for Texas Alliance for Life. \u201cState prosecutors are not bound by that [2004] decision.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas District & County Attorneys Association on Friday wrote in an interim legislative update that the legal ambiguity could make prosecuting abortion cases difficult.\n\u201cHow these existing laws interact \u2026 is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d the association\u2019s update read, \u201cbecause the new \u2018trigger law\u2019 did not amend or repeal these existing crimes.\u201d\nThe pre-Roe laws include more detailed provisions than Texas\u2019 trigger ban, including the potential to charge anyone who \u201cfurnishes the means\u201d for someone to obtain an abortion. The threat of criminal charges has been enough to chill both abortion procedures as well as funding for Texans to travel and obtain abortions outside the state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for anyone to take on the threat of criminal prosecution in order to test these theories because the harm inflicted by the criminal justice system is immediate,\u201d said Elizabeth Myers, an attorney who represents abortion funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome abortion providers have already said they will resume procedures if a court gives them the protection to do so before Texas\u2019 trigger ban takes effect.\n\u201cIf these laws are blocked, I plan to provide abortions for as long as I legally can,\u201d Dr. Alan Braid, abortion provider and owner of Alamo Women\u2019s Reproductive Services, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. \u201cI started my medical career before Roe v. Wade and never imagined our country would go back to criminalizing doctors and preventing us from helping women.\u201d\nThere are now several state laws passed over various years that ban or severely limit abortion. It\u2019s unclear how these laws may compound or overlap.\nEven before the high court\u2019s decision, the number of abortions in the Lone Star state was halved due to its controversial abortion ban that occurs at about six weeks of gestation. The law was one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive laws in force before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us Sept. 22-24 in person in downtown Austin for The Texas Tribune Festival and experience 100+ conversation events featuring big names you know and others you should from the worlds of politics, public policy, the media and tech \u2014 all curated by The Texas Tribune\u2019s award-winning journalists.
