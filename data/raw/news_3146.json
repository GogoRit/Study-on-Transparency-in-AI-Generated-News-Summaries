Cassidy thanked attendees for their efforts and reiterated his support for life.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is cold outside, but there is a warmth here for mamas and their babies,\u201d\u00a0said Dr. Cassidy.\u00a0\u201cThank you for changing our culture so life is more valued. There will be a child alive in the future because of you.\u201d\nCassidy was welcomed by Benjamin Clapper, Executive Director of the Louisiana Right to Life.\n\u201cWe are excited to have Senator Cassidy at our Louisiana Life March South in Baton Rouge,\u201d said Clapper. \u201cSenator Cassidy has a 100% Pro-Life voting record and we appreciate his dedication to standing for life on our behalf in DC.\u201d\n\nDuring the 117th\u00a0United States Congress, Cassidy has aggressively worked to defend the unborn. Last April,\u00a0he\u00a0introduced\u00a0bi-cameral legislation to require Planned Parenthood affiliates to return the $80 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans they illegally applied for and received. He introduced similar\u00a0legislation\u00a0to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving taxpayer dollars altogether.\u00a0\nAdditionally, he proposed the\u00a0Woman\u2019s Right to Know Act, which would provide adequate medical information for informed consent before abortions, and the\u00a0Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would protect unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization.\nCassidy also\u00a0opposed\u00a0the FDA\u2019s approval of allowing chemical abortion pills to be sent by mail, and\u00a0joined\u00a0an amicus brief to support the State of Mississippi in\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Finally, he\u00a0joined\u00a0fellow Senators to support the State of Mississippi in a press conference on December 1, 2021.\n###\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Print\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPrevPrevious Article \n\nNext ArticleNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAbout\nNews\nServices\nContact\nFunding LA\n \n\nAbout\nNews\nServices\nContact\nFunding LA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
