The WorldOctober 5, 2020 \u00b7 3:00 PM EDTBy Fariba NawaSevilay, a mother of two in Istanbul, got permission from her husband to have an abortion as required by law. But she had trouble finding a public hospital that would do it, and even some of her friends criticize her for her decision. She asked that her full name not be used for privacy reasons.\u00d6zge Sebzeci/The World\u00a0When Sevilay, a 38-year-old, stay-at-home mom in Istanbul, learned she was pregnant with a third child, she agonized over what to do.\u201cI became very upset when I learned about my pregnancy. I wondered whether I could do it or not. I was already having a hard time with two kids. There was nobody that could help me.\u201dSevilay, a mother of two in Turkey who had an abortion\u201cI became very upset when I learned about my pregnancy. I wondered whether I could do it or not. I was already having a hard time with two kids. There was nobody that could help me,\u201d said Sevilay, who asked that her full name not be used for privacy reasons.After thinking about it, she made the tough decision to have an abortion, something she needed permission from her husband to do, as is required by law in Turkey. She thought that would be the hardest part.Related:\u00a0In Turkey, a conservative push to remove domestic violence protections is met with an uproarThe greater challenge, though, was finding a hospital willing to perform an abortion. Private hospitals cost too much, up to $500. But public ones kept turning her away.Turkey is one of the few majority-Muslim countries where abortion is legal, but access to them is becoming increasingly limited under the conservative government.\u00a0Abortion has been legal in the country since 1983\u00a0\u2014 and wealthy women from places such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, where the procedure is banned, often turn to Turkish clinics. But it\u2019s still deeply stigmatized in Turkey.\u00a0In the last decade, the ruling conservative AK Party and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have been chipping away at reproductive rights. Police have busted back-alley clinics for low-income women while many public hospitals have stopped providing abortions altogether.In 2012, the government tried to reduce the 10-week pregnancy limit to six weeks, but feminists fought back and won. Erdo\u011fan publicly calls abortion a crime and says women should have at least three children.Sedef Erkmen, who\u00a0authored a book on the subject, told Duvar, a Turkish news site,\u00a0that the \u201canti-abortion practices that have been systematically implemented since 2012 turned into a de facto ban.\u201dRelated:\u00a0Turkey passes \u2018draconian\u2019 social media legislationPublic hospitals can simply refuse women access based on what the president says, not the law. So, low-income women \u2014 in many cases, Syrian refugees \u2014\u00a0turn to back-alley clinics that do the procedure illegally.Last year, news broke that police had raided a clinic fronting as a Syrian hair salon. Three people were arrested.Related:\u00a0Expulsions, pushbacks and extraditions: Turkey\u2019s war on dissent extends to EuropeAn all-too-familiar story\u00a0Sevilay reached out to Mor Cati, a women rights group, which helped her find a public hospital to do the abortion\u00a0for free. But she says that even that hospital\u2019s staff tried to make her feel guilty, and threatened her.\u201cThey said, \u2018If you come to this hospital for another abortion, we won\u2019t let you in,\u2019\u201d she said.She had an abortion at nine weeks, one week before it becomes illegal in Turkey. Sevilay says she felt broken by the emotional toll and harsh treatment. After the abortion, she felt awful.\u201cI felt bad. I woke up crying. To be honest, sometimes my heart aches.\u201dSevilay, a mother of two in Turkey who had an abortion\u201cI felt bad. I woke up crying. To be honest, sometimes my heart aches,\u201d she said.Unfortunately, Sevilay\u2019s story is all too common in Turkey. That\u2019s something that Hazal Atay can attest to. She\u2019s an outreach coordinator at Women on Web, a Dutch-based platform that helps women get access to abortions in restrictive countries.Turkey banned Women on Web's website in 2016. But Turkish women still find ways to contact them. Many are faced with dire circumstances.Related:\u00a0Turkey's\u00a0president formally makes Haghia Sophia a mosqueLike one 22-year-old woman in Erzurum, whose letter Atay shared with The World,\u00a0in English: \u201cI\u2019m sure this situation is difficult for everyone, but if my family learns about the pregnancy, they won\u2019t let me live. I know you help a lot of people, but you don\u2019t know where I live, and you don\u2019t know my family. You are my only hope,\" the woman said in the letter, adding,\u00a0\u201cPlease get back to me as soon as possible. I cannot trust anyone except you. This is a conservative city. Even if I go to the hospital ... they will let my family know about it. Please help.\u201d\u00a0Two other letters sent to them from women in Istanbul reflect the same desperation. One woman says she doesn\u2019t have the money to get an abortion. Another has run away from a violent husband but needs his permission to abort her pregnancy.Sevilay says she is still criticized by some of her women friends for having an abortion. But she says she just wants what is best for her family: \u201cI am trying to set higher standards for my children. I am trying to provide them a good life \u2026 I can give birth to five children and can raise them very well, but I can\u2019t provide them good opportunities.\u201dSign up for our daily newsletterSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Email AddressEmail AddressSubscribeI have read and agree to your Privacy Policy.Related ContentWhy an international court struck down Costa Rica\u2019s IVF banSurrogacy advocates fear pope\u2019s position will create stigmaAs India becomes the world's most populous nation, engaging men in family planning \u2018will be a game changer'Abortion is illegal in Malta.
