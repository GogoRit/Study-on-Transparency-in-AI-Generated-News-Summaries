Horn said she wanted people to know the power of their intercessory prayer and that they were also giving witness to a world where many people are dead inside and need to experience \u201cliving in the fullness of Christ.\u201d\nThe March for Life saw tens of thousands of marchers like Horn descend on Washington from across the country on Jan. 24 to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion and has cost the country about 61 million lives. But marchers also came away invigorated by seeing history made, with the attendance for the first time of a U.S. president, and feminist history reclaimed by the pro-life movement.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for a very simple reason: to defend the right of every child, born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential,\u201d President Donald Trump declared from the podium at the march rally after Lee Greenwood\u2019s iconic song God Bless the USA had concluded. After thanking marchers for their 47 years of faithful witness, Trump told the audience, \u201cToday, as president of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president spoke eloquently about how \u201ctogether, we must protect, cherish and defend the dignity and sanctity of every human life\u201d and how\u00a0\u201cone life changes the world.\u201d\nThe president also referred to his pro-life record in the White House, from the expanded Mexico City Policy\u00a0to the new pro-life rules on Title X taxpayer funding, as well as the number of judges he has appointed, including two Supreme Court justices.\nThe president also contrasted his White House r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the Democratic Party leadership\u2019s \u201cextreme positions\u201d on abortion, both in Congress and in states like New York and Virginia. The president also made clear that he would be enforcing federal laws on religious liberty and free speech, particularly in regards to universities that ban pro-life speech on their campuses.\n\u201cYou stand for life each and every day.\u00a0You provide housing, education, jobs and medical care to the women that you serve.\u00a0You find loving families for children in need of a forever home.\u00a0You host baby showers for expecting moms,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou make \u2014 you just make it your life\u2019s mission to help spread God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBipartisan Participation\nThe president may have been the biggest political figure present, but he was joined by politicians from both Republican and Democratic Parties. Democrats who spoke included Donna Bel Edwards, the first lady of Louisiana, and Louisiana state Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, the author of a bill requiring abortionists to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their practice that faces a challenge at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u201cIn Louisiana, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Democrat or Republican, black or white \u2014 we fight for life,\u201d Jackson said, explaining why the Bayou State is the \u201cNo. 1 pro-life state in the nation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me why I\u2019m a black, female Democrat fighting for life, I tell them \u2018because I\u2019m a Christian first,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I tell them that Proverbs says God hates the shedding of innocent blood, and there\u2019s no blood more innocent than an unborn child.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cWe fight \u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor life!\u201d the crowd shouted in reply.\nJeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, told the Register that the march has invited every sitting U.S. president an opportunity to speak at the March for Life. March for Life founder Nellie Gray even invited President Barack Obama, Mancini said \u2014 but it came as a surprise that President Trump made the decision to come in person.\nAt the same time, Mancini said the March for Life aims to foster unity in the pro-life movement and is inclusive in how it cuts across party, religious and cultural lines.\n\u201cWe were there because of the human-rights abuse of today, abortion,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReclaiming Feminism\nThe March for Life this year had the theme \u201cPro-Life Is Pro-Woman\u201d and made a concerted effort to both highlight the pro-woman nature of the movement and also reclaim the pro-life roots of the American feminist movement contained in the fight for women\u2019s suffrage, which culminated in the adoption of the 19th Amendment in 1920.\nSue Ellen Browder, Catholic author of\u202fSex and the Catholic Feminist, former Cosmopolitan writer and frequent contributor to the Register, spoke at both the March for Life Conference the day before the March for Life and at the Pro-Life Summit held on the following Saturday.\nBrowder told the Register that she was deeply impressed that the message of reclaiming feminism for the pro-life movement had taken hold since she last spoke to activists at the march in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was there last time, I felt I was leading the pack, and, now, I feel like I\u2019m following it,\u201d she said. Browder said she was impressed at how the discussions focused on \u201cthe empowerment of women\u201d in addition to the killing of the baby in the womb. Browder said there is much more emphasis today on how to help women who find themselves in situations where they are contemplating abortion.\n\u201cEveryone knows we\u2019re headed to a post-Roe America,\u201d Browder said. She said the grassroots pro-life voice will be vital when the issue gets \u201cthrown back to the states.\u201d\n\u201cThe intensity of the young people was palpable,\u201d she said of the crowd gathered this year. \u201cThere was a fire there that only comes when you\u2019re 18, 19 and 20.\u201d\nMancini said the march is preparing for a post-Roe world with its regional and state march program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in some capacity to help work with the states,\u201d she said.\nDestiny Herndon-De La Rosa, founder of New Wave Feminists, told the Register that the pro-life movement is pro-woman at its core. However, she believed Trump\u2019s presence at the march could be costly to the movement in the long run.\n\u201cIf we lose the culture by tying ourselves to a man \u2014 ironically, when the theme is \u2018Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman\u2019 \u2014 who has been known for very misogynistic and questionable behavior throughout his life, it kind of makes us look like hypocrites,\u201d she said, though Herndon-De La Rosa stressed the March for Life organizers have been consistent in their invitation to sitting presidents of all political stripes and have tried to diversify the political presence at the main rally. However, she said many people were failing to look at the president critically or understand how others see his behavior.\nHerndon-De La Rosa said transforming the culture is key to the pro-life movement\u2019s effectiveness. She said the main event would benefit from having post-abortive women speak, and the presence of more women of color, so they could share how to address structural issues that are leading women to feel that they need abortion in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can create that world now that supports women so well that abortion is unthinkable because they have everything they need to choose life for their child,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u00a0\nAbortion Survivor Speaks\nThe March for Life also made history with two abortion survivors speaking from the podium, providing a rare opportunity for pro-life marchers to see the faces of the people they are fighting for. Melissa Ohden spoke about how she was a victim of a saline abortion 42 years ago \u2014 just five years after Roe v. Wade. She was followed by Claire Culwell, who survived an abortion while her twin did not.\n\u201cWhen you look at my face, you see my twin. And when you look at my life, you see the almighty hand of God,\u201d Culwell told marchers.\nCulwell told the Register that the vast number of people that came to \u201cliterally march for my life and my twin\u2019s life was very encouraging and inspiring.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople want to stand up for truth,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to support and empower women.\u201d\nCulwell hopes marchers will take her message back to their communities, share the pro-life message, and \u201cdo something to support ministries that are making it possible for women to continue their lives, continue their careers and also be able to experience the gift of motherhood.\u201d\nElizabeth Horn said she\u2019s ready to share that pro-life message and pro-woman witness more than ever, particularly after transferring to Ohio State University later this year, a Big Ten campus where she will encounter other students who need to see a pro-life message in action.\n\u201cMy testimony alone can speak so many volumes to their hearts because they see someone for whom it\u2019s real,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they can see: \u2018There\u2019s a person I respect that\u2019s a woman, a feminist, who believes in the Lord. And I believe that it\u2019s real, and the pro-life movement is needed.\u2019\u201d\nPeter Jesserer Smith is a Register staff reporter.\n\n\n\nKeywords: \nmarch for life\nmarch for life 2020\npeter jesserer smith\nprolife witness\n\n\n\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith Peter Jesserer Smith is a staff reporter for the National Catholic Register.
