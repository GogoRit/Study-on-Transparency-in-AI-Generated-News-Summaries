So are abortion bans. Keep abortion safe and legal,\u201d it states.\nThis accusation is outrageous and the attempted analogy is atrocious. Pro-life people have no desire to control anyone.\nHendrik van der Breggen, PhD, a retired associate professor of philosophy at Providence University College in Manitoba, said the claim is based on a \u201cfaulty analogy\u201d about power. He writes:\nWhereas rape involves power and control over women (and some men), bans on abortion are significantly NOT like rape. Unlike rape, bans on abortion are about stopping the exercise of power and control that harms other human beings (children). So bans on abortion are more like BANS ON RAPE which stop the exercise of power and control that harms other human beings (mostly women).\nThus, the argument fails to justify the conclusion. It commits the fallacy of faulty analogy.\nAbortion violates the most basic human right, the right to life. Abortion cannot be defended. Abortion is ugly, it is violent.\nThe late Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a former abortionist turned pro-life activist,\u00a0described a D&E abortion:\nThe D&E is performed by breaking the bag of water with a pointed instrument thrust through the partly dilated cervix, then inserting grasping and tearing instruments into the womb. The fetus is then quartered, the torso isolated and disemboweled. The head is crushed and extracted in pieces. The placenta is located and scraped off the wall of the womb. This completes the procedure save for the abortionist reassembling all the removed parts on a side table adjoining operating table.\nDr. Anthony Levatino, who himself performed over 1,200 abortions details what happens during an abortion in which suction is used:\n\u201cThe baby has a heartbeat, fingers, toes, arms, and legs, but it\u2019s bones are still weak and fragile. The suction is then turned on, with a force ten to twenty times more powerful than your household vacuum cleaner. The baby is rapidly ton apart by the suction, and squeezed through this tubing down into the suction machine, followed by the placenta. The abortionist uses a curette to scrape the lining of the uterus. A curette is basically a long-handled, curved blade. Once the uterus is empty, the speculum is removed and the abortion is complete.\u201d\nRather than admit or talk about the brutality of abortion, its defenders would rather make false accusations using faulty analogies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nShare: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFacebook\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwitter\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinkedIn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlanned Parenthood Exposed for Selling Aborted Fetal Parts to UC San Diego\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarch 18, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNewsom Launches Series of Pro-Abortion Ads in Red States\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarch 9, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPro-Life Clinics Defend Right to Offer Abortion Pill Reversal Amid State Lawsuit\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFebruary 16, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlanned Parenthood Exposed for Selling Aborted Fetal Parts to UC San Diego\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarch 18, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNewsom Launches Series of Pro-Abortion Ads in Red States\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarch 9, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPro-Life Clinics Defend Right to Offer Abortion Pill Reversal Amid State Lawsuit\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFebruary 16, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe and receive notificationsof new posts & updates!\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up! \n\n\n\nJoin our update list for the latest breaking news and key action alerts! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFollow CFC \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\nPO Box 7937 Fresno, CA 93747866-866-7993info@californiafamily.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2022 \u2022 California Family Council \u2022 PO Box 7937 \u2022 Fresno, CA 93747 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-End Matching Grant! \n\n\n\nDouble your support of CFC\u2019s work to defend Life, Family, & Liberty\u00a0by giving before December 31! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
