Protesters have disrupted church services across Poland in the latest in a series of demonstrations following a near-total ban on abortion, announced last week. \n    \n\n            Sunday marked the fourth day of protests after Poland\u2019s top court ruled on Thursday that abortion due to fetal defects is unconstitutional \u2013 meaning that the only circumstances in which termination is legal are in cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life in danger.\n    \n\n            The ruling sparked furious demonstrations that spilled into the weekend in cities including Warsaw, Lodz, Poznan, Gdansk, Wroclaw and Krakow \u2013 in defiance of a ban on gatherings of more than five people due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrators protest against the tightening of the abortion law at the Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Poznan, Poland, Sunday.\n\nPiotr Nowak/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n            Protesters stormed Poznan Cathedral, in western Poland, at midday on Sunday, shouting abortion rights slogans such as \u201cCatholics need abortions too\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough.\u201d \n    \n\n            Police were called to the scene, mass was abandoned, and around 30 protesters were given citations by police, according to social media and Poland\u2019s national broadcaster. \n    \n\n            Demonstrations also took place in Warsaw, and images emerged on social media showing activists at the altar at the church of Our Lady of Perpetual bearing the slogan: \u201cLet us pray for the right to abortion.\u201d \n

records to denounce 'right' to abortion\n\n\n\n\n            Hundreds of protesters also gathered outside the Presidential Place on Sunday night.\n    \n\n            The ruling by Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal removed one of the few remaining grounds for legal termination in the country, which already had some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe.\n    \n\n            Abortions due to fetal defects comprised approximately 98% of all legal abortions carried out in Poland in 2019, according to data from the Polish Ministry of Health.\n    \n\n            Further protests, including a blockade, are planned around the country on Monday, while a national strike encouraging people to boycott work is scheduled for Wednesday. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of protesters gathered during the fourth day of protests against the Constitutional Court ruling on tightening the abortion law in front of Krakow's Archbishop's Palace Sunday.\n\nOmar Marques/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            On Friday, riot police cracked down on crowds which had gathered near the home of the ruling Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the country\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, who is widely seen as the de facto decision maker in Poland.\n    \n\n            The move to further restrict abortion had been pursued by Poland\u2019s populist government \u2013 who won the Presidential election back in July with a narrow margin of 0.4% of the vote \u2013 for months.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters gathered for a fourth day of protests against the Constitutional Court ruling on tightening the abortion law in front of Krakow's Archbishop's Palace on Sunday.\n\nOmar Marques/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Abortion rights protest leaders have accused the Law and Justice ruling party of pushing the court to tighten abortion restrictions in order to please the party\u2019s base, and the Church. \n    \n\n            Church leaders have denied influencing the change in law: in a statement on Sunday, Archbishop Stanis\u0142aw G\u0105decki said it \u201cis not the Church that constitutes the law in our Homeland and that it is not bishops who make decisions on the compliance or non-compliance of statutes with the Constitution of the Republic of Poland.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cFor her part, however, the Church cannot cease to defend life, nor can she abandon the proclamation that every human being must be protected from conception until natural death,\u201d he added. \n    \n\n   Artur Osinski, Zahid Mahmood, and Sarah Dean contributed reporting.
