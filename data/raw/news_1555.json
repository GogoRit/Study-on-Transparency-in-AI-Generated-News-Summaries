(AP) \u2014 State courts have become hot spots in the national abortion debate, with Utah\u2019s top court and a Kansas judge considering Tuesday whether their state constitutions require them to block or invalidate laws regulating the procedure more than a year after Roe v. Wade was overturned.The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson transformed what was long a debate over the U.S. Constitution, immediately limiting the pathways abortion advocates could take in challenging restrictions from one state to the next.\u201cState courts are incredibly important in this moment when patients are having difficulty accessing abortion because many states have banned it entirely so patients are traveling hundreds or even thousands of miles,\u201d Alice Wang, a Center for Reproductive Rights attorney, told reporters after arguing providers\u2019 case in a courtroom in the Kansas City area.\n\nIn Kansas, the legal battle is over how providers dispense abortion medications, what they must tell patients and a required 24-hour wait for an abortion after information required by the state is provided to the patient. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas is close to banning gender-affirming care for minors as GOP leaders seek the last vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Skillings Jr. scores 25, Cincinnati beats short-handed No. 16 Kansas 72-52 in Big 12 Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas will pay $1 million over the murder of a boy torture victim whose body was fed to pigs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions about those restrictions hinge on the state constitution \u2014 and on the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 decision declaring bodily autonomy a \u201cfundamental\u201d right that protects abortion access. Kansas doesn\u2019t ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge K. Christopher Jayaram was skeptical of parts of those requirements, including provisions in place for years, but did not rule from the bench. He repeatedly questioned an attorney for the anti-abortion Alliance Defending Freedom who was arguing for the state. The new Kansas law, which took effect July 1, requires providers to tell patients a medication abortion can be stopped once it is started with a regimen that major medical groups call unproven and potentially dangerous. While the state is free to regulate an area of medical \u201cuncertainty,\u201d Jayaram told the alliance\u2019s attorney, Denise Harle, that the medical literature he\u2019s read suggests there\u2019s no good, valid study supporting the regimen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about that,\u201d he said.The state and the providers mutually agreed that the new law wouldn\u2019t be enforced at least until Jayaram decides whether to block the law and the other requirements while a trial of the providers\u2019 lawsuit against it goes forward.Harle said those requirements don\u2019t limit bodily autonomy but bolster it by giving patients more information.\u201cIt\u2019s not a right to unregulated abortion,\u201d she said in court.In Utah, the state\u2019s attorneys want the state Supreme Court to overrule a lower court\u2019s decision to put a 2020 state law banning most abortions on hold. They argued the \u201coriginal public meaning\u201d of the state constitution drafted in the Mormon Pioneer era in 1895 didn\u2019t guarantee a right to abortion. \u201cThere is no constitutional text, history or common law tradition that can support it, and yet the state\u2019s law has been under way for one year and 28 days, allowing thousands of abortions to proceed,\u201d said Taylor Meehan, Utah\u2019s outside counsel, echoing an argument Kansas made before the 2019 decision of its highest court. \n\nPlanned Parenthood Association of Utah\u2019s attorney Camila Vega argued that the right to an abortion aligned with the court\u2019s prior rulings on the Utah Constitution, fell under a broadly defined right to bodily autonomy and ensured other protected rights could be equally guaranteed to men and women. In Kansas, providers argued that bans in other states only heighten the harm caused by the state\u2019s restrictions because patients are traveling much farther for care. Outside the courthouse in Salt Lake City, Planned Parenthood of Utah CEO Kathryn Boyd said if the trigger law takes effect, \u201cThousands will be forced to flee their communities for basic health care or carry pregnancies to term against their will.\u201dThe Kansas and Utah cases reflect how the impact of the overturning of Roe remains unsettled 13 months later. Republican-controlled legislatures, including in Utah and Kansas, have since pushed to tighten laws surrounding abortion, prompting fierce court battles from the doctors and clinics providing them.\n\nKansas voters scrambled the national debate last year by decisively rejecting a proposed change in the state constitution sought by GOP lawmakers to say it doesn\u2019t grant a right to abortion. Anti-abortion groups warned that without the change \u2014 and its rebuke of the Kansas Supreme Court \u2014 the state\u2019s existing restrictions could fall.Kentucky also voted to protect abortion rights last year, and Ohio voters on Tuesday rejected a Republican proposal to make it harder to amend the state\u2019s constitution \u2014 which would have hindered efforts to add abortion-rights protections through a November ballot initiative. Utah is one of at least five states in which laws restricting abortion have been put on hold amid litigation. In Utah, the result is that abortion isn\u2019t banned until the 18th week of pregnancy, but lawmakers subsequently passed additional legislation striking licensing provisions for abortion clinics from state code in an effort to phase them out.\n\nIn arguments Tuesday, Utah\u2019s majority-women Supreme Court appeared skeptical of the state\u2019s claims that the lower court abused its power in putting an abortion law on hold last year. The panel probed Utah\u2019s attorneys about arguments that the state\u2019s Planned Parenthood affiliate had not raised \u201cserious issues\u201d enough to merit delaying the law. In the days or weeks ahead, the Utah justices are expected to decide whether to maintain the lower court\u2019s hold on the abortion law or take the matter into their own hands because of the state constitutional questions at stake. ___Metz reported from Salt Lake City, Utah.
