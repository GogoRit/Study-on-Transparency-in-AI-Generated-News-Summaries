Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, presents HB1301 to the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor committee alongside genetic counselor Shannon Barringer and OB-GYN Dr. Luann Racher.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn effort to roll back Arkansas\u2019 near-total ban on abortion failed in the state legislature Tuesday.Lawmakers on the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor committee rejected House Bill 1301, which would allow for abortions in cases of fetal abnormalities incompatible with life.The bill\u2019s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Nicole Clowney of Fayetteville, said it would help minimize the trauma felt by women who, under current Arkansas law, must carry a fetus to term despite any diagnoses during pregnancy.\u201cShe\u2019ll have to go to the grocery store, she\u2019ll have to have strangers rub her belly, ask her how she\u2019s feeling, ask her if the nursery\u2019s done and if she\u2019s chosen a name. She\u2019ll have to endure full-term labor and childbirth, potentially major surgery\u2026 and then, after all of that and without any chance that the outcome could have been any different, she will leave the hospital with no baby,\u201d Clowney said.Clowney said Arkansas\u2019 abortion laws also ban early delivery in these cases, potentially robbing parents of the chance to see and hold their child alive, if only briefly.Cherisse Dean with the conservative advocacy group the Family Council spoke against the bill, saying it doesn\u2019t specifically define which medical conditions would be applicable.\u201cIt does not say what it is and what it is not, and so that leaves it very unclear for a federal judge to interpret this language,\u201d Dean said. \u201cUnborn children should not be aborted because a doctor thinks that they may have a fetal abnormality.\u201dRep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, asked about an experimental procedure which used saline injections as a substitution for amniotic fluid, allowing babies born without kidneys to live long enough to receive a transplant. Shannon Barringer, a genetic counselor with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, said that procedure is not available in Arkansas and has, for the most part, been unsuccessful.\u201cThere may be three or four cases reported, but the studies that came off from the original Johns Hopkins trial are closed because they were not working in the vast majority of cases,\u201d Barringer said. \u201cWe can argue about one or two or three cases, but I know what my medical literature says. And the vast majority of those babies die, hooked up on dialysis, because they can\u2019t get a transplant.\u201dThe bill failed on a voice vote after roughly one-and-a-half hours of testimony. Arkansas\u2019 near-total abortion ban went into effect in the wake of the Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade last June.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nLocal & Regional News\n2023 Arkansas Legislative SessionArkansas AbortionArkansas Healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Breen\n\n\n                \n                    Daniel Breen is News Director of Little Rock Public Radio.\n                \n            \n\n\n                        See stories by Daniel Breen\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom NPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreats, debt and Trump's advances: 'Stormy' doc examines the life of Stormy Daniels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo long, Stumpy.
