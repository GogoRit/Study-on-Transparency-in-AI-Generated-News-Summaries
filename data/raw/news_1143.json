Jackson Women\u2019s Health, a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, long before fetal viability. Experts believe this could be the most important abortion case in decades and could undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade.

Doug Ducey made it illegal for Arizona women to seek an abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 even if they became pregnant because they were raped.\u00a0\nThe legislation, which will go into effect 90 days after the legislative session ends, was modeled after a Mississippi law that the U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering. Under Senate Bill 1164, doctors would be prohibited from performing the procedure, even if the patient was a victim of incest or rape. Doctors in violation face a class 6 felony and revoked license. A class 6 felony comes with fines, probation and possible prison time between months and up to 5 years.\u00a0\n\u201cIn Arizona, we know there is immeasurable value in every life \u2014 including preborn life. I believe it is each state\u2019s responsibility to protect them,\u201d Ducey wrote in a signing letter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters after an event Wednesday afternoon, Ducey noted the new law doesn\u2019t ban all abortions, just those done after 15 weeks. But if a victim finds out about a pregnancy afterward that time, they\u2019re left without recourse. Ducey said few abortions happen after 15 weeks, so that argument didn\u2019t persuade him.\u00a0\n\u201cI think if you would look at the statistics on what is already happening in our country, you\u2019d find that this is a very reasonable policy,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nWhile supporters have championed the measure as in defense of children, opponents argue it actually places undue burden on women.\u00a0\n\u201cBanning abortion will do NOTHING to protect babies, but everything to strip Arizonans of their bodily autonomy & self-determination,\u201d tweeted Rep. Athena Salman, D-Tempe.\u00a0\nThe ban comes in the wake of Republican attacks on abortion access across the country, as conservatives anticipate the federal protections will be torn down by the U.S. Supreme Court later this year. A 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi is being contested in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which observers predict the high court will uphold. Currently, Planned Parenthood v. Casey makes bans earlier than 24 weeks unconstitutional.\u00a0\nBoth the bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen. Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, and Ducey have cited the upcoming Supreme Court case in defending the legislation\u2019s legality. But Democrats in staunch opposition to the measure say its current unconstitutionality opens it up to legal challenges.\n\u201cArizonans won\u2019t stand for this. We\u2019ll see you in court and at the polls,\u201d tweeted Rep. Melody Hernandez, D-Tempe.\u00a0\nCritics say the move is out of step with the opinions of Arizonans and medical professionals.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, which advocates for reproductive freedom, denounced Ducey\u2019s approval and said it ignores the varied medical situations women could face.\u00a0\n\u201cMedical professionals in Arizona are against this ban. Nobody asked for this. But Arizona politicians \u2014 including the governor today \u2014 are willfully ignoring both public opinion and science with the sole goal of stripping constituents of their constitutional rights,\u201d said President Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement.\u00a0\nNARAL Pro Choice America, an abortion rights group, said the bill is incongruent with the actual opinions of Arizonans statewide, citing a survey which found 71% of respondents oppose making abortion illegal, and 90% agree that family planning should be left up to individuals, without government interference.\u00a0\nSecretary of State Katie Hobbs echoed this in a statement her office released shortly after Ducey\u2019s, condemning his action.\u00a0\n\u201cWith Governor Ducey\u2019s signature, our elected leaders have chosen to turn their backs on the overwhelming majority of Arizonans who support the constitutional right to choose. Make no mistake \u2014 stripping away women\u2019s constitutional rights won\u2019t stop women from seeking access to reproductive health care,\u201d Hobbs, who is running as a Democrat to replace Ducey as governor, said. \n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX15-week abortion ban will become Arizona law\nby Gloria Rebecca Gomez, Arizona Mirror March 30, 2022\n15-week abortion ban will become Arizona law\nby Gloria Rebecca Gomez, Arizona Mirror March 30, 2022\n With the stroke of a pen Wednesday, Gov.
