Large crowds also filled the streets in other major cities, including Krakow, Wroclaw, Szczecin and Lodz.\nIn parliament, Poland\u2019s most powerful politician, ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, lashed out at opposition lawmakers, accusing them from the podium of inciting people to protest during the pandemic.\n\u201cYou are destroying Poland, Kaczynski told them. \u201cYou are exposing a lot of people to death, you are criminals.\u201d\nThe nationwide strike and protests come amid a deepening standoff between angry demonstrators and Poland\u2019s deeply conservative government, which pushed for last Thursday\u2019s court ruling and has vowed not to back down.\nREAD MORE: Poland\u2019s leader wants churches defended, condemns protests\n\u201cI am so furious! They have no right to decide about my life, about my personal decisions, about my future,\u201d Julka Wojciechowska, 19, a student protesting in Warsaw, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand young people. They don\u2019t understand the world now, but they are trying to regulate our lives. We will never allow that.\u201d\nDaily protests since Poland\u2019s constitutional court issued its decision have exposed deep divisions in this central European nation of 38 million, long a bastion of conservative Catholicism and now undergoing rapid social transformation.\nRage over the ruling, which would deny legal abortions to women even in cases of fatal birth defects, has been directed at the Roman Catholic Church and ruling party leader Kaczynski.\nKaczynski said in the past that pregnancies involving even fetuses that are badly damaged and have no chance of survival outside the womb should \u201cstill end up in a birth, so that the child can be baptized, buried, have a name.\u201d\nOn Sunday, women entered Polish churches on Sunday to disrupt Masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings.\nKaczynski accused protesters of seeking \u201cto destroy Poland\u201d late Tuesday and called on his party\u2019s supporters to defend churches \u201cat any cost.\u201d\nHe spoke to a camera backed by Polish flags in an announcement that some critics compared to a notorious announcement of martial law in 1981 by communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski to crack down on anti-regime protests.\nSome saw Kaczynski\u2019s words as an incitement to violence. The 71-year-old also holds the job of deputy prime minister in charge of police and security services.\nOn Sunday, members of some far-right groups and soccer fans surrounded churches to defend them, in some cases provoking skirmishes with protesters and police.\nSzymon Holownia, the founder of a new centrist political movement, said that Kaczynski, \u201cin the name of defending the Church wants to set fire to the country and drown it in blood.\u201d\nThe conservative rulers have sought to depict the huge crowds of mostly young people led by women\u2019s rights activists as \u201cfascists.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Women\u2019s groups lead more protests over Poland\u2019s abortion law\n\u201cLeft-wing fascism is destroying Poland,\u201d read a Tuesday headline on state TV, echoing language that U.S. President Donald Trump has also used.\nInterior Minister Mariusz Kaminski on Wednesday vowed \u201cdecisive action\u201d by the police \u201cin the face of further attempts of similar acts of aggression and desecration announced by the leaders and organizers of the protests.\u201d\nHe said 76 people have been detained in connection with the protests at churches, and prosecutors are carrying out proceedings in 101 cases.\nPeople have been taking to the streets in massive numbers even as the coronavirus spreads fast, with a record 18,820 new cases and 236 new deaths over the past day.\nPolish President Andrzej Duda, who is in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, said last week that he supported the court ruling, His daughter Kinga Duda, appointed as an unpaid advisor to her father on social issues, said Wednesday that she could not accept the constitutional court\u2019s ruling.\nKinga Duda said that any woman carrying a fetus that is could die within moments of birth should be allowed to decide what to do since she will be the one \u201cto face the consequences of her decision for the rest of her life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A woman takes part in a protest against the ruling by Poland's Constitutional Tribunal that imposes a near-total ban on abortion in Warsaw, Poland October 28, 2020.
