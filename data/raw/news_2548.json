Opponents of the law say it will put numerous abortion providers out of business, forcing women to go to just a few select clinics.\u201cThere\u2019s a recent poll by Kaiser that found the majority of Americans, 69% support the idea of doctors having admitting privileges if they\u2019re going to be doing abortions. So is this a case where public opinion is out of line with the law or are you guys out of line with public opinion?\u201d asked Dokoupil.\u201c[Abortion] is one of the safest medical procedures there is,\u201d responded Johnson.\u201cYou would call it safe. Some people would call it murder,\u201d Gayle King fired back.AdvertisementJohnson corrected herself to say that \u201csafe\u201d meant only for the woman getting the procedure.\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. There are \u2014 and this was brought up yesterday. There are moral arguments with respect to accessing abortion. But it is the law of the land that a woman seeking an abortion has the right to have access to one,\u201d said Johnson.As noted by Newsbusters, the conversation shifted into safer territory for Johnson after that.AdvertisementAlexis McGill Johnson\u2019s passionate defense of abortion comes as Planned Parenthood has reported record-high profits from the practice.\u201cPlanned Parenthood reported a record-high number of abortions and government funding for 2018-2019, despite encountering a wave of Republican-led measures designed to restrict resources and access to the controversial procedure,\u201d Fox News reported in January.The organization\u2019s\u00a0annual report released in January showed that Planned Parenthood received a whopping $617 million in taxpayer funds for the fiscal year ending in June 2018 \u2014 a full 9% increase from the previous year and representing 37% of its overall organizational funding. Those funds could decline with the next fiscal year, given the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to strip Planned Parenthood with \u201cexecutive-level funding for clinics that refer clients for abortion.\u201dAdvertisementAlexis McGill Johnson said that the organization has been forced out of government-funded programs due to \u201cunethical\u201d gag rules on referring women for abortions.\u201cWe stand at an inflection point for reproductive health and rights,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur opponents moved to dismantle our nation\u2019s program for affordable birth control this year, forcing providers like Planned Parenthood out of the program with an unethical gag rule.\u201dPlanned Parenthood has always maintained that abortion constitutes just 4% of the organization\u2019s services. Pro-life advocates have countered that assertion, arguing that Planned Parenthood manipulates the statistics to conceal its profitability.\u201cLet\u2019s say a woman comes into Planned Parenthood for one service\u2014an abortion,\u201d pro-life Lila Rose argued in a Prager U video. \u201cBefore providing an abortion, Planned Parenthood has to confirm that the woman is pregnant, right? So, they administer another service\u2014a pregnancy test. That\u2019s two services! Then, after the abortion, on your way out the door, they hand you a prescription. That\u2019s three services!\u201dAdvertisementGot a tip worth investigating?Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.
