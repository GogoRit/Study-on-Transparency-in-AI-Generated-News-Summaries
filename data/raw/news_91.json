That is why the Ministry for Women agrees with decriminalizing abortion under three circumstances: when the life of the woman is in danger, when she has been the victim of rape or incest and when the fetus has malformations incompatible with life.\n\u201cPresident Luis Abinader Corona is committed to a government of change, which begins by responding to the problems in a context of institutionality and respect for the rights and health of women, without postponing. There is enough evidence that the absolute criminalization of abortion does not reduce its occurrence, which is why the highest rates are in the countries with more restrictive laws, as is our case\u201d, highlighted Jim\u00e9nez.\nAccording to Public Health figures, each year nearly 25,000 women, adolescents and girls in the Dominican Republic are treated for complications linked to miscarriages or induced abortions, causing between 8% and 13% of maternal deaths.\nConservative sectors \u2013religious entities above all\u2013 firmly oppose decriminalizing abortion and fear the approval of the three exceptions leads to covertly legalize abortions. The country\u2019s criminal code imposes prison sentences of up to two years on women and girls who induce abortions and up to 20 years for medical professionals who provide them.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19\n\nMarch 19, 2024 | 9:24 amFirst Lady presents oncopediatric pavilion  for child and adolescent careSanto Domingo.- First Lady Raquel Arbaje, along with Carlos Bonilla, Minister of Housing and...March 19, 2024 | 8:16 amFirst poison center established in the countrySanto Domingo.- The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) and the Pan American Health Organization...March 18, 2024 | 4:04 pmDominican Embassy in Belgium\u2019s initiative on mental healthBelgium.- As part of the International Women\u2019s Day commemoration activities, the Dominican Embassy in...March 16, 2024 | 11:07 amDominican Republic receives human tissue for children with severe burnsSanto Domingo \u2013 The Dominican Republic managed a donation of 3,600 cm2 of Liolized...March 14, 2024 | 3:14 pmM\u00e9dico Express and Barnaclinic sign interinstitutional agreementSanto Domingo, March 2024.- With the aim of promoting best practices, specialized medical care...March 6, 2024 | 10:39 amDominican Republic leads global mental well-being rankings post-pandemicSanto Domingo.- The Dominican Republic has secured the top position in global rankings for... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST READ\n\n\nLocalJAC denies opening air bridge with Haiti \n\n\nLocalAbinader on Nayib Bukele\u2019s statement: \u2018Hope he is part of the peacekeeping mission in Haiti\u2019 \n\n\nTourismHaiti unrest no impact on Dominican tourism: Collado \n\n\nLocalUnderwater cable linking Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE NEWS\n\n\nLocalThales partners with IDAC for radar installation \n\n\nLocalBoosting tourism: Visit Santiago and Santiago Tur\u00edstico Bureau launch \n\n\nTourismUber drivers stage peaceful protest over payment policies and support concerns \n\n\nBavaro & Punta CanaFirst Lady presents oncopediatric pavilion  for child and adolescent care \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Toda la actualidad de noticias en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOME\nADVERTISING\nCONTACT US\n\n\nPrivacy Policies\nCookies Policy \n\n\n\n\n\nDominicanToday.com - The Dominican Republic News Source in English\nAv.
