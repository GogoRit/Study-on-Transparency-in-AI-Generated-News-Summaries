Wade, its landmark 1973 ruling on abortion.\u00a0This week,\u00a0Beth Allison Barr\u00a0cited the data in\u00a0an opinion\nessay\u00a0for Religion & Politics about how views in the pro-life movement are in contradiction with supporting the lives of mothers who will be at-risk.\nShe writes, \u201cIt is hard to comprehend that if my skin had been a different color, my chances of surviving would have decreased significantly. Regardless of income and education levels, Black women are\u00a0three to four times more\u00a0likely\u00a0than white women to die due to pregnancy complications.\u201d Additionally, in 2018, only\u00a030% of Black mothers\u00a0were both eligible and able to afford unpaid work leave.\nBarr emphasizes that Black Christians, who are just as religiously devout as white evangelicals, are less likely to identify as pro-life. Research from PRRI\u00a0found\u00a0that 75% of Black Protestants support abortion being legal in most or all cases in contrast to only 25% of white evangelical Protestants.\u00a0The\u00a0Rev. Cheryl Sanders, senior pastor of Third Street Church of God in Washington, DC, said she does not want to align with the political pro-life movement, stating that it is \u201cfraught with problematic racial views and exceptions and blind spots.\u201d Barr also cites that\u00a067% of women\u00a0in the United States support legal abortion in most or all cases. She concludes: \u201cInstead of seeing this majority of women as the liberal enemy, shouldn\u2019t the pro-life movement be asking what they have done to alienate them?\u201d\n\nChristian Nationalism on the Rise\nElizabeth Dias\u00a0for The New York Times\u00a0reports\u00a0on the dynamics of Christian nationalism in American politics today, demonstrated by a recent statement from Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Doug Mastriano: that separation of church and state is a \u201cmyth.\u201d Mastriano recently spoke at a far-right conference where he \u201cwove a story about what he saw as the true Christian identity of the nation.\u201d Dias explains that the rapid advance of cultural priorities held by many conservative Christians is now clearly on display, including U.S. Supreme Court decisions on\u00a0abortion,\u00a0school prayer,\u00a0and funding for\u00a0religious education, as well as state laws targeting classroom conversations on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming healthcare for transgender children.\nDias also notes the history of\u00a0Christian nationalism\u00a0in America, including a 1948 presidential nominee from the Christian Nationalist Party, which \u201cadopted an antisemitic, anti-Black platform that called for the deportation of people with whom it disagreed.\u201d\u00a0Former President Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power was largely fueled by his offer to \u201cpreserve the influence of white evangelicals and their values just as many feared that the world as they knew it was rapidly disappearing,\u201d she writes. A PRRI\u00a0survey\u00a0recently found that about 60% of white evangelical Protestants believe that the election was stolen from Mr. Trump, and also that white evangelicals are also the most likely religious group to be believers in\u00a0QAnon.\n\nChildren Caught in the Political Tangle of a Polarized America\nNew York Times opinion contributor\u00a0Margaret Renkl\u00a0writes\u00a0on the spate of laws targeting transgender students and athletes across the country. She leads with the story of two families who were involved in a\u00a0federal civil rights lawsuit\u00a0challenging Tennessee legislation barring transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities; the families\u00a0have since left the\u00a0state,\u00a0resulting in a district judge dismissing the suit. Renkl writes that this serves as \u201cyet another stark reminder that fighting institutional prejudice always comes at a cost,\u201d with\u00a0new laws\u00a0being put in place across many red states.\nRenkl goes on to address the post-Roe\u00a0fallout\u00a0in some Republican-led states: physicians\u00a0afraid to treat life-threatening conditions,\u00a0women\u00a0forced to carry\u00a0babies that will not survive\u00a0outside the womb, and abortion bans with no exceptions for rape or incest,\u00a0even when the victim is a young child.\u00a0She also notes that we \u201cnow have a country in which the citizens of red states don\u2019t have the same rights and civil liberties as the citizens of blue states.\u201d A PRRI\u00a0survey\u00a0found that nearly 79% of Americans \u2014 including 65% of Republicans \u2014 support laws that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\n\n\nGet the Latest From PRRI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning Buzz (Daily)\n\n\nNew Research (Breaking)\n\n\nResearch Roundup (Monthly)\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tweets by @PRRIPoll \nTweets by @prripoll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRRI\n1023 15th Street NW, Floor 9  Washington, DC 20005\n\n\nGeneral Information\ninfo@prri.org\n(202) 238-9424\n\n\nMedia Inquiries\npress@prri.org\n(202) 238-9424\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
