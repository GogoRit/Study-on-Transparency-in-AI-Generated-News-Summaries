Judge Joseph Seidlin held a hearing on the matter on Friday, but said he would take the issue under advisement \u2013 just as Reynolds signed the bill into law about a mile away.Abortion providers said they scrambled last week to fit in as many appointments as possible before the governor put pen to paper, preemptively making hundreds of calls to prepare patients for the uncertainty and keeping clinics open late.Reynolds swiftly put out a statement underscoring her intention to fight the issue all the way to the state supreme court.\u201cThe abortion industry\u2019s attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today,\u201d she said.The ruling Monday does specify that while the law is temporarily paused, the state\u2019s board of medicine should proceed with creating rules for enforcement, as the law specifies. That way the guidance for healthcare providers would be well defined if the law were to be in effect in the future.There are limited circumstances under the law that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality \u201cincompatible with life\u201d; or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman.Seidlin specified that his ruling today hinges on the \u201cundue burden\u201d test, which is an intermediate level of scrutiny that requires laws do not create a significant obstacle to abortion.The state supreme court, in its latest rulings on the issue, said that undue burden remains in effect \u201cwith an invitation to litigate the issue further\u201d, Seidlin wrote. \u201cThis, perhaps, is the litigation that accepts the invitation.\u201dUsing that standard, abortion advocates are likely right to say the new law violates Iowans\u2019 constitutional rights, Seidlin said, which led him to grant the temporary block.Lawyers for the state argued \u2013 and will likely continue to argue \u2013 that the law should be analyzed using rational basis review, the lowest level of scrutiny to judge legal challenges.\u201cWe are deeply relieved that the court granted this relief so essential healthcare in Iowa can continue,\u201d said Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director of the Iowa City-based Emma Goldman Clinic, in a statement. \u201cWe are also acutely aware that the relief is only pending further litigation and the future of abortion in Iowa remains tenuous and threatened.\u201dMost Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected.Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings, as is now the case in Iowa.Explore more on these topicsAbortionIowaRepublicansnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
