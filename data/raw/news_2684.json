And in the past decade of Tom's Guide battery test scores, only once has Apple ever come close to the new MacBook Air's time.So we're here to put a \"correct\" sticker of Apple's claim that the new MacBooks are its longest lasting ever. As our MacBook Air with M1 review shows, it took 14 hours and 41 minutes of web browsing at 150 nits of brightness to drain Apple's most portable laptop \u2014 which beats the previous record-holder, the 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro (14:00). But wait: it gets better.The best laptops to buy nowAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT ray tracing revealed \u2014 and it's impressiveJust in: The worst iPhone 12 accessory exposedNot only was that the previous record-holder, it was also done at a slightly less demanding test: with its display at 100 nits, not 150.\u00a0But about the M1 MacBook Pro. Its battery test score \u2014 an amazing 16:32 \u2014 is one of the best scores on this test I've ever seen, and the longest lasting MacBook ever.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Battery lifeM1 MacBook Air 14:41M1 MacBook Pro16:32Asus ZenBook 1313:47Dell XPS 1311:07Intel MacBook Air 20209:31Intel MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020)10:21How did Apple pull it off? The Apple M1 Chip is a winner at efficiency, as it's a 5-nanometer processor that the company says offers the best performance per watt in a CPU.\u00a0These achievements in endurance make us wonder how the long the larger 16-inch MacBook Pro will last on a single charge, once it's moved to Apple Silicon in the coming years.
