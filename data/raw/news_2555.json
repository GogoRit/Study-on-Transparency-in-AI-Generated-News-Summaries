Russo, the Supreme Court case regarding Louisiana\u2019s 2014 admitting privileges law, has serious ramifications for the future of abortion rights in the United States. But there is a segment of the anti-abortion movement that doesn\u2019t appear all that concerned with the outcome. If this seems odd, it\u2019s because they never saw Roe v. Wade as a valid ruling, they don\u2019t view the Supreme Court as a legitimate legal authority, and they dismiss the foundation of the Constitution. \nSay hello to the so-called \u201cabolitionist\u201d movement, comprised of white men who say the pro-life movement is too secular, abortion constitutes homicide, and that people seeking abortion care should be criminalized and subject to the death penalty. This ideology is largely informed by longtime anti-abortion leaders with ties to militia movements. While this may sound like a fringe group, their movement is gaining steam and political power in abortion battleground states like Oklahoma, Texas, and Indiana\u2014and there is serious cause for concern. Not only do they advocate for bills that would make it possible to subject people to death for having an abortion, but the movement\u2019s leaders are influenced by\u2014and work alongside\u2014men who once signed a\u00a0statement that framed the murder of abortion providers as \u201cjustifiable homicide.\u201d\nWhile abolitionists agree with the pro-life movement on opposing abortion, they see themselves as fundamentally opposed to the majority of that movement. They criticize the pro-life movement for compromising with the Supreme Court and accepting Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Abortion abolitionists advocate for bringing the Gospel of the Kingdom of Jesus and God into \u201cconflict with the culture of death.\u201d They associate all abortion with evil and believe it is incumbent upon them to root it out. Rather than regulate abortion, they want to criminalize it. Rather than compromise with political leaders, they seek to create a moral high ground based on a biblical worldview and have people join their movement.\nAbortion abolitionist groups have increased their organizing efforts under the Trump administration, claiming the federal government is \u201canti-Christian\u201d and that the pro-life movement doesn\u2019t support their cause. It should come as no surprise that while diminishing the authority of the country\u2019s legal institutions, these groups are capitalizing on the latest wave of anti-abortion laws by advocating for the most extreme bills and pushing state legislators to do the same. But sometimes it seems lawmakers need little urging. Republican Rep. Matt Shea of Washington, who engaged in domestic terrorism against the United States, introduced an abolitionist bill in Washington. The bill was delivered to Shea\u2019s office by Jake Eakin, the youngest person in Washington state history to be tried for murder as an adult. Now a born-again Christian, Eakin is the \u201cleader of an extremist, increasingly vocal anti-abortion group targeting women,\u201d according to the Daily Beast. That group? The abortion abolitionists, of course. \nPrism has done the work of combing through the horrifying online materials of the so-called abolitionist movement, including manifestos published online by Free the States, an Oklahoma-based organization that advocates for state sovereignty\u2014the idea that a state should be able to override the federal government\u2014as a way of abolishing abortion. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWhy do they call themselves abolitionists? \nSimply put: They want to abolish abortion because according to their leaders, abortion is \u00a0\u201cmurder from the moment of conception\u201d and abortion care is \u201cchild sacrifice.\u201d This belief is wholly inaccurate, of course. Abolitionists view their anti-abortion ideology as \u201cthe practice of consistent biblical Christianity.\u201d For them, ending abortion is the \u201cquintessential\u00a0Christian issue.\u201d \nPeople in their movement regularly co-opt racial and immigrant justice frameworks, and men in the abolitionist movement purport to believe they are modeling themselves after the anti-slavery abolitionists of the 19th century. Even further, people in this segment of the anti-abortion movement regularly compare abortion to slavery and the Holocaust. For example, the Oklahoma-based abortion abolition organization Free the States argues for state sovereignty as the key to ending the \u201cAmerican abortion Holocaust.\u201d\nThe self-identified \u201cabolitionist\u201d title is also quite literal, in that people in this movement want to get rid of all exceptions for abortion, including rape, incest, or when a pregnant person\u2019s life is in danger. They are calling for the \u201ctotal and immediate\u201d criminalization of abortion, effectively extending the laws against murder to apply to abortion.\nWho are they?\nThe leaders in the current iteration of this movement are men like Russell Hunter, the co-founder of Free the States and his other Oklahoma-based group, Abolish Human Abortion. Hunter has spent years documenting his harassment against pregnant people seeking abortion care. \nThere\u2019s also Jeff Durbin, founder of End Abortion Now, an \u201coutreach ministry\u201d of Durbin\u2019s Apologia Church in Arizona. End Abortion Now trains churches to form an \u201cabortion clinic ministry,\u201d and shares tactics for engaging lawmakers. The primary tactic is the organization\u2019s six-point plan that calls for \u201cministering\u201d before city councils \u201cto instruct magistrates on their duty to preserve innocent life within their jurisdiction,\u201d according to the organization. In other words, they ask local city councils to turn their cities into \u201csanctuaries for the unborn.\u201d \u00a0\nAs the New York Times recently reported, there is a larger \u201csanctuaries for the unborn\u201d movement nationwide, led by so-called pro-life organizations like the Personhood Alliance, which took credit for helping pass the first ever county level \u201csanctuary for the unborn\u201c\u00a0in Yadkin County, North Carolina, last year, and Right to Life, which has been supporting \u201csanctuary for the unborn\u201d resolutions and ordinances in other parts of the country. But these abolitionists view themselves as separate from the pro-life movement, even though there is overlap in their work regarding sanctuaries for the unborn. Generally speaking, abolitionists like Hunter and Durbin think the pro-life movement has failed on eliminating abortion and claim the pro-life movement won\u2019t support their goal to criminalize pregnant people seeking abortion care. \nAccording to Free the States, leaders in their movement decided in 2011 there needed to be a \u201creformation\u201d in the way that Christians fight abortion, which reignited the abolitionist movement in the United States. What the men behind Free the States fail to mention is how their beliefs and ideology are largely shaped by Rusty Thomas and Matthew Trewhella, men who pose a real threat because they believe violence against abortion providers is justified. Thomas is the national director of Operation Save America (OSA), an organization known for the targeted harassment of abortion care providers, including protesting in their neighborhoods and distributing flyers with their photo and home address. In the 1990s, three abortion providers were murdered following an OSA harassment campaign. \nOSA is considered the successor of the anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue. While the splintering of the two organizations is sometimes framed as Operation Rescue\u2019s attempt to distance itself from the violence advocated for by OSA, Operation Rescue is hardly moderate. As Right Wing Watch reported, at one time the second in command of Operation Rescue was a woman who spent time in prison for attempting to bomb an abortion clinic. Operation Rescue\u2019s president, Troy Newman, also once wrote that the United States government has \u201cabrogated its responsibility\u201d to execute abortion providers.\nTrewhella is an early Operation Rescue activist who formed Missionaries to the Preborn in Wisconsin and became a leader in the pro-violence wing of the anti-abortion movement, urging churches to \u201cteach their congregations to fight.\u201d In 1994, Planned Parenthood revealed Trewhella and his anti-abortion associates\u2019 organizing activities, which included distributing manuals on how to set up paramilitary militias. Before the trial of Michael Griffin for the 1993 murder of abortion care provider Dr. David Gunn, Trewhella and 33 others signed the \u201cdefensive action statement\u201d that called the murder of abortion providers \u201cjustifiable homicide.\u201d \nPart of the media arm of Durbin\u2019s ministry, Apologia Studios has regularly given a platform to Thomas, Trewhella, and other members of the extreme anti-abortion movement that sprouted up in the 1990s. Many of these men were also featured speakers during the February Free the States conference in Oklahoma. \nThe overlap of two movements\nAs it turns out, there is significant overlap between the abolitionist wing of the anti-abortion movement and the Patriot movement, a loose organization of extremists in mostly rural areas, comprised of both organized militia members and so-called sovereign citizens, who are united by their deep distrust of the federal government.\nFrederick Clarkson, an expert on the Christian right and a senior research analyst at Political Research Associates, said anti-abortion activists and militias were \u201csometimes literally the same people,\u201d according to his work in the 1990s as a researcher for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where he focused on the violent anti-abortion movement and the rising militia movement. \nAt the time, Clarkson said that many researchers were treating the two movements as separate, but for the militia movement in the 1990s, \u201cpreparing for violence against abortion clinics and providers was a chief aim,\u201d Clarkson said. He reported on this connection in 1998 for the Southern Poverty Law Center. Given the resurgence of what is now the abolitionist movement, which includes the same players from the militia movement in the 1990s, Clarkson is concerned by how little understanding there still seems to be concerning the overlap between the anti-abortion movement and militias. \u00a0\nOne of the prime examples Clarkson points to is minister Paul Hill, who murdered abortion provider Dr. John Britton and his security escort in Pensacola, Florida, in 1994. Prior to the murder, Hill, who received the death penalty, wrote a 13-page memo about how killing abortion providers was acceptable because it was a defense of \u201cthe unborn.\u201d In his memo, he called for the formation of Christian militias to engage in theocratic revolution. Along with Trewhella, Hill signed a statement calling the murder of abortion care providers \u201cjustifiable homicide.\u201d Like Durbin and Hunter, Hill also compared abortion to slavery and the Holocaust.\nThe Patriot movement and the contemporary abortion abolitionists continue to find common ground. Last year, a bill attempting to abolish abortion in Washington state was widely supported by abolitionists. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Matt Shea, who both planned and participated in domestic terrorism against the United States when, beginning in 2015, Shea worked with a militia leader to plan and execute the armed takeover at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, a 41-day anti-federal government protest. According to a 2019 report from the Washington State House of Representatives, Shea was closely associated with armed militia and was using his prominence in the Patriot movement to dispatch armed militia against government officials. \nLast month, not a single state Republican signed on to expel Shea from the Washington legislature. In prior years, Shea was also active in the early formation of the law enforcement wing of the Patriot movement, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which came under fire during the Obama administration for voiding gun control laws and for aligning with militia leaders to support standoffs against the federal government. A recently surfaced video of Shea filmed in 2013 features the lawmaker telling a congregation of supporters they should be stockpiling food, supplies, and ammunition for a potential civil war between \u201cpatriots\u201d at home and \u201cloyalists\u201d from Washington, D.C.\n\u201cArm yourselves. Arm your families. Arm the church,\u201d Shea said in the video. \nShea isn\u2019t the only state representative who has spoken out against the federal government and advocated for the abolition of abortion. Oklahoma Republican State Sen. Joseph Silk is a self-identified abolitionist who introduced SB 13 in 2019 to reclassify abortion as homicide. He is strongly allied with Free the States, appearing at their February conference and leading several sessions about abolishing abortion in the state of Oklahoma. He has spoken extensively about his experience introducing so-called abolitionist legislation. As Media Matters reported, Silk spoke at a campaign rally hosted by Operation Save America in March 2018 for then-gubernatorial candidate Dan Fisher. Fisher also identifies as an \u201cabolitionist\u201d and as part of his platform, he expressed a commitment to \u201cdefy the federal government\u201d and \u201cmake Oklahoma the first abortion-free state.\u201d After his campaign failed, Fisher and his staff funneled their resources into Free the States, which became a tax-exempt organization in 2019.\nWhat exactly do abolitionists believe? \nThe organizing efforts and ideology of abortion abolitionists are largely informed by Trewhella\u2019s work as a published theorist regarding the Doctrine of the Lower Civil Magistrate, which is the idea that government is a ministry of God, intended to administer and enforce his laws. When leaders fail to conform to God\u2019s law, it is up to lower government officials\u2014the lower or lesser civil magistrate\u2014to remove them and restore godly order. This is a theory closely held by End Abortion Now and Free the States, as evidenced by Durbin\u2019s efforts to pressure local jurisdictions to become sanctuaries for the unborn, and Hunter\u2019s efforts to focus on state anti-abortion laws.\nAbolitionists advocate for political and religious authorities to submit to God, rather than the U.S. Supreme Court. They believe state governors, legislators, and judges are morally and legally obligated to interpose\u2014meaning to put themselves between the Supreme Court, as long as it is upholding Roe v. Wade, and the \u201cvictims who are being deprived of their God-given right to life.\u201d Like much of the Patriot movement and elements of the Christian right, they do this through embracing nullification, the attempt to push a state, city, or municipal government to declare a law written by a higher governing body illegal and/or void within its jurisdiction. This tactic has most commonly been used to advance a neo-Confederate agenda.\nReproductive justice advocates working in states with active abortion abolitionist movements have serious concerns about these groups and their deadly ideologies. In part two of this mini-series, Prism speaks to a care provider and advocates in Oklahoma about the effect these movements have on pregnant people seeking care. \nTina Vasquez is the gender justice reporter at Prism.
