Ron DeSantis said he would sign a federal 15-week abortion ban.Wednesday's comment marked the first time since the launch of his presidential campaign that he said he would sign a national abortion ban.The Daily Signal was the first to report and confirmed the governor's remarks.The moment occurred during an exchange with Sen. Tim Scott, where he asked the governor if he would support a 15-week abortion ban. DeSantis said yes.The moment was widely missed due to the moderators talking over the pair while the exchange was happening, trying to regain control of the debate.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis speaks during the second Republican presidential primary debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 27, 2023.Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty ImagesThroughout his campaign, DeSantis, who has signed both a 15-week and six-week abortion ban in Florida, has walked a very fine line on abortion access, saying that he would be a \u201cpro-life\u201d president and support \u201cpro-life legislation,\u201d but has stopped short of saying he would support any national abortion ban.This is a complete flip from the last debate in August, where the governor indicated that he would prefer states to make their own abortion laws.\u201cI understand Iowa and New Hampshire are going to do different. But I will support the cause of life as governor and as president,\u201d DeSantis said during the August debate.MORE: Florida court hearing spotlights DeSantis' dance on abortion: ANALYSISIn a statement to ABC News, Scott's campaign communications director, Nathan Brand, said they're glad DeSantis is \"on board\" with a federal limit.\u201cRon had months to advocate for a federal limit, yet discouraged efforts to protect life. If you\u2019re going to back down on an issue, this is the one to do it on. Glad Ron is now on board.\u201dJust a few weeks ago, Scott criticized DeSantis, along with Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, at a town hall in Mason City, Iowa, for not \u201cstanding\u201d with him on the issue.Senator Tim Scott speaks during the second Republican presidential primary debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 27, 2023.Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty ImagesDeSantis\u2019 comments in Wednesday's debate elicited a statement from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser, who applauded DeSantis\u2019 agreement to support a 15-week abortion ban.\u201cWe thank Governor Ron DeSantis for his commitment to support minimum federal protections for babies in the womb when they feel pain by 15 weeks, while keeping states free to be as ambitious as possible for life,\u201d Dannenfelser said in a statement. \u201cWe thank Senator Tim Scott for raising this vital point in the debate and for advocating these protections for months, as has Vice President Mike Pence.This past August, Dannenfelser attacked DeSantis for being non-committal to a 15-week abortion ban.DeSantis now joins the rank and files of other presidential hopefuls who have committed to signing a national abortion ban if elected president, including Sen. Tim Scott and former Vice President Mike Pence.When asked by ABC News about the governor\u2019s commitment to support a 15-week abortion ban, DeSantis\u2019 communication director said the governor has always supported \u201cpro-life legislation.\u201dABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim contributed to this report.Related TopicsRon DeSantisRepublican PrimaryReproductive Rights 2024 Abortion RightsTop StoriesJudge rules evidence related to 'Access Hollywood' tape admissible in Trump trialMar 18, 6:35 PMState Medicaid offices target dead people\u2019s homes to recoup their health care costsMar 16, 4:18 PMTrump claims Liz Cheney and Jan. 6 committee should be jailedMar 18, 8:58 PMTrump faces 'insurmountable difficulties' in securing $464M bond in civil fraud caseMar 18, 10:47 AMFormer officer sentenced after pleading guilty to torture of Black men31 minutes agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights \u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n\n\n"
