Some student unions have been threatened with legal action if they attempt to prevent anti-abortion groups opening on campus.There have been reports that there are now at least 14 anti-abortion societies in university students\u2019 unions around the UK, many of which have faced fierce opposition from students who are overwhelmingly pro-choice.Most recently there have been a series of demonstrations by anti-abortion campaigners outside Cardiff University, which have prompted counter-protests by some students. The rise in tensions followed a vote by the students\u2019 union to adopt an official pro-choice stance, in common with other universities.Isadora Sinha, a postgraduate student of bioinformatics at Cardiff, proposed the motion which gained overwhelming support when put to a vote in November. Since then there have been at least three anti-abortion protests outside the university, organised by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK (CBR UK), which recently targeted the pro-choice Labour MP Stella Creasy.There have been anti-abortion societies at Cardiff students\u2019 union before, but in October a new anti-abortion society opened called Cardiff Students for Life. Its website encourages members to get involved with the wider anti-abortion movement through events such as the annual March for Life and \u201c40 days of life\u201d vigils outside clinics.Sinha said she and other pro-choice activists had received online threats from external parties following the vote and had been in virtual hiding for two weeks. \u201cThe motion was written in a way to ensure free speech and expression for those who are pro-life and the pro-life society can function as before. Unfortunately, there has been backlash against this motion passing despite it having passed by a democratic vote by hundreds of students.\u201dStudents\u2019 unions at universities including Birmingham, Nottingham, Aberdeen and Strathclyde have been forced to lift bans against anti-abortion groups when faced with possible legal challenges over free speech.An organisation called the Alliance of Pro-Life Students (APS) supports students to set up their own anti-abortion societies. It encourages them to affiliate with their students\u2019 unions in order to gain access to facilities, resources, students\u2019 union funding and training opportunities.The APS chief executive, Madeline Page, said there were 14 affiliated societies in the UK, with at least two in the process of affiliation. \u201cOur societies remain autonomous and students are welcome to run their society as they see as most appropriate to their university\u2019s setting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not dictate how they should be run, nor do we run any societies as an organisation.\u201dWhere legal heft is required, a faith-based legal advocacy group called the Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF International, intervenes to remind universities of their responsibilities to protect freedom of speech, an issue which both the government and the higher education regulator have recently addressed.Dr Pam Lowe, a senior lecturer in sociology and policy at Aston University, researches anti-abortion activism across the UK. \u201cThe anti-abortion movement has collectively recognised they have got an ageing population. They are setting out strategically to try to engage more younger people and get younger people advocating against abortion.\u201cThis is a deliberate policy, that\u2019s quite new. It\u2019s an orchestrated campaign, but where exactly it originates is unclear to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign that it\u2019s really being successful at the moment.\u201dRachel Watters, the NUS women\u2019s officer, said the union did not hold data on societies of this kind but agreed the anti-abortion movement was more visible on campuses, but it did not reflect any change of heart among students. \u201cStudents\u2019 unions and students have been passionate in campaigning about reproductive rights issues for decades.\u201dShe suggested that recent changes to the law on abortion in Northern Ireland had brought the issue back into focus. \u201cI don\u2019t think the general opinion of students will be massively influenced by the growth of these societies. Anti-choice societies have the right to express their views. Of course, students\u2019 unions, people in the student movement, also have a right to challenge what they are saying.\u201dKerry Abel, who chairs the campaigning group Abortion Rights, agreed: \u201cAnti-choice campaigners on campus are not new, but their strategies are \u2013 they are becoming more brazen. It\u2019s not acceptable for students\u2019 access to healthcare and information to be blocked or interfered with.\u201dThe CBR UK chief executive, Andy Stephenson, said anti-abortion activities were being being targeted at students \u201cas universities are attended with people very likely to have an abortion\u201d. He said the demonstrations in Cardiff would continue for the foreseeable future, with protests planned once or even twice a week for the new year. \u201cThe only thing that would make us stop such frequent displays would be the students\u2019 union reversing its advocacy for abortion and mistreatment of pro-life students.\u201dNicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), England\u2019s university regulator, said institutions had a duty to provide inclusive and safe environments, and to consider the needs of all students.\u201cUniversities are places where people can encounter challenging and \u2013 at times \u2013 uncomfortable ideas, and see those ideas questioned, sometimes for the first time. This is something which we should encourage, and the OfS stands for the widest possible definition of free speech. But that challenge must take place in a respectful environment in which civil discourse can thrive.\u201dAdditional reporting by Shanna Jones This article was amended on 7 January 2020 to clarify in the text and subheading that the NUS was not the source of the data relating to the number of pro-choice student groups. The text was also changed to clarify that the OfS is the university regulator in England, not the whole of the UK.Explore more on these topicsAbortionUniversitiesCardiff UniversityHigher educationFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMPs\u00a0to get free vote on decriminalising abortion in England and Wales23 Feb 2024Abortion investigations causing women \u2018life-changing harm\u2019, says UK expert27 Jan 2024Abortion prosecutions are never in the public interest, says royal college22 Jan 2024Women still being harassed at abortion clinics despite buffer zone law 18 Oct 2023Telling health staff not to report women for suspected illegal abortions has firm legal basis22 Jan 2024Home Office delay on abortion clinic buffer zones leaves council to act alone15 Sept 2023Ministers accused of watering down rules around abortion clinic buffer zones 17 Jan 2024Why\u00a0UK campaigners fear drive to decriminalise abortion may stall18 Jul 2023Judge\u2019s reduction of sentence for abortion shows how law must change, say campaigners18 Jul 2023England and Wales abortion law has been settled, minister tells Commons15 Jun 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
