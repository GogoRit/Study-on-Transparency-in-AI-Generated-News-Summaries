This short, animated video was produced by Choice42, a Canadian pro-life group trying to change public opinion about the value and humanity of the unborn. While the group is well known for its humorous videos on a variety of topics to make a strong point, their newest video, \u201cModern Child Sacrifice,\u201d isn\u2019t humorous at all\u2014it makes a sobering point, one I\u2019ve been saying for years: abortion is nothing more than modern \u201cchild sacrifice to the god of self.\u201d\n\n\nI urge you to watch and share this powerful video through social media and in any way you can.\nThe video is hard-hitting\u2014yet it\u2019s an accurate portrayal of the reality of the brutality of abortion and exposes the true heart behind this barbaric practice.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                \r\n                    Watch the video on YouTube.\r\n                \r\n            \n\n\n\nAbortion truly is the greatest holocaust of all time and a shocking blight on the whole world. I urge you to share this video with as many people as you can. We need to boldly stand against the evil of abortion.\nThanks for stopping by and thanks for praying,Ken\nThis item was written with the assistance of AiG\u2019s research team.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Article \n\nHuge Announcement: Biggest Matching Gift in Answers in Genesis History!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Article \n\n\u201cLiving Room Reset\u201d with Kirk Cameron at the Ark Encounter, November 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKen Ham\n\n\nKen\u2019s Radio Show\n\n\nKen\u2019s Blog\n\n\nKen\u2019s Video Updates\n\n\nKen\u2019s Resources\n\n\nPray for Answers in Genesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Ken\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKen Ham\u2019s Daily Email\nEmail me with Ken\u2019s daily email:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA, and the Google\r\n    Privacy Policy and\r\n    Terms of Service apply.\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\nThank You!\nThank you for signing up to receive email newsletters from Answers in Genesis.\nYou can also sign up for our free print newsletter (US only).\n\n\nFinish your subscription\nYou're almost done!
