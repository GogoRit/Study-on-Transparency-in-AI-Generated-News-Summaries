There\u2019s no regard for the Jewish community\u2019s beliefs or communal norms,\u201d said Rabbi Laurie Rice from the Congregation Micah, a synagogue located in Brentwood.\u00a0\nOn Aug. 25, Tennessee implemented a strict abortion ban making no exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies, and doctors who perform abortions, even lifesaving ones, risk criminal prosecution.\u00a0\nBefore the ban was enacted, Jewish leaders in Nashville met on Aug. 12 to discuss how Judaism views abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think it\u2019s a complete imposition of one religious tradition\u2019s understanding upon the rest of the community. There\u2019s no regard for the Jewish community\u2019s beliefs or communal norms. \n\n\n\u2013 Rabbi Laurie Rice, Congregatin Micah\n\n\nIn a broadcast hosted by the Jewish Federation & Jewish Foundation of Nashville and Middle Tennessee, six Jewish leaders representing different religious backgrounds\u2013from modern-Orthodox to Reform\u2013said that because under Jewish law a soul does not enter the body until birth, the choice to have an abortion is open to interpretation.\n\u201cThe law will establish that the fetus is not considered to be fully in the same category as a person who has already been born,\u2019\u2019 said Rabbi Joshua Kullock, from the conservative West End Synagogue.\nFirst and foremost, if a mother\u2019s life is in danger, abortion is permissible as described in the Mishnah, or Jewish law, he said.\n\u201cThat every single time that there is a risk for the life of the mother, the termination of the pregnancy can happen even all the way up to the end of the pregnancy,\u201d said Kullock.\nOther circumstances can also be taken into consideration.\u00a0\nFor instance, some Jewish sources indicate that a fetus is considered a part of its mother\u2019s body, supporting the notion that women should be able to make decisions concerning their autonomy.\nRabbi Saul Strosberg argued that Judaism may also take into consideration a woman\u2019s mental and physical health, and that mothers may also decide to have an abortion to focus their limited resources on their living children instead of the unborn child.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s very empowering to women. Mothers are the ones who make this decision and that may not be traditional,\u201d said Strosberg, from the Sherith Israel Congregation.\nAlthough most Jewish religious leaders agree that abortion is not permitted without reason, opinions differ on under what circumstance the procedure should be allowed. But local leaders said that the choice should ultimately be left to a woman and her doctor.\n\u201cAnd the government should not interfere,\u201d said Erin Coleman, an attorney at the Jewish women advocacy group, Hadassah. \u201cEven the most religious rabbi in Nashville said that decision should not be controlled by the government.\u201d\nAt the Islamic Center of Nashville, Dr. Ossama Bahloul addressed the varying ways that abortion is regarded under Islam, which says that the soul enters a fetus at 120 days, or four months.\u00a0\nThe \u201cdefault position of Islam is pro-life,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n  Ossama Bahloul, Ph.D, imam for the Islamic Center of Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo)\n\u201cHistorically speaking scholars express their care about pregnancy and caution against eliminating pregnancy in general. With this said, one might view the scholar\u2019s way of viewing pregnancy in three stages,\u201d said Bahloul. \u201cFrom day one until day 40, some scholars will entertain an abortion for a valid reason. From day 40 to day 120, the scholars begin to look for a reason that carries a heavy weight. From day 120 until the end of the pregnancy, the only reason for an abortion would be out of extreme necessity and that necessity must be that the mother\u2019s life would be lost.\u201d\u00a0\nMarried couples may make the decision to have an abortion together, which usually is done after receiving advice from faith leaders, counselors, mental-health professionals, health staff and other trusted individuals, he said.\nOther exceptions may be made for rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhile some (scholars) will not allow abortion during any stage of a pregnancy without necessity, others will consider a good reason to be enough \u2014 a woman being raped or potential harm to the mother, for instance \u2014 and some (scholars) choose to accommodate a reasonable excuse within the first 40 days of a pregnancy,\u201d said Bahloul.\u00a0\nAccording to Shaykh Mohammed Faqih, imam and religious director at the Memphis Islamic Center, abortion is decided on a case-by-case basis, each case is handled differently under Islam.\nBut after 120 days, when the soul is believed to enter the fetus, most scholars will consider abortion to be the ending of a human life.\u00a0\n\u201cIf a person is seeking an abortion, it\u2019s always a tough decision to be made,\u201d said Mohammed. \u201cWe always advocate (that) individuals going through any personal crisis causing them to consider abortion should be given the attention, spiritual and mental care support that they need.\u201d\u00a0\nTennessee\u2019s abortion ban complicates those decisions, he said. \u00a0\n\u201cPolitically speaking, it\u2019s very awkward for us and we don\u2019t want political officials to make the choice for everyone,\u201d said Mohammed.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbortion providers can use the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d in limited cases, but they will first face criminal charges and will need to prove the mother\u2019s life was in danger. Doing so may involve allowing the mother\u2019s health to deteriorate before they can intervene. Physicians may also decline to treat patients for fear of legal repercussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a person is seeking an abortion, it\u2019s always a tough decision to be made . . . Politically speaking, it's very awkward for us and we don't want political officials to make the choice for everyone.\n\n\n\u2013 Shaykh Mohammed Faqih, imam, Memphis Islamic Center\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s more reprehensible about this ban, is that it criminalizes the intervention for the sake of the health of the mother on the part of healthcare professionals,\u201d said Rice.\u00a0\nChristians are also divided on the abortion ban.\nWhen Misha Wesley learned that Roe v. Wade was overturned, she wept as some of her Christian friends celebrated.\u00a0\n\u201cI was feeling the burden of women. I was feeling the complications of pregnancy, the financial burdens of pregnancy, of bringing a life into this world. I was feeling the burden of those heavy decisions of women who go are in marginalized communities, the drug addicts who are pregnant. I was just feeling it all,\u201d said Wesley, who works as a faith outreach specialist at the Haven, an LGBTQ-friendly organization in Memphis offering comprehensive services for those at-risk for or living with sexually transmitted diseases.\nMarta Hernandez, who serves on the Haven faith advisory board, also struggles with supporting women\u2019s reproductive autonomy while standing at odds with her religious friends and family.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHow may I confront this with my beliefs while at the same time with my understanding that there are certain times (abortion) is needed, and I am not the judge? And how can I help other people understand that?\u201d She asked. \u201cAs Christian people, we shouldn\u2019t make those decisions.\u201d\nWhile some Christians have an \u201cextreme interpretation,\u201d said Faqih, Islam calls for a consensus, non-polarizing, approach to abortion.\n\u201cIs there a middle ground on abortion that we can agree on?\u201d he asked.\nJewish women at Hadassah, on the other hand, plan to combat the abortion ban by increasing voter turnout.\n\u201cWe have a legislature that is more likely never going to change their mind so it\u2019s important to change voter habits, on state level and national level,\u201d said Coleman.\u00a0\nAcross the nation, Jewish groups have launched their own lawsuits against their state\u2019s restrictions on abortion. In Florida, Congregation L\u2019Dor Va-Dor filed a lawsuit arguing that abortion laws violate Jewish teachings, which state that abortion is necessary if it protects the health, mental or physical well-being of the woman.\u00a0\nHadassah is considering launching its own lawsuit against Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban and argue that their religious beliefs allow for abortion.\u00a0 But for now, they wait to see how other lawsuits based on Judaism fair against the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s important not to recreate the wheel but support the ongoing one,\u201d said Coleman.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXTennessee Muslim, Jewish leaders weigh abortion ban against their faith\u2019s teachings\nby Dulce Torres Guzman, Tennessee Lookout September 16, 2022\nTennessee Muslim, Jewish leaders weigh abortion ban against their faith\u2019s teachings\nby Dulce Torres Guzman, Tennessee Lookout September 16, 2022\n Backers of Tennessee\u2019s strict abortion ban often cite their Christian faith.\u00a0 But some Middle Tennessee Jewish and Muslim faith leaders say the law compromises their ability to draw on their own religious traditions in guiding worshipers through difficult decisions.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a complete imposition of one religious tradition\u2019s understanding upon the rest of the community.
