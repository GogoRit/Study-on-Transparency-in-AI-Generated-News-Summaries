SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (FOX 2) - A pregnancy center in Oakland County was targeted by vandals and police believe a known extremist group -- may be responsible. \"We believe that all life is sacred. We believe it starts at conception,\" said Mark McGrath, chairman of the board.   And it\u2019s those beliefs that made Mother and Unborn Baby Care a target for vandals, not once but twice. The pro-life, crisis pregnancy center is located in Southfield. A threatening message was left saying \"'If abortion is not safe neither are you,'\" he said. \"And you can still see the neither right there.\" \u00a0  McGrath is taking that as a threat from two women wearing hoods and armed with spray paint last Friday, hitting the location off Southfield Road near 10 Mile Road. \u00a0 Jessica Dupnack, FOX 2: \"Are you guys going to be doing anything different security-wise?\" \"We are considering everything right now but are kind of in a state of shock right now,\" he said. It has put the small group that works and volunteers at the religious-based, pro-life clinic for women on high alert. \u00a0    Back in June after news broke of the Roe v Wade decision by the US Supreme Court, McGrath says they were a target like this for the first time since they opened in 1984. \"They actually did more damage that time. They broke out all the windows on the ground floor - 14 windows,\" he said. In spite of the vandalism, they are still open, servicing about 200 women a year. \u00a0    A militant, extremist abortion rights group known as \"Jane\u2019s Revenge\" has been behind similar crimes around the country. It\u2019s being investigated by police if it is connected to the incident in Southfield. \"I think these poor women are very misguided,\" McGrath said. \"I pray for them. We all pray for them.\"\u00a0If you know anything about the two women who did this \u2013 or the incident in June, call Southfield police at 248-796-5500.    \u00a0 \u00a0    BREAKING NEWS Breaking news delivered fast        By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.  \n      Top videos\n          video  Suspect torches Tesla in Detroit       video  Exploring this year's construction projects in downtown Detroit       video  Motion passes to demolish historic school building       video  Clinton Township residents attend meeting to voice blast concerns       video  Allen Park taxidermist gets tracked down by Rob Wolchek   Trending      Southgate drunk driver kills woman, injures 4      Man who said new clerk was going to sell him big winner wins $500K on Michigan Lotto ticket      'Outrageous': Rising gas, car insurance prices affect Michigan drivers      Elderly sisters beaten, raped in Dearborn home invasion; suspect in custody      Romulus nightclub temporarily shutdown after fatal shooting had host of other issues        News LocalNationalHall of ShameLet It RipCrimestoppersThe InterviewBusinessThings to DoFOX News SundayLive LiveNOW from FOXFOX SoulStream FOX 2 FOX LOCALFOX 2 News appWeather ClosingsWeather AppWeather AlertsTrafficAirport DelaysFox WeatherAnimal HouseMornings The NineThe NoonMug ContestHealth WorksCooking SchoolNosh with JoshGet FitMoney SaverDoctor is InWeekend MorningsPolitics Let It RipGretchen WhitmerJoe BidenSports First & NorthLionsWolverinesSpartansPistonsTigersRed WingsEntertainment FOX ShowsCriticLEE SpeakingTV ListingsContestsDeeper Than A CutAbout Us FOX 2 Staff75 years of WJBKContact UsWork at FOX 2FOX 2 News AppJob ShopCommunityFCC Public File FCC ApplicationsClosed CaptionsProblem Solvers ResourcesContests Wallside Windows Weather QuizGardner White Dream TeamMug ContestExposedMoney Personal FinanceCOVID-19 & The EconomyBusinessStock MarketSmall BusinessRegional News Chicago News - FOX 32 ChicagoMilwaukee News - FOX 6 NewsMinneapolis News - FOX 9 facebooktwitterinstagramemail  About UsNew Privacy PolicyTerms of ServiceYour Privacy ChoicesWork at FOX 2FCC Public FileEEO Public File This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX Television Stations\n\n\n\n"
