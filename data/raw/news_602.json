Rutledge. A panel of federal appeals judges, including Erickson, upheld a U.S. District Court ruling striking down two abortion restrictions enacted in 2019, a ban of abortions after 18 weeks and a ban on abortions stemming from a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, a genetic defect that occurs in one of every 700 births in the United States. \n Erickson joined another judge on the 8th Circuit, Bobby Shepherd, in bemoaning the fact that Supreme Court precedent left them no choice but to block the Arkansas restrictions, finding they were unconstitutional. \n Both judges then called upon the Supreme Court to overturn an important 1992 case that provides the legal precedent to strike down the bans. The decision established the standard of viability \u2014 allowing abortions as long as the fetus would not be viable outside the mother\u2019s body. \n That standard is inadequate and fails to consider legitimate state interests in banning certain abortions, including those of unborn children who carry the genetic marker for Down syndrome, \n    \n      Erickson wrote\n    \n      .  \n \u201cThe great glory of humanity is in its diversity,\u201d Erickson wrote in his concurring opinion. \u201cWe are as a species remarkably variant in our talents, abilities, appearances, strengths, and weaknesses. \u2026 And each human being is priceless beyond measure. Children with Down syndrome share in each of these fundamental attributes of humanity.\u201d \n Erickson wrote that the abortion of unborn children with Down syndrome is reminiscent of the 20th century eugenics movement that employed genocide and forced sterilization to develop a \u201cmaster race,\u201d causing the deaths of millions of innocents. \n He added: \u201cA core value of eugenics is the notion that diversity in the human population should be reduced to maximize and eventually realize the \u2018ideal\u2019 of a more \u2018perfect person.\u2019 Inherent in this concept is the goal of controlling genetic diversity of a population in order to create a super race: one that is deemed to be healthier, smarter, stronger, and more beautiful.\u201d \n North Dakota Right to Life, a group that opposes abortion, agrees with Erickson\u2019s concerns about the dangers of aborting fetuses with Down syndrome, which a spokeswoman said is an example of abortions for so-called \u201cquality of life reasons.\u201d \n \u201cWe reject the argument on quality of life because that implies that some life might not be worth living,\u201d said Sierra Heitkamp, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life. \n The practice of aborting unborn children with Down syndrome is becoming increasingly common in Europe, she said. Erickson noted that as well in his opinion. Denmark now routinely screens for Down syndrome. As a result, Erickson wrote, last year only seven Down syndrome children among those tested were born. Advocates of screening for Down syndrome have argued that just because a woman doesn\u2019t want to take on the responsibility of caring for a child with the genetic defect doesn\u2019t mean she is motivated by eugenics ideology. \n North Dakota law prohibits abortions based on gender selection or genetic defects, Heitkamp said. But as genetic screening becomes increasingly common, there is a danger that aborting unborn children who have some defect could become more accepted, she said. \n \u201cThat always is a worry,\u201d she said. \n Planned Parenthood of North Central States, which includes North Dakota, opposes any erosion of abortion rights, said Katie Christensen, North Dakota state director for external affairs for Planned Parenthood, which does not perform abortions in the state but does in some of its clinics in other states. \n \u201cThere\u2019s a growing movement to chip away at abortion in multiple ways,\u201d Christensen said, including laws that prohibit abortion for sex selection or genetic defects. \n Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, has announced that she will have a bill introduced to outlaw abortion of fetuses with Down syndrome, part of an \u201corchestrated attempt\u201d to further restrict access to abortion, Christensen said. \n \u201cThe risk is higher now than it was previously,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cThis has been a legitimate concern throughout the Trump administration.\u201d \n Besides appointing three Supreme Court justices, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority, Trump has appointed 197 other federal judges, including his appointment of Erickson to the appeals court bench in 2017. \n In North Dakota, legislation has been introduced that would make it a felony to perform an abortion or to \u201caid and abet\u201d an abortion, an example of the latest attacks on abortion rights, Christensen said. \n \u201cThey\u2019re upfront about it,\u201d she said, noting that the sponsor of the bill hopes it will be appealed to the Supreme Court if the bill becomes law and is challenged in court. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Share\n    \n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Tags\n          \n\n\n\nTags\n\nCRIME AND COURTSNORTH DAKOTACRIME AND COURTSFARGO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                By\n                Patrick Springer\n\n\n                Patrick Springer first joined The Forum in 1985.
