At nine weeks, she woke up in terrible pain that kept getting worse. Her husband took her to the doctor, then to the hospital, where she was rushed into surgery. Doctors found an ovary that had flipped around a fallopian tube, endangering both the pregnancy and her health. They removed it, and her pregnancy continued.\nThen, at a scheduled scan seven weeks later, she got even worse news: Her doctor suspected the fetus had anencephaly, a serious birth defect in which the brain and skull don\u2019t fully develop.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe told me, \u2018This is not compatible with life, the baby cannot survive outside of you,\u2019 we\u2019re talking a matter of hours, maybe a day,\u201d Elizabeth said.\u00a0\nElizabeth\u2019s obstetrician referred her to a neonatal specialist. The details he filled in were not encouraging: If her baby made it to term, then through the birth, he would survive for only a short time. Her options, the doctor said, were to deliver the baby and administer pain medication to keep him as comfortable as possible for his short life, or terminate the pregnancy. Elizabeth thought about the son she was carrying, then the 2-year-old son she already had at home.\u00a0\n\u201cRight away I knew: I can\u2019t carry this to term. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a good mom to my child. I would be depressed. I knew I couldn\u2019t, my husband agreed,\u201d Elizabeth said.\nThe next week, the couple drove to one of only a handful of clinics in Ohio that offered surgical abortions. When they pulled in, some of the dozen or so protesters noticed a sticker from a Catholic university on her husband\u2019s car. The protesters yelled that the church didn\u2019t support what they were doing, that there were better options.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    More students will likely become pregnant post-Roe. Who will support them?\n                \n\n\n\n                    Block on Biden\u2019s Title IX rule is part of broader attack on key LGBTQ+ rights case, experts say\n                \n\n\n\n                    Dozens of clinics have dropped abortion services since Roe v. Wade was overturned\n                \n\n\n\n\nShe had a surgical abortion at 17 weeks.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was so hard not to scream back at them and tell them why we were there,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI wanted them to know \u2014 I wanted them to know that this was a wanted baby.\u201d\u00a0\nElizabeth spoke to The 19th just days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and a six-week abortion ban went into effect in Ohio. We are using her middle name and last initial because Elizabeth is pregnant again \u2014 17 weeks at the time of the interview \u2014 and Ohio has a quickly shifting legal landscape when it comes to abortion rights.\u00a0\nThe only exception to Ohio\u2019s six-week abortion ban is to protect the life of the gestational parent \u2014 a standard medical providers in Ohio and elsewhere have already said is so ill-defined it will lead to delays in critical care. It does not have exemptions for rape, incest or severe fetal abnormalities, including life-threatening conditions like anencephaly. If Elizabeth\u2019s previous pregnancy were today, she would no longer have the option to end it in Ohio.\u00a0\nWhen the Supreme Court on June 24 issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization that overturned Roe, which had protected federal abortion rights for nearly a half century, Elizabeth\u2019s husband texted her at work to tell her the news.\n\u201cI had to get off a call, I was crying. We all expected it, but I feel terrible for other women in my situation who now don\u2019t have the option I did. I can\u2019t imagine the mental toll of carrying a child you know is going to die,\u201d she said.\nIn this new America, the state you live in determines your access to abortion. Medical providers, advocates and liberal lawmakers are pointing out the lesser anticipated impacts of some of these state laws \u2014 including situations where fetuses have serious or fatal medical issues.\u00a0\nWhen Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat, testified before a U.S. House of Representatives oversight hearing last month on the impact of overturning Roe, she focused on a Michigan couple who found out in 2014 at their 20-week appointment that their fetus had severe osteogenesis imperfecta. The baby\u2019s bones were not developing, likely leading to a \u201cvery short life, suffering every moment in great pain,\u201d McMorrow said. Now, with Roe gone, McMorrow pointed out that, if courts allow it to take effect, a Michigan law from 1931 criminalizing the provision of abortion would prevent them from seeking in-state care.\u00a0\nAbout 120,000 pregnancies in the United States each year are affected by fetal anomalies, which are genetic or physical defects of varying severity that can impact pregnancy, delivery and the child\u2019s health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly all of them cannot be diagnosed until well after the gestational cutoffs set by states that have curbed abortion access. And very few have exceptions for the health of the fetus.\u00a0\nDr. Jessian Munoz, an OB/GYN in San Antonio, Texas, said that in the United States the average patient comes in for the first prenatal visit at about 11 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, and for those who don\u2019t have access to good health insurance or money saved, it can be even later. Over the past decade, there has also been a push to use less invasive or financially onerous prenatal testing procedures, like ordering a blood test instead of an amniocentesis or an ultrasound. It is common, now, for the first scans that might show a serious issue to happen in the second trimester of pregnancy, Munoz said.\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Only Louisiana has an exception for \u201cmedically futile\u201d pregnancies, but that is not a medical term. Missouri also allows abortions in cases of \u201cmedical emergency,\u201d but doctors have said the law is confusing and vague and interferes with patient care.\u00a0\nTennessee and South Carolina, like Ohio, have six-week abortion bans in place. All three states have exceptions to save a parent\u2019s life but not for rape, incest or fetal abnormalities.\u00a0\nGOP lawmakers in South Carolina have introduced a bill that would ban abortions from conception. An appeals court in Michigan ruled this week that prosecutors could begin enforcing its pre-Roe ban, which criminalizes abortion except to save a parent\u2019s life. In West Virginia, a law banning abortions because of genetic anomalies already took effect. In Indiana, abortions for reasons of sex selection, race or genetic anomalies are already banned and Republican legislators are weighing broader restrictions.\u00a0\nEven though some exceptions for fetal abnormalities exist, Dr. Chloe Zera, an OB/GYN at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said doctors struggle to define what a lethal fetal defect is.\u00a0\n\u201cIf the sky\u2019s the limit on intervention, and if there are no limits on intervention, then there\u2019s not a whole lot that is purely lethal,\u201d Zera said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that are profoundly life-limiting, life-threatening, or are associated with developmental delays, but it\u2019s almost impossible to get definitive. The more common thing is: \u2018This is definitely going to mean a lot of medical care, and that medical care might be painful, or that medical care might be unsuccessful.\u2019\u201d\nEven if a patient is getting prenatal screenings and scans at every recommended point in pregnancy, many potential issues aren\u2019t diagnosable early on. Most pregnant people have what doctors call the \u201canatomy scan\u201d around 18 to 22 weeks \u2014 parents typically think of this appointment as the one in which they\u2019ll find out the baby\u2019s sex \u2014 to look for issues with various fetal organs, including making sure they are inside the body. It cannot be done earlier because for a period in the first trimester, a fetus\u2019 intestines push outside of their body through the umbilical cord, then are pulled back in around 11 to 14 weeks. It isn\u2019t until 15 to 17 weeks that doctors can start to see fetal heart structures clearly. It\u2019s not until 16 to 19 weeks that they can get a good look at the brain, she said.\u00a0\nWhen doctors see something is wrong, they can rarely confirm that something will be fatal in advance, or advise you on the best next steps, Zera said.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat we can say is: \u2018These are things that are going to mean that your baby has a neurologist, that your baby needs cardiac surgery, that your baby needs dialysis.\u2019 We can give a whole list of likely outcomes based on what we can see on ultrasound. For some families, they\u2019re not a problem. And for some families, they\u2019re an absolute non-starter. And for most families, they don\u2019t know.\u201d\nElizabeth doesn\u2019t talk about her abortion much. Until speaking to The 19th, she\u2019d told only family and smattering of close friends. It seemed too difficult to even revisit in therapy. But when the court overturned Roe, and Ohio\u2019s six-week ban took effect, she wanted to start telling her story.\nElizabeth said she isn\u2019t someone who ever thought they would have \u201cabortion\u201d in their medical file \u2014 in fact, she wishes there was a different word to describe her experience, her loss. Yet here she is.\u00a0\n\u201cYou think \u2018these things don\u2019t happen to us\u2019 and then it\u2019s very eye-opening when it does,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas just added exceptions to its abortion ban.
