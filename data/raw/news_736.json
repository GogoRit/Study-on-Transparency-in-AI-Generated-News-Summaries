(Photo: John Partipilo)\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee on Thursday became the latest state in the nation to ban abortion, implementing a strict new law with no exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies while subjecting doctors who choose to perform lifesaving abortions to the risk of criminal prosecution.\nThe state\u2019s Human Life Protection Act is among the toughest abortion bans in the nation and one of three so-called \u201ctrigger bans\u201d to take effect on the same day. Texas and Idaho trigger bans also go into effect Thursday.\nAltogether, at least a dozen states have implemented some form of abortion ban since the June 24 Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ended Constitutional protections for abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.\nAbortion foes in Tennessee celebrated Wednesday. Tennessee Right to Life, the powerful lobbying group that served as the architect of the ban, tweeted Wednesday that they have waited nearly 50 years for the day to arrive.\n\u201cThe end of abortion-on-demand in our state is a badge of honor for Tennessee,\u201d State Rep.

They\u2019ve abandoned us. And they have left us with a totally manufactured crisis of their own making.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end of abortion-on-demand in our state is a badge of honor for Tennessee.\n\n\n\u2013 Rep. Susan Lynn, R-Mt. Juliet\n\n\nMost abortions in Tennessee have already come to a halt. Planned Parenthood clinics in Nashville and Memphis ended abortion services within days of the Supreme Court decision, when a 6-week abortion law took effect almost immediately.\nClinics that continued to provide abortions during the narrow 6-week window saw far fewer patients. CHOICES, a Memphis clinic, reported seeing one-tenth the number of usual abortion patients after the 6-week ban took effect.\u00a0 CHOICES was one of three clinics that have continued to provide abortions since the Supreme Court decision. All three announced they would end abortion services Wednesday.\n\u201cPatients were confused and in total shock about what had happened,\u201d Coffield said. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t see this coming. They believed that providers like Planned Parenthood would fight back, and there would be a path for us to protect this right. And, unfortunately, we had to explain to our patients that we didn\u2019t have one.\u201d\nEnacted three years ago in anticipation of an eventual Supreme Court ruling ending abortion rights, the trigger law\u2019s language has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks, with questions about whether a ban \u2014 and criminal penalties \u2014 apply to situations that vary from certain IUD\u2019s used as emergency contraception to how gravely ill a pregnant patient must be for a physician to be able to justify an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen.

(Photo: John Partipilo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe enforcement of this law, how it\u2019s interpreted, how it\u2019s put into effect in Tennessee is all left to be seen,\u201d Coffield said.\nThe law\u2019s language contains no specific exception for lifesaving care. Instead, it says a physician may defend him- or herself against criminal charges by demonstrating the \u201cabortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\u201d\nWill Brewer, Tennessee Right to Life\u2019s lobbyist, told the Lookout last month the language is intended to protect doctors. \u201cIt is in there as an added protective measure for the doctor and it\u2019s in his professional judgement whether that was the nature of the operation, so I really don\u2019t see a criminal investigation going past that,\u201d Brewer said.\nPatients seeking abortions are exempt from criminal prosecution, the law says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis trigger law is depraved and heartless, and it is anything but Christian.\n\n\n\u2013 Ashley Coffield, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississipp\n\n\nIt is the first time since Tennessee first began regulating abortions more than a century ago \u2014 in 1883, according to state Supreme Court records \u2014 there has not been specific language in the state\u2019s abortion rules to \u201cpreserve the life of a pregnant women.\u201d The 1883 law banning abortions\u00a0 contained that language, and remained in effect until the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade opened access to abortion across the nation.\n\u201cNow our legislature makes physicians\u2019 jobs even harder by crafting a legal system where pregnancy care providers will feel like there is a target on their back even more than usual,\u201d Dr. Amy Gordon Bono, a primary care physician, said Wednesday at a press conference in downtown Nashville.\nBono was joined by Democratic state lawmakers who urged Tennesseans opposed to abortion restrictions to vote for pro-choice candidates.\n\u201cOur Tennessee daughters deserve to grow up with the same rights and freedoms that our Tennessee sons have,\u201d said state Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat who is running for Congress in District 5.\n\u201cThis is literally democracy versus fascism,\u201d said Odessa Kelly, a Democrat running for Congress in District 7.\nCompounding the uncertainty over Tennessee\u2019s law is a Biden Administration guidance that federal law \u2014 known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act\u2014 protects healthcare providers who perform emergeny abortions in order to safeguard the life or health of pregnant patients. The federal law supersedes any state law, the guidance said.\nA federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the Biden guidance from applying to Texas, at the request of the state\u2019s attorney general.\nIn Idaho, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit over the state\u2019s trigger ban, which \u2014 like Tennessee\u2019s ban \u2014 requires physicians to be able to prove an abortion was necessary to prevent a patient\u2019s death as a defense to criminal prosecution. Unlike Tennessee, Idaho\u2019s ban does not provide a legal mechanism for doctors to perform abortions to prevent grave bodily harm.\nIdaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden criticized the federal lawsuit as \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\nLate on Wednesday, a federal judge in Idaho temporarily blocked a portion of the state\u2019s law that banned abortions to protect a pregnant woman\u2019s health. The judge ruled Idaho\u2019s trigger law conflicted, in part, with the Biden Administration guidance.\nTennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III has not taken a public position on how, or whether, the Biden Administration guidance applies to Tennessee\u2019s trigger ban, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAmid uncertainty and anger, Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban takes effect\nby Anita Wadhwani, Tennessee Lookout August 25, 2022\nAmid uncertainty and anger, Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban takes effect\nby Anita Wadhwani, Tennessee Lookout August 25, 2022\n Tennessee on Thursday became the latest state in the nation to ban abortion, implementing a strict new law with no exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies while subjecting doctors who choose to perform lifesaving abortions to the risk of criminal prosecution.\nThe state\u2019s Human Life Protection Act is among the toughest abortion bans in the nation and one of three so-called \u201ctrigger bans\u201d to take effect on the same day.
