Inflammatory: Kanye West, 43, (above in February this year) claimed in a Wednesday interview that Planned Parenthood is run by white supremacists to do 'the Devil's work'Nia Martin-Robinson, who is Director of Black Leadership and Engagement at Planned Parenthood, rebuked the star,\u00a0calling his claims 'offensive' and 'infantilizing' in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com.'Black women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available. Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantilizing,' Nia's statement began.\u00a0'The real threat to Black communities\u2019 safety, health, and lives stems from lack of access to quality, affordable health care, police violence and the criminalization of reproductive health care by anti-abortion opposition.\"Nia added, 'At Planned Parenthood, we trust and we stand with Black women who have, and continue to lead the charge when it comes to the health, rights, and bodily autonomy of those in their communities.'

She later posted about the experience on Instagram saying she stood with Planned Parenthood.         Advocate: In 2017, Kim and her sisters Khloe and Kourtney visited Planned Parenthood Los Angeles and she later endorsed the organization saying 'I stand with #PP'       'My sisters and I visited Planned Parenthood recently and learned that the House of Representatives forced through a bill that strips health care coverage from millions of people and raises health care costs, including Planned Parenthood patients,' she wrote.Adding: 'They are such an amazing place that provides so much to so many! #istandwithpp.'Kanye has also received a huge backlash for revealing his anti-vaccine stance, telling Forbes: 'It's so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralyzed\u2026 So when they say the way we're going to fix COVID is with a vaccine, I'm extremely cautious.'
