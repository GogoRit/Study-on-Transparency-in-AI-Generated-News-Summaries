(AP) \u2014 Herschel Walker, who has vehemently opposed abortion rights as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia, paid for an abortion for his girlfriend in 2009, according to a new report published late Monday. The candidate called the accusation a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d and said he would sue.\nThe Daily Beast spoke to the former girlfriend, who asked that her name not be used out of concerns for her privacy. The news outlet reviewed a receipt showing her $575 payment for the procedure, along with a get-well card from Walker and her bank deposit records showing the image of a $700 personal check from Walker dated five days after the abortion receipt.\nREAD MORE: White House says GOP\u2019s abortion ban proposal could lead to a nationwide crisis\nThe woman said Walker encouraged her to end the pregnancy, saying that the time wasn\u2019t right for a baby, The Daily Beast reported. As a candidate, Walker has characterized abortion as \u201ca woman killing her baby\u201d and has played up his opposition to the procedure in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year stripping a woman\u2019s constitutional right to access abortion services.\nIn a statement, Walker said he would file a lawsuit against The Daily Beast on Tuesday morning.\n\u201cThis is a flat-out lie \u2014 and I deny this in the strongest terms possible,\u201d he wrote.\nMatt Fuller, the politics editor for The Daily Beast, tweeted in response: \u201cI can tell you we stand behind every word and feel very solid about the story.\u201d\nLater Monday night, Walker appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s program on Fox News, where Walker was asked if he recalled sending a $700 check to a girlfriend.\n\u201cWell, I sent money to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI give money to people all the time because I\u2019m always helping people. I believe in being generous. God has blessed me. I want to bless others.\u201d\nWalker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock are engaged in a tight contest that is key to the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. The chamber is now divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats control. Warnock won the seat in a special election runoff on Jan. 5, 2021, prevailing by 2 percentage points over then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican.\nThe allegation against Walker is the latest in a series of stories about the football legend\u2019s past that has rocked the first-time candidate\u2019s campaign in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Earlier this year, Walker acknowledged reports that he had three children he had not previously talked about publicly.\nWalker has often boasted of his work helping service members and veterans struggling with mental health. Yet The Associated Press reported in May that various records showed he overstated his role in a for-profit program that is alleged to have preyed upon veterans and service members while defrauding the government.\nThe AP also has reported that a review of public records detailed accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife\u2019s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker himself has at times discussed his long struggle with mental illness.\nRepublicans targeted Warnock as perhaps the most vulnerable of the Democratic Senate incumbents. But they were also skeptical about Walker\u2019s viability as a statewide candidate, especially through the spring and summer as Walker\u2019s past was aired publicly. In recent months, Walker found his footing by attacking Warnock for backing President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda in Washington. Biden won Georgia narrowly but has seen his approval ratings in the state fall significantly since 2020.\nBut Walker also has made abortion an issue. During the Republican Senate primary, he openly backed a national ban on abortions with no exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or a woman\u2019s health being at risk \u2014 particularly notable at a time when the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court precedent has been overturned and Democrats in Congress have been discussing codifying abortion rights into federal law.\n\u201cI\u2019m for life,\u201d Walker has said repeatedly as he campaigns. When asked about whether he\u2019d allow for any exceptions, he has said there are \u201cno excuses\u201d for the procedure.\nWATCH: Conservative states continue to restrict abortion following overturn of Roe v. Wade\nAs the Republican nominee, Walker has sometimes sidestepped questions about his earlier support for a national abortion ban, a tacit nod to the fact that most voters, including many Republicans, want at least some legal access to abortion. Walker instead tries to turn the issue against Warnock, who supports abortion rights. Walker often says he doesn\u2019t understand how Warnock, a Baptist pastor, can support the procedure being legal.\nCampaigning in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, on Monday night, Warnock stressed his support for abortion rights.\n\u201cI have a profound reverence for life. I have a deep and abiding respect for choice. I believe a patient\u2019s room is too small and cramped a space for a woman, her doctor and the United States government,\u201d he said, emphasizing Walker\u2019s support for a national ban.\nWarnock was dismissive when told of The Daily Beast story and when asked whether it might affect the outcome in Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ll let the pundits decide,\u201d he said.\nWalker\u2019s son, Christian Walker, criticized his father in a series of tweets late Monday, saying his family \u201casked him not to run for office.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability,\u201d Christian Walker tweeted. \u201cBut how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you\u2019re some \u2018moral, Christian, upright man.\u2019 You\u2019ve lived a life of DESTROYING other peoples lives. How dare you.\u201d\nFor now, Republicans in Washington are standing by Walker, with a spokesman for the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm dismissing The Daily Beast story as \u201cnonsense\u201d rooted in desperation by Democrats.\n\u201cThey and their media allies are doing what they always do \u2014 attack Republicans with innuendo and lies,\u201d said Chris Hartline, a top aide at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Former college football star and current senatorial candidate Herschel Walker speaks at a rally in Perry, Georgia, U.S. September 25, 2021.
