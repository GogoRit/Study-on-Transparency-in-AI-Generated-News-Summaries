Previously, Texas had allowed abortions up to 22 weeks gestation for any indication.\nResearchers expect the number of abortion procedures to drop and live births to increase when abortion restrictions go into effect within a state, but do not know to what extent for some time. A 2022 study, also published in JAMA, estimated that abortions provided to pregnant Texas residents in facilities in Texas or in one of six adjacent states decreased by 38 percent\u20142,171 fewer abortions\u2014in the month after the Texas abortion ban went into effect. \nThe new study is thought to be the first to examine how the Texas abortion ban may have impacted live births in the state. \n\u201cThere has been a lot of speculation about how restrictive abortion policies will affect the number of babies being born. This research adds valuable information to that discussion,\u201d says Alison Gemmill, PhD, assistant professor in the Bloomberg School\u2019s Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health and one of the study\u2019s lead authors. \u201cAlthough our study doesn't detail why these extra births occurred, our findings strongly suggest that a considerable number of pregnant individuals in Texas were unable to overcome barriers to abortion access.\u201d\nFor their analysis, the researchers used statistical modeling to create a \u201csynthetic\u201d Texas based on monthly live birth data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., from 2016 through 2022. The researchers calculated that there would have been 287,289 live births in Texas from April to December 2022 had the abortion ban not gone into effect in September 2021. The number of observed births during this period was 297,088, a difference of 9,799.\n\u201cThe study\u2019s findings highlight how abortion bans have real implications for birthing people, thousands of whom may have had no choice but to continue an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term,\u201d says Suzanne Bell, PhD, MPH, assistant professor in the Bloomberg School\u2019s Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health and one of the study\u2019s lead authors. \u201cNotably, the majority of people who seek abortions live below or close to the poverty line. So many of these birthing people and their families were likely struggling financially even before the recent birth.\u201d \nThe findings come one year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in its landmark Dobbs decision and as more states move to enact abortion restrictions. Separately, a federal lawsuit likely to end up before the U.S. Supreme Court is challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of mifepristone, one of two pills used in most medication abortions. Though mifepristone is still available, the case casts uncertainty over the reproductive rights landscape.\nThe authors note that the results cannot be generalized, as the analysis was restricted to one state.\nThe researchers will explore how the Texas law may have disproportionately impacted certain demographic groups when detailed birth data become available in the coming months.\nThe study was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (P2CHD042854). \nDisclosure: Alison Gemmill reported receiving consulting fees from Population Reference Bureau outside the published work.\n\u201cTexas\u2019 2021 Ban on Abortion in Early Pregnancy and Changes in Live Births\u201d was written by Suzanne O.
