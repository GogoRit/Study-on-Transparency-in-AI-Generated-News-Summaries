The video was accompanied by a post saying that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic platform would allow abortion to continue and that Trump and the Republican platform wanted to protect unborn children.\n\nEven before then, Pavone successfully appealed 2011 restrictions on his ministry that Amarillo Bishop Patrick Zurek had placed on him.\nPavone remained a firm supporter of Trump and in 2020 disputed the outcome of the election won by Joe Biden. Ahead of the election, the Amarillo diocese denounced Pavone\u2019s use of social media for political ends, distanced the diocese from him and said his positions weren\u2019t consistent with Catholic teaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPavone relocated from Amarillo and was allowed to move to Colorado Springs, Colorado. His Twitter handle still features him wearing a \u201cMAGA\u201d hat with a background photo of former President Trump, who is praised by many conservatives for his Supreme Court nominees who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion in the United States.In a tweet Sunday, Pavone sounded defiant, comparing his fate to that of the unborn.\n\n\u201cSo in every profession, including the priesthood, if you defend the #unborn, you will be treated like them! The only difference is that when we are \u2018aborted,\u2019 we continue to speak, loud and clear.\u201dHe later appeared in a social media video wearing a black leather biker jacket over his priestly collar against a faux backdrop of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica vowing that the anti-abortion \u201cwar\u201d would continue and denouncing the \u201ccancel culture\u201d of the church that he said had persecuted him for decades. In a statement on his Priest For Life website, he said that his laicization was \u201cthe result of an abusive process\u201d and that he was considering unspecified legal action against unnamed U.S. bishops.His supporters immediately denounced the defrocking, including the bishop of Tyler, Texas, Joseph Strickland, who referred to U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights as \u201cevil.\u201d\u201cThe blasphemy is that this holy priest is canceled while an evil president promotes the denial of truth & the murder of the unborn at every turn, Vatican officials promote immorality & denial of the deposit of faith & priests promote gender confusion devastating lives\u2026evil,\u201d Strickland tweeted.\n\nIn his letter, Pierre cited information from the Congregation for Clergy that Pavone had been laicized \u2014 he can no longer present himself as a priest \u2014 after being found guilty in a canonical proceeding \u201cof blasphemous communications on social media and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop.\u201d The letter was first reported by Catholic News Agency.The statement said Pavone was given \u201cample opportunity to defend himself\u201d as well as to submit to his bishop. \u201cIt was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions.\u201dThe statement concluded that since Priests for Life is not a Catholic organization, it would be up to the group to determine whether he could continue his role \u201cas a lay person.\u201dLaicization, or being reduced to the lay state, is one of the harshest sanctions in the church\u2019s canon law for priests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
