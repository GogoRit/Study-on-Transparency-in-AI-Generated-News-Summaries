Such women are banned from terminating their pregnancies under a recent Constitutional Tribunal ruling that outlaws almost all legal legal abortions in Poland.\nIn a scheme launched today, opposition-controlled Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Poland\u2019s fifth-largest city \u2013 is providing psychological and legal assistance funded from the municipal budget to women who find themselves in such a situation.\n\u201cWe know that help for parents affected by problems concerning severe birth defects is very much needed,\u201d said J\u0119drzej Solarski, the deputy mayor. \u201cThe recent legislative changes have strongly highlighted diverse expectations and attitudes.\u201d\n\nPolish ministry proposes \u201croom to cry in\u201d for women forced to give birth by abortion ban\n\nThe legal support the city is offering includes information on prenatal testing, benefits for parents of sick children, patients\u2019 rights, maternity and paternity leave, and labour law. People interested in receiving the support can register for it online.\nThe city says that the psychological consultations, from which the partners of pregnant women or fathers of new-born babies can also benefit, will be adapted to the individual situation. They will be offered online, by telephone or in person at the local Family Initiatives Centre.\n\u201cI know that every parent who has to face up to a diagnosis of irreversible severe defects of their child experiences their own anxieties and dilemmas,\u201d said Solarski. \u201cAs a city we have been following a pro-family policy for years, and that is why we want to support residents in these very difficult moments too.\u201d\n\nProtests return to Polish streets as anti-abortion ruling finally goes into force\n\nMagdalena Pietrusik-Adamska, director of Pozna\u0144 city hall\u2019s health and social affairs department, hopes that the programme, which will run until at least the end of 2021, will provide \u201creal support\u201d to parents in a difficult situation.\n\u201cWe based our planning of the range of support on identifying the challenges faced by parents finding out that the child whose birth they are awaiting has an incurable illness,\u201d she said. \u201cReceiving information about fatal defects for many parents is a moment when joy drastically changes into tragedy.\u201d\nPozna\u0144 mayor Jacek Ja\u015bkowiak, from centrist opposition party Civic Platform (PO), has attended and supported the mass protests against the anti-abortion ruling. \u201cThe Constitutional Tribunal is a tool [for the government] to introduce changes not accepted by a large part of society by force,\u201d he wrote last year.\nPoland\u2019s ruling national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) has supported the banning of what it calls \u201ceugenic abortions\u201d. October\u2019s ruling came as the result of a request to the Constitutional Tribunal made by over 100 MPs, mainly from PiS.\n\nOver 80% of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll\n\nSince then, PiS figures have called for a support package to be introduced to help women those foetuses are diagnosed with defects. However, the justice ministry drew controversy last month when its spokeswomen suggested that this could include providing women a \u201cseparate room\u201d with the \u201cchance to have a cry\u201d.\nMeanwhile, the effects of the ruling are already beginning to be felt. According to Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, Pozna\u0144 medical university hospital has had to cancel several planned terminations since 27 January, when the ruling entered into force. Prenatal testing has also decreased around Poland.\nOrganisations helping Polish women to go abroad for an abortion have been much busier in recent months, according to a survey conducted by the newspaper a month after the publication of the ruling.\nAbortion without Borders supported 522 Polish women in January this year, compared to 228 in the same month in 2020. And the Abortion Support Network funded more than three times the number of procedures in January and February than the total from the first quarter of last year, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reports.\n\n\u201cAbortion Without Borders\u201d initiative to help Polish women obtain terminations abroad\n\nMain image credit: Jakub Ha\u0142un/Wikimedia Commons (under CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen KoschalkaBen Koschalka is a translator and senior editor at Notes from Poland.
