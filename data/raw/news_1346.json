(KOKH) \u2014 Oklahoma doctors are speaking out in the aftermath of the strictest abortion ban in the country.Once SCOTUS overturned Roe v. Wade, a trigger law went into affect in Oklahoma. One of the bills passed during the 2022 regular legislative session recently took affect, only allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother. That phrase isn't black and white when it comes to medical terms, and Dr. Whitney Driver, an OBGYN at Lakeside Doctors Gynecology & Obstetrics, said many doctors are carefully walking the line between patient health care and avoiding a felony charge.

When someone is actively dying really isn't until they're getting CPR,\" Dr. Driver said. \"I don't think any of us want to be in the position that we're that near death before your doctor feels like they can safety act.\"Dr. Driver has been assisting women with their healthcare decisions for around a decade.But following Oklahoma's anti-abortion laws, in many cases, she said her hands are tied. \"Recently a statement I said to a patient, she asked 'how long does this go on?' And I said 'until you're bleeding so much I don't feel like I can give you a transfusion and keep up,'\" Dr. Driver said. After Governor Stitt fulfilled his promise to sign every pro-life bill that came across his desk, the exception to perform an abortion became to save the life of a mother.RELATED | A person is tampering with security cameras and breaking into vehicles in EdmondBut doctors say that risk is a gray area, and when the consequence of terminating a pregnancy is being behind bars, many are fearful of making those decisions. \"We're putting our minds together and saying 'you think I'm right right? She really needs this intervention?' That's not where you want your doctors coming from when they're taking care of you and making what they think are the best decisions for you,\" Dr. Driver said.  \"You don't want them to be weighing jail time as part of how they make those choices.\"Dr. Driver said for the most part, the decision of whether to end a pregnancy is the same.What has shifted though is the timeline. Doctors now have to wait until the risk is near death.

I've got to make you declare and hope your tube doesn't rupture in the interim,\" Dr. Driver said. Doctors are concerned that the gravity of these day-to-day decisions will force health  care professionals out of the state, therefore restricting the workforce. Dr. Driver believes that this is not a political, but a medical issue. She's concerned women will have to die before the law is given a second look.
