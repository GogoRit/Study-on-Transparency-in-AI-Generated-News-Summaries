Ernst voted in favor of a bill which would provide commonsense protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization and a second bill that would simply require health care practitioners to provide the same degree of care to a baby who survives an abortion as they would any child born naturally premature at the same age.\nYesterday, Ernst joined fellow members of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus on the Senate floor to speak on the importance of both the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. In her speech, Ernst shared the remarkable story of Micah Pickering, a native of Newton, Iowa, who was born prematurely at 22 weeks of gestation\u2014an age at which the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would prohibit abortion\u2014and described how Micah, now 7 years-old, has gone on to lead a healthy and energetic life.\n\nClick here or the image above to watch Senator Ernst\u2019s speech.\nErnst met with Micah and his family earlier in the day in her office.\n\nErnst meets with Micah and his family earlier in the day in her office.\nSenator Ernst\u2019s remarks are below:\n\u201c\u2026 First, I\u2019d like to step back a little bit and take a moment to answer the one key, big picture question at the center of this debate and the debate that we have over life. And the basic question there: is life valuable?\n\u201cAnd my answer to that question is that, absolutely. I see value in every single life, and we all have different ideas on how we measure the value of life, but I can boil it down a little bit.\n\u201cSome folks would say it\u2019s what a human being will bring to this world. Now what that is can be determined by different measures, but what impact does a person have?\n\u201cNow, some of course will see celebrities, they\u2019ll see athletes, they\u2019ll see trailblazers and scientists and say, \u2018wow, they\u2019ve made their mark on the world and they contribute so much. There is so much impact there.\u2019\u00a0\n\u201cBut then I see it in every day common people at home in Iowa as well, and I even reflect upon folks like a friend of my daughters who grew up in our small community of Stanton and he has Down syndrome.\n\u201cAnd yet, he contributed so much and still does to this day in our home community. He\u2019s our hometown spirit coordinator at every football game and he\u2019s leading everyone in their cheers and supporting our hometown teams and this young man brings so much joy to everyone. I\u2019d say that his life has made a huge impact on all that know him.\n\u201cAnd now we can think of the smallest among us as well. That baby in the womb, and how does that baby make an impact?\n\u201cAnd as a mother, you know, I know that other fellow mothers they can relate to this as well. But that baby makes an impact even in the womb.\n\u201cThe experience of pregnancy can change a woman forever\u2013 not just physically, but mentally and emotionally.\n\u201cWomen that I talk to, they\u2019ll often comment on the amazing feeling and bond that they will have with that child that is growing in their womb. They experience that heart beat in the womb.\n\u201cAnd even to the effects that maybe we don\u2019t like to reflect on, I remember the swollen ankles that I had on the last month of pregnancy. You know, no offense to Fred Flintstone, but I had Fred Flintstone feet!\n\u201cYou know even things like that we can reflect on but the impact that having that child carried with me, it changed me forever. I know that other mothers know that.\n\u201cSo, whether it\u2019s from the beginning of a pregnancy of a healthy, healthy full term child; or whether it is a scary premature birth; or for some, the difficulty and life-ending decision to abort, the fact remains that that tiny human being carried within us has forever left a mark on their mother.\n\u201cAnd this truth spurs me on to fight even harder to protect the undeniable value that every human life has. Every human life has value.\n\u201cSo, today, I stand with my pro-life colleagues and asking our pro-choice friends\u2014many of whom are mothers and fathers themselves \u2013 to meet us in the middle.\n\u201cWe may not be able to get on the same page when it comes to recognizing the inherent value that each of these lives holds, but surely we can agree that protecting our most vulnerable from painful death is a unifying and a humanitarian cause.\n\u201cSo what I\u2019d like to do is just tell you the story of my fellow Iowan, Micah Pickering.\n\u201cNow, Micah is joining us on the Hill this week, and I encourage all of my colleagues to take some time to meet this incredible boy \u2013 he will be on the Hill tomorrow.\n\u201cNow, when I first met Micah, he was just a couple years old and his family brought him into my office and I had this picture, I had just this picture in my office, and Micah, then two years old, he ran over to this picture \u2013not knowing that was him \u2013 and he pointed at it and he said, \u2018A baby!\u2019 And, I started to cry and I said, \u2018Yes, Micah, that is a baby.\u2019\n\u201cToday, Micah is happy and he\u2019s healthy, and he is seven years old. Now, he was born at 22 weeks, and that\u2019s some of the babies we are talking about today. They\u2019re born at 22 weeks. Now when Micah was born, he was literally the size of a bag of M&Ms\u2014a tiny baby.\n\u201cNow, folks, can\u2019t we all agree that this is a baby, and that babies like Micah, who survived a premature birth at, again, twenty-two weeks, and we are talking about those that survived, those that are at 20 weeks, which is more than halfway through a pregnancy\u2014are deserving of protection? I agree to that.\n\u201cThe only dividing factor between beautiful Micah and the more than ten thousand children that are aborted after twenty-two weeks gestation, which is what Micah was, the difference, the dividing factor is that\u2026Micah was wanted, by his parents. His parents, Danielle and Clayton, saw his inherent value.\n\u201cThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is a measure that should meet the approval standard of my pro-choice friends because supporting this bill means giving all of the Micah Pickerings of the world an equal fighting chance.\n\u201cThe degree to which a child \u2013 of any age \u2013 is wanted does not diminish their value, and we have an obligation as lawmakers to protect their right to life.\n\u201cBut if we cannot come together in support of a bill to protect viable babies from abortion at the point when they feel pain, then surely\u2026surely a baby who survives an abortion attempt deserves the same degree of care as any other newborn.\n\u201cFolks, just think about it. These babies\u2026their lives\u2026they\u2019ve already survived a horrific abortion attempt and been given a second chance at life.\n\u201cBut without us putting the necessary protections in place, these precious babies can literally be left to die.\n\u201cAnd for those in the medical field who fail to care for these precious newborns, they need to be held accountable.\n\u201cSenator Sasse has helped lead the way in protecting these living babies with his Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act \u2013 a commonsense bill I proudly support.\n\u201cGiven that we have an estimated 143 babies who died between 2003 and 2014 after surviving abortion, it\u2019s clear that we need to strengthen the current law. These babies deserved the basic medical standard of care \u2013 regardless of how wanted they may have been.\n\u201cBut I implore you to think about the issue of life in a new way; one that\u2019s very simple.\n\u201cWhen you think about everyone you come into contact with \u2013 whether it\u2019s your family, your friends, your coworkers, your children, your spouse, even yourself.\n\u201cEvery single person was at one time a defenseless child in their mother\u2019s womb.\n\u201cEvery life \u2013 from the baby who has just been conceived to each and every one of you in this room tonight \u2013 has value.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re that star athlete, whether you are that scientist making new discoveries, whether you\u2019re that hometown cheerleader, every life has value.\n\u201cAnd to my Senate colleagues: We\u2019ve had this debate before, but I ask that you consider these bills with new eyes\u2026focused on the inherent value of life.\n\u201cYou have the opportunity to save lives, and I hope that you will join me in doing so.\n\u201cAnd again I thank the senator from Montana for raining this issue this evening and I\u2019m proud to be a yes vote on both of these tremendous bills and I hope that we can get others to join us in that effort. Thank you, senator.\u201d\n###\n\n\n\n\n\n Print\n      \n\n\n\n Email\n      \n\n\n\n Share\n      \n\n\n\n Tweet\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Protecting Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Previous\n          \n\n\n\n            Next\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            About\n          \n\n\n\n            Assistance For Iowans\n          \n\n\n\n            Priorities\n          \n\n\n\n            News\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Ernst Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Ernst Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Ernst Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Ernst Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              About\n            \n\n\n\n              Assistance for Iowans\n            \n\n\n\nCasework\n\n\n\n\nTraveling Office Hours\n\n\n\n\nVisiting Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\nFlag Requests\n\n\n\n\nAcademy Nominations\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Request\n\n\n\n\nInternships\n\n\n\n\nWhistleblowers\n\n\n\n\nResources For Veterans\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Priorities\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              News\n            \n\n\n\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n\nColumns\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n\nHear From Joni\n\n\n\n\nEmail Joni\n\n\n\n\nOffice Locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwebsite-search\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
