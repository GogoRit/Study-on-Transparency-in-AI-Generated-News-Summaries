    "text": "More protests break out in Poland as near-total ban on abortion comes into effect | SBS NewsSBS NewsEuropeMore protests break out in Poland as near-total ban on abortion comes into effectThousands of people across Poland have demonstrated to protest against a court ruling that effectively bans abortion in the country.People take part in a protest against the abortion ban in Warsaw, Poland, on 27 January. Source: Getty ImagesPoland\u2019s government has put into effect a constitutional court decision banning terminations of pregnancies with foetal defects, as conservative policies increasingly take root in one of Europe\u2019s most devout Catholic countries.The October ruling had led to weeks of massive protests, forcing the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government to delay its implementation.Small protests gathered late on Wednesday following an announcement PiS would take the official step to enforce the decision imminently, and abortion rights activists announced more would take place on Thursday.READ MORETens of thousands march in the biggest protest so far against Poland's abortion rulingAbortion has emerged as one of the most divisive issues since PiS took power in 2015, promising poorer, older and less educated Poles a return to a traditional society mixed with generous welfare policies.The court\u2019s verdict was published in the official gazette late on Wednesday.\u201cThis idiotic ruling will not prevent abortions,\u201d said Cezary Jasi\u0144ski, a 23-year-old student, standing in front of the Constitutional Tribunal building in central Warsaw.\u201cBut for every woman who will experience pain because of this ruling, or will be forced to give birth to a child with Down\u2019s Syndrome, they (court judges) will be to blame.\u201dPeople hold signs reading (L) 'Being a woman in Poland endangers your life and health' and (R) 'Bondage to god' as they take protest in Warsaw on 28 January. Source: AFPLast year\u2019s protests quickly morphed into an eruption of anger against the government, particularly among young people, suggesting PiS may face a fresh challenge from new voters in coming years.On Wednesday, officials said the government would now focus on assisting parents of disabled children, although PiS as well as its centrist predecessors have been accused by critics of not doing enough in that regard.\u201cThe state can no longer take a life away only because someone is sick, disabled, in poor health,\u201d PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski said.READ MORE'Traumatised' women in Poland are looking abroad for help after the country's abortion rulingThe party denies opposition criticism that it had influenced the court, called the Constitutional Tribunal. It is one of the judicial bodies PiS overhauled during reforms that the European Union said has politicised the courts.\u201cNo law-abiding government should respect this ruling,\u201d Borys Budka, leader of Poland\u2019s largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, told reporters.Access to abortion has declined even without the legislative curbs as more doctors refuse to perform them on religious grounds and many women seek abortions abroad.Under the new rules, terminations will be permitted only in cases of rape and incest, and when the mother\u2019s life or health is endangered. Doctors performing illegal abortions in Poland face jail.In a justification published on Wednesday, the tribunal left open the possibility of the parliament regulating some circumstances covered by the law.READ MORERapture as Argentina approves landmark abortion billMarek Suski, a PiS lawmaker, said the party would consider introducing new rules that could allow the most extreme foetal deformities to be excluded. But political commentators say consensus between PiS and its arch-conservative governing allies would be difficult to achieve.\u201cIn cases when the foetus doesn\u2019t have a skull or has no chance to live outside the womb, there should be a choice. We will work on this,\u201d Ms Suski told public radio.Opinion surveys have shown some decline in PiS popularity in recent months, but an opinion poll by the government-affiliated CBOS pollster showed it edging back up to 35 per cent this month, from 30 per cent in October. PiS and its two small parliamentary allies won re-election in 2019 with a 44 per cent share of the vote.Share3 min readPublished 29 January 2021 10:45amSource: Reuters, SBSTagsWorldSocial issuesPoliticsShare this with family and friendsCopy linkShareRecommended for youPolice reveal day Ballarat woman Samantha Murphy was allegedly murderedMissing PeopleSam Kerr's English club breaks silence: 'It's a difficult time for her'MatildasKate Middleton apologises for 'any confusion' caused by editing of family photoBritish Royal FamilyA local doctor went for a walk.
