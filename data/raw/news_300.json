She was pregnant for the third time and working as a housekeeper; the stakes were personally huge, and time sensitive. She signed the affidavit for a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s abortion ban as \u201cJane Roe\u201d, the anonymous plaintiff in the landmark supreme court case which, in 1973, secured abortion access for women in all 50 states.Jane Roe\u2019s deathbed confession exposes the immorality of the Christian right | Arwa MahdawiRead moreFor years afterward, McCorvey went public as a hero for abortion rights, though she never actually received the procedure. So it was a shock when she dramatically \u201cconverted\u201d to evangelical Christianity (and later Catholicism) in 1995, joining the ranks of the anti-abortion movement that has effectively gutted abortion access across the US in the decades since. For 25 years, McCorvey\u2019s shift was framed as an archetype of redemption, the Christian right\u2019s greatest evidence of the personal sin of abortion, a lethal narrative of regret.Except much of that narrative was a lie, at least according to McCorvey in a new documentary filmed in the final year of her life (she died of heart failure aged 69 in February 2017). An hour into the 80-minute film AKA Jane Roe, McCorvey, hooked to oxygen in her nursing home room in Katy, Texas, reconfigures her \u201cconversion\u201d as less a change of heart than a change for cash. \u201cThis is my deathbed confession,\u201d she says with a shallow laugh. The film\u2019s director, Nick Sweeney, asks McCorvey: \u201cDid [the evangelicals] use you as a trophy?\u201d \u201cOf course. I was the big fish,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you think they would say that you used them?\u201d Sweeney responds. \u201cWell,\u201d says McCorvey, \u201cI think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201dThe admission, filmed in 2016 but revealed to media this week, generated shock and dismay, particularly for women who grew up with McCorvey\u2019s flip lorded over by the anti-abortion movement. But in the context of the film, which establishes McCorvey\u2019s history as an unreliable narrator, and the anti-abortion movement\u2019s decades of smokescreens and lies in protecting its argument, it\u2019s less a bombshell than an eye-widening confirmation. As AKA Jane Roe reveals, the real Jane Roe \u2013 survivor of neglect and abuse, working-class, an out lesbian for decades, a woman often craving validation \u2013 never fit tidily into either the sweeping, idealistic image of the reproductive rights movement nor the redemption archetype constructed by anti-abortionists.According to Sweeney, the headline-grabbing \u201cdeathbed confession\u201d arose \u201corganically\u201d over the process of filming. \u201cI absolutely did not expect it to go in the direction that it did,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBut I was shocked at the things that Norma admitted to and told me.\u201d The film presents documents disclosing $456,911 in \u201cbenevolent gifts\u201d from the anti-abortion movement to McCorvey over an unspecified time. Asked directly by Sweeney, the Rev Flip Benham, who targeted McCorvey for conversion in the mid-90s, opening an office next to her house, and touts their relationship in the film, denies paying McCorvey, but also adds: \u201cYeah, but she chose to be used. That\u2019s called work. That\u2019s what you\u2019re paid to be doing!\u201dThe Rev Rob Schenck, who accompanied McCorvey in many of her appearances as a \u201cborn-again\u201d evangelical but has since publicly reversed his stance on abortion, says McCorvey was \u201ca target\u201d of the movement, a \u201cneedy\u201d person easily exploited by clergy \u201cused to the those personalities\u201d, and that \u201cat a few points, she was actually on the payroll, as it were\u201d. McCorvey was at times \u201ccoached on what to say\u201d in her public appearances, to make sure she stayed on message. \u201cShe was our Oscar,\u201d he says, \u201cand we were going to put her on the mantle and show her off to the world.\u201dView image in fullscreenNorma McCorvey, Jane Roe, in the 1973 court case, left, and her attorney, Gloria Allred, hold hands as they leave the supreme court building in Washington. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APWhich is perhaps why, when Sweeney first reached out to her in April 2016, McCorvey was \u201csuspicious\u201d. What congregation did he belong to? she asked. What anti-abortion group? \u201cI think she was very grateful that I was somebody who was uninvolved in the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that was part of the reason why she agreed to meet up and why she was so honest and volunteered all of the things that she did.\u201d At that point, McCorvey\u2019s health was already in decline, and \u201cI think she felt like she had nothing to gain and nothing to lose at this point in her life, and she wanted to set the record straight on her own terms,\u201d said Sweeney.Using interviews filmed over 10 months and archival footage, AKA Jane Roe traces McCorvey\u2019s life as a survivor of abuse hungry for recognition, prickly but vulnerable. Her alcoholic mother was not prepared to raise her, while her father walked out when she was young and barely returned. She remembers her early teenage years an all-girls state reform school, where she was placed at 10 after robbing a convenience store, fondly; there was structure there, and friends, and burgeoning sexual relationships with her classmates. She got pregnant for the first time at 16, after meeting and marrying a man who propositioned her at the Sonic fast-food restaurant where she worked. When she signed the Jane Roe affidavit in 1969, she was snagged, as one pro-choice activist explains in the film, by a paradox of the abortion rights movement: with her rough edges, she wasn\u2019t an ideal \u201cposter girl\u201d for abortion access, but that poster girl couldn\u2019t have been the plaintiff in the first place.That paradox underscored McCorvey\u2019s alienation from the reproductive rights movement once she went public in the 1980s (she did not match the cool glamour of Gloria Steinem, the broad appeal of Hollywood activists like Cybil Shepherd, the sanded-down Hollywood character played by Holly Hunter in the 1989 movie Roe vs Wade). The film also recaps her partnership with the lawyer Gloria Allred, who reacts with shock to McCorvey\u2019s confession, to capture attention for abortion rights in the late 80s and early 90s.View image in fullscreenNorma McCorvey in AKA Jane Roe. Photograph: APThe \u201cconversion\u201d remains baffling, especially as Benham and his notorious organization Operation Rescue forced McCorvey to end her 25-plus-year relationship with her girlfriend, Connie Gonzalez. But the arc of McCorvey\u2019s life as someone both scrapping to get by and eager to please is clear. \u201cAt different points in her life, people on all sides have wanted Norma McCorvey to fit their expectations or to suit their aims,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cThere\u2019s a temptation to make somebody like Jane Roe into a trophy or an emblem and ignore the complexity of her life.\u201dWhereas in old news clips, McCorvey appears tepid, on script for the intended audience, in AKA Jane Roe, she comes off as unburdened \u2013 conspiratorial, seditious, a foul-mouthed quoter of Macbeth. Even her \u201cdeathbed confession\u201d is itself revealed with a half-ironic shrug. Sweeney fondly remembered her \u201cgallows humor\u201d that he got to know during filming. \u201cThat real Norma is a really funny, entertaining person,\u201d he said.In the film, after her reveal, Sweeney asks: \u201cIt was all an act?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d she confirms. \u201cI did it well, too. I am a good actress. Of course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d Taken at her word, her ultimate stance on abortion was characteristically, as she says, \u201clooking out for Norma\u2019s salvation and Norma\u2019s ass\u201d: \u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine. That\u2019s no skin off my ass,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s why they call it \u2018choice\u2019. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d\nAKA Jane Roe premieres on FX in the US on 22 May, Hulu on 23 May and in the UK at a later date\nExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryHuluAbortionRoe v WadeWomenFactual TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
