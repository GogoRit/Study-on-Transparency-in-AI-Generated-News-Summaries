We support women through all stages of life \u2014 pregnancy, parenting, adoption, and post-abortive regret \u2014 unlike the abortion lobby that has always put dollars signs above women.\u201d\u00a0\nWASHINGTON D.C. (10-07-2022) \u2013\u00a0TOMORROW, Students for Life of America (SFLA) will be countering\u00a0Women\u2019s Marches\u00a0in\u00a0six\u00a0cities nationwide this Saturday, October 8, 2022, in order to represent the fact that women don\u2019t need abortion to succeed and the majority of women reject the violence of abortion. SFLA demonstrators will be holding signs that read \u201cAbortion Betrays Women,\u201d \u201cLet Their Hearts Beat,\u201d and \u201cDear Women, The Abortion Industry is Lying to You.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhile pro-life women have been\u00a0repeatedly uninvited, and the\u00a0Women\u2019s March\u00a0has stated outright in a\u00a0recent tweet, \u201cWe\u2019re not just pro-choice. We are proudly, unapologetically pro-abortion,\u201d SFLA\u00a0team members and the Pro-Life Generation have continued to show up year after year to be a voice for the preborn and the women targeted by the abortion industry.\u00a0\nAfter the\u00a0Women\u2019s March\u00a0dropped a pro-life feminist organization as an official partner of the march, SFLA President Kristan Hawkins spoke out on the\u00a0Women\u2019s March\u00a0tying itself to the abortion industry. Hawkins told the\u00a0Washington Post:\n\u201cIt further proves that this is what the abortion industry does. They have taken over any talk of feminism in the country to point out that if you are antiabortion, you are accused of being anti-woman.\u00a0\n\n\nMEDIA ADVISORY: \nSFLA\u00a0team members and the Pro-Life Generation will be available for interviews and B-roll at these\u00a0Women\u2019s\u00a0March\u00a0locations across the country:\u00a0\nAtlanta, Georgia:\u00a0The Atlanta counter event will take place at Liberty Plaza in Atlanta, GA 30334 at 3pm local time and will be coordinated by Cori Woods.\u00a0Austin, Texas:\u00a0The Austin counter event will take place at the Long Center for the Performing Arts at 701 W Riverside Dr, Austin, TX 78704 at 10:15 -11:30 a.m. local time and will be coordinated by Faith Elwonger.\u00a0Boston, Massachusetts:\u00a0The Boston counter event will take place at Massachusetts State House, 24 Beacon Street, Boston, MA, 02133 at 12pm local time and will be coordinated by Stephanie Luiz.\u00a0Denver, Colorado:\u00a0The Denver counter event will take place at Civic Center Park, 101 14th Avenue, Denver, CO, 80204 at 12pm local time and will be coordinated by Brooke Faulkner.\u00a0New York City, New York:\u00a0The New York City counter event will take place at Washington Square Park at 50-58 Centre St, New York, NY 10007 at 12pm local time and will be coordinated by Taylor McGee.\u00a0Washington, D.C.:\u00a0The Washington D.C. counter event will take place at Folger Park at 11:00 am local time and will be coordinated by Mary Briganti.\u00a0\n\n\nEach year, SFLA has experienced harassment and hostility from abortion supporters at these events.
