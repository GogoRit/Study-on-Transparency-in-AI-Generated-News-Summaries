Every life is meaningful, and our actions significant.\u201dDEMOCRATIC FEARMONGERING\u201c76 percent of women seeking an abortion say they would choose life if their circumstances were different.\u201cInstead of promoting ways to support women and children with better health care, education, and financial stability and changing their circumstances, Democrats, including President Biden, are spreading fear, anxiety, and misinformation.\u201cThis is a blatant attempt to spread fear and present abortion at any stage of pregnancy as a woman\u2019s only option.\u201cSo, I want to be very clear. It is already unconstitutional to prevent a woman\u00a0from traveling between states.\u201cThe pro-life movement does not support and has always rejected criminalizing and punishing women, period.\u201cState laws currently in effect have exceptions to save the life of the mother.\u201cPro-life laws do not prevent women from getting care they need in cases of miscarriages and ectopic\u00a0pregnancies.\u201dTHIS BILL PROTECTS PREDATORS\u201cRegarding this legislation, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, I have many questions and concerns.\u201cIts vague language\u2014designed to promote more abortions\u2014undermines parent consent for minors, opens loopholes for abuse, and eliminates medical supervision for chemical abortions.\u201cThis bill does nothing to explicitly prevent an unrelated adult or a sexual abuser from taking a minor out-of-state for an abortion, without parent consent.\u201cIt would prevent health care professionals, social workers, and schools in every state from reporting instances of child abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect because that could be seen as delaying or hindering access to abortion.\u201cIt also undermines parental rights.\u201cParents can be targeted by the federal government and sued for wanting to help their child just by asking them to delay traveling to get an abortion.\u201cIf their child is 16 for example, the parents lose power to protect their teenager from being coerced by an older man to get an abortion.\u201dHARMING THE HEALTH OF WOMEN\u201cThe Ensuring Access to Abortion Act undermines the health and safety of women.\u201cBy pre-empting state laws regulating the practice of medicine, it overrides the majority of states that have determined it is safest for doctors to prescribe pills for chemical abortions.\u201cThis puts women and minors in danger if they experience complications.\u201cFinally, these same provisions give sexual abusers and human traffickers more direct access to chemical abortions in all 50 states.\u201cIt ensures that doctors in states like California, where there is no parent consent, can effectively become pill mills, by prescribing and mailing abortion drugs to children and minors\u00a0and end lives all over the country.\u201cThis is extreme.\u201dDEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS\u201cAgain, I\u00a0ask my colleagues to abandon this agenda for unlimited abortions with no restrictions.\u201cIt only promotes more fear, pain, and dehumanization of the most vulnerable, the helpless among us.\u201cInstead, let\u2019s come together around the human rights of every person in this country\u2014born and unborn.\u201cLet\u2019s celebrate the dignity, value, and potential of every person.\u201cThis is our chance to lead a new era of\u00a0hope and healing in our country. For every person\u2014for moms and their babies at every stage of life.\u201cEvery life is worth living.\u201cI urge a \u2018no\u2019 vote on this bill and reserve the balance of my time.\u201dShare onEnergy & Commerce CommitteeOffice2125 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20515Main: (202) 225-3641Press: (202) 226-4972 Minority WebsitePrivacyAccessibility"
