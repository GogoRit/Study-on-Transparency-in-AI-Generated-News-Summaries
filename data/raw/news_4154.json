The role of UN Volunteers\u00a0in supporting women\u2019s rights has\u00a0become critical during the Coronavirus\u00a0pandemic.\n\nAs frontline responders, health professionals\u00a0and beyond, women are contributing to addressing the COVID-19 outbreak daily. Women are mainly responsible for household care and are at increased risk of infection and loss of livelihood. During the pandemic, they are often the victims of domestic violence, with limited access to sexual and reproductive health.\nIn response to the crisis, UN Women in Turkey is using the latest information to understand and address gender challenges during COVID-19. National UN Volunteers support UN women in diverse ways.\n\nPersonnel of the UN Women office in Turkey\u00a0have been working remotely for the past two months. Our national UN Volunteers assiduously support our work in driving gender-sensitive responses to the COVID-19 crisis. --Asya Varbanova, Country Director of UN Women in Turkey\n\nCommunications.\u00a0The need to reduce gender inequalities in the division of domestic labour and rising unpaid care for chores performed by women has spiraled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The HeForShe movement in Turkey works closely with such influential partners as Ko\u00e7 Holding and Fenerbah\u00e7e Sports Club to tackle the situation.\nHeForShe Turkey recently launched the #EvdeHeForShe social media campaign, which calls on men to share in household work to advance equality. National UN Volunteer\u00a0Ipek Naz \u00c7\u0131nar, serving as Communications Assistant, is contributing to the development and implementation of this campaign.\n\nTo increase campaign visibility, we invited celebrities to join in and\u00a0reached approximately 500 thousand people on three different HeForShe Turkey (@heforsheturkiye) social media channels. Participants included famous actors\u00a0Boran Kuzum and\u00a0An\u0131l Altan and Fenerbah\u00e7e Sports Club athletes Ahmet D\u00fcverio\u011flu, Izzet \u00dcnver\u00a0and Caner Dengin. --Ipek Naz \u00c7\u0131nar, national UN Volunteer\n\nAnother national volunteer in a communications\u00a0role,\u00a0Erman Fermanc\u0131\u00a0is using social media to generate localized information on the gender implications of COVID-19. From the onset of the pandemic, UN Women has increased its social media reach, providing vital information to thousands of social media users.\nIn the past three months, UN Women in Turkey has launched an official Twitter account. The agency increased its Instagram and Facebook followers by 146 per cent\u00a0and 7.8 per cent\u00a0respectively, reaching over half a million users.\n\nWe raise awareness by sharing content on violence against women, support mechanisms, and the role of women\u00a0and their importance in COVID-19 response via\u00a0Instagram live sessions. --Erman Fermanc\u0131, national UN Volunteer\n\nProgramme Adaptation.\u00a0Continuous coordination is vital as agencies adapt current activities and programmes to the COVID-19 context.\u00a0Ekin Su Y\u0131lmaz, programme assistant at UN Women, generates advocacy and information materials, while communicating with civil society organizations.\n\nWe continued\u00a0supporting civil society organizations services during COVID-19 and refered them to additional emergency funds. --Ekin Su Y\u0131lmaz, national UN Youth Volunteer\n\nFellow national volunteer\u00a0Melinda Demirel\u00a0is currently contributing to the project Gender Equality in Political Leadership and Participation in Turkey. She supports partner selection processes in response to COVID-19 and violence against women. She oversees logistics for rearranging field activities due to the pandemic\u00a0and disseminates COVID-19 information to stakeholders.\n\nWe inform women leaders and members of parliament\u00a0about the impact of COVID-19 on women and girls, encouraging them to take action as decision-makers. --Melinda Demirel, national UN Volunteer\n\nTechnical support.\u00a0Irem Polat\u00a0serves as a UN Volunteer\u00a0Administrative Assistant at the UN Women Europe and Central Asia Office and is now engaged with COVID-19-related procurement. She develops processes for data collection and analysis for gender-inclusive COVID-19 response in Serbia. Irem procures protective items for local communities and UN offices and also manages\u00a0processes for the rapid gender assessment of COVID-19 in Tajikistan and Macedonia.\n\nAnother inspiring procurement activity is the contracting process with civil society organizations\u00a0providing SOS helplines for women who are victims of violence in Serbia, in order\u00a0to keep these functioning and accessible during the state of emergency. --Irem Polat, national UN Volunteer\n\n\nThis article was prepared with the kind assistance of Online Volunteer Anderson Ezie.\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope and the CIS\n\n\n\nCOVID-19\nUN Women\nGender-based violence\n\n\n\nSustainable Development Goal\n\n\nSDG 3: Good health and well-being\nSDG 5: Gender equality\nSDG 17: Partnerships for the goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nlinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube-play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nBecome a UN Volunteer\n\n\n\nHow to register in our Talent Pool\n\n\nVolunteer in your country\n\n\nVolunteer abroad\n\n\nVolunteer online\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\nEngage a UN Volunteer\n\n\n\nUN Partner Toolkit\n\n\nUnited Nations partners\n\n\nRequest UN Volunteers\n\n\nEngage Online Volunteers\u00a0\n\n\nUnified Conditions of Service\n\n\nDiversity Mosaic: 77 inspirations\n\n\n\n\nVolunteerism\n\n\n\nState of the World's Volunteerism\n\n\nVolunteerism and the Global Goals\n\n\nKnowledge Portal on Volunteerism\n\n\nPlan of Action 2016-2030\n\n\nInternational Volunteer Day\n\n\n\n\nAbout UNV\n\n\n\nAnnual Reports\n\n\nPublications database\n\n\nEmployment & internships\n\n\nProcurement information\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nUNV funding partners\n\n\n\nSpecial Voluntary Fund\n\n\nSponsor UN Volunteers\n\n\nUNV and the private sector\n\n\n\n\nOur legacy\n\n\n\nA short history of UNV\n\n\nUNV at 50\n\n\nUNV alumni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional offices\n\n\nMy UNV Profile\n\n\nUNV eCampus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis website benefits from the continuous support of Online Volunteers.\nUNV is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\n\n\nUNV Scam Alert\nUNV Privacy Policy\nUNV Website Terms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
