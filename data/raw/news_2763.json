Ralph Northam, who has expressed approval of legislation legalizing abortion up to the moment of birth.\u00a0[RELATED: WATCH: Leftist students, encouraged by College Dems leader, destroy pro-life display in broad daylight]Biden and Democrats just clarified the fact that they are fully in favor of (very) LATE TERM ABORTION, right up until the time of birth, and beyond - which would be execution. Biden even endorsed the Governor of Virginia, who stated this clearly for all to hear. GET OUT & VOTE!!!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2020Conti quoted the president\u2019s tweet, declaring that \u201cTHIS IS NOT REAL\u201d and \u201cnone of this actually happens.\u201d She has since deleted her tweet.\u201dI am one of a few hundred MDs in this country that are trained in complex abortion care,\u201d Conti wrote. \u201cTHIS IS NOT REAL. None of this actually happens (and I can\u2019t believe I have to keep saying this).\u201dCreated Equal, a nonprofit that seeks to inform voters about abortion, told Campus Reform that \u201call evidence points to Conti not telling the truth,\u201d as New Mexico, New York, and many other states allow abortion up to birth.Created Equal External Affairs Assistant Lexie Hall pointed Campus Reform to the website of an abortion provider with sites in Nebraska and Maryland, which openly states on its website that it provides \u201cabortion care throughout pregnancy, meaning 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester abortion care.\u201dThis particular provider provides explicit details of how it performs abortions on pregnancies \u201c25 weeks and up.\u201dHall also referred Campus Reform to Jill Stanek\u2019s February 2020 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Stanek explained that she was a nurse in a hospital that regularly left babies who survived abortions in the hospital\u2019s Soiled Utility Room until they died.Likewise, Human Coalition spokeswoman Heather Cirmo pointed Campus Reform to research from the Guttmacher Institute -- a pro-choice research organization -- suggesting that late-term abortions compose at least 1.3 percent of all abortions in the United States.[RELATED: Georgia Tech coughs up $50k to settle free speech lawsuit involving MLK\u2019s niece]Live Action Director of External Affairs Alison Centofante pointed Campus Reform to an analysis of state abortion data, indicating that more than 100,000 late-term abortions may have occurred in a single year. In many states, second and third-trimester abortions account for up to 17 percent of all abortions, according to Live Action.\u00a0Campus Reform reached out to Conti for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.\u00a0Follow the author of this article on Twitter:\u00a0@BenZeisloftShare this articleBen Zeisloft  Former Staff Reporter, Daily WireBen Zeisloft is a former Staff Reporter at the Daily Wire.
