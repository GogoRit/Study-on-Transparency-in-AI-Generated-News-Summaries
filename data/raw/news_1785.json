Indiana became the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court ended nearly a half-century of federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022.\n\nAlthough Planned Parenthood\u2019s four Indiana abortion clinics have stopped providing abortions, Gibron said its 11 health centers across the state continue offering a wide range of services, including emergency contraception and birth control, even as the group works to help Hoosiers obtain out-of-state abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge approves new murder charges against man in case of slain Indiana teens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Gov.

It includes exceptions allowing abortions at hospitals in cases of rape or incest before 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also allows abortions up to 20 weeks to protect the life and physical health of the mother or if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly.\n\nBefore Indiana\u2019s ban was passed, the state\u2019s laws generally prohibited abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and tightly restricted them after the 13th week.The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, representing Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic operators, challenged the ban\u2019s constitutionality. But in a June 30 ruling, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the ban doesn\u2019t violate the state constitution. Its ruling struck down a preliminary injunction that had kept the ban on hold, although that ruling has yet to be certified to officially take effect.On Monday \u2014 the last day for it to do so \u2014 the ACLU of Indiana filed a petition for a rehearing with the high court asking it to keep the ban on hold while it pursues a narrower preliminary injunction in a trial court to address the scope of the ban\u2019s exemption allowing women facing serious health risks to obtain abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat filing delays the certification of the court\u2019s ruling while it considers whether to grant or deny that petition, said court spokesperson Kathryn Dolan. It\u2019s unclear how long it may take the high court to decide the matter. But the state attorney general\u2019s office, which had 15 days to respond to the rehearing request, filed it Tuesday, urging the court to \u201cpromptly deny plaintiffs\u2019 groundless and exceedingly calculated rehearing petition\u201d and calling it \u201ca transparent attempt\u201d to delay certification of the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nAttorney General\u2019s office spokeswoman Katlyn Milligan said in a statement Tuesday that, \u201cOn the eve of Indiana\u2019s pro-life law going into effect, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood made a desperate attempt to prevent Indiana from enforcing our own law. We responded to this filing immediately and are now waiting for the Court to rule.\u201dPlanned Parenthood ended abortion services at its four clinics Monday in light of the state\u2019s guidance and the uncertainty over when the court will certify its abortion ban ruling, Gibron said.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that it can happen at any point. The Supreme Court could certify it this afternoon,\u201d she said.Gibron said Indiana\u2019s abortion ban will \u201ctarget Hoosiers of color, indigenous communities and those already marginalized by our health care system.\u201dIndiana\u2019s two other abortion clinics, which are not operated by Planned Parenthood and are both located in Indianapolis, have also stopped providing abortion care. In a statement, Clinic for Women owner LaDonna Prince said the clinic ended abortions on Monday, calling it \u201ca dark day for Indiana and for the country.\u201dThe state\u2019s other abortion clinic, Women\u2019s Med, stopped providing abortions on Friday, a representative said Tuesday.Although Planned Parenthood\u2019s Indiana abortion clinics are no longer performing abortions, Gibron said a \u201cpatient navigation team\u201d is working to help patients get out-of-state abortions. That includes helping schedule appointments and finding ways to help them pay the costs of traveling out of state.\n\nAdjacent Illinois and Michigan \u2014 states where abortion remains legal \u2014 will most likely become the destinations for many Indiana residents seeking out-of-state abortion care, said Gibron, who is CEO for Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky.Planned Parenthood of Illinois had prepared for years for the possibility of Roe v. Wade falling, and it opened clinics near the Indiana and Wisconsin borders in 2018 and 2020 in anticipation of those states restricting access to abortion, said Kristen Schultz, the affiliate\u2019s chief strategy and operations officer.She said patients from Indiana nearly doubled after the state\u2019s ban briefly went into effect last September and that traffic is expected to rise again starting this week. Schultz said more doctors, advanced nurse practitioners and medical assistants have been hired to accommodate the expected surge.\u201cThe demand has increased, the challenges have increased when patients show up at our doors having traveled eight or ten or 12 hours. That\u2019s an increased burden on the patient. And our staff really feel that,\u201d she said.___Claire Savage, a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative, contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
