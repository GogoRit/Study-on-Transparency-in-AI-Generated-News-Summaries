People gathered at Poland's embassies in Stockholm, Lisbon and Rome in solidarity.\nPoland, a mainly Catholic country, already had one of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws. The ruling that declared it unconstitutional to terminate pregnancies for congenital defects amounts to a near-total ban.\nIn Warsaw on Wednesday, demonstrators marched from the office of Ordo Iuris, a conservative group that has been lobbying for years for a full abortion ban, to the parliament building, which was surrounded by police officers in riot gear. Large crowds also filled the streets in other major cities, including Krakow, Wroclaw, Szczecin and Lodz.\nIn parliament, Poland's most powerful politician, ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, lashed out at opposition lawmakers, accusing them from the podium of inciting people to protest during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n[Video not showing up above? Click here to watch \u00bb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7FoojxNKw]\n\"You are destroying Poland,\" Kaczynski told them. \"You are exposing a lot of people to death, you are criminals.\"\nThe nationwide strike and protests have been largely organized by Women's Strike, a women's-rights initiative. The protests take place as a standoff deepens between angry demonstrators and Poland's conservative government, which pushed for last week's court ruling and has vowed not to back down.\nOpinion polls show a majority of Poles oppose the constitutional court's ruling and the protesters have even found support from unexpected groups, including farmers and miners.\nAnother opinion poll on Wednesday showed falling support for the Law and Justice party.\n\"I am so furious! They have no right to decide about my life, about my personal decisions, about my future,\" Julka Wojciechowska, 19, a student protesting in Warsaw, said. \"They don't understand young people. They don't understand the world now, but they are trying to regulate our lives. We will never allow that.\"\nRage over the ruling, which would deny legal abortions to women even in cases of fatal birth defects, has been directed at the Roman Catholic Church and ruling party leader, Kaczynski.\nKaczynski has said in the past that pregnancies involving even fetuses that are badly damaged and have no chance of survival outside the womb should \"still end up in a birth, so that the child can be baptized, buried, have a name.\"\nOn Sunday, women entered Polish churches on Sunday to disrupt Masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings.\nKaczynski accused the rioters of seeking \"to destroy Poland\" late Tuesday and called on his party's supporters to defend churches \"at any cost.\"\nOn Wednesday, people heeded that call, gathering outside churches and singing religious songs.\nInformation for this article was contributed by Monika Scislowska of The Associated Press.\n\n\n\nWomen's rights activists with posters of the Women's Strike action protest in Warsaw, Poland, Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2020 against recent tightening of Poland's restrictive abortion law.
