It\u2019s an action that didn\u2019t attract many headlines, amid a contentious election and global pandemic, but it\u2019s significant nonetheless.\nA vitally important mission is at stake. The declaration seeks to unite countries to work together to achieve four important goals: improved health for women; the preservation of human life; strengthening the family as the foundational unit of society; and protecting national sovereignty.\nThis growing partnership and the goals of the declaration constitute a clear signal to the world that the U.S. government is committed to\u00a0pushing back\u00a0against the aggressive abortion promotion that occurs within the United Nations ecosystem.\nThe Trump administration also recently proposed a new\u00a0regulation\u00a0to apply the terms of the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy to \u201ccontracts and subcontracts funded partially or wholly with global health assistance funding.\u201d If finalized, the rule would extend pro-life protections to approximately\u00a040 percent\u00a0of global health foreign assistance not currently subject to the policy.\nFor background, among President Donald Trump\u2019s first acts in office was to issue an\u00a0executive order\u00a0reinstating the life-affirming \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d which ensures that American taxpayers do not fund international organizations that perform or promote abortion overseas. The Mexico City Policy was first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Since then, the policy has been enforced by every Republican president and suspended by every Democratic president shortly after being inaugurated.\nJust a few months later, the administration announced the\u00a0expansion\u00a0and implementation of the Mexico City Policy\u2014now known as PLGHA.\nThe Mexico City Policy required foreign non-governmental organizations that receive funds from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and State Department for family planning assistance to certify that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning. The expanded policy applies to more Department of State, USAID, and Department of Defense funds\u2014specifically, an estimated\u00a0$7.3 billion\u00a0in FY2020 alone.\nImportantly, the policy does not reduce funding for global health assistance, in spite of claims to the contrary by abortion advocates who routinely insist that PLGHA\u2014which they call the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d\u2014deprives women around the world from receiving necessary health care. Rather, it seeks to disentangle U.S. aid dollars from the abortion industry and separate American taxpayers from non-governmental organizations that do not respect innocent human life.\nA\u00a0review\u00a0of the policy released in 2020 found that most foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive U.S. funding accepted the terms of the\u00a0pro-life PLGHA policy. Furthermore, in most cases in which a recipient\u2014such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation or Marie Stopes International\u2014refused to comply with the policy, the U.S. government \u201cand/or the prime partner successfully transitioned activities to ensure the continuity of global health assistance.\u201d\nIn other words, other organizations and health care providers that were willing to deliver a range of much-needed health care services to women and girls, while steering clear of abortion, had the funds and ability to do so.\nIn proposing a rule to extend the terms of this important pro-life policy to even more funding streams, the Trump administration is once again demonstrating its leadership on the world stage and its commitment to defending innocent human life while promoting global health.\nHowever, while this is a laudable and important next step, it will not end the flow of U.S. tax dollars that go to the promotion or performance of abortion.\nFor example, U.S. foreign assistance funds that go to humanitarian aid are not subject to the same pro-life protections that PLGHA applies to global health funding. Neither is money that the United States sends to multilateral organizations, such as various UN entities, unless those organizations are found to violate the Kemp-Kasten Amendment\u2019s prohibition on supporting coercive abortion or sterilization programs, such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\nSecretary of State Michael Pompeo recently invoked the Siljander Amendment, which prohibits foreign aid funding from being used to lobby for or against abortion, to cut more than $200,000 in funding from the United States\u2019 contribution to the Organization of American States (OAS) over concerns that entities within the OAS were lobbying countries to weaken their existing pro-life laws. (In this case, the United States did not withhold all funds to the OAS, rather it determined how much money had been used for the prohibited action of lobbying for abortion liberalization and then withheld that amount.)\nIf the United States were to apply this approach to its monetary contributions to\u00a0United Nations entities\u00a0and programs that similarly promote abortion, then it would strengthen pro-life efforts to further extricate American tax dollars from abortion promotion abroad.\nFor example, the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, which is a\u00a0collaboration\u00a0between nongovernmental organizations and several UN entities, authored the\u00a0Inter-Agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings\u00a0in 2018 and included access to abortion as part of the Minimum Initial Service Package for use in crises settings. In short, UN funding is being used to promote abortion as a response to crises around the globe.\nOther UN entities ripe for applying the Siljander Amendment protections include the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, UN Women, and the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0(WHO). Notably, the United States has already\u00a0suspended WHO funding\u00a0and plans to withdraw effective summer 2021 following its mismanagement of the covid pandemic; invoking the Siljander Amendment in addition to other justifications would send a powerful signal to the world about the U.S. commitment to protect human life.\nHuman-rights treaty bodies under the mantle of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u00a0routinely\u00a0call upon countries to\u00a0loosen\u00a0any restrictions they may have on abortion. In the face of criticism from a UN working group lambasting U.S. states for not distinguishing abortion as \u201cessential\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. Ambassador to Geneva, Andrew Bremberg, sent a sharp\u00a0rebuke\u00a0noting that international human-rights law recognizes no right to abortion and that\u00a0actual human-rights abuses\u00a0perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party\u2014including forced abortion and sterilization\u2014have not been addressed.\nIt is encouraging that the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0is willing to publicly reject attempts to elevate abortion to an internationally recognized human right and fight attempts to permit abortion\u00a0under the Trojan Horse of \u201csexual and reproductive health.\u201d\u00a0The administration should be applauded for its commitment to strengthen the PLGHA and provide leadership for the Geneva Consensus Declaration. But the U.S. can and should do more to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not being used to support multilateral organizations that continue to advocate for abortion.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in the National Interest https://nationalinterest.org/blog/politics/trump-administration-wont-accept-abortion-human-right-171319\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
