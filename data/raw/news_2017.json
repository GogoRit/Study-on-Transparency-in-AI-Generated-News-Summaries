The organization filed the complaint over the law to ban dilation and evacuation abortions on Tuesday, just hours after Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte's office announced he had signed the bill into law. The law, which took effect immediately, says anyone who performs such an abortion can be charged with a felony that can be punished with 5 to 10 years in prison and a fine up to $50,000. There are exceptions for medical emergencies.",

(AP) \u2014 Planned Parenthood of Montana on Tuesday asked a state judge to temporarily block a law that bans the abortion method most commonly used after 15 weeks of gestation, arguing it is unconstitutional.The organization filed the complaint over the law to ban dilation and evacuation abortions just hours after Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte\u2019s office announced he had signed the bill.The law \u201cis the latest salvo in the Legislature\u2019s ongoing assault on Montanans\u2019 right to seek safe and lawful pre-viability abortions \u2014 a right guaranteed by the Montana Constitution,\u201d the complaint states.Montana\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that the state constitutional right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion from a provider of the patient\u2019s choice, the lawsuit states.Under the new ban, which took effect immediately, anyone who performs a dilation and evacuation abortion can be charged with a felony that can be punished by 5 to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000. There are exceptions for medical emergencies.\n\nThe new law \u201cis a grave threat to Montanans\u2019 health and safety and must be blocked,\u201d Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana, said in a statement. \u201cGiven the law\u2019s immediate effective date, patients across the state can already be denied access to care that was legally available moments before the governor\u2019s signature today.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPedal coast-to-coast without using a road?

District Court Judge Kathy Seeley said she could not restrain a law that was not yet in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office of Attorney General Austin Knudsen filed a motion on May 8 asking the court to sanction the attorneys and the plaintiffs for seeking the temporary restraining order before the law was in effect.\n\nPlanned Parenthood said it filed the lawsuit before the bill was signed because it had an immediate effective date and implicated constitutionally protected medical procedures.\u201cHouse Bill 721 does not prevent a single woman from having an abortion. Instead, it prohibits a barbaric abortion procedure,\u201d said Emily Flower, spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Justice. Abortions can also be performed by using medications to induce labor and delivery. The procedure takes place in a hospital where the patient can be monitored. \u201cNone of the alternatives offered by the state for the banned procedure are feasible,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Montana said in a statement. \u201cThey also carry more risk to the patient. This law bans the safest procedure after 15 weeks.\u201d The new law being challenged also includes a provision that says: \u201cThe right of individual privacy as referenced in the Montana Constitution ... does not create, and may not be construed as creating or recognizing, a right to abortion or to governmental funding of abortions,\u201d as part of a Republican effort to require the Montana Supreme Court to reconsider the 1999 Armstrong ruling.\n\nThe Montana Supreme Court cited the Armstrong ruling last week in saying advanced practice registered nurses can continue to provide abortion care if they are properly trained.Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers did receive an order to temporarily block a state rule that required prior authorization before Medicaid paid for an abortion. Planned Parenthood obtained an order to block another law that called for a 24-week abortion ban and required an ultrasound before an abortion could be performed.A hearing over whether a judge should grant preliminary injunctions blocking the rule and the ultrasound law are scheduled for May 23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
