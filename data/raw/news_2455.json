My grandmother advised her \u2014 begged and pleaded \u2014 to have me aborted. My mom said no. So, when given the choice, my mom chose life and that\u2019s why I\u2019m pro-life.\u201d\nIn a news release on the video, Cammack said she \u201cwill always choose life\u201d if elected to Congress.\n\u201cI am incredibly blessed that my mother chose to defy the advice of not only her doctors, but of my own family, to bring me into the world. Countless other babies have not been as fortunate as I was, which is why I will always fight for the unborn in the same way my mother did for me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAs science continues to advance in support of policies that protect life, we are winning on this issue. However, it is crucial that we have more young women advocating for the unborn in leadership positions across our country. I believe that as a young millennial woman myself, I will have an important role of speaking to new generations of Americans about pro-life policies in a way that connects with them. If elected, I will proudly take on that important responsibility both on Capitol Hill and right here at home in FL-03.\u201d\nCammack\u2019s video is the third released by her campaign in recent weeks. The first was a TV spot that\u2019s airing in the North Central Florida district. The second is a longer video chronicling her upbringing and the experiences that led her to move to the district and work for current CD 3 U.S. Rep.\u00a0Ted Yoho, first as his campaign manager and later as his deputy chief of staff.\nCammack is one of 10 Republicans hoping to succeed Yoho, who made good on his 2012 promise to limit himself to four terms. She faces\u00a0Ryan Chamberlin,\u00a0Todd Chase,\u00a0Bill Engelbrecht,\u00a0Joe Dallas Millado,\u00a0Gavin Rollins,\u00a0Judson Sapp,\u00a0James St. George,\u00a0David Theus\u00a0and\u00a0Amy Pope Wells\u00a0in the Aug. 18 primary election.\nShe is among the top fundraisers in the crowded primary.\u00a0As of June 30, she had raised $461,000 and had had more than $330,000 left to spend. Only Sapp and St. George boast bigger campaign accounts, though each has relied on candidate loans to build their advantage.\nCD 3 covers Alachua, Bradford, Clay, Putnam and Union counties as well as part of Marion. It is a safe Republican seat.\nThe video is below.\n\n\n Post Views: 1,542\n\n\n\n\n\nDrew Wilson\nDrew Wilson covers legislative campaigns and fundraising for Florida Politics.
