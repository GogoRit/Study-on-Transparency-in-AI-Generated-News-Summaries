Wade.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pro-life. I don\u2019t apologize for it,\u201d the former vice president\u00a0told\u00a0David Axelrod\u00a0in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply held conviction for me and for my family,\u201d he said, citing religious beliefs. But in a twist of irony, a second judge blocked Indiana\u2019s strict abortion ban on religious grounds late last week, based on a law Pence himself enacted as governor of the Hoosier state almost a decade ago.\u00a0Judge\u00a0Heather Welch\u00a0ruled that the law,\u00a0which prohibits abortion at 10 weeks of pregnancy with narrow exceptions, \u201csubstantially burdens\u201d the religious exercise of five women, as part of a lawsuit backed by the Indiana American Civil Liberties Union. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the ban\u00a0violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law Pence signed in 2015, barring the government from infringing on one\u2019s religious beliefs or practices (a\u00a0highly controversial law that was heavily criticized for initially allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people).\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0the lawsuit hinges on disputing that life begins \u201cat conception\u201d\u2014arguing that this is not a belief held across all religions. \u201cFor example, under Jewish law, a fetus attains the status of a living person only at birth,\u201d the lawsuit reads, according to IndyStar. \u201cJewish law recognizes that abortions may occur, and should occur as a religious matter, under circumstances not allowed by (the near-total abortion ban) or existing Indiana law.\u201d (The five women in the lawsuit practice Judaism, Islam, Unitarian Universalism, Episcopalianism, or paganism.)\u00a0Welch sided with the plaintiffs, saying in her decision that \u201cundisputed evidence demonstrates, based on actual facts, that the Plaintiffs are suffering injury and altering their behavior at the current time solely because of\u201d the state\u2019s new abortion law. It represents the second time the abortion ban has been blocked by Indiana\u2019s courts since it was signed into law in August. Back in September, another judge issued a temporary injunction against the law on privacy grounds\u00a0in a separate lawsuit backed by Planned Parenthood and others. The Indiana Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments\u00a0in this case in January. If appealed, the Supreme Court would\u00a0also rule on the legality of the latest injunction.\u00a0\u201cAbortion is legal in Indiana today. This preliminary injunction acts as a second layer of protection, ensuring the rights of Hoosiers on the grounds of religious freedom,\u201d Ken Falk, ACLU of Indiana legal director,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cThis decision represents another crucial victory for abortion access, and we will continue to fight this ban until it is blocked for good.\u201dWelch\u2019s ruling came a day after Pence appeared on\u00a0The Axe Files, where he said he will continue to push for an abortion ban\u00a0despite the electoral toll the issue took on the Republican Party in the midterms. \u201cIt may take us as long to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in all 50 states as it took us to overturn\u00a0Roe v. Wade, but for as long as I live, I will be a champion for the unborn and a champion for the sanctity of life,\u201d Pence, who has been rumored as a possible 2024 Republican presidential candidate, said. \u201cI just trust the American people to sort this out in a way that\u2019s consistent with their values and their aspirations.\u201d\u00a0The Ultimate Guide to the 2024 OscarsThe Biggest Moments From the Oscars 2024Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee Every Look From the Oscars Red CarpetFrom Emma Stone to LeBron James, Stars Collided at the 2024 VF Oscar PartyOppenheimer\u2019s Golden Night at the OscarsBillie Eilish, Lily Gladstone, and More Stars of Mark Seliger\u2019s 2024 Oscar Party PortraitsAll the Glam From the Oscar Party Red Carpet11 Spectacular Stars Unite for the 30th Annual Hollywood IssueStay in the know and subscribe to Vanity Fair for just $2.50 $1 per month.Most PopularPhotos From Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee the Glam in Motion on the Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2024 Glam CamBy Kase WickmanBarry Keoghan, Charles Melton, and Hunter Schafer Kick Off Oscar Week in Style at Vanity Fair and Instagram\u2019s Vanities PartyBy Kara WarnerAbigail Tracy National Political ReporterAbigail Tracy is the national political reporter at Vanity Fair.
