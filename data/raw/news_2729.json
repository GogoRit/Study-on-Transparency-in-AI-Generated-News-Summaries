More demonstrations are planned this weekend.Poland already has some of the most draconian abortion laws in Europe, and on Thursday a constitutional tribunal ruled that one of the few exceptions to the ban \u2013 cases of severe foetal impairment \u2013 should also be made illegal. These cases, which hardline Catholic anti-abortion activists have called \u201ceugenic abortion\u201d, made up almost all of the few abortions performed legally in Poland.The constitutional tribunal found that abortion in cases where \u201cprenatal tests or other medical indications indicate a high probability of severe and irreversible foetal impairment or an incurable life-threatening disease\u201d is a violation of the constitutional right to life. The country\u2019s populist, socially conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which has been accused of eroding judicial independence, had packed the tribunal with loyalists.View image in fullscreenA protester confronts police in Warsaw. Photograph: Janek Skar\u017cy\u0144ski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ruling came as Poland grapples with a second wave of coronavirus cases, and restrictions limit the possibility for mass protests. On Friday, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, announced that restaurants and bars would close for two weeks and public gatherings would be limited to five people, as infections hit a new daily record of more than 13,600.Despite the ban on gatherings, there were a number of protests planned for Friday evening and the weekend, with many emphasising that they would observe distancing measures. On Thursday evening, protesters in Warsaw gathered outside the home of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the powerful deputy prime minister and PiS ideologue. Police used pepper spray on the protesters and detained 15 people.In \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, a \u201cfuneral for women\u2019s rights\u201d was planned for Friday evening, while protesters promised to gather in Warsaw again. \u201cIn a few days, hell for women will begin in this country,\u201d said the description of a Facebook protest event organised in the city of Gda\u0144sk this weekend, in which participants were encouraged to block major traffic intersections.View image in fullscreenCandles are lit during a protest in Olsztyn, Poland. Photograph: Agencja Gazeta/ReutersEach year, thousands of Polish women seeking abortions are forced to travel to neighbouring countries. In previous years, attempts to tighten the already strict legislation led to a huge protest movement, with tens of thousands of women dressed in black marching through major Polish cities. Surveys showed that while society was split on liberalising abortion, only a small minority backed a further tightening of the rules, and the PiS government backed away from supporting tougher restrictions after the protests in 2016.\u201cThe government has evaded the essence of democracy \u2013 a wide public debate and consultations \u2013 and introduced a ban on such an abortion back door, using the subordinated constitutional tribunal,\u201d said Zuzanna Rudzi\u0144ska-Bluszcz, a candidate for the office of Poland\u2019s human rights ombudsman, who has the support of more than 1,000 non-governmental organisations but has been blocked by the PiS-dominated parliament.\u201cThe consequences will involve more human tragedies and the rapid growth of abortion underground. The judgment will adversely affect the most vulnerable groups, and in all likelihood, will divide Poland even further,\u201d she added.The decision also drew criticism from abroad. Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, called it \u201ca sad day for \u001dwomen\u2019s rights\u201d.However, church leaders welcomed the move. Marek J\u0119draszewski, the archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, expressed \u201cgreat appreciation for the courage\u201d of the judges at the tribunal.Explore more on these topicsPolandAbortionEuropeProtestWomennewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Third night of protests in Poland after abortion ban takes effect29 Jan 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Poland to implement near-total ban on abortion imminently27 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Poland delays abortion ban as nationwide protests continue3 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
