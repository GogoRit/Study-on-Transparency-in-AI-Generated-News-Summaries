Ron DeSantis is criticizing Donald Trump for implying Florida's new six-week abortion ban is \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d DeSantis contends the law has widespread support among opponents of abortion. He says that \"protecting an unborn child when there\u2019s a detectable heartbeat is something that almost 99% of pro-lifers support.\u201d He also noted that the former president didn't say what limits he would back on the procedure.

Ron DeSantis criticized Donald Trump for implying that Florida\u2019s new six-week abortion ban is \u201ctoo harsh,\u201d going after the former president as DeSantis prepares to challenge him for the 2024 Republican nomination.DeSantis was responding to a question Tuesday about Trump\u2019s comments in The Messenger about the six-week ban that DeSantis recently signed into law. \u201cMany people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh,\u201d Trump told the online outlet in an article published Monday. The governor contended the law has widespread support among opponents of abortion and he noted that Trump did not say what limits he would back.\u201cProtecting an unborn child when there\u2019s a detectable heartbeat is something that almost 99% of pro-lifers support,\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference after he signed a measure to combat human trafficking. \n\n\u201cAs a Florida resident, you know, he didn\u2019t give an answer about, \u2018Would you have signed the heartbeat bill that Florida did, that had all the exceptions that people talk about?\u2019\u201d DeSantis added.The rivalry between Trump and DeSantis is heating up as DeSantis nears a decision on a presidential campaign. DeSantis allies believe he will launch his candidacy as soon as this week, although an announcement could come closer to the end of the month. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion has been an early flashpoint in the still-forming Republican primary field in the first White House election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The bickering showcases the GOP\u2019s internal debate over hard-line abortion restrictions, which may be popular in a primary but could create problems in a general election for the party\u2019s eventual nominee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked whether he felt Trump had taken a firm enough stance on abortion, former Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 a staunch opponent of abortion who is soon expected to enter the race against his former boss \u2014 drew a line of distinction with Trump, saying he supported Florida\u2019s bill and would sign such a measure as president.\n\n\u201cFor my part, I disagree with President Trump about the heartbeat bill,\u201d Pence told reporters Tuesday night after an event in Concord, New Hampshire. \u201cI truly do believe that we ought to advance the cause of life at the state level, but I also want to say, I also believe there is a role at the federal level to advance the sanctity of life.\u201dThe bill signed into law last month by DeSantis would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It will take effect only if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in a legal challenge before the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives.Calling into a Newsmax program Tuesday night, Trump repeated earlier comments he made on CNN that he had given abortion opponents \u201cthe power of negotiation.\u201d Twice deflecting questions about whether he would support a national abortion ban at a specific point, Trump said \u201cmany pro-life people\u201d are \u201ctalking about more weeks than Ron is talking about.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m going to decide, and I\u2019m going to be in there pushing, and I\u2019m the one that got rid of Roe v. Wade,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump kept it up Wednesday, saying on his social media platform, \u201cWithout me there would be no 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to. Without me the pro Life movement would have just kept losing. Thank you President TRUMP!!!\u201dTrump has referred to himself as \u201cthe most pro-life president in American history,\u201d as his three nominations of conservative judges to the Supreme Court paved the way for the end of legalized abortion nationwide.But in the early months of his 2024 bid, Trump has often sidestepped the issue of abortion, even as Republicans across the country celebrate the Supreme Court decision stripping federal constitutional rights to the practice. In Iowa in March, he repeatedly refused to say whether he would support a federal law restricting abortion in every state \u2014 a move that anti-abortion activists have been demanding of the GOP\u2019s presidential contenders. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of different things,\u201d he said when asked by The Associated Press whether he supports a federal abortion ban.\n\nLast week during a primetime CNN town hall in New Hampshire, Trump continued to avoid specifics on a national ban, repeatedly saying he would \u201cdo what\u2019s right,\u201d without specifying what that was.As he gets closer to an announcement, DeSantis has been escalating his criticism of Trump, who for months has been attacking him directly and through groups supporting his candidacy. Last week in Iowa, as perilous weather sidelined Trump\u2019s trip to the state, DeSantis highlighted the GOP\u2019s recent string of electoral losses \u2014 a clear knock on the former president.\u201cWe must reject the culture of losing that has impacted our party in recent years. The time for excuses is over,\u201d DeSantis said at an event in Sioux Center. \u201cIf we get distracted, if we focus the election on the past or on other side issues, then I think the Democrats are going to beat us again.\u201d___Associated Press writers Michelle L.
