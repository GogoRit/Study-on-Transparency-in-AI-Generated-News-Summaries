Its Dobbs v Jackson ruling last June said the US Constitution does not guarantee a right to abortion.\nMifepristone approved decades ago\nIn the US, there are two common abortion methods. Dilation and curettage, also known as D&C or surgical abortion, involves dilating the cervix and removing tissue from the uterus. Medication abortion, or \u201cthe abortion pill\u201d, most often involves the combination of two medications: mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks hormones to end a pregnancy and misoprostol causes cramps to empty the uterus.\nMedication abortion is a safe method that can be taken at home, and has helped promote access to abortion in rural communities.\nThe FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000. Medication abortions have increased steadily in recent years, and in 2020, this type of abortion accounted for 53 percent of abortions in the US that happen via facilities like clinics and physicians\u2019 offices.\nThe lawsuit by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a coalition of groups that assert \u201cabortion is not healthcare\u201d, against the FDA alleges the agency improperly used accelerated drug approval for mifepristone, failed to study its safety, and ignored the potential hormonal effects on teenagers.\nMisoprostol works in conjunction with mifepristone to induce a medication abortion [File: Allen G. Breed/AP]\nAlliance Defending Freedom counsel Julie Blake told Al Jazeera: \u200b\u200b\u201cThe FDA has been entrusted by Congress to serve as the nation\u2019s gatekeeper of legal drugs but it failed its responsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of women and girls when it approved chemical abortion drugs and removed safeguards on their use.\u201d\nFor example, the suit alleges the FDA extended the use of mifepristone from seven weeks to 10 weeks, which the group claims is unsafe.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a tremendous amount of research that has been published and continues to consistently document the safety of this treatment,\u201d said Daniel Grossman, professor in the department of obstetrics, gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIn terms of hormonal effects on young people, there has not been any evidence to indicate that that\u2019s a concern.\u201d\nHe said medication abortion has a success rate of about 97 percent for pregnancies under 10 weeks. The remaining three percent of people will need an additional intervention to end the pregnancy.\nRisk of severe bleeding, infection or death are rare: \u201cOverall there have been 0.5 deaths per 100,000 medication abortions,\u201d Grossman said. In about half those cases, the death wasn\u2019t related to the treatment \u2014 the person died from homicide or an unrelated drug overdose, for example.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that this case has gotten so far,\u201d Grossman told Al Jazeera. \u201cThat a bunch of anti-abortion advocacy groups can essentially undermine the authority of the FDA through this legal action.\u201d\n\nWhat could the case mean for sanctuary states?\nAfter the Dobbs decision, California passed laws to protect abortion access, resulting in a slight increase in abortions as people arrived from out of state, according to data from the Society of Family Planning.\nLisa Matsubara, vice president of Policy and General Counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, said providers in her state are planning for the worst-case scenario.\n\u201cIf that happens and it is actually implemented, in the sense that the FDA does pull approval of mifepristone \u2026 it will make mifepristone unavailable across the country, including in California,\u201d she said.\nIn sanctuary states, abortion will still be legal if the FDA pulls mifepristone, but access to the pill would vanish overnight. \u201cJust because abortion is legal does not mean it\u2019s accessible,\u201d Duffy said.\nWhat could happen in states with abortion bans?\nSince the Dobbs decision, Georgia has passed a six-week ban on surgical abortion, and droves of people are now travelling out of state, explained Dazon Dixon Diallo, founder of SisterLove, a sexual and reproductive health advocacy group in Georgia.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to Florida, South Carolina, Kentucky, Illinois, DC, North Carolina,\u201d she said.\nEven if women can cover the cost of travel, they may not get an appointment \u201cbecause these haven states are now overwhelmed\u201d, Dixon Diallo said.\nWhile medication abortion is still legal in Georgia, lawmakers are trying to limit access. The state now faces two direct threats to abortion pills \u2014 the Texas FDA case, and Georgia Senate Bill 456, which would require pregnant people seeking abortion-inducing medication to see a doctor in person, and would make it illegal to send the medication by mail.\n\nIf access to pills is curtailed, Dixon Diallo expects people will search online for pills that may not be the correct medication, and try to order them across state lines.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to send it underground, you\u2019re going to see [people seeking pills on the] black market, which also is going to increase criminalisation of certain people,\u201d she said.\nCan misoprostol be used alone?\nIf mifepristone is taken off the market, Grossman said misoprostol can be used alone to induce a safe abortion.\n\u201cThe World Health Organization in its guidance clearly states that in settings where mifepristone is not available or accessible, that it\u2019s very reasonable to use regimens that include just misoprostol.\u201d\nHe said it is slightly less effective \u2014 about 85 to 90 percent effective.\nDixon Diallo said misoprostol-only abortions are not ideal. \u201cIt\u2019s just not as effective,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so that raises other questions about what happens when people have an incomplete termination \u2014 where they go, and not only that, but once they show up somewhere, and they were past six weeks, what does the provider do? Are they reported? Are they arrested or criminalised for that?\u201d\nMeanwhile in Texas, abortion is outlawed after a foetal heartbeat is detected, around six weeks, and people can be sued for helping a pregnant person access abortion. Auntie Network USA, a Facebook group that hosts a nationwide network of volunteer \u201caunties\u201d who help \u201cnieces\u201d who are in need of abortions, has seen a surge of requests across the south and in other red states.\nLisa, the Texas-based co-founder of the network, asked that only her first name be published for legal and safety reasons. She said the network will continue to help people access abortion, even if the FDA overturns its approval of mifepristone. She has consulted with physicians on how misoprostol can be used alone.\n\u201cI am confident on how to instruct women to have a misoprostol-only abortion,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cSo no, this decision will not stop Auntie Network USA from pushing forward and doing the work we do.\u201d\n\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
