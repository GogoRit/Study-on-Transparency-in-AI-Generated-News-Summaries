This law is a crucial step in eliminating discrimination against women &amp; girls. It\u2019s now important that the law be applied in the whole country and not be usurped.\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/Je7xQynqXw pic.twitter.com/Y09sPLgpMr\n\n\nUN Special Procedures\n\nUN_SPExperts\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil now, the mostly Catholic country permitted abortions only in cases of rape or when the woman\u2019s health was at risk, although, the experts pointed out, in practice they were often not available even on those grounds.\u00a0\n\u201cWe welcome this law that should make abortion safer\u201d, they said. \u201cCriminalizing abortion had done little to stop termination of pregnancies, but simply drove women to illegal, unsafe abortions, and many women died as a result.\u201d\u00a0\nThe existing law also discriminated against women and girls living in poverty who could not afford to travel abroad or pay for a safe procedure. Moreover, it contributed to forced continuation of pregnancy, even in cases where the pregnancy resulted from rape.\u00a0\nWomen and girls have rights to equality, physical and mental integrity and privacy, which require that they must enjoy the right to make autonomous decisions about their pregnancies, said the experts.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, countries in which women have access to information, contraception and the right to terminate pregnancies have the lowest rate of actual terminations.\u00a0\u00a0\nA hard-won battle\u00a0\nAgainst the backdrop of several unsuccessful attempts to get the law through Argentina\u2019s Congress in recent years, the experts applauded \u201cthe extraordinary mobilization of all activists in the country who contributed to the adoption of this law\u201d.\u00a0\nAt the same time, they cautioned that \u201cmuch remains to be done to ensure women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights to equality and highest standard of sexual and reproductive health\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s now important that the law be applied in the whole country and not be usurped by a political agenda or religious dogma\u201d, the experts underscored.\u00a0\u00a0\nNews media reported that after a marathon debate that lasted through the night, the vote that yielded the decision was held at 4:00 am \u2013 registering 38 in favour, 29 against and one abstention.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2018Time is of the essence\u2019\u00a0\nThe UN experts however, raised their concern over a conscientious objection clause that allows health professionals not to perform abortions should they violate their personal beliefs.\u00a0\u00a0\nConscientious objection can only be allowed where there is a clear duty and an effective possibility to refer the pregnant person to a competent and willing provider without any delay to the procedure, the UN experts said.\u00a0\n\u201cThis clause should not become a new barrier to timely access to abortion services\u201d, they underscored. \u201cIn these cases, time is of the essence\u201d.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentinaabortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nUS abortion debate: Rights experts urge lawmakers to adhere to women\u2019s convention\u00a0\n\n\nUS state abortion bans \u2018putting millions of women and girls at risk\u2019\n\n\nOverturning of Roe v Wade abortion law a \u2018huge blow to women\u2019s human rights\u2019 warns Bachelet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nAvert \u2018dire consequences\u2019 for women's health, UNFPA urges in appeal to prevent maternal deaths 14 December 2020\nWomenThe UN agency dedicated to improving reproductive and maternal health worldwide (UNFPA) appealed on Monday for $2.5 billion by 2030 to help avert potential \u201cdire consequences\u201d surrounding pregnancies and maternal deaths.\n\n\n\nPoland \u2018slammed the door shut\u2019 on legal and safe abortions: Human rights experts 27 October 2020\nHuman RightsA group of UN independent human rights experts have denounced a court ruling in Poland that bans abortions on the grounds of fatal or severe foetal impairment, effectively \u201cslamming the door shut\u201d on safe and legal pregnancy terminations. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
