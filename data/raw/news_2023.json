Aiming to return to the White House, the former president often notes how his presidency advanced the cause of abortion opponents. He appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, abolishing the federally guaranteed right to the procedure and fulfilling the decades-long aspirations of anti-abortion activists.But Trump has so far declined to go along with some of his rivals, most notably his onetime vice president, Mike Pence, who is pushing for national bans that would take effect relatively early into a pregnancy. He\u2019s warned Republicans against locking themselves into positions that are unpopular with a majority of the public and has argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision gives abortion opponents the right to \u201cnegotiate\u201d restrictions where they live rather than rely on federal curbs. \n\nThat tension underscores the new reality the GOP finds itself in more than a year into the post-Roe era. While top Republicans were long able to simply declare themselves opposed to abortion, they must now contend with more complicated questions \u2014 including when access should be banned and whether uniform standards might apply across the U.S., even in states where support for abortion rights runs deep. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Coverage\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood to resume offering abortions next week in Wisconsin, citing court ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida abortion rights at stake as state Supreme Court takes up challenge to GOP-led restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky Democrat Beshear links GOP challenger to reality of abortion law in reelection campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a wide variety of opinion. Should there be a national ban? At how many weeks? Should it be entirely left to the states?\u201d said Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition and a Republican National Committee member. \u201cSome people get it wrong when they think this constituency is in lockstep.\u201dThe dynamic will be on fresh display in the coming days, at events dominated by social conservatives. Trump joined a crowded slate of candidates speaking Friday in Washington at an event for the Family Research Council and headlined the Concerned Women for America\u2019s Leadership Summit dinner. But he\u2019s skipping Scheffler\u2019s Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition banquet on Saturday in Des Moines, where Pence will be among the candidates who will address evangelical Christians, long an influential bloc in the first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\nPolling suggests about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should generally be legal, and Trump has said in recent years that he supports exceptions to abortion bans when a pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or threatens the life of the mother. But Trump, who said again Friday that the Supreme Court ruling \u201cmoves the issue back to the states ... where it should be,\u201d has repeatedly criticized fellow Republicans for the way they talk about the issue. He argues it could benefit the party politically if candidates learn to speak about it differently by highlighting Democratic positions that are out of the political mainstream.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, Republicans don\u2019t know how to discuss the subject,\u201d he said at the Concerned Women for America event. \u201cWe do have to hold on to office, we do have to win. And we can win elections on this issue, but it\u2019s very delicate and explaining it properly is an extremely important thing.\u201dSpeaking later Friday at the Family Research Council event, Trump blamed the issue for the GOP\u2019s lackluster performance in the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cI will say politically, it\u2019s a very tough, it\u2019s a very tough decision for some people, but very, very hard on elections. Very, very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was, we had midterms and this was an issue, you know.\u201dIndeed, in the aftermath of the high court\u2019s abortion decision, Democrats mounted a strong performance in last year\u2019s midterms, limiting their House losses and maintaining the Senate majority. Voters in Republican-leaning states from Kansas to Ohio have also rejected GOP-backed efforts to curb abortion. Once a self-described \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d New York businessman, Trump had to do more than most major GOP candidates to win over initially skeptical evangelical Christians during his 2016 presidential run. A political committee supporting one of his rivals ran an ad with footage from a 1999 interview in which he declared, \u201cI am pro-choice in every respect.\u201d\n\nAttempting to bolster his anti-abortion credentials, Trump released a list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court who could be counted on to overturn Roe v. Wade long before actually winning the White House. Trump now calls himself the \u201cmost pro-life president\u201d in U.S. history, pointing to his Supreme Court picks and other actions long sought by the anti-abortion movement. Ironically, Democrats are promoting the same branding. President Joe Biden is making abortion rights central to his reelection campaign and attacks on the former president\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. \n\n\u201cLed by Donald Trump, who\u2019s done more to pave the way for abortion bans than anyone in history, MAGA Republicans are poised to again be rejected by the American people who want women to have the freedom to make their own health care decisions,\u201d said Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, in a statement.Ahead of last year\u2019s midterm election, meanwhile, Trump warned candidates, including his endorsed choice for Michigan governor, Tudor Dixon, to \u201ctalk differently about abortion.\u201d He urged Dixon to explicitly allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk, but she nonetheless lost handily to Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Mike DeMastus is an evangelical Christian in Des Moines who was part of a private meeting this summer between Trump and a group of pastors and asked Trump about abortion.\u201cHis response to me was, \u2018I\u2019ve given you leverage now to make a better deal,\u2019\u201d recalled DeMastus, who supports some form of a federal ban but isn\u2019t ruling out backing Trump even if he doesn\u2019t.Many in the Republican primary field have taken a harder line.Pence, whom Trump picked as his No. 2 in part because of his credibility with social conservatives, has declared that every Republican running for president should endorse, at a minimum, a federal abortion ban 15 weeks into pregnancy. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, also making a push to appeal to Iowa evangelical voters, concurs with Pence. He recently criticized fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley, who says Republicans should look for bipartisan consensus on abortion since stricter federal bans won\u2019t clear Congress.But entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy opposes national bans in favor of state restrictions, and other major candidates have been noncommittal. That includes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who often answers questions about a federal ban by saying his state recently passed a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Trump maintains that even some anti-abortion activists believe the six-week ban \u2014 before many women even know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 is too harsh. The country\u2019s leading anti-abortion group, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, wants GOP presidential candidates to advocate for a 15-week federal ban. Its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said anything less is \u201cunacceptable to the pro-life movement.\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung noted that Dannenfelser\u2019s group has praised Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201dthe most consequential in American history for the pro-life cause.\u201d Other activists aren\u2019t as firm, however. Kim Lehman, the former president of Iowa Right to Life and also an RNC member, says the issue should be left to the states. \u201cWe need someone who is going to stand up for life and not just be a mouthpiece,\u201d said Lehman, who has not endorsed a GOP primary candidate. \u201cBut I believe our people are best served when this decision is made from the ground up.\u201dDemocrats have unified around calls to protect abortion rights, seeing it as an issue of strength in 2024. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Republicans are trying to seem softer on abortion in an attempt to head off more losses. \u201cThey know that, if they\u2019re clear about their motivations and their positions, they\u2019ll lose. And so they\u2019re trying to confuse the public,\u201d Timmaraju said. \u201cThe challenge is, they\u2019ve run for so long as a party embedded and intertwined with the radical, extremist anti-abortion movement that it\u2019s almost impossible to disentangle themselves now.\u201d Marlys Popma, a longtime GOP strategist for statewide and presidential candidates in Iowa, is among those suggesting her party embrace nuance. She described herself as \u201can incrementalist\u201d but acknowledged, \u201cCertain people in the movement don\u2019t like incrementalism\u201d and think \u201cwe have to have it all.\u201d \u201cAnd if you want anything different than that,\u201d she added, \u201cthen you are wrong and a bad pro-lifer.\u201d___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Sara Burnett in Chicago contributed to this report. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWILL WEISSERT\n\n\n                Will is a national political reporter based in Washington.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
