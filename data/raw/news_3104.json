Jackson\u2019s legal background\u00a0\nThe 51-year-old judge clerked for Justice Stephen G. Breyer \u2014 whose seat she would fill at the Supreme Court \u2014 in 1999 and 2000. Biden elevated Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, one of the most powerful courts in the country, in 2021. But Jackson first became a federal judge in 2013, serving the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as a President Barack Obama appointee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson received her undergraduate degree, magna cum laude, and law degree, cum laude, from Harvard, before working as a federal public defender. Her resume includes serving as vice chair and commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which establishes sentencing policies and practices for federal courts and advises both Congress and the executive branch.\nShe also worked at law firms such as Miller Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin, Goodwin Procter, Feinberg Rozen, and Morrison & Foerster.\n2. Jackson\u2019s personal life\nBorn in Washington, D.C., Jackson grew up in Miami. She attended Miami Palmetto Senior High, where she made waves on the speech and debate team. Even then, she hoped to one day become a judicial appointee, as she revealed in her senior yearbook.\nToday, Jackson lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband, Patrick Jackson, a general surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. The two married in 1996 after meeting at Harvard and have two daughters together: Talia, 21, and Leila, 17.\u00a0\nAt the start of her legal career, while working for a Boston law firm, Jackson remembered the struggle between working in law and raising a family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike so many women who enter Big Law, I soon found it extremely challenging,\u201d she said in 2017, while speaking at the University of Georgia. \u201cYou start to feel as though the demands of the billable hour are constantly in conflict with the needs of your children.\u201d\nJackson is also related, by marriage, to former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\u201cOur politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji\u2019s intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal,\u201d Mr. Ryan told the Senate Judiciary Committee of Jackson in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson cites her father, who later became the chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board, as her role model. One of her earlier memories is sitting next to him as a preschooler with her coloring books while he studied for law school.\nJackson\u2019s mother worked as a high school principal. Her younger brother worked for the Baltimore police and served in the U.S. Army, including in Iraq, before becoming a lawyer. Two of her uncles also worked in law enforcement.\n3. Making court history\nIf confirmed, Jackson would be the first Black woman to sit on the bench of the nation\u2019s highest court. Biden first announced that he would nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court on the campaign trail.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI will nominate someone with extraordinary qualifications, charity, experience and integrity,\u201d Biden repeated in January. \u201cAnd that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\nJackson could be the Supreme Court\u2019s third Black justice, and the second Black justice on the current bench, with Justice Clarence Thomas. If confirmed, she would also be the sixth woman to become a Supreme Court justice, and join Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Amy Coney Barrett on the current bench.\n4. Notable cases\nWhile Jackson has served in her current position for less than a year, her earlier rulings as a district judge \u201ccomported with those of a liberal-leaning judge,\u201d the New York Times reported.\nThose include \u201cblocking the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to fast-track deportations, cut short grants for teen pregnancy prevention and shield a former White House counsel from testifying before Congress about President Donald J. Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation.\u201d\nIn Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn in 2019, Jackson ruled that former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II must comply with a congressional subpoena for his testimony about President Trump\u2019s behavior during the Russia investigation.\u00a0\nDuring her time on the D.C. Circuit, Jackson has encountered at least one high-profile case \u2014 one that involved former president Donald Trump and the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nIn December, Jackson joined a unanimous ruling that Trump could not prevent the House investigation from certain records from the Trump White House, Vox reported. The Supreme Court later upheld that decision.\u00a0\n5. Jackson\u2019s faith\nAt her nomination ceremony, Jackson began her speech by \u201cthanking God for delivering me to this point in my professional journey,\u201d and adding that \u201cone can only come this far by faith.\u201d\nWhile the details of her faith are unclear, she served on the inaugural advisory board for a Christian school in Rockville, Maryland, from 2010-2011. The school backed Christian beliefs on marriage, gender, and the \u201csanctity of all human life from conception to natural death.\u201d\nDuring her confirmation hearings last year, she commented on her time at Montrose Christian School, which she described as a now-defunct K-12 private school.\u00a0\n\u201cI was aware that Montrose Christian School was affiliated with Montrose Baptist Church,\u201d she said. \u201cI was not aware that the school had a public website or that any statement of beliefs was posted on the school\u2019s website at the time of my service.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri about the First Amendment, Jackson responded, \u201cI do believe in religious liberty,\u201d calling it a \u201cfoundational tenet of our entire government.\u201d\nIn response to the Supreme Court nomination, Charles Holmes Jr., an HBCU (Historic Black College and University) college director for The Summit Church, claimed a personal connection to Jackson on Twitter.\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s grandmother was led to Christ by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s mother,\u201d he typed. \u201cMy wife\u2019s family wouldn\u2019t be Christians if it wasn\u2019t for Judge Jackson\u2019s mother.\u201d\n6. What Biden says about Jackson\nIn a tweet announcing the nomination, Biden called Jackson \u201cone of our nation\u2019s brightest legal minds\u201d and said that she will be \u201can exceptional Justice.\u201d\nDuring his formal announcement on Friday, Biden introduced Jackson as \u201ca daughter of former public school teachers, a proven consensus builder, an accomplished lawyer, a distinguished jurist on one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious courts.\u201d\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m pleased to nominate Judge Jackson who will bring extraordinary qualifications, deep experience in intellect, and a rigorous traditional record to the court,\u201d he said.\n7. What pro-life leaders say about Jackson\nIn response to the new nominee, pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) expressed concern over Jackson\u2019s position on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The Supreme Court is expected to decide a high-profile case that directly challenges Roe \u2014 Dobbs v. Jackson \u2014 later this year.\n\u201cJoe Biden is fulfilling his promise to only appoint justices who support the Roe v. Wade regime of abortion on demand up to birth,\u201d president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a press release. \u201cKetanji Brown Jackson is backed by many of America\u2019s most radical pro-abortion groups. She is on record opposing the free speech rights of pro-life advocates pleading to save lives outside abortion centers and supporting the false claim that abortion is \u2018health care.\u2019\u201d\nDannenfelser added, \u201cWe have no doubt she will work with the most pro-abortion administration in history to enshrine abortion on demand nationwide in the law.\u201d\nSBA List also noted that in 2001, Jackson co-authored an amicus brief in McGuire v. Reilly in support of a Massachusetts law that created a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d preventing pro-life sidewalk counselors from approaching women outside of abortion clinics. Jackson\u2019s clients include pro-choice groups such as NARAL and the Abortion Access Project of Massachusetts.\u00a0\nThe March for Life also cautioned pro-lifers on Twitter about Brown\u2019s record.\n\u201cMarch for Life opposes President Biden's anticipated nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the U.S. Supreme Court based on her record of judicial activism,\u201d the pro-life group said. \u201cWe expect her to be a reliable vote for the far left and the Biden administration\u2019s radical abortion agenda.\u201d\n\u201cWe urge the Members of the Senate to stand for our nation\u2019s mothers and most vulnerable unborn by rejecting this extreme nominee, and we encourage the nomination of a judge who will honor our Constitution and the right to life,\u201d the group concluded.\nAs the head of Americans United for Life, Catherine Glenn Foster highlighted that abortion groups such as NARAL and Planned Parenthood applauded Jackson as the nominee \u201ctragically, and literally within seconds of President Biden\u2019s announcement.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough Kentanji Brown Jackson has not yet explicitly stated her views on Roe or abortion, NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and other abortion activists see in her an ally for the moral crime of abortion,\u201d she stressed in a statement.\nWhen asked about her position on Roe v. Wade during her confirmation proceedings last year, Jackson responded: \u201cAs a sitting federal judge, all of the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements are binding on me, and under the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, I have a duty to refrain from critiquing the law that governs my decisions, because doing so creates the impression that the judge would have difficulty applying binding law to their own rulings.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nBiden administration, \nSupreme Court of the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
