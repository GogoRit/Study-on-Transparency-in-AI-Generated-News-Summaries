Newsroom, Sep 21, 2022 / 13:45 pm\nAfter the pro-life pregnancy center he runs outside Buffalo was firebombed and vandalized on June 7, James Harden gave investigators video-surveillance footage of the attack, along with what he described as a \u201cmountain of other evidence.\u201d\nNow, frustrated that no arrests have been made in the case after more than three months, he wants the footage back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Day 106. There have been no arrests. There have been over 50 attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers. And our patience is at an end,\u201d Harden, president and CEO of CompassCare Pregnancy Services, told CNA on Wednesday.\nHarden said that he has asked both the FBI and local police for access to the footage so he can make a copy of it, to no avail. The police showed him still images taken from the video, he said, but would not give him access to the footage itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo on Tuesday CompassCare filed a lawsuit asking a judge to order the police department to provide CompassCare with a copy of the footage.\n\u201cTime is of the essence to commence a civil litigation because the longer time goes by the more likely it will be that those responsible for the firebombing will spoliate other evidence,\u201d reads the complaint, which was filed in state Supreme Court in Buffalo.\nThe legal action is the latest manifestation of mounting frustration about what some see as a lackluster response by the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies to the wave of violent attacks on pro-life groups and Catholic churches across the U.S. since an early draft of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked on May 2.\nThe same day CompassCare filed its lawsuit, Republican Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington\u00a0introduced a bill\u00a0that, among other things, would require the Biden administration to publicly report its handling of the investigation and prosecution of those engaging in \u201cdomestic violent extremism\u201d against pregnancy centers.\nThe legislation, called the Protect Pregnancy Care Centers Act of 2022, already has 28 co-sponsors and boasts the support of national pro-life organizations, including SBA Pro-Life America, the March for Life, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\u2018Jane\u2019s Revenge\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe June 7 attack on CompassCare\u2019s clinic, located in Amherst, New York, is one of at least 18 attributed to assailants invoking the pro-abortion moniker \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge.\u201d To date, there have been no arrests in any of those cases, Fox News\u00a0reported\u00a0last week.\nIn fact, no arrests have been reported in the\u00a0more than 50 vandalism attacks\u00a0on pregnancy centers since the Supreme Court leak, according to CNA\u2019s tracker of these crimes.\n\u201cThe public has a right to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Harden told CNA.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a serious sickness in the body politic of America and the FBI isn\u2019t even talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest law enforcement agency on the globe and it appears that they\u2019re treating this like some sort of bubble gum theft.\u201d\nCompassCare, a pro-life pregnancy center near Buffalo, New York, was heavily damaged by fire and spray-painted with pro-abortion graffiti on June 7, 2022. CompassCare\nIn the attack on CompassCare\u2019s Amherst facility, windows were shattered, an office was burned and heavily damaged, and the words \u201cJane was here\u201d were spray-painted on the side of the building.\nIn an interview with EWTN\u2019s Raymond Arroyo not long after the attack, Harden said it was clear from video footage that \u201cmultiple perpetrators\u201d were involved.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio draws attention to pro-life strategy, spike in church vandalism\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had video footage on security cameras trained at all the points of penetration,\u201d he said at the time. You can watch the full interview with Arroyo in the video below.\n\nHarden told CNA he does not understand why the Amherst Police Department has not released the video to the public. He said the footage shows clear figures and license plates that ought to make it possible to identify someone. CompassCare was not able to make a copy of the footage before handing it over to authorities because of the damage to its building, its lawsuit notes.\nA \u2018quiet\u2019 investigation?\nThe Amherst Police Department did not respond to CNA\u2019s request for comment. In a statement released Aug. 1, the department said it was \u201cworking diligently\u201d with the FBI to resolve the case.\n\u201cThere have already been multiple leads examined and we are continuing to follow up with those at this time,\u201d the statement read. Anyone with information about the case should contact the police department at 716-689-1311, referencing case number 22-224665, the statement added.\nStanley J. Silwa, the Amherst town attorney,\u00a0told Buffalonews.com\u00a0that giving CompassCare a copy of the footage would put the police investigation in jeopardy and added that the police would release the footage after the investigation is complete.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently they don\u2019t like the explanation,\u201d Silwa said, referring to CompassCare officials. \u201cThey should understand that.\u201d\nIn an\u00a0interview\u00a0with the Epoch Times, Silwa said that the police department wants a \u201cquiet\u201d investigation because of fears that \u201cthese people don\u2019t go further underground, as they may already be.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re aware of all the nut jobs out there with guns and AK-47s, bombing and killing people because they have certain political views,\u201d Sliwa said in the interview.\nAsked to elaborate on which people he was referring to, Silwa told the Epoch Times he was referring to the riot on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nSilwa clarified that he was not linking supporters of CompassCare with the Capitol riot.\nSilwa was not immediately available for comment Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nVandalism, \nCatholic News, \nPro-life pregnancy centers, \nAbortion in the United States, \nCompassCare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Bukuras is a journalist at the Catholic News Agency.\u00a0 Joe has prior experience working in state and federal government, in non-profits, and Catholic education.
