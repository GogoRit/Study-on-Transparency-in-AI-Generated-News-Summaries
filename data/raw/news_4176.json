Under the bogus guise of patient safety concerns \u2014 abortion is one of the safest common medical procedures \u2014 the law would make ever scarcer access to legal abortions in the state and, if sanctioned by the Supreme Court, the country.\nDespite the fact that the court struck down a nearly identical Texas law in 2016, the presence of misogynist Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 both President Donald Trump appointments \u2014 on today\u2019s conservative bench could see the established legal precedent rejected in favor of anti-abortion ideology. In restrictive states like Mississippi, medical abortions are already de facto inaccessible; now the reactionary dream of legally entrenching that inaccessibility \u2014 overturning Roe v. Wade \u2014 is closer to becoming a reality.\nJoe Biden\u2019s rise should concern anyone who believes that reproductive rights and choice are essential to social justice.\nAbortion rights will likely not survive another term under Trump. Even under a Democratic president, the current makeup of the Supreme Court will continue to pose a grave threat. That is the bleak terrain in which voters who care about reproductive rights need to consider the Democratic presidential nominees. They must look for someone who offers an unwavering commitment to not only protect the right to abortion, but to make the choice to terminate a pregnancy a readily available option for all.\nAnd that is what\u2019s so concerning about the frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden,\u00a0and his record on abortion rights. He is worse than inconsistent \u2014 and his rise should concern anyone who believes that reproductive rights and choice are essential to social justice.\nDuring a February Democratic primary debate, Biden aligned himself with the other candidates on stage by calling for the protection of abortion rights. Alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the former vice president said that if the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe, he would put forward legislation to uphold the law\u2019s protections.\n\u201cIf they ruled it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress, and it will pass I believe, a bill that legislates Roe v. Wade adjusted by Casey,\u201d Biden said, referring to a later Supreme Court case that prohibited undue burdens on abortion rights. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s right to do that. Period.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat \u201cperiod,\u201d however, has for much of Biden\u2019s career been a comma \u2014 a qualified and compromised support of abortion\u2019s legality at best, and a commitment to limit funding for abortions at worse. Up until last summer, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion under programs like Medicaid, enforcing a hideous denial of affordable care to poor people.\nOne might generously frame Biden\u2019s changing stance on abortion as a righteous journey, navigating his Catholic faith with a willingness to learn and change in the interest of women\u2019s rights. As vice president, Biden actively worked to undermine reproductive rights by trying to cut mandated coverage for contraception from the Affordable Care\u00a0Act.\nHis reversal on the Hyde Amendment last year, meanwhile, smacked of electoral expediency: On June 5, Biden\u2019s campaign said that he continued to support the law. He received immediate censure from activists, other lawmakers, and his opponents for the Democratic nomination. The very next night, at a Democratic National Committee gala in Atlanta, Biden said he no longer supported the ban on federal funding for abortions.\nBiden claimed that recent Republican anti-abortion efforts around the country prompted his change of position. But widespread abortion restriction laws have hacked away at abortion access for years \u2014 including throughout President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 and Biden\u2019s support of the Hyde Amendment did not shift.\n\u201cI can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s ZIP code,\u201d Biden later said, explaining his about-face. He had, however, managed to support such legislation for nearly a decade after the Center for Constitutional Rights reported in 2010 that, since the Hyde Amendment passed in 1976, more than a million women\u00a0have been unable to afford abortions and had to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Of his many years supporting the dangerous and discriminatory law, Biden said he made \u201cno apologies for the last position.\u201d\nAbortion is, of course, only one among a number of crucial issues on which Biden has a poor record, riddled with discriminatory positions; he worked with segregationists and helped bolster racist mass incarceration. Contrary to claims in his current campaign ads, he has argued for cuts to Social Security throughout much of his career. And, as I wrote last year, Biden\u2019s pathetic excuse for an apology to Anita Hill was decades too late, insufficient, and transparently timed around the launch of his presidential campaign; it was further evidence that he will not address the power structures that enable patriarchal sexual abuse to prevail.\n\n\n\n \n\n        Related      \nAre These the Final Days of Legal Abortion?\n\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, highlight his record against sexual violence to parry allegations of misogynist behavior. He championed the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which introduced crucial provisions for domestic violence victims, like rape crisis centers, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and battered women\u2019s shelters.\nBiden should be commended for this. It should not be forgotten, however, that the Violence Against Women Act was tucked inside the pernicious 1994 crime bill, which he helped draft; support for the provisions on violence against women went a long way toward gaining liberal backing for the broader bill. In other words, even Biden\u2019s proudest legacy when it comes to addressing sexual violence must be considered in the context of his efforts to bolster the violent, racist criminal justice system.\nThe former vice president\u2019s very recent shift to support abortion access should be measured against his long history of compromise, and indeed complicity, with Republican agendas. A politician who treats such compromise as moral value in and of itself should not be trusted to fight hard for an issue on which he\u2019s shown unacceptably wavering commitments. The risk to too many people\u2019s lives, health, and well-being \u2014 particularly the risk to poor women of color \u2014 is too high to allow the decimation of abortion access to proceed. He would make an insufficient bulwark against the conservative anti-abortion tides.\nWhat delineates robust from weak support for abortion rights is an understanding that the issue of abortion intersects with structural questions of economic and racial equality, health care access, and how society treats gestational labor. A promise to protect Roe is insufficient to defend abortion rights, which require abortion access to be meaningful. That sort of commitment seems unlikely to come from the man who, in 1973, said that the Supreme Court had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d in its Roe v. Wade ruling.\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Natasha Lennard          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @natashalennard                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Are These the Final Days of Legal Abortion?      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        How the Supreme Court Could Gut Reproductive Rights Without Ruling on a Single Abortion Restriction      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The GOP\u2019s Fearmongering Over Abortion Flopped in Kentucky and Virginia      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Joe Biden Worked to Undermine the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Coverage of Contraception      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
