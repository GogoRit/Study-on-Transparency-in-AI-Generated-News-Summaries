The Arizona Court of Appeals has given us the clarity that Planned Parenthood Arizona has been seeking for months: when provided by licensed physicians in compliance with Arizona\u2019s other laws and regulations, abortion through 15 weeks will remain legal,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona.\nIn June of this year, the newly conservative U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to abortion protected in Roe v. Wade when it ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The case determined that a 15-week abortion ban passed in Mississippi \u2014 while federal laws at the time prohibited bans before 24 weeks \u2014 was perfectly legal because nothing in the Constitution protected a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.\u00a0\nDuring that time, the GOP-controlled state legislature in Arizona passed a nearly identical 15-week ban of their own, in the hopes that the high court would rule in favor of Mississippi.\u00a0\nShortly after that hope was realized, Brnovich went to court to request the nullification of an injunction blocking the near-total ban that was first added to Arizona\u2019s territorial statutes in 1864, then re-codified when Arizona became a state in 1912. That injunction was placed in 1973, after Roe was enshrined at the federal level.\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals took on the case after a trial judge in September removed a nearly 50-year-old injunction blocking the Civil War-era abortion ban, effectively reinstating it and threatening abortion providers across the state with 2 to 5 years in prison.\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona appealed that ruling, and judges heard arguments in the case last month.\nPlanned Parenthood of Arizona, the state\u2019s largest abortion provider, running four of the state\u2019s nine clinics offering the service, fought against Brnovich\u2019s request. The core of Planned Parenthood\u2019s argument is that decades of regulations passed since the 1973 injunction, including this year\u2019s 15-week ban, muddled the legal landscape for doctors and implied that abortion, to some extent, was permitted.\u00a0\nThe appellate panel agreed, and said Brnovich\u2019s legal argument viewed the 1864 ban in isolation.\n\u201cBut we do not construe statutes in isolation,\u201d Chief Judge Garye Vasquez wrote on behalf of the panel.\n\n\n \nThe reality is that Arizona lawmakers have \u201ccreated a complex regulatory scheme to achieve its intent to restrict \u2014 but not to eliminate \u2014 elective abortions\u201d in Arizona. Brnovich\u2019s position \u201cwould eliminate the elective abortions the legislature merely intended to regulate.\u201d\nAnd Brnovich\u2019s position that prosecutors could use their discretion to not enforce the 1864 ban \u201cwould not merely invite arbitrary enforcement, it would practically demand it.\u201d And even then, doctors would be left in an uncertain environment, as statutes of limitations extend beyond the terms of prosecutors.
