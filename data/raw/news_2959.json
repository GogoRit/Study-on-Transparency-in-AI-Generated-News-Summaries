A guide to the future of the pro-life movement and the truth about abortion.\u00a0\nRyan T. Anderson, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), and Alexandra DeSanctis, a National Review staff writer and EPPC fellow, recently co-wrote \u201cTearing Us Apart: How Abortion Harms Everything and Solves Nothing\u201d (Regnery Publishing, 2022). Published just days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the book promises to explain pro-life arguments with facts and logic while revealing the brutality of abortion and how it has wounded society.\u00a0\nIn an interview with EWTN Pro-Life Weekly on Aug. 18, the authors said that they foresaw the possibility of the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the near future. That\u2019s when they decided to \u201cprovide a pro-life roadmap to the future of the pro-life movement,\u201d explained DeSanctis.\u00a0\n\u201cWe wrote a book hoping that it would be accessible, useful even, to people who don\u2019t agree with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to make a case, of course, first of all, that the unborn child is harmed by abortion, is killed by abortion, but [also] to kind of show pro-lifers a broader case, that abortion has actually harmed everything it\u2019s touched.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two began writing the book in December, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The case ultimately overturned Roe, leaving abortion up to the states.\nThe book dives into several aspects of society harmed by abortion, Anderson said, including the unborn child, women, racial minorities, people with disabilities in the womb, the field of medicine, the legal system, the political system, and culture, from big business to the news media.\u00a0\nThe authors also defined three theses upon which the right to life stands and provide rebuttals to pro-choice arguments. The theses are: the biological, the moral, and the political.\u00a0\nDeSanctis explained that the biological thesis defends the fact that the unborn child is indeed a human being and not a clump of cells, part of the mother, or a parasite.\nThe moral case, she said, poses the question of what it means to be a human being \u2014 and why human beings have moral worth.\u00a0\nFinally, the political thesis rebukes the claim that it is \u201cnot the role of government to impose on other people your beliefs\u201d or that \u201cthe government shouldn\u2019t get in the way between women and their doctors,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of government, what kind of society do we live in if the most innocent human beings aren\u2019t protected by our laws?\u201d DeSanctis asked.\u00a0\nThe book also discusses marriage and the family, along with the need to rebuild a pro-family culture.\n\u201cAbortion is the ultimate backstop for so-called consequence-free sex\u201d or sex without commitment, Anderson explained. \u201cWhat we argue in the book is that it can\u2019t just be that we prohibit abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAbortion is a consequence of the sexual revolution. Abortion is also a catalyst of the sexual revolution in fueling consequence-free sex, commitment-free sex,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means we need to promote a marriage culture. We need to get men and women to commit to each other so then they can commit to take care of that child.\u201d\u00a0\nDeSanctis stressed that the overturning of Roe \u201cis not the end of the fight over abortion.\u201d\nInstead, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a new and important phase.\u201d\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nBook, \nDobbs v.
