Karen Berg called the bill \"a medical sham.\"ByIvan PereiraApril 18, 2022, 5:05 PM8:32In this March 10, 2022, file photo, Sen. Karen Berg, left, was upset she was the only woman on the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Capitol listening to testimony on a bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks, in Louisville, Ky.Sam Upshaw Jr./Courier Journal via USA Today Network, FILEKentucky state Sen. Karen Berg went viral last month for an impassioned speech in the Senate chambers against the state's new law that bans abortions after 15 weeks, calling the legislation a \"medical sham.\"Now that the bill is the law of the land, the Democratic senator told ABC News Live on April 15 that she will continue to raise her voice as the controversial legislation faces lawsuits.\"I don't really understand how your morals could possibly think that is the appropriate thing to do,\" she told ABC News, regarding the new abortion law.In this March 10, 2022, file photo, Sen. Karen Berg, left, was upset she was the only woman on the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Capitol listening to testimony on a bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks, in Louisville, Ky.Sam Upshaw Jr./Courier Journal via USA Today Network, FILEThe state bill went into effect on April 13 after the GOP-led legislature overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's veto. Under the new rules, any physician who performs an abortion after 15 weeks would lose their license for at least six months.MORE: Kentucky legislature overrides governor's veto of 15-week abortion banThe bill allows for exceptions if there is a medical emergency in which continuing the pregnancy would result in \"serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\" or \"death of the pregnant woman.\" There are no exceptions for rape or incest.The bill's proponents have argued that abortion is morally wrong, including Kentucky's Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, who said the bill was meant \"to protect life and promote the health and safety of women.\"During the March 10 vote, Berg scolded the legislators who signed onto the bill for ignoring the personal choices of a pregnant woman.\"What you are doing is...putting your knee, putting a gun to women's heads. You're killing them,\" she said.Berg told ABC News that the speech wasn't prepared and came about from her frustrations on the number of state legislatures in the country that choose \"to ignore what is safe for women, to ignore what women want, and sometimes need for their own safety, and instead insert their own moral values that have nothing to do with health care.\"\"That, honestly, is such an overreach of what government is supposed to be doing,\" Berg said.She recalled that her father, a surgeon, taught her how dangerous backstreet abortions can be, and was baffled as to why lawmakers would reduce access to safe options.\"I have actually seen what it looks like inside of a woman who is dying from sepsis, from a botched illegal abortion,\" Berg said.The bill also changed the regulations for prescription drugs used for medication abortions, which is a nonsurgical procedure typically used up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy.In order for a physician to provide the medication, they must have hospital admitting privileges in \u201cgeographical proximity\u201d to where the abortions are being performed, give the patient an in-person examination 24 hours before the medication abortion and cannot mail the drugs.MORE: Oklahoma passes bill that would make it a felony to perform abortions Berg said all of the clinics that provide medication abortion have had to shut down because they cannot comply with the new regulations.\"We do not have the system,\" she said.Sen. Karen Berg, (D) Louisville, spoke with Diane Macedo on ABC News Live about going viral for her impassioned speech against the state's 15-week abortion ban.ABC NewsTwo federal lawsuits were filed April 14 by abortion advocates, including Planned Parenthood, arguing that it is \"impossible to comply\" with the new regulations and the new law resulted in \u201cunconstitutional ban on abortion in Kentucky.\" Cameron said in a statement he would defend the law, reiterating that the \"General Assembly passed HB 3 to protect life and promote the health and safety of women.\"Berg said she is unsure how the lawsuit will play out, especially since the Supreme Court is slated to make a decision on a case that challenges a similar 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi.\"How is this going to play out? Well, a lot of it's going to depend on the Supreme Court decision. There is a lot, a lot riding on that decision,\" she said.ABC News' Mary Kekatos contributed to this report.Top StoriesJudge rules evidence related to 'Access Hollywood' tape admissible in Trump trialMar 18, 10:35 PMState Medicaid offices target dead people\u2019s homes to recoup their health care costsMar 16, 8:18 PMTrump claims Liz Cheney and Jan. 6 committee should be jailedMar 19, 12:58 AMTrump faces 'insurmountable difficulties' in securing $464M bond in civil fraud caseMar 18, 2:47 PMTimeline of college student's disappearance after night out in Nashville3 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights \u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n\n\n"
