The controversial law, which was passed in 2019, would have banned most abortions after a doctor detected fetal cardiac activity, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, sometimes before a woman realizes she is pregnant. The law included some exceptions for victims of rape and incest but only if they had filed official police reports.On Monday, District Judge Steve C. Jones ruled that the law infringed upon constitutional rights, including those established by the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade and the 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\u201cIn sum, the undisputed material facts in this case lead to one, indisputable conclusion: that Section 4 of H.B. 481, by prohibiting a woman from terminating her pregnancy upon the detection of a fetal heartbeat, constitutes a pre-viability abortion ban,\u201d Jones wrote in his decision. \u201cAs this ban directly conflicts with binding Supreme Court precedent (i.e., the core holdings in Roe, Casey, and their progeny) and thereby infringes upon a woman\u2019s constitutional right to obtain an abortion prior to viability, the Court is left with no other choice but to declare it unconstitutional.\u201d\u201cIt is in the public interest, and is this court\u2019s duty, to ensure constitutional rights are protected,\u201d Jones continued. The suit, SisterSong v. Kemp, was brought by advocacy groups and abortion providers including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Georgia. \u201cThis win is tremendous, and [it] also makes a very bold statement,\u201d said Monica Simpson, the executive director of the suit\u2019s lead plaintiff SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, in a statement. \u201cNo one should have to live in a world where their body and reproductive decision-making is controlled by the state. And we will continue to work to make sure that is never a reality in Georgia or anywhere else.\u201dIn a statement to TIME, the office of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said: \u201cWe will appeal the Court\u2019s decision. Georgia values life, and we will keep fighting for the rights of the unborn.\u201d The controversial law faced widespread criticism, including from several famed filmmakers and actors who threatened to pull out of Atlanta\u2019s multi-billion dollar film industry if the law was enacted. The law was initially going to take effect at the start of 2020, but Jones placed a preliminary injunction blocking the law in October 2019. \u201cThe district court blocked Georgia\u2019s abortion ban, because it violates over 50 years of Supreme Court precedent and fails to trust women to make their own personal decisions,\u201d said Sean J. Young, the legal director of the ACLU of Georgia, in a statement. \u201cThis case has always been about one thing: letting her decide. It is now up to the state to decide whether to appeal this decision and prolong this lawsuit.\u201dMonday\u2019s ruling came the same day a federal judge temporarily blocked a bill in Tennessee that would ban most abortions after the detection of fetal cardiac activity. At least seven other states passed similarly restrictive abortion laws in 2019, all of which are currently stopped in the courts.More Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
