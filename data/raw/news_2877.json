If they could get consensus around killing children based on how they were conceived, they could start breaking down opposition to other elective abortions \u2013 and they did. But that\u2019s over now, as the Los Angeles Times reports: Students for Life of America (SFLA) led the charge to protect children no matter what happened on the night they were brought into existence.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the article entitled \u201cRape Exceptions to Abortion Bans Were Once Widely Accepted. No More,\u201d Los Angeles Times writer Jennifer Haberkorn highlights SFLA for being largely responsible for refusing to accept rape and incest exceptions and thereby transforming the wider movement. Haberkorn begins her analysis with an Alabama pro-life law from 2019 which was unique at the time for its lack of rape and incest exceptions. She writes,\u00a0\n\u201cAlabama\u2019s law benefited from the support of an emerging and growing contingent of abortion opponents who positioned themselves outside a movement long dominated by groups such as the National Right to Life, the nation\u2019s oldest antiabortion group.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThese abortion opponents were younger, more fervent in their position and less beholden to long-standing ideas about the need for political expediency. If abortion is wrong, they asked, why should it ever be allowed? Chief among these activists was Students for Life, a group made up of students who urged the Republican National Committee in a well-circulated letter to drop the rape and incest exceptions.\u201d \u00a0\nSFLA opposes rape and incest exceptions because we understand that a child is no less worthy of life based upon how they were conceived. SFLA and Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins put it best when she said, \u201cYour humanity doesn\u2019t change with the circumstances of your conception. You are valuable regardless of how you came into existence, or what your father did the night of your conception.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHawkins was outspoken about how rape and incest exceptions are illogical and dehumanizing way before this view was considered politically achievable. In 2014, she wrote an enlightening and informative op-ed for The Hill entitled, \u201cWhat About Rape?\u201d in which she condemned pro-life politicians for skirting the issue and putting the pro-life movement\u2019s credibility in jeopardy. Hawkins further explained how true pro-lifers should view rape and incest exceptions, writing,\u00a0\n\u201cWhile the intention may be to ease her suffering, abortion, even in the case of rape, is a great injustice to the second victim, the baby, because he or she did not choose to be placed in this situation, either. Ultimately, we will ask the question: If both victims of this tragic situation can walk away with their lives intact, isn\u2019t that the best option?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn 2014, this was not a view that was widely accepted by the pro-life movement at large, and experts say that SFLA was a turning point for the movement.\u00a0\u00a0\nHaberkorn quoted Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University College of Law professor who specializes in the history of \u201creproductive rights\u201d, as saying, \u201cGroups like Students for Life were embracing positions that [the mainstream antiabortion movement] wouldn\u2019t have, at least as openly.\u201d According to Ziegler, this transformation of the pro-life movement was \u201ca sort of mutiny against the antiabortion incrementalism that had been dominant for decades.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHaberkorn continued, \u201cSupport from groups like Students for Life helped give political life to more stringent abortion bans once viewed as politically impossible.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSFLA will continue to unapologetically lead the way in lobbying and demanding pro-life action which stays true to the mission of pro-life movement: the complete abolition of abortion. Unlike the abortion lobby, we will never define someone\u2019s worth based upon the events that led to their conception, and we will always fight for all babies\u2014not matter how they were conceived. Say goodbye to the acceptance of rape and incest exceptions because the Pro-Life Generation does not tolerate dehumanization.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo read more about why rape and incest exceptions are not pro-life, click HERE and HERE and HERE. \nTo watch Hawkins answer this question live during her 2022 Spring Campus Speaking Tour, click HERE and fast forward to the 1:30:44 time stamp.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,783\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
