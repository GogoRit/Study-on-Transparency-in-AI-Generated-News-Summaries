(Photo: John Partipilo)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 700 Tennessee doctors, nurses and other medical professionals are calling on the state\u2019s GOP-super majority Legislature to revisit an abortion ban that criminalizes the procedure with no exceptions and subjects doctors who perform it to prosecution, fines and jail time.\nIn an open letter to the legislature, published in a full page ad in The Tennessean on Sunday, the healthcare professionals are asking the General Assembly to \u201creconsider the \u2018trigger law.'\u201d\n\u201cTennesseans should have the right to make personal health care decisions with the assistance of their doctors and healthcare team \u2013 without the intrusion of politicians,\u201d the letter says.\n\u201cThis law puts the government in charge of deciding which healthcare options are available to patients, setting a dangerous precedent that violates the sacred physician-patient relationship.\u201d\n\u201cAnd because it includes zero exceptions \u2013 not for rape, incest, fetal anomaly, or even to protect the mother\u2019s life \u2013 it forces health care providers to balance appropriate medical care with the risk of criminal prosecution.\u201d\nTennessee\u2019s trigger law, formally named the \u201cHuman Life Protection Act,\u201d took effect Aug. 25, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark abortion rights case, Roe v Wade and left to individual states the right to set abortion rules.\nIn Tennessee, the law makes performing an abortion a Class C felony, punishable for up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000 for anyone who performs one. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. Instead of containing an exception to the law for abortions necessary to spare the life of, or grave harm to, a pregnant patient, the law says doctors may use those circumstances as an affirmative defense in a criminal trial.\nAll Tennessee abortion clinics have ceased offering the procedure;\u00a0 women seeking abortions must travel out of state. And doctors say they fear they will be prosecuted for providing life-saving abortions.\nThe signers of the paid ad are individuals, not the hospitals that employ them. Hospitals have declined to answer reporters\u2019 questions about how they will comply with the law and whether they are permitting any life-saving abortions to be performed at their facilities.\n\u201cWe are doing the heavy lifting ourselves\u2014and that means funding the effort ourselves, as well,\u201d said Dr. Amy Gordon Bono, a Nashville physician.\n\n\n\n\nThe letter was initiated by Dr. Nikki Zite, a Knoxville OB-GYN, Dr. Heather Maune, a Nashville OB-GYN and Dr. Jessica Rosen, a Nashville emergency medicine physician, a news release said.\n\u201cThis letter quickly gained support from so many colleagues because healthcare workers don\u2019t want a ban without exceptions,\u201d Dr. Zite said. \u201cMedical professionals understand that there are situations, often heartbreaking, when ending a pregnancy is necessary. People don\u2019t want physicians delaying care because they fear being criminalized.\u201d\nOrganizers are working to next run the ad in the Tennessean online, Dr. Bono said.\nThe letter does not include specific recommendations for whether the law should be amended or overturned, but notes the law, as it is written now, could criminalize routine and urgent medical procedures, including tubal pregnancies, serious infections or cancers during pregnancy and miscarriage care.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFull text of the letter:\n\n\n\n\nAs medical professionals from across Tennessee, we call on our legislature to reconsider the \u201ctrigger law,\u201d which bans abortion without exception and criminalizes physicians for providing lifesaving care.\nThis law makes ending any pregnancy a felony offense, even when the pregnancy cannot survive to viability and threatens the life of the mother. This impacts women experiencing miscarriages, tubal pregnancies, or even serious infections or cancers during pregnancy.\nTennesseans should have the right to make personal health care decisions with the assistance of their doctors and healthcare team \u2013 without the intrusion of politicians. This law puts the government in charge of deciding which healthcare options are available to patients, setting a dangerous precedent that violates the sacred physician-patient relationship.
