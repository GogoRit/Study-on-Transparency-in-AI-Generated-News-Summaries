Her support for the women\u2019s rights movement earned her the nickname \u201cGloria Steinem of the Republican Party,\u201d which worked as either a compliment or an insult, depending on the party member who uttered it. \nHer consistent views in regards to civil and women\u2019s rights earned her the ire of more right-wing GOP members, but she did not let the opposition stand in her way. Her fight to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and her stunning moral integrity were portrayed in the 2020 Hulu docudrama Mrs. America. Here is her true story.\nBecoming A Jill \u201cRuckelshaus Republican\u201d\nBefore she ruffled the feathers of her own party, Jill Ruckelshaus was born Jill Elizabeth Strickland in 1937 to an Episcopalian family in Indianapolis, Indiana. After graduating from Indiana University, Ruckelshaus went on to obtain a master\u2019s degree in English literature from Harvard.\nAfter a stint teaching abroad in Switzerland, she returned to Indiana in 1962 and met her husband, William Ruckelshaus, at a dinner party set up by Ruckelshaus\u2019s aunt. He was Deputy Attorney General of Indiana at the time \u2014 he was also a widower with twin toddlers. They were introduced and the two wed five months later.\n\u201cI got the willies at the idea of being married \u2014 I had a career without marriage planned,\u201d she admitted. But the couple turned out to be perfect for each other, advocating for progressive ideals in a more conservative government. \nWilliam Ruckelshaus was known for his opposition to DDT and his call to institute health-based standards for air pollutants and car emissions. Together they were known as the \u201cclean\u201d couple of the Washington swamp following Richard Nixon\u2019s 1973 Watergate Scandal.\nIndeed, their stance on Republicanism was such that Jill Ruckelshaus referred to herself as a \u201cRuckelshaus Republican.\u201d\nGetty ImagesNWPC co-founders Jill Ruckelshaus (right) and Gloria Steinem (left) appear together in a television interview.\nJill Ruckelshaus was briefly a stay-at-home wife as the family expanded to five children. She had to leave some ambitions, like her desire to join the Peace Corps, behind. Instead, Ruckelshaus channeled her energy into becoming a perfect homemaker. She reportedly had \u201cthis obsession to be the best housecleaner, to have the best parties, and to have the cleanest, best-dressed children.\u201d\nIn 1969, the family relocated to Washington, D.C. when William Ruckelshaus was hired as the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under then-President Nixon\u2019s new administration. Meanwhile, Ruckelshaus grew too restless.\n\u201cI had a lovely family,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut I was terribly unhappy. I didn\u2019t identify what was wrong with my feelings until I began meeting women who were doing things and were using their minds.\u201d\nRuckelshaus\u2019 Fight For The ERA\nIn 1971, Jill Ruckelshaus banded together with like-minded women Shirley Chisholm, Gloria Steinem, and Bella Abzug to form the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus (NWPC). \nThe NWPC was the \u201conly national organization dedicated exclusively to increasing women\u2019s participation in all areas of political and public life\u201d and most notably campaigned for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), an amendment to the constitution that would afford women more legal, social, and political rights. The ERA had seven years to acquire the approval of 38 states in order to be written into the constitution.\nRuckelshaus was frequently one of the only conservatives among liberal women and was notably pro-choice. Other conservative women, like Phyllis Schlafly, opposed Ruckelshaus\u2019 positions and actively campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment.\nWikimedia CommonsThe Ruckelshaus\u2019 at William\u2019s swearing-in as the head of the new EPA.\nIn 1972, Jill Ruckelshaus was made the White House special assistant on women\u2019s rights but stepped down in 1973. At the same time, her husband left his posting as the head of the new EPA due to corruption in Nixon\u2019s cabinet.\nIn a 1975 speech before the National Press Club, Ruckelshaus took the press to task for its sexist coverage of female politicians and encouraged her party to appoint a woman as the chair of the upcoming Republican convention. \nShe specifically called out U.S. Representative Morris Udall, a Democrat from Arizona, who stated on his personal envelopes that the public wanted \u201ctrue leadership from our public men and institutions.\u201d Ruckelshaus quipped: \u201cI suspect that the printing on that envelope will soon change.\u201d\nThat same year, she was appointed to the head of a presidential commission on women\u2019s rights under President Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency following Nixon\u2019s resignation. The posting was a clear sign of the new administration\u2019s support for the ERA and elevated Ruckelshaus\u2019 status in politics.\n\n\nElizabeth Banks as Jill Ruckelshaus on Mrs. America.\n\nIn 1977, Ruckelshaus was a key figure in securing $5 million from Congress in order to hold a National Women\u2019s Conference for the first time in Houston, Texas.\nMeanwhile, there was a widely-held belief that the ERA was going to pass, but it wound up being just short of approval when it reached its ratification deadline in 1979. This was because of the unexpected national campaign against the amendment mobilized by fellow Republican Phyllis Schlafly.\nPolitics Of Principle\nGetty/Hulu/FX NetworkElizabeth Banks (right) as Jill Ruckelshaus in Mrs. America.\nThe failure of the ERA did not spell the end to Ruckelshaus\u2019 political career.  \nIn 1980, she was appointed to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission by former Democratic President Jimmy Carter. This was evidence of her growing political appeal on both sides of the House floor. Moderate Republicans appreciated her vigor and Democrats resonated with her ideals.\nShe became the third head of the United Nations Conference on International Women\u2019s Year. From 1980 to 1983, she served as a commissioner for the United States Commission on Civil Rights.\n\u201cShe\u2019s hard-working and practical and always does her homework,\u201d said Blandina Cardenas Ramirez, a Democrat who served on the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cI really can\u2019t say enough glowing things about her. She\u2019s a liberal woman, but she has a practical understanding about what government can be.\u201d\nIn the 2020 Hulu series Mrs. America, Jill Ruckelshaus is portrayed by actress Elizabeth Banks. Banks spoke about her own views on feminism while promoting the show at the Television Critics Association in January 2020: \u201cI never bought into \u2018feminist\u2019 being a bad word\u2026I just believe men and women should have equality of opportunity\u2026Everything else that has gone into the demonization of the word are special interests who don\u2019t want women to succeed.\u201d\nRuckelshaus likely holds a similar sentiment. She remains a progressive advocate for women\u2019s rights to this day.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve learned about Jill Ruckelshaus, meet Martha Mitchell, the woman nobody believed about Watergate. Then, read up on Mary Astell, the so-called mother of all feminists.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShare\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauthor\n\n\n\n\nauthor\n\nNatasha Ishak\n\n\n\n\nA former staff writer for All That's Interesting, Natasha Ishak holds a Master's in journalism from Emerson College and her work has appeared in VICE, Insider, Vox, and Harvard's Nieman Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neditor\n\n\n\n\neditor\n\nLeah Silverman\n\n\n\nA former associate editor for All That's Interesting, Leah Silverman holds a Master's in Fine Arts from Columbia University's Creative Writing Program and her work has appeared in Catapult, Town & Country, Women's Health, and Publishers Weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For The ATI Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Post\nThe Truth About Al Capone's Net Worth And How He Lost Millions\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Post\nResearchers Finally Find The USS Nevada, Which Survived Pearl Harbor, D-Day, And An Atomic Bomb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 Interesting Facts About The World\nTrending on ATI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Stephen Hawking Thinks Threatens Humankind The Most\nTrending on ATI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27 Raw Images Of When Punk Ruled New York\nTrending on ATI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI\n\nAbout\nAdvertise\nJobs\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\nFollow hu On \n\nJoin The All That's Interesting Weekly Dispatch\n\n\nLike\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPO Box 24091\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11202-4091\n\n\n\n\n"
