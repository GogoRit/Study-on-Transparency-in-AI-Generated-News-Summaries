Today, people are more likely than ever before to enjoy reproductive rights and choices.\nIt is an extraordinary achievement, an inspiration to us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating the many contributions made is a fitting way to mark the 50th anniversary of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and the 25th anniversary of the landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development.\nThe people profiled here represent countless valiant others who have likewise made a difference. Many have energized the global movement for sexual and reproductive health and rights. Others are poised to carry it forward\u2014with hope and determination for a future of rights and choices for all.\n\n\n\nscroll down\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Whitney Curtis/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople equal development\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn 1994, at the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), icons and activists from around the world mobilized behind an unprecedented global agreement, the ICPD Programme of Action. For the first time, 179 governments committed to social and economic development that upholds human dignity and empowers people to chart their own futures. The ICPD was the culmination of a global movement to uphold the basic right of all couples and individuals to freely and responsibly make their own decisions about the number and spacing of their children, and to have the information, education and means to do so.\n\n\n\nIcons and activists\n\nGita Sen\nJoan Marie Dunlop\nAdrienne Germain\nRachel Kyte\nDr. Lincoln Chen\nSusan Berresford, Jos\u00e9 Barzelatto, Margaret Hempel, Susan Davis\nDr. Mahmoud Fathalla\nCheikh Mback\u00e9\nJulia Bunting\nJeff Jordan\nAlexandre Kalache\nTed Turner\nKathy Calvin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Suzanne Camarata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGita Sen\n\n\n\n                                    I think living the life of a woman drives me.\n\n                                    I was aware of gender inequality even as a girl, when a lot was about controlling what girls could be and do.

Since then, health-care systems around the world have taken steps to provide more people with the information and services they need to plan their families, give birth safely, avoid or treat sexually transmitted infections, and address infertility and reproductive health cancers. While gaps remain, the stage has been set for further expansion of services: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes sexual and reproductive health as essential to equitable development and women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nIcons and activists\n\nCarmen Barroso\nPatricia Rodney\nDr. Allan Rosenfield\nDr. Nadine Gasman\nRosemary Barber-Madden\nFrances Kissling\nAdjoa Amana\nDr. Peter Lamptey\nYolonda Richardson\nBarbara Klugman\nSivananthi Thanenthiran\nUlrika Karlsson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Derli Barroso\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarmen Barroso\n\n\n\n                                    I strongly believe the language of human rights is the language of progressive change today.\n\n                                    There is a revolutionary potential in the fundamental notion that every human being simply by virtue of being human, is entitled to certain basic protection.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Derli Barroso\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 UNFPA/Zeriba Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatricia Rodney\n\n\n\nHealth is not just about diet and exercise.
