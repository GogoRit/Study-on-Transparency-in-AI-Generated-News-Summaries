Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and M. Nirmal Kumar took up a suo motu public interest litigation petition, with the permission of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, after a neurosurgeon\u2019s body was not allowed to be buried in a cemetery at Kilpauk here on Sunday. The judges said, according to news reports, local residents had opposed burial of the surgeon\u2019s body at the Kilpauk cemetery. Consequently, the body was taken to a burial ground at Velangadu in New Avadi Road where again a mob attempted to prevent the burial.In the process, some public servants had sustained injuries when they attempted to disperse the mob. The ambulance, in which the body was transported, was also damaged. Such acts were completely unacceptable and legally punishable, the judges pointed out.\u201cIt prima facie appears that as a consequence of the above said alleged acts, a person who practised a noble profession as a doctor, and breathed his last, has been deprived of his right to have a burial in a cemetery earmarked for that purpose,\u201d the Division Bench lamented.The Bench pointed out that the Code of Criminal Procedure contains enough provisions to deal with maintenance of public order, discouraging unlawful assemblies, dispersal of such assemblies using civil force and immunity to police personnel involved in such action.Authoring the interim order, Justice Sathyanarayanan also pointed out that Section 297 of the Indian Penal Code states it is a punishable offence to trespass into a burial ground or crematorium and cause indignity to the corpse or disturbance to performance of funeral rites.Centre\u2019s guidelinesPeople found guilty under the Section could be punished with imprisonment that could extend up to one year or with fine or both. The court also recalled that the Centre had already issued an advisory to the citizens and urged them to avoid social stigma associated with COVID-19. Further, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had also issued guidelines on March 16 with respect to management of bodies of those who die due to COVID-19. Those guidelines require strict adherence to infection prevention control practices.Those guidelines require the body to be secured in a body bag, the exterior of which should be decontaminated. \u201cEnvironmental cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is to be done with one per cent Sodium Hypochlorite solution. Autopsy should be avoided and embalming should not be allowed.\u201cAt the crematorium/burial ground, the staff should be sensitised that COVID-19 does not pose additional risk,\u201d the Ministry\u2019s guidelines read. Stating that these guidelines were available in the public domain, the judges said, people were expected to be aware of them.The court also ordered notice to the State government and adjourned further hearing on the PIL petition to April 28.\nRead Comments ()\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\npublic health/community medicine\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\nTop News Today0 / 0\nRead in App\n\n\n\nThe Hindu\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\n\n\nCode of Editorial Values\n\n\n\n\nNews Archive\n\n\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\n\nPrint Subscription\n\n\n\n\nDigital Subscription\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nRss Feeds\n\n\n\n\nReaders Editor-Terms of Reference\n\n\n\n\nAuthors & Contributors\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup News Sites\n\n\n\nBusiness Line\n\n\n\n\nBL on Campus\n\n\n\n\nSportstar\n\n\n\n\nFrontline\n\n\n\n\n\u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8\n\n\n\n\nThe Hindu Centre\n\n\n\n\nYoung World Club\n\n\n\n\nThe Hindu ePaper\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Line ePaper\n\n\n\n\nCrossword + Free Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Products\n\n\n\nRoofandFloor\n\n\n\n\nSTEP\n\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\n\n\nClassifieds - Print\n\n\n\n\nBookstore & Special Publications\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Sections\n\n\n\nElections\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict 2023\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\nNational News\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\nLife & Style\n\n\n\n\nFood\n\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\n\nShowcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\n\nColumns\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\nCartoon\n\n\n\n\nLetters\n\n\n\n\nInterview\n\n\n\n\nLead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\nAgri-Business\n\n\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\n\n\nEconomy\n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\n\n\nBudget\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\n\n\nMotorsport\n\n\n\n\nRaces\n\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSci-Tech\n\n\n\n\nScience\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\n\nGadgets\n\n\n\n\nInternet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\n\n\n\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\n\n\n\nKarnataka\n\n\n\n\nKerala\n\n\n\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n\n\n\nTelangana\n\n\n\n\nOther States\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCities\n\n\n\n\nBengaluru\n\n\n\n\nChennai\n\n\n\n\nCoimbatore\n\n\n\n\nDelhi\n\n\n\n\nHyderabad\n\n\n\n\nKochi\n\n\n\n\nKolkata\n\n\n\n\nKozhikode\n\n\n\n\nMadurai\n\n\n\n\nMangaluru\n\n\n\n\nMumbai\n\n\n\n\nPuducherry\n\n\n\n\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n\n\n\nTiruchirapalli\n\n\n\n\nVijayawada\n\n\n\n\nVisakhapatnam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending on The Hindu\n2024 elections in india\n\nVisual Stories\n\nLok Sabha General elections 2024\n\nIndira Gandhi\u2019s 1979 Thanjavur By Election\n\nHaryana floor test\n\nRameshwaram cafe blast suspect sketches\n\nShaitaan movie review\n\nGaami Movie review\n\nDamsel movie review\n\nAadhar\nTrending on Group sites\nStock Market Live Today\n\nIndia vs England LIVE 5th Test\n\nRanji Trophy Final Live Score\n\nStock Market Today\n\nGold Rate Today\n\nSilver Rate Today\n\nStocks to buy\n\nFootball News\n\nPolitics News\n\nFrontline Current Issue\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n \nCopyright\u00a9 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.
