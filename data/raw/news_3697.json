Wade if elected, has recently focused on Oz, who clarified his stance on abortion this month, and his views on reproductive health.\u00a0\nOz told reporters at a press conference in Philadelphia this month that he would not support criminal penalties for people who sought or doctors who performed abortions. Describing himself as \u201cstrongly pro-life,\u201d he added that he supports exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother\u2019s life is at risk.\nThe clarification comes after audio from a tele-town hall, held one week before the May primary election, resurfaced and fueled questions about where Oz, who defended Roe v. Wade in 2019, stands on abortion access.
