Wade, ending nearly 50 years of federal protection for abortion, some states began enforcing strict abortion bans while others became new havens for the procedure. ProPublica is investigating how sweeping changes to reproductive health care access in America are affecting people, institutions and governments.\n \n\n\n\nThis story was co-published with WPLN. ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\n\nWhen state Sen. Richard Briggs voted \u201cyes\u201d on Tennessee\u2019s total abortion ban, he never thought it would actually go into effect.\nIt was 2019, and Roe v. Wade was the law of the land. His vote seemed like a political statement, not a decision that would soon impact people\u2019s lives.\nBut on Aug. 25, the ban, one of the strictest in the country, kicked in. It contains no explicit exceptions for circumstances under which the procedure would be allowed. Any doctor who performs an abortion in Tennessee faces a felony that carries penalties of up to 15 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\n\n\u201cThe way that many state laws work is they\u2019ll say, \u2018Abortion, elective abortion, is generally illegal except in these situations.\u2019 \u2026 What y\u2019all did is you said, \u2018Elective abortion is illegal all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n        \u2014Katie Glenn, state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America\n\n    \n\nRepublican state leaders have repeatedly said the law has enough protections for doctors who provide \u201cmedically necessary care to pregnant women,\u201d referring to a narrow clause that allows doctors to defend themselves from charges by proving an abortion was necessary to prevent death. But already, some women have made costly rushes across state lines to end nonviable pregnancies or to seek high-risk care that Tennessee doctors weren\u2019t sure they could legally provide.\nFaced with the law\u2019s real-world implications, Briggs and a handful of his fellow Republicans have made statements floating the idea that they will \u201cclean up\u201d or \u201cclarify\u201d the ban when the next legislative session begins in January.\nBriggs, who won reelection last week, told voters he would like to see the law offer clear exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal anomalies and cases where the pregnant patient\u2019s life or health are at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\nGet Our Top Investigations\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail address:\n\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\nThanks for signing up.

The anti-abortion organization helped write and lobby for so-called trigger bans \u2014 laws that outlawed abortion in anticipation of Roe being overturned \u2014 in Republican-majority statehouses across the country.\nProPublica reviewed a recording of the call. It provides the clearest examples yet of the strategy that the law\u2019s architects are pursuing to influence legislators and the public amid growing national concerns that abortion bans endanger women\u2019s health care and lives.\n\n\n\u201cI encourage you to be able to, in a certain sense, hide behind the skirts of women who\u2019ve actually been there.\u201d\n\n\n        \u2014David C. Reardon, researcher with the Charlotte Lozier Institute\n\n    \n\nDuring the hourlong meeting, representatives of Tennessee Right to Life and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America urged the legislators to stay the course and protect the nation\u2019s \u201cstrongest\u201d abortion ban as it stands.\nThey said they see Tennessee\u2019s ban, with its tiny carve-out for life-saving procedures and steep penalties for doctors, as the best example of a law that protects every potential life \u2014 even when it means pregnant patients must face serious risks or trauma in the process. The group has released model legislation suggesting it would like to see similar language adopted across the country, not weakened by exceptions.\nDuring the call, one activist reminded the group about the law\u2019s strict requirements for doctors. \u201cThe burden of proof, the onus, is on the doctor to prove that he or she was in the right.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that [the doctor] didn\u2019t violate the text of the statute, it\u2019s that they had a justifiable reason to do so,\u201d said another activist. \u201cAnd that reason \u2014 you\u2019ve drawn it very narrowly \u2014 is to save her life, to prevent an organ system from failing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbortion Is Illegal, All the Time\u201d\n\n\n\nKatie Glenn, state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, discusses how Tennessee\u2019s total abortion ban addresses life-threatening medical emergencies.\n\nCredit: \n        Webinar audio reviewed by ProPublica\n    \n\n\nA Tennessee lawmaker on the call suggested health data could be mined to track and investigate doctors, to make sure the abortions they provided to save patients' lives were truly necessary.\nThe discussion also captured anti-abortion groups coaching legislators on messages aimed at swaying the wider public to support their stance.\nOne researcher said that when lawmakers are challenged about the state\u2019s lack of exceptions for rape and incest cases, they should try to \u201chide behind the skirts of women\u201d who carried such pregnancies to term and believe abortion is wrong. Others suggested \u201cnegativity\u201d toward the law would fade and raised the possibility of regulating contraception and in vitro fertilization in a few years\u2019 time.\nProPublica reached out to National Right to Life, Tennessee Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the Charlotte Lozier Institute. They did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment.\nIn the chat box, state Rep. Susan Lynn, who originally sponsored the law in the House, typed a question: \u201c9 months after the enactment of this law, can we organize with the crisis pregnancy centers to see some of these babies? <3.\u201d\nWill Brewer, the state\u2019s most influential anti-abortion lobbyist, responded: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    \u201cA Lot More Complex\u201d\n\nBriggs, a heart surgeon and a retired U.S. Army colonel, was unimpressed.\nA Methodist who considers himself a pro-life \u201cReagan Republican,\u201d Briggs would prefer not to get involved with abortion politics at all. He told ProPublica that he sometimes wishes men would \u201crecuse themselves from the whole thing, because we don\u2019t need to be talking about that.\u201d\nBut the trigger law he\u2019d supported was now staring him in the face. As a physician, he felt the anti-abortion lobbyists were \u201cskirting around\u201d serious health care questions that the law\u2019s language fails to address and instead were presenting \u201ca simpleton\u2019s message.\u201d\n\u201cThey really don\u2019t want me talking when I bring up these medical issues,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cBecause the medical issues are a lot more complex.\u201d\n\n\n\nTennessee state Sen. Richard Briggs\n\nCredit: \n        Jack Sorokin, special to ProPublica\n    \n\n\nWhen Tennessee Right to Life, the state\u2019s main anti-abortion lobbying group, proposed the trigger ban in 2019, Briggs admits he barely read the two-page bill forwarded to his office.\nHe followed the lead of his colleagues, who assured state lawmakers that the bill included medical exceptions. He even added his name as a co-sponsor. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to defend myself,\u201d he says now.\nThere was little pushback from advocates, doctors or Democrats at the time. Many took it to be a far-fetched stunt, doomed by the safeguards of Roe v. Wade.\nWhen a Senate Democrat proposed changes that would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, Briggs didn\u2019t counter the chorus of \u201cnays.\u201d\nThe Democrat then narrowed her amendment to only apply to minors, but it was shot down too. The bill sailed through as originally written.\nBriggs says he didn\u2019t understand it at the time, but the law he voted for so quickly was part of a flurry of legislation that anti-abortion groups had pushed in Republican-majority statehouses after the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh energized the movement. Many states passed similar trigger bans, and Tennessee ended up with the strictest version: a criminal statute that contains no explicit exceptions. Not even for the life or health of the pregnant person.\n\n\n\nIt does include a legal mechanism called the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d that can be used in life-threatening emergencies. The defense is written in such a way that it means doctors who provide an abortion must \u201cprove by a preponderance of evidence\u201d that the procedure was necessary to save the pregnant patient\u2019s life or prevent \u201cirreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d No state agencies have released standards to help clarify what counts. The boundaries of enforcement would be left up to prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\"There has to be medical judgment \u2026 [or] you\u2019ve got the legislature practicing medicine, which they have no business at all doing.\"\n\n\n        \u2014Tennessee state Sen. Richard Briggs\n\n    \n\nIn past years, Briggs often earned a 100% rating on Tennessee Right to Life\u2019s scorecard for legislators who support the group\u2019s policy priorities. But as outcry over the ban grew, he found himself agreeing with medical providers who said the law had gone too far.\n\u201cHere, the defendant is guilty until he can prove that he\u2019s not guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, that is a very bad position to put the doctors in \u2014 why should this doctor have to pay his own legal bills for saving a woman\u2019s life?\u201d\nA judge blocked a similar \u201caffirmative defense\u201d provision in Idaho\u2019s abortion ban for \u201cinjecting tremendous uncertainty\u201d into emergency care for pregnant patients.\nMany Republicans argue that physicians are fearmongering and say it\u2019s inconceivable that a prosecutor would use their discretion to go after a doctor for terminating a pregnancy for someone whose life was at risk. In the more than two months since the law has gone into effect, they point out, zero doctors have been arrested.\nThe law\u2019s goal, they say, is to shut down what they call \u201celective\u201d abortions that often happened at family planning clinics like Planned Parenthood.\nBriggs agrees with that goal. But he looked at abortion bans in other conservative Southern States: They included explicit exceptions.\nHis position seems to more closely reflect the attitudes of the majority of Tennesseeans: While 50% identify as \u201cpro-life,\u201d 80% believe abortion should be either completely legal or legal under some conditions.\n\n\n\nBut his public statements, particularly in a debate with his Democratic opponent ahead of last week\u2019s election, led to tense meetings with anti-abortion groups, Briggs says.\nThe Oct. 27 video meeting was advertised as an opportunity to hear \u201cwhy Tennessee\u2019s law is on solid ground and how medical facts back it up.\u201d Briggs registered to attend.\nOpening the call, Brewer, the legal counsel and lobbyist for Tennessee Right to Life, implored lawmakers not to tell the press that they had only voted for the law because they thought Roe would never be overturned. He urged them not to agree to any calls for clarification or new exceptions.\n\n\n\u201cWe Need to Defend This Law\u201d\n\n\n\nWill Brewer, legal counsel and lobbyist for Tennessee Right to Life, asks lawmakers not to rewrite the state\u2019s abortion ban to include clearer exceptions that would address concerns about doctors\u2019 ability to intervene in high-risk situations for pregnant patients.\n\nCredit: \n        Webinar audio reviewed by ProPublica\n    \n\n\nInstead, he advised lawmakers to wait for any backlash to die down and to continue to \u201cplay offense\u201d in the abortion wars.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that we stumbled into,\u201d Brewer said on the call. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a PR move or to stoke the fires of our base. This was a law that we knew would come into effect, hopefully sooner rather than later, and we wanted Tennessee to be prepared.\u201d\nHe was joined by members of the national anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and a researcher affiliated with their nonprofit arm, the Charlotte Lozier Insitute. None of the speakers had medical experience.\nKatie Glenn, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America\u2019s state policy director, counseled lawmakers to let the law sit for another 200 days before reacting to any polls that showed Americans want more exceptions. The protests, she assured them, would fade as people moved on.\n\u201cIt can feel like, \u2018What did we do? We need to go back and like, tear this all apart and open up the law and change all these things,\u2019\u201d she said \u201cBut I really want to urge you tonight, if you take away nothing else from what I say in the next few minutes, please have confidence in your work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe your caucus gets to a point \u2026 where you do want to talk about IVF, and how to regulate it in a more ethical way, or deal with some of those contraceptive issues.\u201d\n\n\n        \u2014Stephen Billy, vice president for state affairs at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America\n\n    \n\nShe laid out why the anti-abortion movement sees Tennessee\u2019s ban as so important: \u201cThe way that many state laws work is they\u2019ll say, \u2018Abortion, elective abortion, is generally illegal except in these situations.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0That\u2019s the way they phrase it, is around this word of an \u2018exception,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhat y\u2019all did is you said, \u2018Elective abortion is illegal all the time.\u2019\u201d\nBrewer contrasted an \u201cemergency room middle of the night instance, where a woman is bleeding\u201d \u2014 which he made clear he believes the law\u2019s affirmative defense covers \u2014 with a situation where a woman might want to terminate a pregnancy because of a high-risk medical history.\n\u201cThat is not an urgent need,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure that these quasi-elective abortions are being stopped.\u201d\nGlenn said cases involving abortion pills should not be permitted under the law because the process takes multiple days.\n\u201cNothing about that is an emergency,\u201d she said. Brewer and Glenn did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn the chat box, Lynn, the representative who first introduced the trigger ban, asked Brewer to check with the state Department of Health to find out if data could be monitored to flag doctors who performed abortions at a higher rate so they could be investigated to find out if patients\u2019 lives were truly at risk.\n\u201cDo we need to follow up on that at some point and make sure that they are looking for the outliers?\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cYes we do,\u201d Brewer responded.\nLynn did not respond to requests for comment.\nAfter listening to the call, Briggs reflected on his 44 years of medical experience. He could think of plenty of dangerous and heart-wrenching situations that fall into the gray area Brewer and Glenn did not discuss.\nWhat about ectopic pregnancies that grow outside the uterus, Briggs remembered thinking. If those aren\u2019t dealt with, they could eventually rupture the fallopian tube, where most such pregnancies occur, and lead to death. Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy can attach to a cesarean scar, and in some of those cases, it may be possible to bring the pregnancy to term \u2014 though doing so risks serious complications, including uterine rupture and death. Yet the law gives no guidance on how to handle those cases, he thought. It defines a pregnancy simply as having a fertilized egg \u201cwithin the body,\u201d not specifically within the uterus. (Other abortion bans specify that treating an ectopic pregnancy is legal.)\n\n\n\nSometimes, Briggs knew, terminating a pregnancy could stop a dangerous condition before it becomes truly life-threatening. He pointed out other cases the law did not address: What about someone was diagnosed early in pregnancy with preeclampsia, which can lead to life-threatening complications? Or a patient whose water broke too early, leaving them nearly certain to eventually miscarry and at risk for sepsis? What about a patient with cancer or preexisting medical conditions that a pregnancy could brutally complicate?\nHow sick did a patient need to be before a pregnancy could be terminated? And was a doctor really supposed to wait to provide that care until the patient faced a truly immediate life-or-death situation?\n\u201cI think that\u2019s wrong. I think that\u2019s not the standard of care,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cIf you willfully neglect her, then that goes from being malpractice to criminal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that we stumbled into. It wasn\u2019t just a PR move or to stoke the fires of our base. This was a law that we knew would come into effect, hopefully sooner rather than later, and we wanted Tennessee to be prepared.\u201d\n\n\n        \u2014Will Brewer, legal counsel and lobbyist for Tennessee Right to Life\n\n    \n\nMore than 1,000 Tennessee medical professionals have publicly opposed the law on the grounds that it interferes with care for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, serious infections and cancers during pregnancy. They have joined activists in asking the governor to convene a special legislative session to review the law, but he has repeatedly said he\u2019s comfortable with it.\nBriggs said a woman recently told him she believed 100% of women with cancer would want to continue their pregnancies instead of terminating to undergo chemotherapy. But Briggs knew that wasn\u2019t true. How would a cancer patient who is already a parent assess their chances, for example? \u201cThat could mean a child raised without their mother,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s a woman\u2019s decision, it shouldn\u2019t be the decision of the legislature that she can\u2019t do chemotherapy.\u201d\nThere are many situations like that, Briggs said. Situations that aren\u2019t black-and-white, that involve an intensely personal risk assessment, where every option comes with some measure of heartbreak.\nAs a surgeon, Briggs had dealt with cases of fetal anomalies, including cases where babies would be born without properly developed hearts or brains. Some could be operated on, but others clearly wouldn\u2019t be able to survive. Watching their induced deliveries was bracing. \u201cYou really have a little baby there you just let sit there until it dies \u2014 to get cold and die,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anybody would be affected.\u201d\n\n\n\nBriggs is one of the few Republican legislators calling for clear exceptions to be added to the state\u2019s total abortion ban in the upcoming legislative session.\n\nCredit: \n        Jack Sorokin, special to ProPublica\n    \n\n\nBriggs says some Republican leaders have asked him to further define the health exceptions he\u2019d like to see in the law. But he doesn\u2019t see lists as the answer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said creating lists of exceptions is dangerous because they can interfere with a medical provider\u2019s ability to assess fast-moving health indicators.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hit every exception \u2014 there has to be medical judgment,\u201d Briggs said. Otherwise, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the legislature practicing medicine, which they have no business at all doing.\u201d\n\n    \u201cHide Behind the Skirts of Women\u201d\n\nTo Briggs, the anti-abortion lobbyists were asking lawmakers to respond to legitimate questions from voters with answers that weren\u2019t based in science.\nOn the webinar, Briggs listened as the organizers brought on David C. Reardon, a researcher associated with the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the nonprofit research arm of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. Reardon outlined a strategy that lawmakers could lean on when asked about rape and incest exceptions.\n\n\n\nThere is \u201cno peer-reviewed medical evidence that shows that abortion in and of itself produces any benefit to women,\u201d he advised the legislators to say. He claimed that abortion is connected with higher mortality and breast cancer rates. Briggs found his arguments suspect.\n\u201cWhere in the world that came from, I have no idea,\u201d Briggs said after the call. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Dr. Reardon was a physician.\u201d\nReardon has a Ph.D. in biomedical ethics from a since-closed unaccredited online university, according to documents he provided to ProPublica. For decades, he has been publishing work that spreads doubts about the safety of abortion but that the wider medical community views as drawing inappropriate conclusions from cherry-picked data to serve an agenda.\n\u201cThe flaws in his research are so profound that no person with minimal training in biostatistics and epidemiology would use these methods,\u201d said Elizabeth Janiak, an assistant professor of social and behavioral science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\n\u201c[Anti-abortion lobbyists] don\u2019t want to change it one bit. It\u2019s like: We won the election and we got what we want, and we\u2019re not going to compromise.\u201d\n\n\n        \u2014Tennessee state Sen. Richard Briggs\n\n    \n\nThe American Cancer Society says scientific evidence does not support the theory that abortions raise the risk of breast cancer. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reviewed existing research and found the risk of death after a legal abortion is a small fraction of the risk of carrying a pregnancy to term. They also found that previous studies linking abortion and long-term mortality rates had not adjusted for social risk factors and \u201cno clear conclusions\u201d could be drawn from them. A large body of peer-reviewed work finds that having a wanted abortion is not associated with worse health or mental health outcomes. Instead, denying a woman a wanted abortion is linked to worse economic and health outcomes and can strengthen a woman\u2019s ties to a violent partner.\nReardon told the lawmakers he recently co-authored a book that was based on interviews with nearly 200 women who became pregnant due to rape or incest and felt misunderstood by the public discussion around abortion. Some of them, he said on the call, were coerced into an abortion by the parent or abuser who sexually assaulted them \u201cto cover up their crime.\u201d Those who carried to term, he said, \u201cwere overwhelmingly glad that they did.\u201d He suggested lawmakers use their stories when talking to voters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous assumption that women who have rape pregnancies have to have an abortion,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cI encourage you to be able to, in a certain sense, hide behind the skirts of women who\u2019ve actually been there. Bring their voices forward. Challenge the other side to demonstrate that abortion actually benefits women.\u201d\nWhen reached for comment, Reardon said the phrase \u201chide behind the skirts of women\u201d wasn\u2019t the word choice he intended.\n\u201cEven as it slipped out, I knew it wasn\u2019t what and how I wanted to say it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have been advocating for years is that politicians should invite the women who have actually had sexual assault pregnancies, no matter what side they are politically, to testify before their legislatures.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHide Behind the Skirts of Women\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid C. Reardon, a researcher affiliated with the Charlotte Lozier Institute, advises lawmakers to read a book he co-authored interviewing nearly 200 women who became pregnant due to sexual assault. He encouraged them to use those stories in public discussions about allowing abortion to be legal in cases of rape or incest.\n\nCredit: \n        Webinar audio reviewed by ProPublica\n    \n\n\nReardon said many of the experts and studies on this topic have ties to pro-abortion-rights groups and disputed that his research is misleading. He said he enrolled in a Ph.D. program at Pacific Western University at a time when no accredited programs in biomedical ethics existed, and because it allowed him to combine his studies with full time work and raising a family. He said the coursework involved reading, writing and submitting nearly 50 papers that demonstrated a solid understanding of foundational literature in addition to his dissertation, and that he has since been published in medical journals and invited to serve as a peer reviewer of other researchers looking into abortion issues.\nIn a detailed response, he also acknowledged more complexity than he had expressed on the call.\nTo lawmakers in the webinar, he said that abortion is \u201csomething we know increases mortality rates of women.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn response to ProPublica, he said: \u201cWhile it is difficult to prove when, if ever, abortion is ever the direct and sole cause of any negative effect, it is equally (and perhaps harder) to prove when, if ever, abortion is the direct cause of any positive effects.\u201d\nOn the call, Stephen Billy, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America\u2019s vice president for state affairs, advised lawmakers to follow the \u201cmantra\u201d of \u201ccontrast and compassion.\u201d When questioned about rape and incest exceptions, he said, they could turn the question around.\n\u201cThe other side\u2019s position is an assumption that abortion is going to be the right decision at every point in time,\u201d Billy said. \u201cVoters in Tennessee will be with us when we say our position is to protect that child and just stand with that mother so she can love her child.\u201d\nBut Briggs recalled wondering who was going to support those children, from buying diapers to paying for college. Those arguments rang hollow, he said, at a time when family health insurance costs businesses a reported $22,000 a year per employee and Republicans in his state have repeatedly blocked Medicaid expansion.\nDuring his years working at a hospital, Briggs said, he had seen pregnancies carried by girls as young as 11. He believes there are ways to support children and adults who have been sexually assaulted and still allow the option of terminating the pregnancy. In the next legislative session, he said, he plans to support a bill that would test the DNA of any fetus aborted due to rape in order to confirm the attacker\u2019s identity.\n\n    The Next Battle\n\nIn the chat, Lynn asked for advice on answering questions about in vitro fertilization and the morning-after pill. IVF, a fertility treatment, generally involves creating multiple embryos, and some may ultimately be discarded. The morning-after pill is emergency contraception that prevents pregnancy if taken soon after unprotected sex. Some wings of the anti-abortion movement would like to see both banned or tightly limited because they believe those procedures amount to terminating human lives. The definition of an \u201cunborn child\u201d in Tennessee\u2019s law starts at fertilization.\nResponding to Lynn, the speakers suggested keeping the focus on the current law and reminding voters that IVF clinics and contraception are still available in Tennessee.\n\n\nIVF and Contraception\n\n\n\nStephen Billy, the vice president of state affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, advises lawmakers not to discuss regulating in vitro fertilization and contraception with voters when discussing the current law. They can revisit the topic in a few years\u2019 time, he tells them.\n\nCredit: \n        Webinar audio reviewed by ProPublica\n    \n\n\n\u201cMaybe your caucus gets to a point next year, two years from now, three years from now, where you do want to talk about IVF, and how to regulate it in a more ethical way, or deal with some of those contraceptive issues,\u201d said Billy. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the conversation that you need to have now.\u201d He did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs Billy wrapped up, he advised: \u201cI think we have to be really careful that we don\u2019t present our side of the argument as if we\u2019re making the best decision for individual women.\u201d\nProPublica asked about 70 lawmakers who sponsored the law if they wanted to see changes to it in the next legislative session. Two responded.\n\u201cBased upon our findings, it seems the current language is clear,\u201d said state Rep. Ryan Williams.  \n\u201cJust because somebody\u2019s life started in a traumatic way does not mean that life should be destroyed,\u201d said state Sen. Mark Pody.\nIn interviews, Brewer has said that he wants lawmakers to introduce bills that strike at the remaining avenues through which Tennesseans can access abortion. That could include passing laws that more tightly regulate online access to abortion pills and block companies from subsidizing employees\u2019 travel to other states to terminate pregnancies. He said he would also like to stop \u201cmarketing efforts\u201d from out-of-state abortion clinics that advertise within the state.\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Missouri Helps Abortion Opponents Divert State Taxes to Crisis Pregnancy Centers\n\n\n\nBrewer reminded the lawmakers: \u201cWe passed this law to put our state in a strong position. And we need to defend this law.\u201d\nBriggs didn\u2019t raise any of his concerns during the webinar. He said he had already voiced them to Brewer in private conversations. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to change it one bit,\u201d Briggs said of Tennessee Right to Life. \u201cIt\u2019s like: We won the election and we got what we want, and we\u2019re not going to compromise.\u201d\n\n\nAre You in a State That Banned Abortion?
