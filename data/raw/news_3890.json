By Carolyn TwerskyPublished: Dec 1, 2020Ever since Kaylan Tanner, 21, was in high school, she's been looking for ways to get involved. At the time, her community in LA was seeing a surge of gang violence, and she knew things didn't have to be this way. \"I wanted to make a change,\" she told Seventeen. \"I wanted to do something different. I wanted to know how I could help my community.\" From there, Kaylan started to do research on advocacy and activism, and while it was community violence that introduced her to the world of change-making, Kaylan eventually found her passion in fighting for reproductive justice. Throughout her journey, Kaylan worked with In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda, she spoke at the My Life, My Decision Supreme Court Rally in March 2020, and, as she attends Dillard University in New Orleans, she has been advocating for reproductive freedom in Louisiana. But Kaylan's work is far from over, and one day, she plans to make it to the Oval Office. \"I am doing everything possible so I can get into that White House,\" she said. Why are reproductive rights so important to you? It's so important to me because I'm a woman and I'm Black and I find it so crazy and odd and disappointing that people want to control what we do with our bodies. I just never really wrapped my head around why. When I was coming down [to Louisiana] from LA, I was becoming a woman, I was 17 years old, and I had reproductive issues that I had to deal with by myself. I first handedly experienced those injustices of people not taking my pain seriously, people saying, \"Oh it's OK,\" and then misdiagnosing me with something else and giving me the wrong medication. From then on, I knew I didn't want anybody else to feel how I felt. I didn't want anybody else to feel misinformed. So, I educated myself. I reached out to people and from there, I became this advocate, this educator. I want to make sure no one else has to go through the negative experiences that I had to go through when I was just seeking help as a 17-year-old woman.  courtney chavezWhat has been your biggest victory? My biggest victory thus far would have to be participating at the My Life, My Decision Supreme Court rally. I was invited with Advocates for Youth, which has also helped me become this amazing advocate. Being able to, not only tell my story, but also use my platform to uplift the lived experiences of others was super important for me. I'm not just speaking on behalf of myself, though, I'm speaking on behalf of the young women of color or the young people of color in Louisiana. I'm letting them know that our voices will be heard.   What do you think about the recent appointment of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court? Getting that news was extremely disappointing, but I pretty much braced myself for it. Still, I don't want anyone to feel discouraged. I don't want anyone to feel like their voice is silent or their vote does not matter because this person got confirmed. This movement is only going to get stronger. Because, at the end of the day, people have been trying to take women's rights away for so long and that's why we're still fighting in 2020. I never thought that it was going to be over. Just how Black people are fighting every single day. I never thought that was going to be over in 2020 or even 2021. We're going to get more people on board and they're going to have to listen to us because at the end of the day, the politicians are here to represent us. These law and policies are here to represent us. So therefore they have to listen to us.  What is a major goal of yours when it comes to your activism? I like to help and educate people. I know that I want to be the President of the United States. That is my number one career goal in life. I am doing everything possible so I can get into that White House. It doesn't matter what position I have, I know that I'm going to get into the White House. I'm going to make an impact. And my goal is to not only become successful, but make sure that I am bringing other people with me so they have a seat at the table. It can't just be me. I can't do all of the work by myself. So, my goal is to uplift others' experiences and educate others and motivate them to succeed with me. View full post on InstagramWhat is next for you career wise?I know I want to go to law school so I've been studying for the LSAT. I want to be in DC. I've already been looking at a lot of apartments. Of course, if there are other opportunities, I'm open, I'll take them, but I know that this is the work that I love doing, this is my passion. I can't see myself sitting at a desk for eight hours a day. I need to be out in the community. I need to be talking to community members and asking, \"What do you need?\" Because, yes, I want to make the policy, but I can't make policies on your behalf if I don't know what you need in this community. Because it's not one size fits all. So, I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that I will still be working in the reproductive justice space because this is what I love to do.Answers have been edited and shortened for clarity.Carolyn TwerskyAssociate EditorCarolyn Twersky is an associate editor for Seventeen covering celebrities, entertainment, politics, trends, and health.
