We strongly condemn all vandalism against pro-life views,\u201d said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America.\nSan Luis Obispo, CA (2-27-2020)\u2013Reacting to the news that hundreds of fliers advertising her speech were torn down ahead of a speaking tour stop at Cal Poly, Kristan Hawkins stated, \u201cVandalism is a serious problem on college campuses with pro-life viewpoints regularly being targeted for supression by vandals. All of my speaking tour stops are free and open to the public, and I always take questions as part of the presentation. Instead of committing acts of violence against Students for Life, these vandals should come to my speech, ask questions, and engage with me.\u201d\nHawkins is speaking at Cal-Poly tonight as part of her national speaking tour, \u201cMake Abortion Illegal Again: Helping Women and Families After Roe.\u201d\u00a0 You can read more about her speaking tour here.\nOver 300 fliers have been hung in residence halls, the student union, and academic buildings since January 22nd. According to Cal-Poly Students for Life, more than half have been torn down.\nKelsea Forward, the vice-president of Cal-Poly Students for Life remarked, \u201cIf people disagree with us, they should come to the event and ask a question during the Q&A session. If they\u2019re only trying to silence us, it proves they don\u2019t have a good argument.\u201d\nThe vandalism has been reported to the Bias Incident Response team on campus.\nYou can view a national map of vandalism against pro-life groups that Students for Life of America has been tracking \u00a0here. Kristan Hawkins has written about the threats to free-speech pro-life students face for the Wall Street Journal.
