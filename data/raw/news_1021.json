Wade constitutional precedent for abortion access, cleared the way for Tennessee to ban abortions after six weeks under a fetal cardiac activity law. The broader trigger law will supersede the six-week ban.\u00a0\u201cAs required by state law, I am notifying the Tennessee Code Commission that\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0have been overturned by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Dobbs, returning abortion regulation to the states,\u201d Attorney General Herbert Slatery said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThirty days from today, on Aug.\u00a025, 2022, Tennessee\u2019s Human Life Protection Act will come into effect.\u201dThe six-week ban has already had a\u00a0significant chilling effect on abortion access across the state, with the majority of abortion providers pulling back on services in recent weeks. One clinic, Memphis CHOICES, said in a social media statement last week it has provided 170 abortions free of charge since the cardiac activity law took effect.\u00a0We answered:What questions do you have about abortion access in Tennessee following the reversal of Roe?These limited, early-gestation abortions will no longer be legal in Tennessee under the trigger law.The trigger law contains no exceptions for rape or incest, even for victims of child sexual abuse. Legislative Democrats, who oppose the law, earlier this month\u00a0said they plan to push for more exceptions.\u00a0Gov. Bill Lee last week declined to answer specific questions regarding potential exceptions for child sexual abuse victims, including whether he believes a child who becomes pregnant should be required to carry the pregnancy to term and give birth, as the law requires.\u201cOur focus right now is the implementation of the current law. And there hasn\u2019t been a discussion of any revisions to that law,\u201d Lee said.Tennessee trigger law gives doctors 'affirmative defense'\u00a0instead of exceptionsThe trigger law will criminalize providers of abortion care, and the law includes no technical exceptions that many other state abortion bans do.\u00a0Instead, the law provides an \"affirmative defense\" for providers who perform\u00a0abortions to save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent \"serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.\"The unusual carve out doesn't protect doctors from being criminally charged for any abortion, even one performed to save the life of the patient.\u00a0In most criminal cases, the burden is on government prosecutors to build a case against a suspect, charge them and\u00a0prove the suspect has committed the crime they've been accused of. Tennessee's abortion ban\u00a0reverses that legal burden.\u00a0The trigger law instead\u00a0offers providers a defense after an arrest has been made and charges filed.\u00a0The law could theoretically lead to criminal felony charges for any abortion performed, though actual implementation of the law could vary depending on the prosecutor.\u00a0Some medical providers worry this could have a \"chilling\" effect on their medical practice, as medical providers may choose to delay treatment for fear of legal liability, even in the absence of actual prosecution.\"As a practical matter, the way the abortion law is structured makes it much more difficult for the doctor to present a defense since the state does not have to prove the abortion was medically unnecessary,\" said David Raybin, a Nashville-based defense attorney.Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.Want to read more stories like this?
