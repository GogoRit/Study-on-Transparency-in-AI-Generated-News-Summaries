It led me through the traditional sequence of sacraments: Baptism, First Holy Communion and Confirmation.\u00a0\nWhen I decided to attend a Jesuit university, I expected my faith to follow me there, and it did. But as with many relationships, the way I view Catholicism evolved from when we first met.\u00a0\nNow, with one of the most important elections around the corner, I have become painfully aware of how the Church\u2019s stance on abortion could influence single-issue voters. This narrow-minded way of voting goes directly against my personal understanding and experience of the Catholic Church.\u00a0\nInstead of unpacking the complicated procedure itself and debating when life begins, I want to focus on Trump\u2019s stance on abortion. According to Trump\u2019s Twitter, he claims: \u201cPRO LIFE! VOTE!\u201d\nHe provides no context or reason for this tweet. Instead, he polarizes pro-life voters and pro-choice voters even more, amplifiying the singularity of abortion in his policial campaign.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t about being pro-life or pro-choice. This is about Catholics realizing that if we vote based on a single issue, we could elect a president who will do the exact opposite of what our faith stands for.\nBut this is Trump\u2019s strategy: to find a reason for single-issue voters to cast their ballots without examining him as a whole person. He targets religious voters, trying to capitalize on religious doctrines to gain supporters.\nWhat about me, a Catholic who believes in giving women the freedom to make a decision based on their own beliefs?\u00a0\u00a0\nIt might sound counterintuitive, but the Church itself shaped me into the pro-choice Catholic that I am today. I\u2019m no saint, but I\u2019ve learned to treat others with kindness, to listen to those less privileged than me and to respect those who think differently than me.\nI\u2019ve learned that men telling women how to deal with their bodies is the opposite of compassion, that judging how women live their lives is the opposite of empathy. So yes, I\u2019m a Catholic, but that label does not define who I am and what I stand for.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n Barrett\u2019s Gain is the LGBTQ+ Community's Loss\n\n\n\n It Cost Me $13,860 to Vote\n\n\n\n The 2020 Election Is America\u2019s Last Arranged Marriage\n\n\n\n\nWe are critical thinkers, fighters and equally split in terms of political opinion. In fact, politically active Catholics hold diverse views, with 47% identifying as Democrats and 48% identifying as Republicans according to Pew Research Center. This diversity is something to be celebrated, as I have had many civil yet informative conversations with Catholics who think differently than me, a true test of maturity and humility.\u00a0\nCatholics are much more complex than Trump implies, so why should a single issue determine such a vital vote? Shouldn\u2019t we, as Catholics, see that our current world is not one we want for our future children?\u00a0\nWe cannot vote pro-life until this world is better equipped to handle new lives. If Donald Trump gets reelected, it definitely won\u2019t be.\u00a0\nA defunded Planned Parenthood would leave 2.4 million Americans without health care. The LGBTQ+ community would continue to be discriminated against, losing basic human rights because of whom they choose to love. People of color would still suffer from the white supremacist in office who calls a civil rights movement \u201ctoxic propaganda.\u201d\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t about being pro-life or pro-choice. This is about Catholics realizing that if we vote based on a single issue, we could elect a president who will do the exact opposite of what our faith stands for.\nCatholicism is my lifelong companion, and it affects not only what I believe in, but also what I fight for. I want my vote to fight for children, both born and unborn. But I will fight to protect their mothers\u2019 rights, too. Financially insecure mothers. Sexually assaulted mothers. Black mothers. Lesbian mothers.\nNext time you see Trump tweet about being \u201cpro-life,\u201d ask yourself: Does he really care about kids, or does he just want to control their moms? Trump claims to have a Catholic fanbase, but as for me, I know a single issue will not determine who I want elected for our future generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay up-to-date with The Observer\u2019s weekly newsletter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next Barrett\u2019s Gain is the LGBTQ+ Community\u2019s LossIt Cost Me $13,860 to VoteThe 2020 Election Is America\u2019s Last Arranged Marriage2020 electionabortioncatholicismChristianitypoliticspro-lifereligionsingle-issue votingTrump \n\n\t\t\tLeave a Comment\t\t\nAbout the Contributors\n\nSOPHIA ORTEGA, Staff WriterSophia Ortega, Fordham College at Lincoln Center \u201922, is excited to be a staff writer for The Observer.
