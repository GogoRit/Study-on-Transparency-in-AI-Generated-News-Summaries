Hannah Kelly, R-Mountain Grove, grew quickly during debate. Lawmakers tacked on provisions that would bar taxpayer funds from going to abortion providers or their affiliates, create an offense for trafficking abortion-inducing drugs and allow family members to bring wrongful death lawsuits in the instance that a baby \u201cborn alive\u201d after an attempted abortion dies.\nThe bill requires a final vote in the House before it is sent to the Senate for consideration.\n\u201cThis bill is about standing up for life,\u201d said Rep. Sara Walsh, R-Ashland, whose legislation establishing the \u201cBorn-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act\u201d was added as an amendment to the bill.\nThe only anti-abortion provision offered Tuesday that didn\u2019t make it onto the final bill was a much-discussed proposal that aimed to limit women from seeking abortions outside Missouri. It would have made it illegal to perform or \u201caid or abet\u201d an abortion for a Missouri resident \u2014 regardless of where the procedure occurs. It would provide exceptions in instances where the abortion is needed due to a life-threatening condition.\n  Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, Chair of the House Children and Families Committee speaks during a hearing Oct. 5, 2021. (photo by of Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)\n\u201cThere\u2019s billboards that say, \u2018Come to Illinois for your abortion,\u2019\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd so\u2026 that kind of advertising would be illegal.\u201d\nBut before her amendment could be brought to a vote, state Rep. Brian Seitz, R-Branson, maneuvered to block her with a substitute amendment. His proposal, mirroring a bill he sponsored earlier this year, would make distributing abortion-inducing drugs that are used in violation of state or federal laws a class B felony, which can result in five to 15 years in prison.\nSeitz\u2019s amendment was adopted by a vote of 93 to 48. That prevented a vote on Coleman\u2019s proposal, suggesting the majority of lawmakers may not have an appetite for Coleman\u2019s amendment that critics had called \u201cshocking.\u201d\nLike Texas\u2019 recent law that banned abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, Coleman\u2019s proposal would be enforced through private litigation. Under the bill, lawsuits could be filed against those who violate its provisions, that range from providing transportation to get an abortion or even hosting a website Missourians can access that facilitates obtaining one. If successful, plaintiffs could be awarded $10,000, in addition to attorney fees.\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s vote, Seitz said he felt his amendment was \u201ca more perfect fit\u201d and noted that the language he offered had already been vetted through the committee process. Coleman\u2019s amendment has not been filed as a standalone bill.\n\u201cAny language that was in the bill that could have been confusing was taken out,\u201d Seitz said of his amendment, \u201cand I think that\u2019s what a good committee does.\u201d\nColeman could not immediately be reached for comment after Tuesday\u2019s vote.\nSeitz\u2019s bill had faced uproar over a provision that dealt with ectopic pregnancies, which are nonviable and occur when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus. The provision was among those removed during committee action last week.\nRep. Wes Rogers, D-Kansas City, argued the language would still make people criminally responsible if they tried to help a friend with an ectopic pregnancy obtain an abortion by ordering abortion-inducing drugs online. Seitz\u2019s bill would not allow the woman receiving the abortion to be prosecuted.\n\u201cThe primary purpose of this amendment is to protect the woman and to protect the baby,\u201d Seitz said.\nAn amendment added by Rep. Adam Schnelting, R-St. Charles, would also prohibit perpetrators of sexual assault or domestic violence from suing victims under the \u201cBorn-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.\u201d\nVersions of the bill have been proposed by Republican lawmakers for years, and Democratic lawmakers decried that the amendment was even needed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to disincentivize people to have abortions by threatening them with lawsuits by their own children,\u201d Rep. Keri Ingle, D-Lee\u2019s Summit, said.\nRepublican lawmakers have already successfully limited access to abortion in Missouri. With one remaining abortion clinic in the state, the number of abortions has steeply declined from the more than 6,000 abortions a decade ago.\nAccording to preliminary figures, last year 151 abortions occurred in Missouri, which includes those that occurred in hospitals, Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Senior Services said. In 2020, the number of abortions was only slightly higher at 167, while in 2019 there was 1,471.\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court overturns, even partially, the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that recognized a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, that number could drop close to zero when a provision of state law banning abortions except in medical emergencies would be permitted to go into effect.\nMeanwhile, more Missourians are traveling out-of-state to receive abortions than the number occurring within state lines.\nAccording to the Kansas state health department, 3,201 Missourians received abortions in the state in 2020 \u2014 a majority of the 3,641 out-of-state residents that year. To the east in Illinois, 6,578 Missourians received abortions in Illinois that same year, according to the state\u2019s health department.\nA recently-launched regional call center in Fairview Heights just past the Missouri-Illinois state line, has also helped Missourians access abortions.\n\u201cMy bills, I think you\u2019re seeing get so much attention, because they really would close that,\u201d Coleman previously said in an interview, \u201cand make sure that women are protected here in the state, and that their children are as well.\u201d\nEmily Wales, Planned Parenthood Great Plains\u2019 interim CEO and president, said Coleman\u2019s proposal is unconstitutional.\nIf Coleman\u2019s amendment is successful in becoming law, ultimately some patients will be unable to access care and for others it will mean trying to terminate their pregnancies without medical support, Wales said.\n\u201cThe idea that in a modern society where we protect civil liberties,\u201d Wales said, \u201cyou would be forced to take care of yourself with no medical support for what is a very safe and should be legal procedure is shocking.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXMissouri House blocks effort to limit access to out-of-state abortions\nby Tessa Weinberg, Missouri Independent March 29, 2022\nMissouri House blocks effort to limit access to out-of-state abortions\nby Tessa Weinberg, Missouri Independent March 29, 2022\n A bill that would make it a felony to donate fetal tissue from abortions for research or therapies won first-round approval in the Missouri House Tuesday, but lawmakers blocked an effort to make it illegal to help a women obtain an abortion outside the state.\nThe bill sponsored by Rep.
