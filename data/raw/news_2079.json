Kennedy Profile in Courage Award this year.A special International Profile in Courage Award will honor South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for working to improve relations between their countries despite domestic opposition.During the filibuster the senators - Republicans Katrina Shealy, Sandy Senn, and Penry Gustafson, Democrat Margie Bright Matthews, and independent Mia McLeod \u2014 took turns \u201cdescribing the complexities of pregnancy and the reproductive system, the dangers of lack of access to contraception, and inadequate privacy laws,\u201d award officials said in written release.Officials noted that members of the coalition, who became known as the \u201csister senators,\u201d were heckled by anti-abortion activists and the three Republicans were also met with strong opposition from their own party \u2013 including censures and promises of primary challenges in 2024. \n\nDespite the filibuster, the South Carolina Legislature was later able to approve the measure that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before most people know they are pregnant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe in the South Carolina Legislature are not God. We do not know what\u2019s going on in somebody else\u2019s life. We do not have the right to make decisions for someone else,\u201d Shealy said at the time, urging other members of her party to adopt a 12-week abortion ban instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy said the goal of the Profile in Courage awards is to honor leaders who took stands of conscience and risked their careers by putting the public interest ahead of their own political standing.\u201cThe women of the South Carolina Senate set an example for those seeking justice and individual freedom at all levels of government,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cPresident Yoon and PM Kishida are doing the hard work of reconciliation in pursuit of a more peaceful world.\u201d\n\nKennedy and her children Jack Schlossberg and Tatiana Schlossberg, members of the Profile in Courage Award Committee, will present the awards on Oct. 29 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.President Kennedy\u2019s book, \u201cProfiles in Courage,\u201d recounts the stories of eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled stands for unpopular positions. The award was created by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation in 1989.Previous winners have included Presidents Barack Obama, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. Last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among five people named as recipients of the award for his efforts to protect democracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
