SFLA is proud to introduce the Christian Schools Standing with You Scholarship Competition where we pick three\u00a0Christian schools that are doing outstanding work for women on campus. \u00a0\nBenedictine College SFLA group\nIt\u2019s time to highlight the amazing pro-life efforts of students who attend Christian colleges and universities across America who are setting the standard for great Christian schools. These groups have a passion for helping pregnant and parenting students on their Christian campus, and SFLA wants to award them for their efforts\u2014with your help! By evaluating each school\u2019s friendliness and support for parenting students on campus, we have narrowed it down to our top ten school groups, and now it\u2019s up to you to help us choose the winner.\u00a0\nCheck out one of our schools that made it to the top ten below: Benedictine College in Kansas \u00a0\nBenedictine College is one of ten student groups competing to be in the top three of all Christian Schools that will earn a scholarship for pregnant and parenting students on campus and an award for their group activities for the upcoming year.\u00a0\nBenedictine College, a Catholic institution, was rated an A+ grade for not promoting Planned Parenthood to their students AND promoting life-affirming options to their pregnant and parenting students. The mission statement of their SFLA group, Ravens Respect Life, is to defend human life from conception until natural death in and beyond Benedictine College. The group\u2019s goal is to equip and educate students to save lives which are threatened by abortion, euthanasia, and the destruction of human embryos for research.\u00a0\nBenedictine College students tabling\nHere are some accomplishments of the Benedictine College group: \u00a0\nSidewalk advocacy trips multiple times per month, which include prayer and counseling. The most recent special advocacy trip was to the Overland Park Planned Parenthood for the Feast of St. Joseph, and 38 students participated.\u00a0Annual participation in 40 Days For Life; Spring Break deployment with Susan B. Anthony List in Philadelphia; and participation in the National Pro-Life March in Washington, D.C., with six buses full of students. \u00a0Financial aid is made available to pregnant and parenting students. Other resources, such as diapers, formula, and blankets, are stored in the group\u2019s pregnant and parenting resource storage unit and given to mothers in need. \u00a0The group has also done diaper drives outside the local Walmart and provides\u00a0pregnant and parenting students with brochures that have a detailed list of local pregnancy resources. \u00a0They are also working with local legislators to\u00a0pass the Value Them Both Amendment, which protects basic restrictions on abortion.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBenedictine College students marching for life \nYou can vote for this school to receive a $1,500 scholarship for a pregnant or parenting student on their campus and up to $500 to help their group activities for the upcoming year.
