Subscribe here.\nFrom all indications, the Supreme Court seems poised to overturn the almost-50-year precedent enshrining legal abortion as a constitutional right. As expected, this does not sit well with those who support Roe v. Wade (which is much of the country, according to most polls).\nSome are suggesting this is a manifestation of a kind of soft theocracy\u2014that those of us who are pro-life are now imposing our religious views on the rest of the country. For others, the charge is not that pro-life Americans are too consumed with abortion, but that abortion is just a stalking-horse for the real issues, which are white supremacy and Christian nationalism.\nThe first argument is one that goes back almost to the days of Roe itself: the idea is that most people who oppose abortion do so because of a religious commitment. Sure, there might be an atheist pro-lifer here or there, the argument goes, but most people at the March for Life or working at the crisis pregnancy center near you are Roman Catholics, evangelical Protestants, or, sometimes, Orthodox Jews.\nAccording to this reasoning, to oppose legal abortion is to impose a certain religious viewpoint upon other people, and thus violate the religious freedom of those who don\u2019t believe the fetus to be a human person.\nThat would be true, of course, if what anyone sought to do was to impose a religious dogma. That\u2019s why I oppose, for instance, public school teachers offering a gospel invitation at the close of a class period or municipal governments declaring that the Trinity is the truth. A religion cannot and should not be coerced.\n\nI believe in religious freedom for everybody\u2014Jews, Muslims, Wiccans, atheists, my fellow evangelical Christians, etc.\u2014because I believe in the founding principles of this country. But I also believe in it because I believe, on the basis of biblical revelation, that the gospel must be received by faith, not by force.\nI care about not coercing people to accept my religious doctrines, not only because I think that\u2019s demonstrably bad for society, but because I think it confuses the gospel and hurts the church. But that doesn\u2019t mean religious motivations shouldn\u2019t inform what Christians, or others, care about.\nThere are all sorts of issues one could be concerned with today. The question is always why someone is motivated to pay attention to some of them. In my community, working with Afghan refugees, helping them to resettle, find work, and provide for their families, is carried out by people with multiple different motives for doing so.Article continues below\n\nFree NewslettersGet the best from CT editors, delivered straight to your inbox!\n\n\n\n More Newsletters\nOne person might be, like me, an evangelical Christian who believes that because my storyline in Christ includes being on the run from Pharaoh and Herod, that I ought to care about people in a similar place of vulnerability. Someone else might care about these refugees because she was a refugee from Cuba a generation ago and feels a kinship with those hurting in that way.\nOne person might be an Afghanistan War veteran who saw the humanity of the Afghans suffering under Taliban rule and so wants to help them. Someone else might find President Joe Biden politically offensive and is motivated by his blaming the administration for the suffering after pulling out from the country.\nEach of us is serving refugees for very different motivations\u2014ones we often do not share with each other. That tells you why each of us is spurred to action, but it doesn\u2019t tell you whether the action is right or wrong.\nIn some places, laws are being written to criminally charge homeless people for sleeping in public parks. The person who opposes this because he realizes that he can\u2019t mistreat homeless people when Jesus himself was homeless\u2014is he imposing his religion on everyone else? No. He\u2019s telling you why he\u2019s motivated to care about certain human beings.\nHis religion dictates his responsibilities to the homeless neighbor in front of him\u2014and the notion that they are human beings is not a specifically religious teaching. The fact that the Qur\u2019an tells Muslims to care for the poor doesn\u2019t make homeless shelters the outworking of Sharia Law. The fact that the Bible tells Christians to care for \u201cwidows and orphans in their distress\u201d (James 1:27) doesn\u2019t make foster-care safety nets a sign of theocracy.\nThe second charge often leveled\u2014that the pro-life issue is really about white supremacy\u2014is plausible to many people right now. That is because we have seen awful realities revealed in the church and the world over the past several years, which I\u2019ve written about repeatedly.\nChristian nationalism is real. It is a threat to the witness of the church, and it\u2019s a repudiation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And, yes, we\u2019ve seen the pro-life issue sometimes used by people whose viewpoints\u2014about women, refugees, the disabled, and other vulnerable people\u2014do not in any way reflect a holistic pro-life vision with any integrity or consistency.Article continues below\n\nIn his bookBad Faith: Race and the Rise of the Religious Right, historian Randall Balmer argues against the idea that Roe v. Wade mobilized evangelicals into political action, saying that this a myth. Balmer contends that the motivating factor was, in fact, religious conservatives\u2019 backlash against Carter administration initiatives to remove tax exemptions from racist all-white \u201csegregation academies\u201d run by church groups.\nBalmer is hardly the only one to make this case.\nAlmost 30 years ago, historian Godfrey Hodgson quoted pastor Ed Dobson, a key lieutenant of Jerry Falwell Sr., as saying: \u201cThe Religious New Right did not start because of a concern about abortion. I sat in the non-smoke-filled back room with the Moral Majority, and I frankly do not remember abortion ever being mentioned as a reason why we ought to do something.\u201d\nOver the past several years, a lot has been revealed. We have seen many moral causes championed by Christian leaders who later didn\u2019t seem to care about those things, but only wanted the power those issues could bring with them. It can be disorienting.\n\nMaybe you watched a pastor preach about evangelism and now you find he was really just trying to amass numbers for his own personal empire. But does that cynical use of the Great Commission mean the Great Commission is a lie?\nUsing the call to evangelism was cunning precisely because that pastor was exploiting something true for false ends. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone who has witnessed door to door or mustered the courage to talk about faith with their neighbors is motivated by ego and power.\nEven with the most cynical view possible, the question is not whether some leaders used abortion when their real objectives were contradictory, immoral things instead. The question is, if that\u2019s the case, why emphasize abortion? Why not simply mobilize people to protect segregation? One can only mobilize people with something they actually care about.\nWhen one looks past the power brokers and politicians, one can see countless small pro-life ministries around the country, where people genuinely believe in caring for the suffering of their neighbor\u2014for the unborn child in danger of dying, the pregnant woman in peril of facing violence or poverty, or the born child in need of food or a home.\nAre there those who use abortion as simply a cudgel to say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote for otherwise reprehensible candidates or policies, you are guilty of murder?\u201d Yes. And are there pro-choice employers who pressure women to abort because they refuse to provide the support and benefits for women with small children? Sure. Does either case nullify the central question? Are there people who support democracy because it\u2019s the way they can get votes to hold office? Yes. Does that mean that\u2019s all democracy is? No.Article continues below\n\nDo not let your allies determine who your neighbor is.\nOnce, while putting together an event on human dignity from womb to tomb, someone told me that he would participate, but only if I promised not to mention race, refugees, or migrant children. He said it was because he thought \u201cpro-life\u201d applied only to abortion.\nI asked if we could also talk about adoption and foster care. He said yes. I asked if we could talk about the wrongness of euthanasia. He said yes. About the sexual exploitation of women and girls? Yes. About genetic engineering and other bioethical questions? Yes. I realized he didn\u2019t want anything mentioned about race or migrants or refugees because that would get him in trouble with his political allies.\nI was urged to make some people invisible because an acknowledgement of their presence would be inconvenient to someone with power. But to me, that sounded exactly like the abortion culture, and I refused to avoid talking about those \u201cinconvenient\u201d people.\nI\u2019ve seen it work the other direction too. People will work diligently on matters of migrants, refugees, the trafficked, or the poor but who will blanche at the mention of the unborn\u2014not because they don\u2019t believe the unborn are persons deserving of protection, but because it would put them in a camp with people they don\u2019t like or respect.\nWhichever way that goes, Jesus told us that defining our neighbors according to the expectations of our tribal allies can lead to nowhere good. That\u2019s why Jesus chose a Samaritan as the neighbor in his parable about the man by the Jericho Road. It\u2019s also why Jesus did not care that his fellow Jews thought he shouldn\u2019t talk to Zacchaeus because he was a tax collector who collaborated with Rome (Luke 19:1\u201310). Jesus cared about Zacchaeus, not about his tribal standing.\nAnd neither should we.\nIf the unborn are made in the image of God, and I believe they are, let\u2019s care for them. If women are in the image of God, and I believe they are, let\u2019s care for them. If white supremacy and Christian nationalism are of the Devil\u2014and I believe they are\u2014let\u2019s oppose them.Article continues below\n\nLet\u2019s be pro-life even if that makes some of our \u201cpro-justice\u201d allies uncomfortable and let\u2019s be pro-justice even if that makes some of our \u201cpro-life\u201d allies uncomfortable. And whenever our group tells us that the price of admission is to make some other category of person invisible to us, then let\u2019s tell them that price is too high.\nRussell Moore leads the Public Theology Project at Christianity Today.\n[ This article is also available in \r\n\t\t\tespa\u00f1ol\u00a0and \r\n\t\t\tFran\u00e7ais. \t]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramTags:Abortion | Children | Evangelicalism | Politics | Pro-Choice Movement | Pro-Life Movement | Russell Moore\n\nPosted:\u00a0May 5, 2022\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMore From:\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRussell Moore\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMarch 2024\n\nSubscribeEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\nRead This Issue\n\n\n\n\nFollow @ctmagazine\n\n\nAnnual & Monthly subscriptions available. \n\nPrint & Digital Issues of CT magazine\nComplete access to every article on ChristianityToday.com\nUnlimited access to 65+ years of CT\u2019s online archives\nMember-only special issues\nLearn more\n\n\nSubscribeAlready a subscriber?
