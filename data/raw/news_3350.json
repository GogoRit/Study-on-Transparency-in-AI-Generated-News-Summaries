Wade \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\nThe Society of Jesus in the United States welcomes the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overrule Roe v. Wade. Abortion is a massive injustice in our society, and today\u2019s ruling is a critical step toward the legal protection of all unborn children. As we wrote in our 2018 pro-life statement Protecting the Least Among Us, \u201cThe most fundamental building block of a just social order is respect for human life. Until men and women individually and collectively make a profound commitment to the value and dignity of all human life, we will never find the true peace, justice and reconciliation God desires for us.\u201d\nWe also affirm our belief that building what Saint John Paul II called a \u201cculture of life\u201d requires a stronger social safety net than our country has today. To be truly pro-life, we must support all women, expectant parents and their children by advocating for policies like universal health care, paid parental leave and a more equitable distribution of our country\u2019s abundant resources.\nWe approach this topic as pastors, scholars, social activists and educators. No part of our ministry is removed from the essential work of promoting and protecting the dignity of every child of God. We pray that the Lord might continue to inspire our efforts and to help us always see the face of Christ revealed in each person, both before their birth and after it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us \n\n\n\n\nThe Jesuits\nHistory\nOur Mission\nWho We Are\nIgnatius of Loyola\nGlobal Community\nProtecting Children\nJesuit Conference Staff\nJesuits Worldwide\nJob Announcements\nContact Us\nFAQs\nGlossary\n \n\nThe Jesuits\nHistory\nOur Mission\nWho We Are\nIgnatius of Loyola\nGlobal Community\nProtecting Children\nJesuit Conference Staff\nJesuits Worldwide\nJob Announcements\nContact Us\nFAQs\nGlossary\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nLinkedin\n \n\n\n\nVimeo\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nSoundcloud\n \n\n\n\nSpotify\n \n\n\n\nPodcast\n \n\n\n\nFlickr\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Work \n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\nJustice and Ecology\nEducation\nParishes\nRetreat Centers\nInterreligious Dialogue\nPartnerships\nSlavery, History, Memory and Reconciliation\nJesuit Missions, Inc.\n \n\nWhat We Do\nJustice and Ecology\nEducation\nParishes\nRetreat Centers\nInterreligious Dialogue\nPartnerships\nSlavery, History, Memory and Reconciliation\nJesuit Missions, Inc.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpirituality \n\n\n\nBecome a Jesuit \n\n\n\nResources \n\n\n\nSupport Us \n\n\n\n\nSupport Our Work\n \n\nSupport Our Work\n \n\n\n\n\nJesuits Only \n\n\n\nConversations that Matter \n\n\n\nProtecting the Least Among Us: A Statement of the Society of Jesus on Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJesuit Conference of Canada and the U.S. \n\n\n\n\nJesuit Conference\nCanada Province (en fran\u00e7ais)\nCanada Province (in English)\nCentral and Southern Province\nEast Province\nMidwest Province\nWest Province\n \n\nJesuit Conference\nCanada Province (en fran\u00e7ais)\nCanada Province (in English)\nCentral and Southern Province\nEast Province\nMidwest Province\nWest Province\n \n\n\n\n\nWorldwide \n\n\n\n\nJesuits of Africa and Madagascar\nJesuits of South Asia\nJesuits of Asia Pacific\nJesuits of the Caribbean and Latin America\nJesuits of Europe\nHeadquarters in Rome\n \n\nJesuits of Africa and Madagascar\nJesuits of South Asia\nJesuits of Asia Pacific\nJesuits of the Caribbean and Latin America\nJesuits of Europe\nHeadquarters in Rome\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 Jesuits.
