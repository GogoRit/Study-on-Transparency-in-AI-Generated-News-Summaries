It\u2019s ridiculous. And it is theocratic. It\u2019s authoritarian. It is wrong.\u201d She\u2019s not the first abortion-choice advocate to bring up religion when arguing against abortion.\nWhen I debated a feminist and women\u2019s studies professor about abortion, my interlocutor also brought up my religious beliefs, even though I never made a single faith-based argument. It\u2019s common for abortion-choice advocates to address religious arguments when arguing against the pro-life view, even though many pro-lifers don\u2019t use their faith to justify their position.\nPro-lifers often argue against abortion from science and reason. For example, I began my debate by claiming abortion should be illegal for the same reason that it\u2019s illegal to kill a fourteen-year-old, a four-year-old, or a four-month-old: It\u2019s wrong to kill innocent human beings. If the unborn is a human being just like born children, then it\u2019s equally wrong to kill the unborn. Then, I demonstrated the unborn is a human being like you and me from the scientific evidence.\nNotice that when I make my case, I don\u2019t cite the Bible. I don\u2019t invoke God. I\u2019m not making a religious argument. My case against abortion brings in legal, moral, scientific, and philosophical reasoning. Abortion-choice advocates, however, bring up religion for a reason: It\u2019s an effective tactic. Whether they realize it or not, it\u2019s a clever way to gain the upper hand for two reasons.\nFirst, by making the pro-life position merely a religious matter, they commit a straw man fallacy. This mistake in logic occurs when you misrepresent (either intentionally or unintentionally) a person\u2019s view in a way that makes it look more foolish and/or easier to refute. Then, instead of responding to the person\u2019s actual view, you respond to a view they don\u2019t hold\u2014the one that is simpler to knock down.\nAbortion-choice advocates bring up religion when talking about the pro-life view, thereby misrepresenting the view and committing a straw man fallacy (assuming the pro-lifer didn\u2019t substantiate their position with their faith). Remember, the pro-life position doesn\u2019t need God or the Bible to be valid. Here is the moral logic of the view:\nPremise 1: It\u2019s wrong to kill innocent human beings.\nPremise 2: Abortion kills an innocent human being.\nConclusion: Therefore, abortion is wrong.\nNotice, nowhere in the above syllogism is there any mention of God or the Bible. Furthermore, you can defend each premise without any reference to religion. The average person will readily accept premise 1. After all, even non-Christians think it\u2019s wrong to kill innocent human beings. Premise 2 can be defended using the science of embryology. Therefore, if premise 1 and premise 2 are true, then the conclusion logically follows by necessity: Abortion is wrong.\nSince the moral logic of the pro-life view is not necessarily religious, abortion-choice advocates attack a straw man when they \u201crefute\u201d a religious-based position. If they want to address our actual view, they need to engage the science of embryology. My suspicion, though, is that they prefer to engage the view of \u201cfundamentalist Christians\u201d for another reason.\nSecond, by making the pro-life position a religious matter, it\u2019s easier to relativize and dismiss the view. Abortion-choice advocates are typically relativists. When it comes to morality or religious belief, they take an \u201ceach person decides for themselves\u201d approach. Your moral rules and your religious beliefs are for you alone. No one religion\u2014or its ethical views\u2014supersedes the others. Consequently, you can\u2019t impose your religion\u2019s moral rules on people outside your faith.\nTherefore, if you can hitch a person\u2019s pro-life views to their religion, then it makes it easier to dismiss that view as simply a theological idiosyncrasy. After all, if you can\u2019t impose your religious beliefs on others, then you definitely can\u2019t impose your religion\u2019s moral rules on others either. That\u2019s why abortion-choice advocates love to bring up religious belief when talking about the pro-life view. It makes it a lot easier to dismiss pro-lifers as trying to impose private religious convictions on society at large.\nIf your pro-life position is grounded in science and reason, but your dialogue partner insists on responding to a religious justification, you need to kindly remind them of your view and ask that they engage it instead of a view you don\u2019t hold. That will help you both have a more productive conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWANT TO BE A STRONGER AMBASSADOR FOR CHRIST?\n\t\t  Let us equip you through our signature publications, videos, articles, and other mentoring tools.
