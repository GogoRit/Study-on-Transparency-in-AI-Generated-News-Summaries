Representative image CHANDIGARH: In a step towards initiation of the process for change in the law pertaining to medical termination of pregnancy in cases of abnormalities of fetus endangering women\u2019s lives, the Punjab and Haryana high court has sought the assistance of Centre and state governments regarding vires of the related statute.\"Needless to say that so far the science and technology has not been so advanced as to prevent the development of any complication/ disease or deformity in the fetus after 20 weeks.In such a situation, if a disease, deformity or complication develops after 20 weeks, then if this provision remains on the statute book, the wouldbe mother/woman is bound to lose her life, along with the life of the fetus/stillborn child, unless she happens to be already on operation table of the medical practitioner to take advantage of relaxation provided by section 5 of the Act,\" the HC has observed.The HC said that before this court enters into consideration of the vires of the Act, it would be appropriate to seek assistance from the Union of India, states of Punjab and Haryana and Union Territory Chandigarh in that regard. The matter has now been adjourned for August 10, with the Centre, both states and UT Chandigarh being asked to submit their responses on the issue.\u2018Thousands not able to avail legal remedy\u2019Justice Rajbir Sehrawat of the HC said it was due to care for human life that the court had been passing orders for termination of pregnancy after a period of 20 weeks in disregard of the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act.\"As a result, some educated and well-off couples might have been successful in saving the life of the would-be mothers/women. However, there would be thousands of couples who are either not able to avail the legal assistance and legal remedies by approaching this court in time or who might be living in abject poverty and therefore, are not able to avail the legal remedy at all,\" observed the judge.About the AuthorAjay SuraAjay Sura is Senior Assistant Editor with The Times of India Chandigarh.
