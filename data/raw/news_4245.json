Pigs and cows endure continuous artificial insemination, and once their reproductive systems wear out, they\u2019re sent to slaughter\u2014as are the hens who live packed on top of each other on filthy egg farms.\nFor more information, visit PETA.org.\nPETA\u2019s letter to the Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Development follows.\nNidhi Goyal\nPresident\nAssociation for Women\u2019s Rights in Development\nDear Ms. Goyal,\nGreetings from PETA and our 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide. We appreciate your efforts to empower women and challenge inequality. May we appeal to you to adopt a policy to serve only vegan meals at your events? I will respectfully make the case below that this fits with your mission very well. The issue involves sexual exploitation, sisterhood, environmental concerns, and more.\nA growing number of human rights and environmental rights groups\u2014including the Center for Biological Diversity, the Food Empowerment Project, Sea Shepherd, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the National Lawyers Guild\u2014have pledged to serve only vegan meals during their events. The Golden Globe Awards, the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards have all opted to serve only vegan food. I\u2019m sure you know that continuing to eat animals and their \u201cproducts\u201d has a terrible environmental impact, in addition to being indefensibly cruel. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock production for meat, eggs, and milk is the leading cause of ocean dead zones, water pollution, species extinction, and habitat destruction\u2014problems that affect us all.\nAs Gloria Steinem has said, \u201cImagine we are linked, not ranked.\u201d She also wrote, \u201cThe first problem for all of us, men and women, is not to learn, but to unlearn.\u201d All supremacy is learned, and it is up to all of us to unlearn oppressive behavior and ideologies, including speciesism.\nWhen one thinks about it honestly, every female\u2014whether she has fur, fins, feathers, or hair\u2014feels pain and fear and deserves to live her life free from suffering. Sexual exploitation is rampant in the meat, egg, and dairy industries. Farmed animals\u2014especially females\u2014are subjugated, oppressed, and abused, and their reproductive systems are regulated and controlled. Female cows, pigs, and turkeys are routinely and repeatedly raped\u2014there is no other word for it\u2014throughout their brief, miserable lives, and their babies are taken from them, sometimes immediately after birth, to be exploited and eventually killed. We hope you\u2019ll agree that violence against females is always wrong, regardless of species.\nWe\u2019d be happy to help your staff plan delicious and healthy vegan meals for your events and to offer assistance\u00a0in any other way. I look forward to hearing back from you.\nWith best wishes to you in your important work,\nIngrid E.
