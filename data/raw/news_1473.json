Florida had until that point prohibited abortions after 15 weeks.\u2018It\u2019s a scary time\u2019: Florida Democrat vows to keep fighting six-week abortion banRead moreA six-week ban gives DeSantis a key political victory among Republican primary voters as he prepares to launch a presidential candidacy built on his national brand as a conservative standard bearer.The policy would also have wider implications for abortion access throughout the south in the wake of the US supreme court\u2019s decision last year overturning Roe v Wade and leaving decisions about abortion access to states. Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, while Georgia forbids the procedure after cardiac activity can be detected, which is around six weeks.\u201cWe have the opportunity to lead the national debate about the importance of protecting life and giving every child the opportunity to be born and find his or her purpose,\u201d said the Republican representative Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who carried the bill in the house.Florida\u2019s six-week ban will take effect only if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state supreme court, which is controlled by conservatives.Democrats and abortion-rights groups have criticized Florida\u2019s proposal as extreme because many women do not yet realize they are pregnant until after six weeks.The bill contains some exceptions, including to save the woman\u2019s life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation such as a restraining order or police report. DeSantis has called the rape and incest provisions sensible.Drugs used in medication-induced abortions \u2013 which make up the majority of those provided nationally \u2013 could be dispensed only in person or by a physician under the Florida bill. Separately, nationwide access to the abortion pill mifepristone is being challenged in court.US justice department to appeal to supreme court over abortion pill accessRead more\u201cI can\u2019t think of any bill that\u2019s going to provide more protections to more people who are more vulnerable than this piece of legislation,\u201d said the Republican representative Mike Beltran, who said the bill\u2019s exceptions and six-week timeframe represented a compromise.Abortion bans are popular among some religious conservatives who are part of the GOP voting base, but the issue has motivated many others to vote for Democrats. Republicans in recent weeks and months have suffered defeats in elections centered on abortion access in states such as Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin.\u201cHave we learned nothing?\u201d the house Democratic minority leader, Fentrice Driskell, said of recent elections in other states. \u201cDo we not listen to our constituents and to the people of Florida and what they are asking for?\u201dDeSantis, who often places himself on the front lines of culture war issues, has said he backs the six-week ban but has appeared uncharacteristically tepid on the bill. He has often said: \u201cWe welcome pro-life legislation,\u201d when asked about the policy.Explore more on these topicsAbortionFloridaRon DeSantisRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
