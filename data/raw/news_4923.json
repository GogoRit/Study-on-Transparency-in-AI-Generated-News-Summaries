Wade, according to Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta.\nGupta delivered remarks at the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division\u2019s 65th Anniversary earlier this month.\nThe associate attorney general described the overturn of Roe v. Wade as a \u201cdevastating blow to women throughout the country\u201d that took away \u201cthe constitutional right to abortion\u201d and increased \u201cthe urgency\u201d of the DOJ\u2019s work\u2014including the \u201cenforcement of the FACE Act, to ensure continued lawful access to reproductive services.\u201d\nShe did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Daily Signal.\u00a0\n\nGupta/DOJ\n\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division enforces the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which \u201cprohibits threats of force, obstruction and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive health care services.\u201d\nIt protects both pro-life pregnancy centers and abortion clinics, as a DOJ official noted to Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, last week.\nAt least 98 Catholic churches and 77 pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life organizations have been attacked since May, but the DOJ has apparently not charged a single person in connection with these attacks. Meanwhile, the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division has charged 26 pro-life individuals with FACE Act violations this year.\nThe DOJ has not responded to The Daily Signal\u2019s requests for comment on this point.\nTweet This: The DOJ has been targeting pro-life activists via the FACES Act due to the overturn of Roe v. Wade, according to Associate AG Vanita Gupta.\nPregnancy resource centers are typically run by pro-life women who seek to offer expectant mothers alternatives to abortion.\nSuch centers provide diapers, baby clothes, and resources for both mothers and fathers, empowering them to care for their child, overcome addictions, build community, and find jobs.\nEditor's note: This article was originally published by The Daily Signal, the Heritage Foundation's news platform. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nUS Department of Justice\nJustice Department\nDOJ\nFreedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act\nFACE Act\nRoe v Wade\nDobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\nVanita Gupta\nChip Roy\nproabortion vandalism\nproabortion violence\nproabortion attack\nweaponized government\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\n\n\nFederal court banishes Idaho satanists\u2019 abortion lawsuit\n\n\n\nCalifornia wants to deter women from seeking to save the lives of their babies\n\n\n\nDOJ advised DC medical examiner to dispose of aborted baby bodies, lawyer says\n\n\n\nDobbs as D-Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET OUR NEWS DIGEST \n\n\nGet Pregnancy Help News delivered to your inbox each Monday morning.\nEmail \nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal court banishes Idaho satanists\u2019 abortion lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDobbs as D-Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court to hear first abortion case since Dobbs on March 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\u2019s March for Life events from coast to coast: \u2018Proclaiming the gift of human dignity\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSCLogin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n                                Remember me                            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nNewsCommentaryVideoAbout\n\n\n\nGet Involved\nAdvertisement Information Contact Us Pitch a Story Write for Us!Partner with Us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Pregnancy Help News .
