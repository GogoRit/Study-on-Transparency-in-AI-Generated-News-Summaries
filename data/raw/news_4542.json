The law represents some progress in a country that currently threatens to imprison people who have abortions at any stage of their pregnancy but falls short of ensuring reproductive rights protected by international human rights law.\nIn February 2020, Thailand\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that the existing criminal code provision, which imprisons for up to three years people who have an abortion and five years for those who perform them, is unconstitutional. It gave the government 360 days to change the law, and with the unconstitutional provisions identified by the court set to be automatically repealed by February 12, 2021, time is running short. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe government\u2019s bill, sponsored by the cabinet and approved by the House of Representatives, is scheduled to be voted on in the Senate today. The House of Representatives rejected a stronger draft that would have permitted legal abortion up until 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe proposed law, if enacted, will continue to deny many pregnant people the right to make their own choices about whether to continue a pregnancy. And it would continue to impose punishments\u2014up to 6 months in jail and a fine of up to 10,000 baht (US$333) \u2014on those who seek an abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy if they cannot meet criteria set by the Medical Council of Thailand.\nWhen governments restrict abortion, women still have abortions \u2013 they just have more dangerous ones.\u00a0 United Nations figures from 2011 suggested that the unsafe abortion rate was more than four times greater in countries with restrictive abortion policies than in countries with liberal ones.\nThe Constitutional Court ruling in Thailand was important, and part of a global move toward greater respect for reproductive rights. South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court issued a similar ruling in April 2019, while Irish voters decided in a 2018 referendum to repeal the country\u2019s abortion ban. In December 2020, Argentina legalized abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy.\nThailand\u2019s parliament still has time to revise the draft law. Instead of putting women on trial for exercising their reproductive rights, the Thai government should fully decriminalize abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nThailand \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nSexual and Reproductive Health Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSouth Korea Partially Recognizes Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 26, 2018\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nIreland Votes Overwhelmingly to Repeal Abortion Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Case for Legal Abortion\n\n\nThe Human Cost of Barriers to  Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Argentina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSouth Korea Partially Recognizes Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 26, 2018\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nIreland Votes Overwhelmingly to Repeal Abortion Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
