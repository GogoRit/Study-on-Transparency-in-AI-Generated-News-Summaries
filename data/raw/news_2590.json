But the law and the Constitution are clear on the matter: Public schools cannot silence pro-life groups or force them to self-censor. If Chemeketa Community College wants to respect every member of its community, it will clarify that Students for Life can participate in the open exchange of ideas and ensure that the entire college community becomes a \u2018free speech zone\u2019 for pro-life students and their peers.\u201d\nThe lawsuit was filed in\u00a0the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0District Court for the District of Oregon, Eugene Division by an allied attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom.\nThe lawsuit stems from a February 26th\u00a0event on campus about the physician-assisted suicide.\u00a0Students for Life leaders Marcos Sanchez\u00a0and Emma Howell were able to host their event, but were forbidden from promoting the event outside. They were also not allowed to hand out flyers promoting free, pro-life resource centers.\n\u201cThe only permission slip students need in order to speak on public college campuses is the First Amendment,\u201d said\u00a0ADF\u00a0Legal Counsel Michael Ross. \u201cStudents don\u2019t give up their constitutionally protected freedoms when they step on to campus or hold a specific viewpoint. Our clients have the right to peacefully engage and persuade their peers. They also have the freedom to support pregnant and parenting students without censorship or harassment from their school.\u201d\nTo read more about the nine common violations of student free speech in a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0op-ed from Hawkins,\u00a0click here.\nFor interviews, please contact\u00a0Kristi\u00a0Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].\n\u201330\u2014\nStudents for Life of America is the nation\u2019s largest pro-life student organization with over 1,225 student groups on high school and college campuses across the country.\nThe\u00a0ADF\u00a0Center for Academic Freedom\u00a0is dedicated to ensuring freedom of speech and association for students and faculty so that everyone can freely participate in the marketplace of ideas without fear of government censorship.\n\n Post Views: 1,259\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
