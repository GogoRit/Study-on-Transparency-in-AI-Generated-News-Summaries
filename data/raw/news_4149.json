For some, those words stay there, laying flat, as a two-dimensional way to feign support for women at the core of the culture, economy, politics and history of Pittsburgh and the nation as a whole. For many others \u2014 mostly Black women and femmes \u2014 those words are a way of life.\nAs COVID-19 persists, Black women are on the frontlines and forefront, if not on the front pages of newspapers. The systemic racial and gender inequities of this country including in health care are magnified due to the pandemic. In keeping with the etymology of apocalypse, the veil is being lifted and what we see is injustice.\nWomen\u2019s Media Center, Essence Magazine and Lean In Foundation are some of the organizations that conducted research on the impact of COVID-19 on Black women, womyn and femmes in the United States. The Essence report released in May also shows the impact of Black women in America, who are disproportionately in high-risk, high-exposure jobs like store clerks and healthcare work: One in four knows someone who has died of the coronavirus, and 44% knows someone who has contracted the virus. Additionally, of the 1,048 respondents, 85% of Black women did not have the technology necessary to support educational needs of children in their care due to the move to online learning.\n \n \n\nEarly statements of \u201cwe\u2019re in this together\u201d and descriptions of COVID-19 as the \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d ring as hollow as \u201cMost Livable City.\u201d Pittsburgh is not a most livable city, as we see time and time again. After the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Gender Equity Commission released a report on race and gender inequities in September 2019, the swift and powerful response from the Black community focused on the erasure of Black women and femmes in the process. Although not initially intended to be a report on the \u201cstate of Black women\u201d in Pittsburgh, due to the huge disparities faced by Black women, the report\u2019s findings focused on Black women and how inhospitable the city is to our wellbeing on nearly every measure.\nSince the report was released last fall, there has been little done at the city, county or state level specifically addressing the issues of creating true equity for Black women and femmes in the Pittsburgh region.\n\u201cWe do this work from the heart because we live it \u2026 We laugh and cry about it.\u201d\nBoth the city council of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Council have passed a non-binding ordinance and motion, respectively, declaring racism a public health crisis over the past six months. The Office of Equity launched in 2019, which according to the City of Pittsburgh website, serves as the administrative liaison for the following City of Pittsburgh advisory groups, committees and commissions: Equal Opportunity Review Commission, Gender Equity Commission, LGBTQIA+ Advisory Council and the Welcoming Pittsburgh Steering Committee. The city recently announced plans to create an Office of Community Health and Safety.\nBut major inequities remain.\n\u201cThe Greater Pittsburgh Region does not care about the lives of Black women, femmes and girls,\u201d La\u2019Tasha Mayes, the founder, president and CEO of New Voices for Reproductive Justice, said via email. \u201cThe evidence is not the Gender Equity Report. The evidence is our lived experiences.\u201d\nMayes said that the \u201cfact remains that the institutions in this region of all stripes \u2014 be it government, health or policy entities do not have the answers for Black women, femmes and girls, our families and our communities. Yet, these institutions must dismantle white supremacy, anti-Black racism and gender oppressions that create the shameful outcomes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMOST READ PUBLICSOURCE STORIES\nPush to cut 10s of thousands from Allegheny County voter rolls feeds fearsMowgli the friendly cat prompts concerns over releases of strays\u2018Landfill tea\u2019 steeps fracking waste near suburban communitiesAllegheny County\u2019s smallest school district depends on big community spirit\n\n\n\nParticipants in the ongoing conversation about inequities, including in the media, should be aware of the push and pull that many Black women feel to not create additional trauma by reporting without context or excluding voices of the most impacted by the injustices of the Pittsburgh region.\nJada Shirriel, chief executive officer of Healthy Start, replied to questions over email, where she commented on the lack of input by Black women and femmes, although the report focused on Black women\u2019s health and infant and maternal mortality.\nJada Shirriel, chief executive officer of Healthy Start at her office in Pittsburgh. (Photo by Jay Manning/PublicSource)\n\u201cWe do this work from the heart because we live it \u2026 We laugh and cry about it,\u201d said Shirriel, whose organization focuses on community-based healthcare for newborns and mothers. \u201cWe are in a fight to save ourselves, our mothers, our aunts, our daughters, our sisters. Equity for Black women is equity for everyone.\u201d\nWhile the Pittsburgh region is a challenging place for Black women to live, it is home. Improving the quality of life here is a priority.\n\u201cWe need a narrative that presents facts but does not add to the undue burden and baggage Black women in this country already have to bear, \u201d Shirriel said.\nWith that in mind, I hope to highlight some solutions put forth by reports cited in a community letter from New Voices Pittsburgh.\nIn December 2018, a report called Advancing Holistic Maternal Care for Black Women Through Policy; also known as Black Mamas Matter highlighted issues of reproductive justice for African American women nationally. The report is national in scope, and it focuses on the interconnected aspects impacting the lives of women, while centering Black women and femmes.\nSome highlights of the report\u2019s recommendations:\n\u201cEnsure Black women are prioritized participants at every level of decision-making around maternal mortality and morbidity.\u201d\u201cInvest in the time and expertise of Black women-led organizations and community- based organizations that use reproductive justice, birth justice and human rights frameworks.\u201d\u201cInvest financial resources in Black women-led organizations and services.\u201d\u201cHold existing health care systems accountable for delivery of quality, comprehensive, patient-centered and trauma-informed care.\u201d\u201cRedefine the concept of health care teams and recognize them as multi-disciplinary\u2014 including doulas, midwives, lactation consultants, perinatal health workers and other paraprofessionals (or non-licensed professionals).\u201d\nAnother important report called Our Bodies, Our Lives, Our Voices: The State of Black Women in Reproductive Justice was finalized during the 2016 election and published in June 2017.\n\u201cBlack women voters had clearly solidified behind a candidate we felt carried a progressive agenda\u2026Today, we find ourselves in a new reality,\u201d Marcela E. Howell, president and CEO of D.C.-based In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda, wrote in the report\u2019s introduction. \u201cA man [Donald Trump] who ran one of the most bigoted campaigns since George Wallace is now in the White House. Worse yet, 53 percent of white women, a group we considered as allies, helped put him there\u2026Consequently, our collective new reality is one of RESISTANCE. But resistance is nothing new for Black women.\u201d\nReading these reports sheds light on the legacy I am carrying, the responsibilities I have moving forward\u2026\nHowell, in an email, explained that the purpose of this report was to \u201clift up the voices of Black women leaders at the national, regional and state levels in our ongoing fight to secure reproductive justice for all women, girls, femmes, gender non-conforming and trans individuals.\u201d\nNew Voices Pittsburgh was one of the report\u2019s eight strategic partners, and Pittsburgh was one of the 10 cities in a tour where the report\u2019s findings were presented to policymakers, community leaders and other stakeholders. The Pittsburgh stop took place on Jan. 26, 2018, at the William Pitt Union. Speakers included Mayes, along with State Reps. Ed Gainey, Jake Wheatley and Morgan Cephas.\nAccording to Howell, the report made waves for its perspective and focus. \u201cWe regularly have people tell us how nice it is to not have to parse out the data on Black women and girls from a broader document, but to have a report that is centered on our experience and the issues that impact our lives.\u201d\nBlack women have to write their own narrative and be at the center of research. Reproductive justice activists who focus on a \u201cwomb-centric\u201d view of the issue fail to see the complete picture as it affects Black women and femmes. The \u201cOur Bodies, Our Lives, Our Voices\u201d report includes how intersectional issues of environmental racism, economics, education and food security, among others, impact a Black woman\u2019s ability to live as she chooses. The report states that Black women \u201cincludes cis, femme, trans, binary and gender non-conforming individuals.\u201d\nAll 128 pages are worth reading, including the \u201cListening Sessions\u201d part, which includes the voices of women in Pittsburgh on pages 18-19. The report\u2019s stated recommendations include:\n\u201cEstablish a leadership voice for Black women on reproductive rights, health and justice policy at the national level.\u201d\u201cBuild a coordinated grassroots movement of Black women support of abortion rights and access all the issues encompassed by reproductive justice, including ending onerous funding restrictions, contraceptive equity; and comprehensive sex education\u201d\u201cLay the foundation for ongoing policy change at the national and state levels that impacts the lives and well-being of Black women and their families.\u201d\u201cEngage and motivate Black women as a traditionally underrepresented group to use their voting power in the American electorate.\u201d\nThe report goes on to suggest several reforms that could be made to improve the lives of Black women and femmes.\nIdeas for improvements include:\nEnacting affordable healthcare actions, including tax credits, cost-sharing methods, unfettered contraceptive informative and services and funding research to determine health disparities that harm Black women\u2019s health.Demilitarizing education by removing police officers from schools and abolishing zero-tolerance policies that disproportionately impact Black students.Supporting equal pay to close the wage gap and ensure that Black women are paid equally for the same job as white men. (Black women in Allegheny County earn 54-59 cents to every $1 white men earn, according to the Gender Equity Commission report.)Forming partnerships of community organizations across movements \u2014 economic, environmental, criminal justice and other social justice issues.\nThe report also speaks to the individual. The authors recommend we contact local reproductive justice organizations and become involved, learn and teach others about local regulations or practices that \u201crestrict access to comprehensive, bias-free reproductive and sexual health for all.\u201d\nThey also said we should share our stories.\nGrowing up, I was taught that my existence was created through a complex system. I learned that I am part of a history and heritage of people from millennia past, with millennia to go. What I was not taught was that my body held specific power and represented a special place in the United States \u2014 a place that the country needed to become, survive, create, thrive but also feared \u2014 the presence of a Black woman.\nI was not taught what the process of becoming a cis woman with the ability to reproduce another life form meant for me. It was unclear to me what rights and responsibilities I had to and for myself, including joy, pleasure, budding sexuality and security.\nReading these reports sheds light on the legacy I am carrying, the responsibilities I have moving forward and what I might be able to do to help create a future of equity. I don\u2019t envision that future for only Black women but for everyone. In a white supremacist patriarchy \u2014 like the United States, like Pittsburgh \u2014 Black and Brown women and femmes are routinely at the bottom of priorities. We have to turn the desire for a level playing field into actual deeds.\nTereneh Idia is a Pittsburgh-based writer and designer.
