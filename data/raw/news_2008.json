Olmscheid/Senate Media Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgressive Democrats, fresh off a surprising midterm election victory, had a plan this year to make Minnesota an abortion refuge of the Upper Midwest, writing abortion rights into law and removing all restrictions on the books.\nThey quickly succeeded in codifying the right to abortion and enacting a shield law to protect women who travel to Minnesota from out-of-state to have abortions.\nBut another, far-reaching bill that would repeal virtually all abortion restrictions could fail to get the necessary support of swing-district Democrats needed with a one-seat majority in the Senate.\nThe hold-outs could force the rest of the Democrats in the Legislature to make compromises on the party\u2019s abortion agenda, something they have been uninterested in doing. Democrats have so far rejected every amendment proposed by Republicans, which they say would be a concession to the anti-abortion movement.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, of course you do not trust the anti-abortion movement. They have literally, successfully banned abortion in more than half the states,\u201d said Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley. \u201cOur goals are fundamentally unalignable \u2026\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to work with them on making abortion a little bit more banned. I don\u2019t.\u201d\nMaye Quade said she believes the abortion restrictions \u2014 many of which have already been ruled unconstitutional by a judge last year \u2014 will pass. But there are signs that some Democrats fear the party is moving beyond what their voters are comfortable with.\nLegislative leaders said they expected to bring the bill (SF70/HF91) repealing restrictions to the floor in February, but it only recently passed in the House as part of a larger health bill. The Senate version didn\u2019t have the corresponding language.\nAnd Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s office declined to say if he supports all the repeals in the bill. A spokeswoman for Walz said only that he looks forward to signing the health\u00a0 bill once the House and Senate pass whatever version they agree to.\nIf progressive Democrats successfully bring moderates to their side, it will likely prove as consequential to abortion access as the PRO Act, the law signed by Walz stating everyone has a fundamental right to reproductive health care.\nThe bill seeks to repeal over a dozen laws regulating abortion, along with archaic (and unenforceable) bans on sodomy, adultery, fornication and mailing \u201cobscene materials\u201d \u2014\u00a0the Minnesota version of the 19th century federal Comstock Act, which abortion opponents have resurrected in an effort to ban the mailing of abortion drugs.\nGone is the definition of \u201cviable\u201d for a fetus being able to live outside the womb, and with it the requirement that abortions after viability only be performed in order to preserve the health of the pregnant woman.\nGone is the requirement that abortions after the first trimester be performed in a hospital or abortion facility.\nGone is the requirement that both parents of minors be notified.\nGone is the requirement that the state Department of Health keep any data on abortions performed in the state.\nGone, too, are the requirements that women wait at least 24 hours before getting an abortion and that their doctors recite a list of medically dubious claims about the risks, including a connection to breast cancer.\nMost of these requirements were struck down by a Ramsey County judge just days after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade in a case brought by Gender Justice, the nonprofit Maye Quade works for. The judge based his decision on 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that the state\u2019s constitution guarantees the right to abortion.\n  Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley, introduces a bill providing gender affirming health care protections. Photo by Senate Media Services.\nThat ruling \u2014\u00a0known as Doe v. Gomez \u2014\u00a0has become a bulwark against the rightward shift of the U.S. Supreme Court, and ensured Minnesota\u2019s place as a haven for abortion rights, as its neighbors have moved to ban abortion.\nYet courts can be fickle. Advocates worry a future judge could reverse the Ramsey County judge\u2019s decision \u2014 though efforts to appeal the decision have so far been unsuccessful \u2014 and a future state Supreme Court could overturn the ruling that Minnesotans have a constitutional right to abortion.\nAbortion access advocates also worry providers would be scared to violate laws, even those ruled unconstitutional.\n\u201cIt removes the Damocles of fear that would hang over providers\u2019 heads,\u201d Maye Quade said.\nThe result would be that abortion would have no more oversight than, say, an online prescription for erectile dysfunction or a tonsillectomy \u2014 treatments health researchers say carry more risk than most abortions.\nIf the package of repeals passes, Minnesota would join the half dozen most progressive states on abortion, including Oregon, California, Vermont and New York, according to Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state-level abortion policy for the Guttmacher Institute.\nLike the PRO Act, the bill has drawn fierce opposition from Republicans.\n\u201cThese bills are just completely far afield of where Minnesotans are. They\u2019re just really out of touch,\u201d said Rep. Anne Neu Brindley, R-North Branch, in an interview.\nYet abortion rights has shown itself to be a winning issue. Polls show support for abortion access has grown since the Dobbs decision. Voters in California, Michigan and Vermont passed state constitutional amendments protecting reproductive freedom, while voters in red states like Kansans and Kentucky rejected abortion bans.\nIn April, Wisconsin residents voted by an 11-point margin for a progressive state Supreme Court judge who publicly stated her support for abortion rights over a conservative opponent who seemed likely to uphold the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban.\nFurther attacks on abortion rights, like a federal judge\u2019s ruling attempting to eliminate access to abortion pills, threaten to paint Republicans as extremists who want to ban abortion completely, keeping the issue alive for at least another election cycle.\nThe significance of the political earthquake set off by the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision can\u2019t be overstated: The package of repeals before Minnesota lawmakers would\u2019ve been unthinkable the last time Democrats controlled the legislative and executive branches nine years ago.\nThis year is the first time there\u2019s been a \u201cpro-choice majority,\u201d according to Democrats, and the repeal bill sailed through a number of committees in both chambers with the maximum 35 co-authors in the House and five co-authors in the Senate.\nThe repeals passed the House at the end of April with two notable changes: The bill doesn\u2019t repeal the requirement that the parents of minors seeking abortions be notified unless waived by a judge.\nAnd the bill doesn\u2019t fully repeal the law requiring physicians to provide life-saving care to a baby that is born after an attempted abortion \u2014 an extremely rare occurrence. Instead, it requires medical providers to provide \u201ccare,\u201d which could be end-of-life care for a baby whose life can\u2019t be saved because of severe deformities or other maladies.\nRepublicans offered numerous amendments, including one that garnered support of two Democrats: Reps. Dan Wolgamott of St. Cloud and Dave Lislegard of Aurora supported an amendment that would have banned third-trimester abortions except in cases of rape, incest or serious complications and would have required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Department of Health, like hospitals.\nNone of the repeals on abortion regulations were included in the Senate\u2019s large health and human services bill, which means members of both bodies will have to negotiate over whether or not to include them in the bill before sending it back to both chambers for approval and then the governor\u2019s desk.\nSenators in swing districts, just one of whom could tank the bill in the 34-33 upper chamber, have been tight-lipped about their positions.\nSen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said he hadn\u2019t looked at it enough yet to know if he supports it.\nSen. Robert Kupec, DFL-Moorhead, didn\u2019t return a voicemail and email, and his assistant said he was unavailable when a Reformer reporter visited his office. He voted for the repeals when the bill was first heard in committee in January.\nSen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, said he\u2019s not necessarily opposed to repealing many abortion restrictions but that the issue is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m appreciating its complexity,\u201d Putnam said. \u201cMost Minnesotans favor access to the procedure. That\u2019s why I voted for the PRO Act without reservation. But I think most Minnesotans also see it as a complicated issue and that circumstances matter.\u201d\nRepealing the viability standard\u00a0\nThe challenges of how to regulate abortion in post-Roe America are medical as well as political.\nProponents of the repeals say the state cannot effectively regulate complex medical decisions.\n\u201cI get nervous when the Legislature tries to legislate how to practice medicine because the Legislature is not made up of health care providers,\u201d said Sen. Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deephaven, a co-author of the bill and an OB/GYN.\nThe bill\u2019s repeal of restrictions after viability \u2014 that ambiguous point in gestation after which a fetus can survive outside the womb \u2014 goes against what polling suggests a majority of the public think is acceptable.\nSeventy-one percent of Americans think abortion should be restricted somewhat \u2014 either mostly legal with some restrictions or mostly illegal with some exceptions. Nineteen percent think abortion should be legal in all cases with no exceptions, according to a pre-Dobbs 2022 poll from the Pew Research Center. In that poll, 61% of respondents said the gestational age of the fetus should matter in determining legality.\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen, who was pummeled on the airwaves for saying he\u2019d ban abortion, tried to paint Walz as the extremist, claiming Walz supported abortion up to the moment of birth with no restrictions.\nWalz\u2019s campaign rebutted the allegation and said he supported \u201cmaintaining the timelines outlined by current law.\u201d By that, Walz meant keeping elective abortion legal up to viability.\nMinnesota\u2019s viability law \u2014\u00a0which states abortions after viability must be done in a hospital and be necessary to protect the health of the mother \u2014 exists in a legal gray area because of a 1976 federal court ruling that a provision of it was unconstitutional because it violated Roe v. Wade.\n  Gov. Tim Walz holds up a signed copy of the Protect Reproductive Options act during a ceremonial bill signing on Jan. 31, 2023 at the state Department of Revenue. Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.\nEven so, medical providers have adhered to it in practice. A Walz campaign spokesperson told MinnPost that the PRO Act would not affect the viability standard, and \u201cwe still share the (medical) providers\u2019 understanding that current law sets the threshold at viability.\u201d\nWhen the PRO Act was passed, Republicans called Walz a liar for supporting a bill that guarantees every person the right to an abortion. Full stop. No exceptions.\nBut Republicans are also skittish about saying when they think abortion should be banned.\n\u201cThat is a political question that folks have been trying to answer all over,\u201d said Republican Minority Leader Mark Johnson of Grand Forks. \u201cI think right now, I\u2019m really grateful that the Dobbs case happened and this was pushed down to the states.\u201d\nPressed on when he personally believes abortion should be legal in Minnesota, Johnson said, \u201cThat\u2019s a political debate to find that sweet spot where Minnesotans are comfortable.\u201d\nAsk Democrats if they think people should be allowed to have elective abortions later in pregnancy, they usually answer a different question: would they?\n\u201cIt literally doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Morrison, the senator and OB/GYN. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to walk in to ask for an abortion in a normally developing pregnancy late in pregnancy. Like that just doesn\u2019t happen. And you\u2019re never going to find (a medical provider) who would do that anyway.\u201d\nOf the 10,136 abortions recorded in Minnesota in 2021, just one was performed after 24 weeks of gestation \u2014 the approximate point of viability. (There were 118 abortions for which the gestational age was not reported.) In 2020, one abortion was reported after 24 weeks. In 2019, two.\nThese statistics would no longer be available if a state law is repealed under the bill. The law requires that health care providers collect a litany of data on each abortion. The reporting requirement was challenged in the recent lawsuit against abortion restrictions, but it was the one law that the judge did not rule unconstitutional. The bill\u2019s authors argue that because abortion should be treated like all other health care, there\u2019s no reason to single it out for more data collection.\nDemocrats say leaving a viability restriction in place \u2014 even one with broad exceptions like Minnesota has effectively had in place for decades \u2014 could deter physicians from providing abortions and delaying care.\nThey point to horror stories from states that have carved out exceptions for medical emergencies. Stories like Deborah Dorbert\u2019s, who couldn\u2019t find a physician in Florida to end a pregnancy doctors agreed was doomed.\nDorbert, whose story was reported by the Washington Post, found out at 23 weeks that the fetus inside her didn\u2019t develop kidneys and therefore couldn\u2019t produce vital amniotic fluid. There are no treatments for the condition \u2014\u00a0called Potter\u2019s Syndrome \u2014 and many fetuses die before they are born.\nDorbert found traveling to a state with more permissive laws too daunting and so continued to carry a baby she knew was going to die soon after it was born, enduring emotional suffering and risking her own health.\nRepealing regulations on who can perform abortions\u00a0\nThe bill would strip away all Minnesota laws governing who can perform an abortion and where \u2014 rules first enacted in the 1970s and declared unenforceable by the courts.\nThe law on the books says it\u2019s a felony for anyone to perform an abortion except a physician (or physician in training) and require that an abortion after the first trimester be performed in a hospital or abortion facility. Minnesota also requires that abortion facilities be licensed \u2014\u00a0like hospitals \u2014 by the commissioner of health.\nRamsey County District Judge Thomas Gilligan\u2019s ruling last year invalidated the law requiring doctors to perform abortions, allowing other advanced care providers like physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and clinical nurse practitioners to perform the procedure.\nTestimony from doctors and nurses showed some of the oddities of restriction: Physician assistants and nurse practitioners can prescribe controlled substances, for instance, yet the law required a doctor to dispense abortion pills, which have been shown to be safer than Viagra and penicillin.\nClinical nurses and nurse midwives also help women carry pregnancies to term and deliver babies, which is far riskier than abortions.\nBrindley, the North Branch Republican, noted Republicans brought an amendment to change \u201ca person performing an abortion\u201d to \u201ca medical professional\u201d and that was rejected.\nRepublicans say that means Democrats are opening up the procedure to non-medical professionals.\nThe bill\u2019s authors hold that because abortion is health care, it must be performed by a licensed medical professional. They counter that state law doesn\u2019t enumerate every individual medical procedure that must be performed by a physician or nurse.\nWhat prevents someone without proper training from performing an abortion, Maye Quade says, is the same law that prevents non-medical professionals from providing heart transplants or leg amputations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime to practice medicine without a license,\u201d Maye Quade said.\nThe Ramsey County judge\u2019s order struck down the requirement that abortions be performed in an abortion facility or a hospital after the first trimester, noting the law was not actively being enforced to begin with.\nThere are no licensed abortion facilities in Minnesota because there\u2019s no licensure mechanism \u2014 the law requiring them to be licensed was enjoined in a 1977 federal court decision.\nClinics aren\u2019t governed by the same rigorous standards that apply to hospitals, which must be licensed by state health authorities. Health clinics aren\u2019t licensed, and the industry largely depends on self-regulation under the threat of lawsuits or disciplinary action.\nThere isn\u2019t a government official who routinely comes by to check that all health clinics are sanitary and safe, like they do for restaurants, hair salons and apartment rentals. Many health care providers do their own internal audits. Planned Parenthood, for example, inspects its affiliate clinics as a requirement to carry the Planned Parenthood name.\nRepublicans say the state should require abortions after the first trimester be performed in hospitals, but experts told the Ramsey County judge that there\u2019s little proven health benefits of a hospital over an outpatient clinic, which in some studies has been shown to have better outcomes.\nAdvocates look to pass a constitutional amendment\nAbortion rights advocates \u2014 with the enthusiastic support of DFL operatives \u2014 are taking no chances that their successes be reversed: Minnesota voters can expect to face a decision about a constitutional amendment to protect reproductive rights at some point in the near future.\n\u201cThat would be an exceptionally wise move if they are really interested in protecting reproductive freedom in Minnesota,\u201d said Laura Hermer, an abortion law expert and professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.\nIt\u2019s the holy grail for abortion rights advocates, who have passed them in California, Vermont and Michigan.\nUnlike the PRO Act, a constitutional amendment couldn\u2019t be reversed by a Republican trifecta or undone by a conservative Supreme Court. The 1995 state Supreme Court ruling that Minnesota\u2019s constitution guarantees the right to abortion is based on people\u2019s right to privacy \u2014 not reproductive health care.\nThe political calculus Democrats have to make is not whether to put it on the ballot, but when it will be most advantageous to them. With U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar on the ballot in 2024, Democrats may feel they don\u2019t need the extra boost from an abortion amendment until 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAs red states pass new abortion restrictions, Minnesota looks to shed them all\nby Max Nesterak, Minnesota Reformer May 8, 2023\nAs red states pass new abortion restrictions, Minnesota looks to shed them all\nby Max Nesterak, Minnesota Reformer May 8, 2023\n Progressive Democrats, fresh off a surprising midterm election victory, had a plan this year to make Minnesota an abortion refuge of the Upper Midwest, writing abortion rights into law and removing all restrictions on the books.\nThey quickly succeeded in codifying the right to abortion and enacting a shield law to protect women who travel to Minnesota from out-of-state to have abortions.\nBut another, far-reaching bill that would repeal virtually all abortion restrictions could fail to get the necessary support of swing-district Democrats needed with a one-seat majority in the Senate.\nThe hold-outs could force the rest of the Democrats in the Legislature to make compromises on the party\u2019s abortion agenda, something they have been uninterested in doing.

In that poll, 61% of respondents said the gestational age of the fetus should matter in determining legality.\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen, who was pummeled on the airwaves for saying he\u2019d ban abortion, tried to paint Walz as the extremist, claiming Walz supported abortion up to the moment of birth with no restrictions.\nWalz\u2019s campaign rebutted the allegation and said he supported \u201cmaintaining the timelines outlined by current law.\u201d By that, Walz meant keeping elective abortion legal up to viability.\nMinnesota\u2019s viability law \u2014\u00a0which states abortions after viability must be done in a hospital and be necessary to protect the health of the mother \u2014 exists in a legal gray area because of a 1976 federal court ruling that a provision of it was unconstitutional because it violated Roe v. Wade.\n  Gov. Tim Walz holds up a signed copy of the Protect Reproductive Options act during a ceremonial bill signing on Jan. 31, 2023 at the state Department of Revenue. Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.\nEven so, medical providers have adhered to it in practice. A Walz campaign spokesperson told MinnPost that the PRO Act would not affect the viability standard, and \u201cwe still share the (medical) providers\u2019 understanding that current law sets the threshold at viability.\u201d\nWhen the PRO Act was passed, Republicans called Walz a liar for supporting a bill that guarantees every person the right to an abortion. Full stop. No exceptions.\nBut Republicans are also skittish about saying when they think abortion should be banned.\n\u201cThat is a political question that folks have been trying to answer all over,\u201d said Republican Minority Leader Mark Johnson of Grand Forks. \u201cI think right now, I\u2019m really grateful that the Dobbs case happened and this was pushed down to the states.\u201d\nPressed on when he personally believes abortion should be legal in Minnesota, Johnson said, \u201cThat\u2019s a political debate to find that sweet spot where Minnesotans are comfortable.\u201d\nAsk Democrats if they think people should be allowed to have elective abortions later in pregnancy, they usually answer a different question: would they?\n\u201cIt literally doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Morrison, the senator and OB/GYN. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to walk in to ask for an abortion in a normally developing pregnancy late in pregnancy. Like that just doesn\u2019t happen. And you\u2019re never going to find (a medical provider) who would do that anyway.\u201d\nOf the 10,136 abortions recorded in Minnesota in 2021, just one was performed after 24 weeks of gestation \u2014 the approximate point of viability. (There were 118 abortions for which the gestational age was not reported.) In 2020, one abortion was reported after 24 weeks. In 2019, two.\nThese statistics would no longer be available if a state law is repealed under the bill. The law requires that health care providers collect a litany of data on each abortion. The reporting requirement was challenged in the recent lawsuit against abortion restrictions, but it was the one law that the judge did not rule unconstitutional. The bill\u2019s authors argue that because abortion should be treated like all other health care, there\u2019s no reason to single it out for more data collection.\nDemocrats say leaving a viability restriction in place \u2014 even one with broad exceptions like Minnesota has effectively had in place for decades \u2014 could deter physicians from providing abortions and delaying care.\nThey point to horror stories from states that have carved out exceptions for medical emergencies. Stories like Deborah Dorbert\u2019s, who couldn\u2019t find a physician in Florida to end a pregnancy doctors agreed was doomed.\nDorbert, whose story was reported by the Washington Post, found out at 23 weeks that the fetus inside her didn\u2019t develop kidneys and therefore couldn\u2019t produce vital amniotic fluid. There are no treatments for the condition \u2014\u00a0called Potter\u2019s Syndrome \u2014 and many fetuses die before they are born.\nDorbert found traveling to a state with more permissive laws too daunting and so continued to carry a baby she knew was going to die soon after it was born, enduring emotional suffering and risking her own health.\n    Repealing regulations on who can perform abortions\u00a0\n\n\t\nThe bill would strip away all Minnesota laws governing who can perform an abortion and where \u2014 rules first enacted in the 1970s and declared unenforceable by the courts.\nThe law on the books says it\u2019s a felony for anyone to perform an abortion except a physician (or physician in training) and require that an abortion after the first trimester be performed in a hospital or abortion facility. Minnesota also requires that abortion facilities be licensed \u2014\u00a0like hospitals \u2014 by the commissioner of health.\nRamsey County District Judge Thomas Gilligan\u2019s ruling last year invalidated the law requiring doctors to perform abortions, allowing other advanced care providers like physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and clinical nurse practitioners to perform the procedure.\nTestimony from doctors and nurses showed some of the oddities of restriction: Physician assistants and nurse practitioners can prescribe controlled substances, for instance, yet the law required a doctor to dispense abortion pills, which have been shown to be safer than Viagra and penicillin.\nClinical nurses and nurse midwives also help women carry pregnancies to term and deliver babies, which is far riskier than abortions.\nBrindley, the North Branch Republican, noted Republicans brought an amendment to change \u201ca person performing an abortion\u201d to \u201ca medical professional\u201d and that was rejected.\nRepublicans say that means Democrats are opening up the procedure to non-medical professionals.\nThe bill\u2019s authors hold that because abortion is health care, it must be performed by a licensed medical professional. They counter that state law doesn\u2019t enumerate every individual medical procedure that must be performed by a physician or nurse.\nWhat prevents someone without proper training from performing an abortion, Maye Quade says, is the same law that prevents non-medical professionals from providing heart transplants or leg amputations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime to practice medicine without a license,\u201d Maye Quade said.\nThe Ramsey County judge\u2019s order struck down the requirement that abortions be performed in an abortion facility or a hospital after the first trimester, noting the law was not actively being enforced to begin with.\nThere are no licensed abortion facilities in Minnesota because there\u2019s no licensure mechanism \u2014 the law requiring them to be licensed was enjoined in a 1977 federal court decision.\nClinics aren\u2019t governed by the same rigorous standards that apply to hospitals, which must be licensed by state health authorities. Health clinics aren\u2019t licensed, and the industry largely depends on self-regulation under the threat of lawsuits or disciplinary action.\nThere isn\u2019t a government official who routinely comes by to check that all health clinics are sanitary and safe, like they do for restaurants, hair salons and apartment rentals. Many health care providers do their own internal audits. Planned Parenthood, for example, inspects its affiliate clinics as a requirement to carry the Planned Parenthood name.\nRepublicans say the state should require abortions after the first trimester be performed in hospitals, but experts told the Ramsey County judge that there\u2019s little proven health benefits of a hospital over an outpatient clinic, which in some studies has been shown to have better outcomes.\n    Advocates look to pass a constitutional amendment\n\n\t\nAbortion rights advocates \u2014 with the enthusiastic support of DFL operatives \u2014 are taking no chances that their successes be reversed: Minnesota voters can expect to face a decision about a constitutional amendment to protect reproductive rights at some point in the near future.\n\u201cThat would be an exceptionally wise move if they are really interested in protecting reproductive freedom in Minnesota,\u201d said Laura Hermer, an abortion law expert and professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.\nIt\u2019s the holy grail for abortion rights advocates, who have passed them in California, Vermont and Michigan.\nUnlike the PRO Act, a constitutional amendment couldn\u2019t be reversed by a Republican trifecta or undone by a conservative Supreme Court. The 1995 state Supreme Court ruling that Minnesota\u2019s constitution guarantees the right to abortion is based on people\u2019s right to privacy \u2014 not reproductive health care.\nThe political calculus Democrats have to make is not whether to put it on the ballot, but when it will be most advantageous to them. With U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar on the ballot in 2024, Democrats may feel they don\u2019t need the extra boost from an abortion amendment until 2026.\n\n\n Minnesota Reformer is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
