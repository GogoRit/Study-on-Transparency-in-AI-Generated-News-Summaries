As mayor of Boston, he supported the ROE Act bill removing certain restrictions on abortion in Massachusetts; the state Legislature enacted the bill into law in December 2020 over the governor\u2019s veto.\u00a0\nThe bill lowered the age when a girl needs the consent of a parent or a judge to get an abortion from 17 to 15. It also removed previous language in state law requiring doctors to try to save the life of a baby born alive after an attempted abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalsh supported the original version of the bill, which sought to increase public funding of abortion and eliminate the parental consent requirement for girls of any age.\nIn February 2016, Walsh received the \u201cMen For Choice\u201d award from a group then known as NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts.\nIn November 2016, Walsh vowed to make Boston one of the \u201csafe cities\u201d for abortions to take place in if other jurisdictions in the country made abortion illegal.\nIn June 2017, Walsh spoke at the dedication ceremony of a public square in Boston that he and city councilors named after a doctor who performed abortions. He praised the doctor for \u201cfighting to protect choice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doctor, Kenneth Edelin (1939-2013), performed a late-second-trimester or early-third-trimester abortion in October 1973. A jury later convicted him of manslaughter, finding that he suffocated the male unborn baby by compressing the umbilical cord while the baby was detached from the wall of his mother\u2019s uterus but still inside his mother\u2019s body. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1976 overturned the verdict and ordered an acquittal, finding there was not enough evidence to prove that a \u201clive birth\u201d had taken place.\nOf Edelin, Walsh said: \u201cIt would be hard to overstate his mark he made on the city of Boston. He possessed a rare combination of a remarkable talent and a devotion to doing the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0The Award\nFrom Catholic Memorial, Walsh is set to receive the Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice Award. Rice (1762-1844) was a rich export merchant in Waterford, Ireland. He grew up during a time when it was illegal to teach the Catholic faith in Ireland. After his wife died, he founded a religious order to teach boys. He was beatified in 1996.\nRobert Joyce, a graduate of Catholic Memorial and a lawyer in nearby Newton, said he finds giving the award to Walsh incongruous with the mission of the school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt kind of sent a message that abortion might not be that bad to support or maybe even participate in, because after all, Martin Walsh is a zealous proponent of abortion, and he\u2019s receiving the Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice Award. The message to the students is contrary to the message that you want Catholic young men to receive,\u201d Joyce said in a telephone interview.\nA spokesman for Catholic Memorial sent a statement to the Register by email: \u201cWe are aware that one of our alumni has gone public with his opinion of the school\u2019s selection of Secretary of Labor and former Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh as the recipient of one of our key awards at CM\u2019s Spring 2022 Gala. A few hundred alumni, school families and generous supporters are helping us raise much needed scholarship funds, which are given to more than 60% of our students, many of whom would not be able to attend our school without the aid.\u201d\nPeter Folan, the president of Catholic Memorial, declined a request for an interview with the Register through a spokesman.\nWalsh\u2019s press secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor could not be reached for comment by deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school says the spring gala, which is set for a hotel in Norwood, a town about 13 miles southwest of Boston, is sold out.\n\n\u00a0Prominent School\nWalsh, 54, is a graduate of two other Catholic schools: The Newman School in Boston (formerly known as Newman Preparatory School) and Boston College.\nAfter nearly 17 years in the state Legislature, he served as mayor of Boston from 2014 to 2021, before joining President Joe Biden\u2019s cabinet. He was a trade union president before running for mayor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is frequently mentioned as a candidate for higher office, including governor of Massachusetts or U.S. senator.\nFounded in 1957, Catholic Memorial is one of the best-known Catholic schools in New England. CM, as it is widely known, frequently wins state championships in hockey and basketball. The school is situated in West Roxbury, a largely residential neighborhood at the southwestern edge of the city of Boston. Its alumni include figures in professional sports, entertainment, and local politics.\nAccording to a brief school history, Cardinal Richard Cushing, then archbishop of Boston, suggested the name \u201cCatholic Memorial\u201d \u201cto commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Archdiocese of Boston as a memorial to all the Catholics who gave so much of themselves in the establishment of educational institutions in the Boston area.\u201d (The archdiocese of Boston was founded in 1808, one of the first four dioceses in the United States carved out of the original diocese of Baltimore, which once covered the whole country.)\nThe school motto is Vince in Bono Malum, which means \u201cConquer Evil With Good.\u201d\nTuition at Catholic Memorial for the 2022-2023 school year is $25,450.\n\n\u00a0Catholic Memorial and Abortion\nJoyce, 75, is a 1964 graduate of Catholic Memorial. He served on the school\u2019s board of directors several decades ago and also served as president of the school\u2019s alumni association. He said he has been a significant donor to the school and has also helped raise funds for it. He also serves on the board of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund, a Massachusetts organization that supports pro-life legal causes.\nJoyce told the Register he first raised concerns with school officials about honoring abortion supporters about 15 years ago, when the school was planning to honor Walsh\u2019s predecessor as mayor, Thomas Menino, who also supported abortion through public policy. At the time, Joyce didn\u2019t make public his opposition to the event. This time is different, he said, because school officials don\u2019t seem to have learned the lesson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed to do this, because I\u2019ve been a longstanding supporter of Catholic Memorial and I have a lot of friends at Catholic Memorial, and I know that some of them won\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s my duty as a loyal Catholic to speak out in defense of fundamental Catholic values.\u201d\nThe Massachusetts Pro-Life Coalition, an alliance of eight pro-life organizations, denounced the school for honoring Walsh, saying his \u201copposition to Catholic morality\u201d is \u201cnotorious, impenitent, wide-ranging, and longstanding.\u201d\nC.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, which is a member of the coalition, notes that Walsh has clashed with Church teachings on other topics besides abortion.\nAs a state representative in 2004, Walsh was a key vote helping keep a proposed ballot question from going to the state\u2019s voters that sought to flip the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s 4-3 ruling legalizing same-sex civil marriage in the state \u2014 which was the first to do so in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mayor, Walsh put pressure on the sponsors of the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in South Boston to allow pro-homosexuality advocacy organizations to march in it \u2014 using, according to a subsequent lawsuit, profane and threatening language in the process.\n\n\u00a0\u2018Toxic\u2019 Message\nDoyle, a 1971 graduate of the school, calls Catholic Memorial\u2019s decision to give Walsh an award \u201ca grave scandal.\u201d\n\u201cThe message Catholic Memorial is sending to its students is toxic. By this award, CM is telling its students that support for the mass murder of the unborn is morally acceptable, that those who advocate such killings are respectable members of the Catholic community, and that those who reject Catholic principles, to conform to the dominant secular culture, are role models to be emulated,\u201d Doyle said in a written statement. \u201cNo rational person can be reasonably expected to take seriously Catholic opposition to abortion when an elite Catholic educational institution confers an award, named after a future saint, on a politician who wanted to make Boston a sanctuary city for abortions. Faithful Catholics should not have to fight a two-front war, against both a culture of death in secular society, and against a culture of betrayal in their own Church.\"\nDoyle notes that in 2004 the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops published a document called \u201cCatholics in Political Life\u201d decrying abortion and stating: \u201cThe Catholic community and Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles. They should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.\u201d\nJoyce said he wrote a letter to Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, asking him to intervene. He said he got a short response from an aide to Cardinal O\u2019Malley pointing out that Catholic Memorial is not a diocesan school, and instead answers to its board of directors and the religious order that runs it.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyce said that a Catholic Memorial official told him that the cardinal has been invited to the gala.\nA spokesman for Catholic Memorial, asked if Cardinal O\u2019Malley plans to attend the event, referred the question O\u2019Malley\u2019s office. A spokesman for Cardinal O\u2019Malley, asked for comment and if O\u2019Malley plans to attend the event, referred questions to Catholic Memorial.\n\nRegister correspondent Matt McDonald is the editor of New Boston Post.\n\n\nKeywords: \nmarty walsh\ncatholic schools\ncatholic memorial\nboston archdiocese\n\n\n\n\nMatthew McDonald Matthew McDonald is a staff reporter for The National Catholic Register and the editor of New Boston Post.
