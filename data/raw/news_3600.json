The FBI must\u00a0answer\u00a0for its selective enforcement of the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the five months since someone leaked a draft majority opinion by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade\u2014which the high court officially\u00a0did\u00a0June 24\u2014pro-life Americans have faced a wave of violent attacks.\nPro-abortion politicians from President Joe Biden on down haven\u2019t just been silent about the attacks on pro-life organizations. They\u2019ve helped fan the flames.\nHave you not heard about these attacks that have swept the country? That makes sense. After all, most of the corporate media either has ignored or woefully underreported it.\nAn Overview of Pro-Abortion Violence\nIn the past five months, hundreds of attacks have targeted\u00a0churches,\u00a0pro-life organizations, and pregnancy centers.\nFrom vandalism to verbal threats to firebombings, groups such as Jane\u2019s Revenge have organized and taken credit openly for such attacks. Crickets from the Justice Department.\nActivists protested for weeks outside the homes of Supreme Court justices. Protesters harassed justices\u2019 families, neighbors, and communities.\nThe Biden administration basically did nothing to\u00a0address\u00a0these demonstrations, even though at least some apparently violated federal law.\nOne abortion supporter even confessed to traveling from California to\u00a0assassinate\u00a0Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\nIn July, a pro-life teenager in Kansas reported being\u00a0assaulted\u00a0by an abortion supporter while canvassing for a pro-life amendment to the state constitution.\nIn September, an 84-year-old Michigan woman was\u00a0shot\u00a0in the back by an abortion supporter while she canvassed against a pro-abortion amendment to that state\u2019s constitution. (Thankfully, she is recovering.)\nAlso in September, Students for Life\u2014no stranger to acts of vandalism and verbal harassment on college campuses\u2014reported that an abortion supporter\u00a0threw\u00a0a cup of urine at two pro-life students while the group was peacefully displaying information about a pro-life campaign.\nMost recently, FBI agents\u00a0arrested\u00a0Mark Houck, a pro-life Catholic activist and father of seven, at his home in Pennsylvania. The FBI\u2019s\u00a0dubious\u00a0charge is that Houck violated a law called the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (also known as the FACES Act), which makes it a crime to use force to intimidate or obstruct someone from getting or providing an abortion.\nThe incident stemmed from an altercation earlier this summer in which Houck reportedly pushed an abortion clinic volunteer away from Houck\u2019s 12-year-old son, who was being harassed by the volunteer. Local officials had refused to bring charges against Houck.\nBiden\u2019s Justice Department, however, is pursuing federal charges that carry a penalty of up to 11 years in prison.\nMonths ago, Houck\u2019s attorneys told the FBI that he would\u00a0cooperate\u00a0fully with law enforcement. No matter. The FBI still chose to raid his home at gunpoint in the early morning in front of his wife and children.\nPro-Abortion Leaders Double Down\nThe wave of violence against pro-life activists and organizations is an outrage.\nBiden\u2019s \u201cunity speech\u201d last month in Philadelphia rang hollow for many reasons, his silence on pro-abortion violence among them.\n\u201cJoe Biden did get one thing right tonight,\u201d Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts\u00a0said\u00a0at the time. \u201cWe are indeed fighting a battle for the soul of our nation. The problem is, he\u2019s fighting on the wrong side.\u201d\nAlso last month, Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0applauded\u00a0Democrat state attorneys general for \u201ctaking on\u201d life-saving pregnancy resource centers, even as these groups dealt with threats, vandalism, and worse.\nIn Congress, pro-abortion lawmakers are\u00a0promoting\u00a0legislation authorizing the Federal Trade Commission to fine pregnancy resource centers for \u201cdisinformation,\u201d meaning accurate information about the physical and psychological harms of abortion, as well as alternatives to abortion.\nLast week, the FBI reportedly\u00a0questioned\u00a0a pro-life sidewalk counselor over an altercation outside a Planned Parenthood clinic. The counselor apparently had tried to stop an abortion advocate from destroying a pro-life sign with a boxcutter.\nAs with the case of the Philadelphia dad, local officials declined to press charges. So why is the FBI engaging? Is another FACE Act raid on a pro-lifer in the works?\nAmericans Deserve Better\nFor their part, some members of Congress are\u00a0demanding\u00a0answers. Should they get the chance next year, pro-life lawmakers should hold oversight hearings and hear directly from Justice Department employees under oath.\nIn any case, the Biden administration should\u2014at the very least\u2014call for an end to the violence. The FBI must\u00a0answer\u00a0for its selective enforcement of the law.\nCongress must\u00a0follow through\u00a0on its commitment to conduct oversight on the Biden administration\u2019s policies.\nAnd every American should resolve to uphold our country\u2019s foundational principles of free speech and peaceful expression. We can\u2019t afford not to.\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
