She also helps pregnant mothers seek resources to help if they're family planning or to help them reconsider abortions by providing resources during their pregnancies. \n\nStevens is a part of the Handmaid Coalition, a grassroots organization born out of the 2019 legislative session surrounding the bill. The group is known to wear costumes similar to the uniforms worn in the popular dystopian drama, \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" She is also a Planned Parenthood escort. \n\nWe asked both advocates their thoughts on the bill, what they think will happen as a result and what they plan to do to support women seeking abortions or pregnant mothers. \n\nINITIAL REACTION \n\nGuy: \u201cI just started thanking God, this is such an answer to prayer. We have waited so long for this bill, this legislation to be allowed to go into effect because as we know, Gov. Kemp signed it back in May of 2019.\" \n\nStevens: \u201cWhen the Supreme Court draft was leaked, we knew this was coming. Doesn\u2019t make it any easier. There are actual women who had appointments scheduled for tomorrow that are being canceled.\u201d \n\nWHY THEY OPPOSE OR SUPPORT THE BILL \n\nGuy: \u201cIt is going to save thousands of lives of innocent children and also spare thousands of women and men the regret of abortion. All the precious Georgians whose lives will be protected and saved, and what that means for future generations. Because those children who are saved will have children, and they'll have children.\u201d \n\nStevens: \u201cThe fact that we live in a state that has the highest maternal mortality rate and now we\u2019re going to force women to go through this, it makes no sense. It is primarily going to affect poor women in rural communities more than in cities and definitely Black and brown women will be affected in ways we can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOSSIBLE FALLOUT FROM THE BILL \n\nGuy: \u201cAs for those precious moms, I care deeply about women who are in crisis, unplanned or unwanted pregnancies. And there are so many fantastic resources out there and there's so much help for them. And they will be spared the regret and trauma of abortion, that abortion causes women and men.\u201d \n\nStevens: \u201cThere are women who will quickly choose to have an abortion the minute they find out they\u2019re pregnant under six weeks, that may have chosen otherwise if they had some time to process it. There are women in abusive relationships that are going to face this abuse, and if they don\u2019t kill them, they will beat them until they spontaneously miscarry.\u201d \n\nHOW THIS PLAYS OUT DURING ELECTIONS \n\nGuy: \u201cRepublicans coming together and supporting Brian Kemp. And more than ever, we need unity in the conservative movement. Republicans need to fully get behind Governor Kemp.\u201d \n\nStevens: \u201cThe messaging, the signs, the debates, I don\u2019t think any of that is going to matter this year, it\u2019s all going to be getting out the vote. The turnout. People who previously identified as Republican voters, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of quiet turnover, particularly among women.\u201d \n\nWHAT'S NEXT AS FAR AS RESOURCES \n\nGuy: Pregnancy resource centers are a fantastic resource for women that find themselves in an unplanned, unwanted or crisis pregnancy. If the reason that they are seeking an abortion or want an abortion is financial, my organization and other organizations and the pregnancy resource centers help women get their rent paid for, we throw baby showers, there are so many things, we help try to find them a car if they need a car. But it's also about loving those women and men while they're pregnant and after they're pregnant.\" \n\nStevens: \u201dThere's already great organizations that are run by Black and brown women and Planned Parenthood that have spent months preparing for this. We just have got to fund, we\u2019ve got to fund people\u2019s travel to other states, we\u2019ve got to do whatever it takes to ensure that the women of Georgia have the support and the access to abortion that they need.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\nIs the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy an abortion?\n\n\nGeorgia's 'heartbeat law' goes into effect immediately, AG says\n\n\nGeorgia lawmakers, leaders react to court's decision to allow 'heartbeat law' to take effect\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\n\n\nEEO Public File Report\nFCC Online Public Inspection File\nClosed Caption Procedures\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n\n\r\n                \u00a9 2024 WXIA-TV.
