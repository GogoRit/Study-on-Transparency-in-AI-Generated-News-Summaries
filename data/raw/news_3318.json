Their daughter would convince them to shift their focus to another hot-button issue. The Willkes\u2019 Handbook on Abortion, and the photographs they distributed along with it, would help kickstart the right-to-life movement.\nSeason 7 of Slow Burn is produced by Susan Matthews, Samira Tazari, Sophie Summergrad, and Sol Werthan.\nDerek John is Sr. Supervising Producer of Narrative Podcasts.\nEditorial direction by Josh Levin, Derek John and Johanna Zorn. Merritt Jacob is our Technical Director.\nOur theme music is composed by Alexis Cuadrado. Artwork by Derreck Johnson based on a photo provided by Robert Wheeler.\nThe season\u2019s reporting was supported by a grant from the\u00a0International Women\u2019s Media Foundation\u2019s\u00a0Howard G. Buffett Fund for Women Journalists.\nFor a look inside the Handbook on Abortion and the \u201cLife or Death\u201d pamphlet, check out this timeline of the Willkes\u2019 work, which explores some of the influential fetal photographs they published.\nWant to learn more about the origins of the anti-abortion movement?
