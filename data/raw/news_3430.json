The annual five-week campaign seeking to end abortion through prayer, fasting and outreach also coincides with Lent in many areas of the world, underscoring the need for \"spiritual revival\" in pro-life work, said Steven Bozza of the archdiocesan Office for Life and Family.

The liturgy will take place at 5:15 p.m. at the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul, with Father Dennis Gill, director of the archdiocesan Office for Divine Worship, as principal celebrant.\nDetails and registration information for a variety of vigils can be found on a dedicated webpage hosted by Bozza\u2019s office.\n[hotblock]\nThe campaign, which mirrors the 40 days of Lent, has taken on new significance as the Supreme Court is set to rule in June on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case\u00a0, which could overturn Roe v. Wade and redirect the abortion issue to the state level for legislation.\nEven if the court revokes the 1973 Roe decision \u2013 since which more than 61 million abortions (an average of 2,000 per day) have taken place in the U.S. \u2013 Bozza said he doesn\u2019t think \u201canybody is taking anything for granted.\u201d\nGlobally, there are a total of some 73.3 million abortions each year, according to the Guttmacher Institute \u2013 a number at least five million greater than United Kingdom\u2019s current population, and almost 15 million more than the\u00a0United Nation\u2019s 2019 crude death rate, or total number of deaths worldwide in a given year.\nAbortion particularly impacts communities of color: Black, Hispanic and other non-White patients accounted for 62% of all U.S. abortions in 2014, according to\u00a0Guttmacher.\n\u201cI think the sense out in the field is that people are gearing up instead of gearing down,\u201d he said.\nWhile the Senate failed to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (H.R. 3755) \u2014 which would have codified the Roe decision and eliminated pro-life laws at every level of government \u2014 states such as New Jersey have moved to enshrine abortion in their constitutions.\nIn addition, chemical abortions, the pills for which are now widely available in several states through telemedicine and online delivery services, \u201cwill start to become more prominent depending on the state in which you live,\u201d said Bozza.\nCurrently, chemical abortions now account for 39% of all abortions in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute. A 2021 study found that chemical abortions are twice as likely to result in emergency room visits.\nOver the decades, the pro-life movement has developed robust resources for pregnancy and parenting support, housing, food and shelter, he said, reducing the risk factors that make women abortion-vulnerable.\n\u201cWe have to remember that a good deal of great of women go into the abortion clinic for a lot of reasons that can be solved,\u201d said Bozza.\nMen also suffer through abortion, he said, pointing to the work of ministries that help men develop their spirituality, interpersonal relations and parenting skills.\n\u201cWe have to start doing this when kids are in school,\u201d said Bozza, citing the efforts of the Culture Project, Students of Life and Pennsylvanians for Human Life, as well as St. John Paul II\u2019s teaching on the theology of the body.\nAbove all, said Bozza, a change of heart and soul is needed.\n\u201cUntil more people are on their knees in worship to God \u2013 whether they are Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or Muslim \u2013 and we become more attached to him, none of this is going to change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut through a true evangelical effort and the Holy Spirit, we will have the groundswell to say, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
