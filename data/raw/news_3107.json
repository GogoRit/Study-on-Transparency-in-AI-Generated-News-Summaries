Here\u2019s a Country-By-Country Map\n\nColombia is the third Latin American country partially to decriminalize abortion in the past three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPregnant (photo: Credit: / Syda Productions/Shutterstock.)\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nWorld\nFebruary 28, 2022\n\n\n\nAfter Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled 5-4 last week to decriminalize abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, abortion advocates hailed the ruling as part of a broader trend of abortion legalization among countries in earth\u2019s most predominantly Catholic continent.\u00a0\nColombia is the third Latin American country partially to decriminalize abortion in the past three years, following Argentina in 2020 and Mexico in 2021, with significant opposition from Catholics.\u00a0\nBelow is a map showing the landscape of abortion laws in Central and South America and the Caribbean as of February 2022.\nArgentina\nIn December 2020, the Argentinian senate legalized abortion. The new laws allow for abortion for any reason until week 14, and afterwards only for reasons of rape, or to preserve the mother\u2019s life or health. Note: Pro-life advocates argue that abortion is never medically necessary, and that, although a woman may sometimes need to undergo a procedure that will lead to the child's death in order to alleviate a medical condition, this is not the same as directly and intentionally killing the baby.\nColombia\n\n\n\n\n\nColombia\u2019s Constitutional Court ruling this week means that until the 24th week of pregnancy, abortion will not be a punishable crime, and that after this period it can be performed with no upper gestational limit on the grounds of risk to the life of the mother, sexual abuse, or fetal deformity.\nThe court ruling asks Congress and the national government to implement a comprehensive public policy that, among other things, eliminates \u201cany obstacle to the exercise of sexual and reproductive rights that are recognized in this ruling.\u201d\nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, as well as the country\u2019s Catholic bishops, have criticized the ruling.\u00a0\nCuba\nAbortion has been legal in Cuba with a 12-week limit since 1965, and is provided for free by the state health system.\u00a0\nEcuador\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortions may be performed to preserve the life and health of the mother, or in cases of rape or for \u201ceconomic or social reasons.\u201d\nUruguay\nAbortion has been legal, with a 12-week limit and only following a five-day \u201creflection period,\u201d since 2012. There is a parental notification law for minors seeking abortions.\u00a0\nMexico\nAbortion policy varies on a state-by-state basis. In September 2021, the Mexican Supreme Court issued a ruling invalidating the protection of life from conception in the Constitution of the state of Sinaloa. Pro-choice observers described the ruling as effectively decriminalizing abortion in Mexico, as the ruling is binding on other states. Most Mexican states currently do not allow abortions except to preserve the mother\u2019s health.\u00a0\nBelize\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is permitted only in cases of fetal abnormality, incest, or to preserve the physical or mental health of the mother.\u00a0\nGuatemala\nAbortion is allowed only to protect the life of the mother; women who procure abortions can be jailed for as many as three years for procuring an abortion, or as little as six months if they are suffering from a psychiatric problem. Anyone who performs an abortion can be jailed for 1-3 years if the woman consents, or as many as six years if they performed it without the woman\u2019s consent.\u00a0\nHonduras\nIllegal for any reason. In 2021, the government changed the constitution to prevent future abortion legalization.\u00a0\nEl Salvador\u00a0\nIllegal for any reason.\nNicaragua\nIllegal for any reason.\nCosta Rica\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\u00a0\nPanama\nAbortion is allowed to save the mother\u2019s life, as well as cases of fetal abnormalities and rape.\u00a0\nVenezuela\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion allowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\u00a0\nGuyana\nAllowed for any reason until 8 weeks; and until 16 weeks in cases of fetal impairment, rape, or incest; and after 16 weeks only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\u00a0\nSuriname\u00a0\nIllegal for any reason.\nBrazil\u00a0\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother, or in cases of rape.\u00a0\nPeru\nAbortion not punishable only \u201cwhen it is the only means to save the life of the pregnant woman or to avoid grave and permanent harm to her health.\u201d\nBolivia\nAbortion illegal except in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life and health (including mental health) of the mother.\u00a0\nParaguay\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\u00a0\nChile\u00a0\nAbortion illegal except in cases of rape (but only before 12 weeks, unless the girl is under 14 years old, in which case the limit is 14 weeks), fetal abnormality, or to protect the life of the mother.\nDominican Republic\nIllegal for any reason.\nHaiti\nIllegal for any reason.\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother, and in cases of rape, incest, or fetal anomaly.\nAntigua and Barbuda\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\nDominica\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\nBahamas\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\nGrenada\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\nTrinidad and Tobago\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother.\nBarbados\nAllowed only to preserve the mental or physical health of the mother, and in cases of rape, incest, or fetal anomaly.\nJamaica\nIllegal for any reason.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis\nIllegal for any reason.\nSaint Lucia\nAllowed only to preserve the life and health of the mother, and in cases of rape, incest, or fetal anomaly.\n\n\nKeywords: \nlatin america\nabortion laws\ncolombia\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPending Decision by Human Rights Court Threatens to Legalize Abortion Throughout Latin America\n\nContrary to what abortion groups maintain, Leilani breathed, cried, received the love of her mother, and had a birth certificate.\n\n\nJulieta Villar\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin America Celebrates \u2018Day of the Unborn Child\u2019 With Pro-Life Marches in Several Countries\n\nThousands came out March 25 to support the gift of life.\n\n\nWalter Sanchez Silva/ACI Prensa/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin American Pro-Life Leaders Celebrate Overturning of Roe v.
