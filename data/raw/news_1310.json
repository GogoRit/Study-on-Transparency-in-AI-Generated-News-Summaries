Mike DeWine\u2019s blessing, Ohio is in court, fighting to reimpose strict abortion regulations under a law he signed in 2019. But he\u2019s refusing to publicly comment on the numerous stories of suffering it caused during the 11 weeks it was enforced.\nThe law DeWine signed, Senate Bill 23, bans abortion after fetal cardiac activity can be detected. That\u2019s about five or six weeks into a pregnancy \u2014 a point so early that many women and girls don\u2019t yet know they\u2019re pregnant.\nThe law makes no exceptions for rape and incest. It includes some protections for the life and health of the mother, but doctors \u2014 who can be charged with felonies under the law \u2014 say they\u2019re too vague to be workable.\nSB 23 was unenforceable until June 24 because it violated the 1973 U.S.\u00a0 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade. But then the U.S. Supreme Court conservative majority handed down its decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health, overturning Roe and its protections of the right to an abortion.\nAlmost immediately, SB 23 went into effect and just a week later, the Indianapolis Star reported that the law had forced a 10-year-old rape victim from Columbus to travel there for an abortion. The incident made for international news, but DeWine refused to comment on it, other than to say child rape is \u201cgut wrenching.\u201d\nAfter that, more horror stories came in the form of sworn affidavits filed by doctors and other workers in Ohio abortion clinics.\u00a0\nThey included two more minors who had been impregnated by rapists and cancer patients who couldn\u2019t get abortions needed for treatment because their doctors were afraid of being charged with crimes and losing their medical licenses.\u00a0\nOther women were diagnosed with fetal abnormalities so severe that their pregnancies couldn\u2019t be successful. Under SB 23 they had to leave Ohio for abortions if they didn\u2019t want to carry those fetuses for months.\nOn Sept. 14, enforcement of SB 23 was paused when a Cincinnati judge granted a temporary restraining order against it and then later issued a preliminary injunction. The case is expected to make its way to the Ohio Supreme Court, on which DeWine\u2019s son, Pat, sits as a justice.\nIn the face of news of medical and emotional problems caused by SB 23, Gov. DeWine has been steadfastly silent.\u00a0\n\u201cOur office has no new comments on the issue or the ongoing litigation at this time,\u201d Press Secretary Dan Tierney said in an email Monday. He said something similar 10 days earlier.\nAlso, some of the governor\u2019s recent conduct might be seen partly as an attempt to avoid questions about the impact the abortion law he signed is having on some women and girls.\u00a0\nHe has refused to debate his Democratic challenger in the Nov. 8 election, Nan Whaley. Also in recent weeks, DeWine has made few appearances in central Ohio, where he\u2019d be likely to face the Capitol press corps.\nAt the same time, he may be quietly signaling his support for even more sweeping abortion measures.\nAfter the Dobbs decision, state Rep.
