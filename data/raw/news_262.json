Parliament passed the Bill on Tuesday by a margin of 68 to 51 votes. Until now, New Zealand has been the only Western nation to consider abortion illegal. \n\u201cThis Bill totally ignores the fact that there are always at least two human lives involved in every pregnancy,\u201d said the Bishops\u2019 spokesperson in a statement posted on their website.\nA travesty of human rights\nSpeaking on behalf of the Bishops, Cynthia Piper, a professor at the Catholic Leadership Institute, called the Bill \u201ca travesty of human rights\u201d. \u201cTo hold that the fetus is not a legal person ignores the reality that a genetically unique human life has begun which is neither that of the mother or the father. That the law fails to recognize this does not change what is a biological and human fact\u201d, she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28/02/2020\n\n\nNew Zealand Bishops warn proposed bill will remove rights of the unborn\n\n      The Bishops of New Zealand say that a proposed Abortion Legislation Bill will remove the need for any statutory tests for an abortion up to 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, effectively ...\n     \n\n\n\n\n\nFailing many women\nAccording to the statement, the Bishops Conference believes the new abortion law will fail many women. \u201cThis law does nothing to help those women who, for a variety of reasons, choose an abortion because they feel they have no other choice, whether that is because of partner pressure or for economic or social reasons\u201d, reads the statement.\n\u201cNeither does this law do anything to reduce the overall number of abortions, something that a majority of New Zealanders have consistently said they want. It has been rushed through and is ill-considered in so many ways.\u201d\nLacking compassionate amendments\nFurthermore, the Bishops say they are \u201cabsolutely dismayed\u201d that Parliament voted down a host of amendments that would have made the new legislation much more compassionate. According to the Bishops\u2019 spokesperson, \u201cThese included amendments that would have required babies born alive to be cared for like any other child, a ban on sex selection abortions, and a ban on disability discrimination abortions\u201d.\n\nThank you for reading our article.
