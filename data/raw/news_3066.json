The trip was unfortunately canceled for our college community as a result of the Omicron COVID variant. Although we were unable to represent Saint Anselm College at the March for Life among the 150,000 other marchers who stood for life in Washington, we must strive to defend life here on-campus as well. Maintaining a pro-life ethos on-campus is an essential part of our identity as a Catholic, Benedictine institution and must impact our college community beyond the March for Life. So what does it mean to be a pro-life campus?\nThe cornerstone of the pro-life movement is the intrinsic dignity and worth of every human person, from the moment of conception to natural death. Catholics believe that this dignity and worth is endowed by God and that it cannot be taken away. Abortion is of course the most important pro-life issue because it is the direct killing of an infant in the womb. However, being pro-life is not just standing against abortion. Being pro-life is about helping mothers who experience unwanted pregnancies. It is about supporting adoption agencies and schools in lower income communities. It is about giving food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, aid to the sick, clothing to the naked, hospitality to the immigrant, and love to the prisoner. It is about tearing down walls of hatred (racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia) and building bridges to learn about others and their journeys. It is about defending life, even to its last moments in a hospital bed. Our work as a pro-life campus must extend to every aspect of what it means to be alive and loved.\nSaint Anselm College has done amazing work through Campus Ministry, the Intercultural Center, the Meelia Center, the ARC, Hawks for Life, and other departments and organizations around campus. However, our work is not complete. It is just the beginning of a long journey of walking with members of our local communities and defending the sanctity of life at all stages.\u00a0\nFor all who are pro-life at Saint Anselm, this message is for you. Do not be afraid to share your point of view around campus; stand up for life and defend it. If you are studying politics, great, because we certainly need more pro-life politicians. If you want to get a doctorate, great, because we need more great thinkers in the pro-life movement too. If you are studying nursing, awesome, because we need more pro-life thought in the medical field. Think, write, create, learn, and defend life in all its stages, and I can promise you that our world will change for the better.\u00a0\nFinally, I believe that every one of us is pro-life in some way, even if you are pro-choice. Thoughts about abortion will change over time, but very few will change their mind simply from arguments. The best way we can share being pro-life is by our actions, by serving others and loving all of God\u2019s children. The abortion debate will continue for a long time. However, we can continue supporting mothers and victims of sexual violence, educating our community, and showing the immense importance of being pro-life. May God bless all of you and inspire our college community to keep serving, loving, and defending life at all stages.\n \n\n\t\t\tLeave a Comment\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nPollsSorry, there are no polls available at the moment.Polls Archive\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nNavigate Left2021-2022Ruth Conley, grande dame of St. A\u2019s, hits 100; college celebrates her achievements, generosity2021-2022Women\u2019s lacrosse finishes season with high hopes for next year2021-2022What\u2019s wrong with baseballs in 2022?2021-2022Celtics and Bucks series tied 1-1 in the conference semifinals2021-2022Photo spotlight: Class of 2022 pinning2021-2022Yale historian examines grace, free will debate at Anselm lecture2021-2022Students speak their minds at first \u2018Synod on Synodality\u20192021-2022TEDA Visibility Day celebrates campus\u2019s LGBTQ+ community2021-2022Seniors celebrate the end of their time on the Hilltop in style2021-2022Annual sonnet marathon draws crowd to honor Bard\u2019s 458thNavigate Right\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024  \u2022 Advertise \u2022  FLEX WordPress Theme by SNO \u2022 Log in \n\n\n\n\n\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\nAll\nThe Saint Anselm Crier Picks\nReader Picks\nSort: Newest\n\n\n\n Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
