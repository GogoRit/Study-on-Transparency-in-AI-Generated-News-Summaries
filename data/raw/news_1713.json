Debra Moody, R-Covington, filed the bill this week, one of the first pieces of abortion-related legislation to be filed in a legislative session expected to heavily focus on Tennessee's new total abortion ban.Under the law, which was passed in 2019 but did not take effect until last year, all abortions are illegal.Brewing battle:GOP Senator to bring bill adding exceptions to Tennessee's abortion law as new fight brewsWhat would the bill do?HB 90 would prohibit local governments, including counties and metro governments, from spending money to assist \"a person in obtaining an abortion.\"\"This prohibition includes expending funds as part of a health benefit plan or for travel to a state where abortion is legal,\" the bill states.The legislation appears to be a response to a Nashville proposal last year to dedicate some grant funding for navigation assistance for Davidson County residents seeking abortion care outside Tennessee. That proposal was ultimately changed to exclude the travel fund earmark.Though Tennessee law bans abortions in the state, it is not illegal to assist a person seeking an abortion elsewhere.Grant money debate:City turns focus of Planned Parenthood grant from abortion access, to birth controlWho sponsored the bill?Moody if a Republican from Covington in Tipton County in West Tennessee. Her district includes Tipton and parts of Haywood County. She sponsored HB 90 and could not be immediately reached for comment.Moody has sponsored previous anti-abortion legislation over the years, including a new law that prohibits local schools from contracting with agencies that provide abortions or abortion referrals. The law targeted organizations like Planned Parenthood and other health professionals who also provide sexual health and sex education curriculum to students.What role will abortion play in the 2023 General Assembly session?A push for changes to Tennessee's total abortion ban will likely be a big issue in the 2023 session.Though the law was publicly lauded by Republican leaders through the summer, after the U.S. Supreme Court paved the way for Tennessee to finally enforce the 2019 ban, the statute drew widespread backlash from the medical community. Consistent polling also shows Tennesseans support less restrictive abortion policies.Under the law, doctors and health professionals can be prosecuted for any abortion performed in Tennessee, even one undertaken to save the life of the pregnant patient. The law contains a technical legal defense doctors could use in court, but the law as written does not protect doctors from criminal charges.Though hardline anti-abortion advocates support the law, a growing number of conservative Republican lawmakers say they would support adding in true legal exceptions to the law. Two Democrats have already filed bills to do just that, though any likely successful push will come from a Republican-sponsored bill.Republican caucus chair Sen. Ken Yager, R-Kingston, confirmed in December he will sponsor a bill to add clear legal exceptions for doctors.Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
