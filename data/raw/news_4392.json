This goal has targets on reducing maternal mortality, ending preventable deaths of new-borns and children under five years of age and ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare information,\u201d \u00a0she added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Kadaga further pledged her support under the Uganda Woman Parliamentary Association to increase pressure on the responsible parties to fast track implementation of some resolutions passed by the House to strengthen laws on stopping teenage pregnancies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Moses Mulumba, the executive director of the Centre for Health, Human Rights and Development, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the number of challenges related to Covid-19. You remember when the lockdown happened, the most affected people were our mothers. They were locked in their homes including those who were supposed to be delivering. They needed permission of the RDCs to go to health centres. Between you and me, pregnancy and delivery does not need RDC\u2019s permission, as a result, we lost a number of them and this needs to be addressed,\u201d Mr Mulumba said. \n\nAccording to a the United Nations Population Fund report on teenage pregnancy in Uganda during and post Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, Busoga sub-region had the highest reported cases with Luuka District alone reporting more than 600 cases. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, a recent police report indicated that about 4,442 cases of defilement were reported between January and April. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister to continue reading this premium article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, please!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already have an account?\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister to begin your journey to our premium content\nSubscribe for full access to premium content\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already have a Subscription?\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor.
