Americans' views on abortion.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Most Americans believe abortion should be legal to some degree, particularly in the first trimester. The majority also disagree with the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, thus returning discretion over the legality of abortion to the states. At the same time, majorities think second- and third-trimester abortions should generally not be legal.\nBroad Views on the Legality of Abortion\nAccording to Gallup's May 2023 update on Americans' abortion views, 34% believe abortion should be legal \"under any circumstances,\" 51% say it should be legal \u201conly under certain circumstances,\u201d and 13% say it should be illegal in all circumstances.\n###Embeddable###\nA follow-up question asked of those taking the middle position finds 13% want abortion to be legal under most circumstances, while 36% favor it in only a few circumstances. The result is 47% of U.S adults favoring expansive abortion rights (legal in all or most cases) and 49% favoring more restrictive rights (legal in only a few or no cases).\n###Embeddable###\nThe demographic breakdown of these abortion views can be found on Gallup's Legality of Abortion Demographic Tables page.\nSupport for Abortion Rights Varies by Trimester\nWhen asked about the legality of abortion at different stages of pregnancy, about two-thirds of Americans say it should be legal in the first trimester (69%), while support drops to 37% for the second trimester and 22% for the third. Majorities oppose abortion being legal in the second (55%) and third (70%) trimesters.\nIn line with Americans\u2019 broad support for first-trimester abortions, the majority oppose laws that would \u201cban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy.\u201d Also, 63% favor allowing the abortion pill mifepristone to be available in the U.S. as a prescription drug. Read more about their views on the abortion pill here:\n\nMost Americans Favor Availability of Abortion Pill\n\nMost Oppose Dobbs Decision\nThe May 1-24, 2023, survey is Gallup\u2019s first update of Americans\u2019 abortion views since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision in June 2022. However, the May 2022 survey was conducted mostly after a leaked copy of the Dobbs opinion was reported in the news. That survey detected notable changes in abortion views, likely a reaction to the impending decision, as described at the time in this article:\n\n'Pro-Choice' Identification Rises to Near Record High in U.S.\n\nIn line with Americans wanting abortion to be legal to some degree, 61% currently say that overturning Roe v. Wade was a \u201cbad thing,\u201d while 38% call it a \u201cgood thing.\u201d Those views are similar to what Gallup measured in 2022, when asking about Roe hypothetically being overturned, as well as more than 30 years of trends showing opposition to overturning Roe.\nIdentity as \u2018Pro-Choice\u2019 Increases Since Dobbs Leak\nContinuing a shift seen in May 2022, Gallup's 2023 abortion update finds the public continuing to lean more \"pro-choice\" (52%) than \"pro-life\" (44%) in their identification on abortion. This is a change from 2007 to 2021, when no more than 50% of Americans identified as pro-choice.\nThe breakdown of how different subgroups of Americans answer this question is available on Gallup's \"Pro-Choice\" or \"Pro-Life\" Demographic Table page.\nSimilarly, after years when Americans were closely divided on the morality of abortion or leaned against it, a slight majority in 2022 said they consider it morally acceptable. That continues in the 2023 poll, as 52% say abortion is morally acceptable and 41% call it morally wrong.\nU.S. subgroups\u2019 views on this question are provided on Gallup's Morality of Abortion Demographic Table page.\nYearly trends for Americans\u2019 views on the legality of abortion and whether they identify as pro-choice or pro-life are shown by gender, age and party ID on the following
