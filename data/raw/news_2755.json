Doctors there missed the diagnosis of appendicitis, and he was discharged. Two weeks later, he was admitted to a hospital in Connecticut for an appendectomy and sent home within 24 hours. While recovering in Florida a week after that, he was admitted to a hospital for tingling and numbness in his hands and feet but released the following day.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightHis condition worsened, and on Dec. 29, back home in New Haven, where he teaches history at Yale University, he spent 17 hours in the emergency room before a diagnosis was finally made. He now had a baseball-size abscess in his liver, accompanied by bacteria in his bloodstream. He was on the verge of death from overwhelming sepsis. It was probably a complication of a burst appendix.After emergency surgery, instead of gratitude that he was alive, Snyder felt rage. In fact, rage is the leitmotif of his slender new book, \u201cOur Malady: Lessons in Liberty From a Hospital Diary,\u201d with more than 30 occurrences of the word, averaging roughly one \u201crage\u201d every five pages.AdvertisementHis central argument is this: America is supposed to be about freedom, but if our health-care system makes us unhealthy, it is making us unfree. Health care, Snyder writes, is a fundamental human right, as laid out in the Constitution. \u201cIf we accept Jefferson\u2019s famous trio of rights to \u2018life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\u2019 the case for a right to health care is made,\u201d Snyder writes. \u201cIf we have a right to life, we have a right to the means of living. If we have a right to pursue happiness, then we have a right to the care that allows us to do so. .\u2009.\u2009. The right to liberty implies a right to health care. We are not free when we are sick.\u201dSynder\u2019s point about our right to health care \u2014 and the flaws of America\u2019s health-care system \u2014 is not a new one. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of books, articles, studies, blogs and podcasts on the inefficiency and inequity of the U.S. health-care system. Buttressed by data showing equal or better outcomes at far lower costs in countries ranging from New Zealand to Norway, this mountain of literature accuses the American system of suffering from its own set of diseases, whose causes are variously attributed to profit maximization by a variety of villains \u2014 hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, etc. \u2014 and general insensitivity to the needs of patients. Sometimes physicians are put in the villain category; in other cases, they are let off the hook as well-meaning but ineffective cogs in a corporate system in which they have lost all control.Snyder\u2019s Thomas Jefferson-invoking tenet is a gussied-up version of these arguments. Other problems he points to as subsets of the larger one have also been examined and discussed at length. So the reader is given cause to ask: What\u2019s new here?AdvertisementThere\u2019s an initial thrill when reading Snyder\u2019s take on American health care. He\u2019s a brilliant historian whose deep understanding of the origins of fascism and the lessons of the Holocaust made his best-selling book, \u201cOn Tyranny,\u201d published on the heels of the 2016 presidential election, all the more credible. And his critique that the health-care system is organized in a way that maximizes profits for a few, wastes a lot of money and too often leaves patients confused, lacking access and feeling uncared for is correct.Share this articleShareYet the unimpeachable authority that made statements in \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d such as \u201cpost-truth is pre-fascism\u201d feel chillingly real is missing in \u201cOur Malady.\u201d Snyder is clearly an authority in his discipline but not one on health care.His chapter on doctors is a case in point. Here, the author puts his money squarely on the doctors-as-powerless-pawns theory, as opposed to the doctors-as-greedy-and-unfeeling-oafs one. Physicians, he writes, have shifted from being like the all-knowing and ever-caring 1970s TV creation, Dr. Marcus Welby, to being an \u201censerfed\u201d medical workforce. They are mere \u201cprops in advertisements.\u201d The health-care providers who spent only a few minutes with Snyder, or sometimes barely seconds, did so not because they are bad or uncaring doctors, but because they are squeezed by both the huge medical conglomerates for which they work and the insurance companies that call so many of the shots.AdvertisementThe consequences of commercial medicine are most evident in hospitals, Snyder writes, where the human body is a widget. Those charged with taking care of the widget try to humanize it, but the system constrains them. \u201cNo one has an economic incentive to keep you healthy, to get you well, or for that matter to keep you alive,\u201d he writes. The first two assertions might be true. The indictment that the U.S. health-care system overemphasizes sick care over primary care and wellness has been made often, and is largely correct. But is he saying that the systems in which he received care failed him because they lacked a financial incentive to keep him alive? One would want strong support for such a statement.Snyder favors big political points: notions of liberty and freedom and how they connect to the imperative to create a health-care system that is equitable and just. However, in doing so, he mentions only in passing one of the main causes of physician burnout and distraction. Doctors spend half their time on a keyboard, slaves to the electronic health record. As a result of this \u2014 and the accompanying pressures to document extensively for purposes of billing, quality measurement and lawsuit prevention \u2014 physicians aren\u2019t as much stripped of their ability to care for patients as just plain worn down. In other words, while Snyder\u2019s diagnosis of an overworked and frayed physician workforce may be accurate, its underlying causes are more subtle and more numerous than he might have us think.He is right in asserting that the outcomes of patients in many other countries are as good as or better than those in the United States \u2014 all at lower costs. Yet it was in Germany, a country he goes out of his way to praise, that his abdominal pain was first misdiagnosed.AdvertisementStill, there\u2019s always a place for a good rant, and the American health-care system is perfectly rant-worthy, as it edges closer to extracting 20 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, with mediocre outcomes to show for it. As rants from patients done wrong go, Snyder\u2019s is loud and lucid. His litany of the many ways the United States bungled the coronavirus response is eloquent and pointed. And just in case you haven\u2019t heard these things before, his cry of rage is certain to get your attention. After all, it\u2019s hard to refute a claim that Americans deserve a medical system that works. \u201cDoes that sound like a dream?\u201d Snyder asks at the end of \u201cOur Malady.\u201d \u201cLet it be the American one.\u201dOur MaladyLessons in Liberty From a Hospital DiaryBy Timothy SnyderCrown. 179 pp. $12 paperbackShare CommentsSign upTOP STORIESPoliticsReporting and analysis from the Hill and the White HouseAnalysis|Trump\u2019s mixed-up, invented and false account of his first impeachment Analysis|\u2018Bloodbath\u2019 aside, Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric is unambiguousBiden and other Democrats forced to adapt to pro-Palestinian protests backTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
