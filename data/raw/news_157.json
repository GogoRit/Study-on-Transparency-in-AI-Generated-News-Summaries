We\u2019ve been here before. Over the past three years, the Kentucky General Assembly has passed bill after bill that limits \u2014 and even bans \u2014 a person\u2019s ability to get an abortion. And time after time, we\u2019ve gone to court to protect people\u2019s rights to get the care they need.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nAt issue this week is a law that makes it a crime for doctors at Kentucky\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic to perform an abortion procedure that is the standard of care. In reality, the law is nothing more than a backdoor abortion ban: It would bar the only procedure available in the state after about 15 weeks of pregnancy. \nFollowing a trial last year, a federal district court blocked the law, finding that it imposed \u201ca substantial obstacle to a woman\u2019s right to an abortion\u201d\u2014as other courts around the country similarly found. \u00a0But the Commonwealth of Kentucky appealed, and we are arguing the appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit today.\nThe commonwealth\u2019s opposition to this type of procedure is blatantly political, not medical. Leading medical experts such as the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose these bans, saying they interfere with a doctor\u2019s ability to provide the best possible care for their patient. \nThis restriction is part of a national and statewide strategy to push abortion out of reach. Since Jan. 2011, state lawmakers around the country have enacted more than 400 new restrictions on abortion that force patients to delay care, shut down clinics, and make abortion care unaffordable. \nBecause of regulations like these, today Kentucky has only one clinic left in the entire state. And the state is trying to force that last clinic to close its doors, leaving Kentuckians with no abortion provider at all. It\u2019s only because we went with the clinic, EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center, to get a court order that the doors are still open; this case is on appeal.\u00a0 \nKentucky politicians have passed yet more attempts to block abortion access: a flat-out ban on abortion from the earliest weeks of pregnancy, and a ban based on the patient\u2019s reason for deciding to have an abortion. The ACLU and the clinic went to court, and those laws are all blocked. \nKentucky politicians are determined\u00a0to\u00a0stop people who have decided to have an abortion from getting one. But we won\u2019t turn from this fight. We will continue this battle so Kentuckians can get the care they need, and the right to decide what happens to their bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About the Issues on This Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Abortion                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Abortion Clinic Regulations                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Reproductive Freedom                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            State Abortion Legislation                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nIn Alabama, Embryos Are People and It Won't Stop There\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nACLU Calls Out Junk Science at the Heart of the Supreme Court Medication Abortion Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nBusy Philipps Is Fed up With Abortion Bans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nBusy Philipps Named as ACLU Artist Ambassador for Reproductive Freedom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
