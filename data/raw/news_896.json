They came home with an imprint of her tiny feet that were no bigger than Kelly\u2019s wedding ring. (Courtesy of Kelly Omu)\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Cilley Foisy plans to tell House lawmakers Thursday about the death of her daughter Kayla, who would have turned 16 in December. When the story becomes almost impossible to tell, Foisy reminds herself she\u2019s telling it for women who today don\u2019t have the options she had when they learn late in pregnancy their baby will not survive outside the womb.\nThat news came at 21 weeks for Foisy and her husband, Ryan.\u00a0\nTheir daughter had no brain, and her heart was missing a chamber. Death after delivery was certain, their doctor told them. Foisy and her husband needed time to absorb the news, consider options, talk with family, and do follow-up testing.\u00a0\nBy the time they got in with a doctor, Foisy was just over 22 weeks pregnant. The couple chose a medical abortion. Today, a delay of just days would make that choice illegal under the state\u2019s new 24-week abortion ban because it has no exceptions for a fatal fetal diagnosis (nor rape and incest). And a doctor who did it could be imprisoned for up to seven years and fined between $10,000 and $100,000.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is just not something that people do because they just say, \u2018Oh, you know what, maybe I should have an abortion,\u2019\u201d Foisy said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s such an impossible decision.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cIt is wrong to judge someone for making the choice to let their baby go. I\u2019m choosing to let my child free from a life that doesn\u2019t exist outside. I don\u2019t think of it as me choosing to kill Kayla. I think of it as me choosing to let her go.\u201d\u00a0\nLast week the Senate rejected legislation that would have repealed the ban and a separate amendment that would have left it in place but added an exception for a fatal fetal diagnosis like Foisy\u2019s. The 11-13 vote against the latter failed along party lines save for the support of Sen. Erin Hennessey, a Littleton Republican.\nThursday, the House Judiciary Committee will take public testimony on House Bill 1673, another attempt to repeal the abortion ban, as well as a bill and constitutional amendment that would prohibit the state from restricting access to abortion (House Bill 1674 and CACR 18).\nDoctors have testified that very few abortions are performed after 24 weeks, and those that are are done under the most dire circumstances, such as protecting a mother\u2019s life, removing a dead fetus, or allowing a family to end a pregnancy that will result in a still birth or a baby that will soon die. (The ban allows an exception only for the mother\u2019s life.)\nWomen who have been faced with those difficult late-in-pregnancy decisions have also begun telling their stories in hopes of repealing the new law. They are stories of death and love.\u00a0\nKelly Omu and her husband of Jaffrey haven\u2019t taken down the butterfly mobile they hung for their daughter, Mariposa, whom they lost in January. They treasure the imprint of their baby\u2019s tiny feet.\nThe couple terminated their pregnancy in January at 18 weeks after an ultrasound showed a large cyst developing at the base of their daughter\u2019s brain. They wouldn\u2019t have known for weeks had Omu not hemorrhaged and required an early ultrasound in the emergency room. The image showed an unusual thickness on the baby\u2019s neck, sometimes an indication of Down syndrome.\u00a0\nThis was the couple\u2019s first pregnancy. Abortion wasn\u2019t an option.\n\u201cWe talked about it and decided we\u2019ll love this baby no matter what as long as there\u2019s quality of life,\u201d Omu said.\u00a0\nThe couple was told to return in two weeks for genetic testing. When testing indicated no problems with the baby, Omu followed up two weeks later with another ultrasound. The tumor had grown three times larger.\u00a0\nSixteen weeks into the pregnancy, Omu got an appointment with a fetal maternal medicine specialist at Elliot Hospital. The growing cyst was interfering with the development of the baby\u2019s lungs and brain. The doctor told Omu and her husband the prognosis for delivering a viable baby was not good but said they could wait two more weeks, enough time to get a better image of the baby\u2019s heart and an understanding of the cause.\n\u201cMy husband asked, \u2018If we find out the reason behind this, is any of it reversible? Even if the swelling stopped today, would this fetus make it,\u2019\u201d Omu said. \u201cAnd the doctor went, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d The couple took the weekend to consider the diagnosis and do their own research. It took two weeks to get an appointment with an abortion provider in Boston, one of two places that provided abortions after week 15. The couple didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the other option, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, because the hospital was treating so many COVID-19 patients.\nThe day before the procedure, Omu testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in favor of Senate Bill 399, which sought to repeal the ban.\nThose opposed to repealing or scaling back the ban quoted scripture, spoke of the \u201cbarbarism\u201d of abortion, the rights of an unborn baby, choosing adoption over abortion, and the potential for errors in a fatal fetal diagnosis.\nOmu offered a different perspective.\n\u201cI am 18 weeks now. Having to mourn this pregnancy loss is hard enough but having to navigate all these crazy hoops is too much,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if I had found out at 24 weeks? How much more difficult would this have been for me and my family. The last thing we should have to do is let the government in the exam room with us.\u201d\nOmu continued.\u00a0 \u201cIf you have the choice to say that abortion is bad, don\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I should also have the choice to say my body can\u2019t go through with the pregnancy.\u201d\nIn a 3-2 party line vote, the committee amended the bill to remove the repeal and keep just the section clarifying ultrasound requirements before an abortion.\nDr. Oge Young, a retired OB-GYN who practiced in Concord, fought the abortion ban before it was passed as part of the state budget last year. He\u2019s still fighting.\u00a0\n\u201cNot allowing maternal medicine specialists or OB-GYNs to help a couple terminate a baby that is not going to survive is appalling, just appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are babies without brains. No developed left ventricle. Babies that have no kidneys. It\u2019s not like these are questionable diagnoses.\u201d\nYoung said a lot of couples faced with a fatal fetal anomaly choose to terminate the pregnancy early so the baby is born alive rather than die in utero. \u201cThey want to have a live-born so they can hold that baby in their arms. So they can grieve.\u201d\n  Michelle Cilley Foisy of Temple with two of her seven children, Samuel, 6, and Alexander, 4. Her other children include two stepchildren, two teenagers, and Kayla. (Courtesy of Michelle Cilley Foisy)\nThat was the choice Foisy and her husband made. They held Kayla, who had already passed, for several hours and had her baptized.\u00a0\n\u201cShe was 12 inches long and weighed 14 ounces,\u201d Foisy said. \u201cHer fingers and toes were perfect. Her little feet and hands are imprinted and hanging on my wall to look at every day. It was the hardest day of my life leaving her behind when I left the hospital the next day.\u201d\nFoisy now has four other children and two stepchildren with her now-husband, Sean, and counts Kayla as her seventh.\nThey celebrate Kayla\u2019s birthday each year and keep a flower garden in her memory.\u00a0\n\u201cNot one day goes by that she isn\u2019t thought about. She\u2019s a huge part of our family,\u201d Foisy said. \u201cAll of our kids know that Kayla is our angel and we talk about her all the time.\u201d\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice a Monadnock-area mother who terminated her pregnancy at 27 weeks could make.\nThe woman, who asked not to be named for fear of judgment and backlash, became pregnant in her 20s while studying abroad. She had the standard ultrasound when she returned, about 24 weeks into her pregnancy. Concerned about gray matter in her son Andres\u2019 brain, intestines, and abdomen, her doctor referred her to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center for more testing.\nMultiple tests and medical appointments followed. Doctors tested her blood repeatedly and tried to draw her son\u2019s blood from the umbilical cord, a painful procedure.\nThe results led to a heartbreaking diagnosis and prognosis. Cytomegalovirus, a common virus passed from mother to baby, was filling his body with blood and stunting his growth and brain development.\u00a0 She was told there was likely no chance her son would survive the pregnancy, and, if he did, make it through labor. If he somehow lived through both, he would have no brain function or quality of life.\nShe had to travel to a clinic in California because it was the only place performing abortions at that stage of pregnancy.\nThe woman delivered her son following a three-day termination procedure. He was not only not alive, she was unable to hold him because the medical team said his body was in no condition to be handled. She left California with a picture of him and imprints of his feet and hands.\nShe canceled her baby shower and told her college she\u2019d no longer qualify for family housing. She said she has told fewer than 10 people her story. She\u2019s sharing it now because the debate about access to abortion has angered her.\n\u201cThe way in which they talk about it is as if it\u2019s just a woman who decided at 30 weeks along that she wants to kill a child,\u201d she said. \u201cIt bothers me a lot because (they) clearly don\u2019t know what type of situations are occurring.\u201d\nHer son would be 22 next month. She and his two siblings will wish him happy birthday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a day that goes by, still, after 22 years, that I don\u2019t think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s my first child.\u201d\nAfter sharing her wedding photo with the Bulletin, Kelly Omu asked that we remove the photo and not identify her husband by name for reasons related\u00a0to his work.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\u2018It\u2019s such an impossible decision\u2019: Fatal fetal diagnoses and the state\u2019s abortion ban\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin February 10, 2022\n\u2018It\u2019s such an impossible decision\u2019: Fatal fetal diagnoses and the state\u2019s abortion ban\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin February 10, 2022\n Michelle Cilley Foisy plans to tell House lawmakers Thursday about the death of her daughter Kayla, who would have turned 16 in December.
