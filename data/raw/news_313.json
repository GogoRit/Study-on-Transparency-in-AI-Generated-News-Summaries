Mike Jones, R-Andalusia, blocked a floor vote Wednesday on a bill that would allow voters to decide on a 12-mill property tax increase to provide added funding for Montgomery Public Schools, according to State House staff and Reps. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery and Reed Ingram, R-Pike Road.\u00a0\u201cI have not spoken to him about delaying a bill, have not spoken with him about doing away with the bill,\u201d said Ingram, who threatened to stop the bill but came to an agreement with Hatcher on Tuesday night to allow it to move forward.\u00a0The rules of the chamber allow any member to file a challenge to a local bill, but it is unusual for a representative from one region to challenge a local bill in another. Jones said in a statement late Wednesday afternoon that he had lifted the challenge after speaking with Hatcher.\u00a0\u201cNearly all bills like this are in the form of a constitutional amendment and I wanted to make sure it could accomplish its purpose without it,\u201d the representative said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cThere were also two committee amendments that materially changed the legislation from what was advertised.\u00a0 It\u2019s possible those changes are substantial enough that could result in a future legal challenge.\u201dBut the unusual action led to criticism and suggestions -- denied by Jones -- that the delay was due to politics. The Montgomery County branch of the Alabama Farmers Federation, a group with enormous sway among Republicans, opposes the referendum.\u00a0\"The fact that he, the Rules Committee chair from Andalusia contested the bill in the first place is highly suspect,\" Hatcher wrote Wednesday evening. \"All of my Democratic colleagues agree.\"Hatcher said he hoped to have the bill on the floor on Thursday.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had some very, very challenging days getting to this point in this process,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had challenging days. When we speak about good fights, this is for children of Montgomery County \u2026 this is a need that must be addressed, period.\u201dMontgomery Public Schools get 10 mills in local property tax revenue, the minimum allowed under state law. 3.5 mills come from the county, while 6.5 mills come from a system-wide assessment. Per-pupil funding in Montgomery lags other large districts in the state, contributing to the poor performance of many public schools in Montgomery.Under the referendum, voters would decide whether to add 12 mills to the systemwide assessment. For a house at the median level of assessment in Montgomery County ($127,500), taxes would go up about $13 a month. Pike Road, which has its own separate school district and tax structure, would not be affected.Montgomery County Board of Education members say the new tax would raise about $33 million, which would go toward increasing teachers and staff, improving school buildings, and investing in technology.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to a chance to allow the people to consider a property tax increase to fund our public schools,\u201d Montgomery County Board of Education President Clare Weil said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cEveryone understands that the future of Montgomery is directly tied to the success of our public schools.\u201dThe Montgomery County delegation approved the bill on a 4-3 vote on Tuesday, but Ingram said he would block the measure from coming to a vote on the House floor. Ingram proposed pushing the election into 2021, arguing that the current economic climate did not justify a tax increase.\u00a0Though the bill does not set a specific date for the referendum, Democrats on the committee said the agreement had been to put the proposal on the November ballot, when high turnout is expected. A special election is likely to reduce the chances of the measure passing. Ingram\u2019s amendment did not pass.More: Pike Road rep wants to push Montgomery property tax vote to next yearIngram and Hatcher said they spoke late on Tuesday and agreed to an amendment Hatcher suggested at the Tuesday committee meeting. That change would delay the collection of the new revenues until 2022 without delaying the election. Ingram said he would not vote for the bill, but would not prevent it from coming to a vote.\u00a0There may be other obstacles to overcome, including the opposition of the Montgomery County Farmers Federation.\u00a0\u201cThe Montgomery County Farmers Federation is opposed to this property tax increase, and we are helping communicate that position to members of the legislature,\u201d said Jeff Helms, a spokesman for the Farmers Federation, on Wednesday.\u00a0Hatcher said Wednesday he was trying to secure votes. Should the bill pass the House, its prospects in the Senate are not clear. Sen. David Burkette, D-Montgomery, strongly supports the measure. A message seeking comment was left with Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, on Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0Contact Brian Lyman at blyman@gannett.com or 334-240-0185.
