ATLANTA - A judge overturned Georgia's ban on abortion starting around six weeks into a pregnancy, ruling Tuesday that it violated the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court precedent when it was enacted.\u00a0 Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney's ruling applies statewide. The ban had been in effect since July.\u00a0   What is Georgia's Heartbeat Law? It prohibited most abortions once a \"detectable human heartbeat\" is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia were effectively banned at a point before many women knew they were pregnant.\u00a0     Fulton County judge overturns Georgia's six-week abortion ban A Fulton County judge overturned the Georgia\u2019s so-called heartbeat law that bans abortion before most women know they're pregnant. Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney called the law \"unconstitutional.\" Kara Richardson, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, said in an email that the office intends to pursue an \"immediate appeal.\"\u00a0 McBurney's ruling came in a lawsuit that sought to strike down the ban on multiple grounds, including that it violates the Georgia Constitution's right to privacy and liberty by forcing pregnancy and childbirth on women in the state. The lawsuit filed by doctors and advocacy groups in July also argued that Georgia's abortion ban was invalid because it violated the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court precedent when it was enacted. McBurney agreed with that argument in his decision. STATE BY STATE: ABORTION LAWS ACROSS U.S.    Lawsuit challenged Georgia's so-called Heartbeat Law A Fulton County judge heard arguments in a lawsuit challenging Georgia\u2019s Heartbeat Abortion Law. The law bans most abortions after a heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of pregnancy. The suit was filed shortly after the law went into effect this summer. Those who filed the suit say it never should have happened because the law was not constitutional at the time state lawmakers approved it. Heartbeat Law blocked Georgia's law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but had been blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Georgia to begin enforcing its abortion law just over three weeks after the high court's decision in June.\u00a0 McBurney wrote in his ruling that when the law was enacted, \"everywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments -- federal, state, or local -- to ban abortions before viability.\" He wrote that the state's law \"did not become the law of Georgia when it was enacted, and it is not the law of Georgia now.\"\u00a0 The state has argued that the Roe decision itself was wrong and the Supreme Court ruling wiped it out of existence.\u00a0 McBurney did leave the door open for the state Legislature to revisit the ban. Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the prohibition on abortions provided for in the 2019 law \"may someday become the law of Georgia,\" he wrote. But, he wrote, that can happen only after the General Assembly \"determines in the sharp glare of public attention that will undoubtedly and properly attend such an important and consequential debate whether the rights of unborn children justify such a restriction on women's right to bodily autonomy and privacy.\"\u00a0     \n      Latest News\n            Gwinnett PD need help to solve murder of young mother at house party in December 2023         Man shot while asking for money at Chamblee gas station dies, suspect identified         Ex-Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill released from federal prison early         Atlanta Girls' School announces closure at end of academic year         Georgia couple accused of child neglect after being found 'heavily intoxicated,' asleep on Daytona Beach    BREAKING NEWS Breaking news delivered fast        By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
