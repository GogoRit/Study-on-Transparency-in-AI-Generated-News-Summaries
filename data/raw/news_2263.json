That is a striking statement about where the Democratic Party stands on abortion in 2020.As I previously wrote, Buttigieg is not just a moderate. He is a moderate running a campaign that is so moderately steeped in moderatism that he is driving many liberal Democrats, particularly supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, to irrational hatred.You might expect such a candidate to have staked out some sort of middle ground on abortion. Buttigieg has not \u2060\u2014 and his position reveals why many people who are otherwise open to voting for Democrats find the party so hostile to their values that they are sticking\u00a0with President Donald Trump despite many reservations.Consider an exchange in which Kristen Day, the president of Democrats for Life, asked Buttigieg a fascinating question about abortion during a Jan. 26 Fox News town hall.\u201cI am a proud pro-life Democrat,\u201d Day told Buttigieg. \u201cDo you want the support of pro-life Democratic voters?\u201dButtigieg essentialy replied that, yes, he wants Day\u2019s vote, but does not intend to make any policy accommodations for her viewpoint on abortion.\u201cI respect where you\u2019re coming from and I hope to earn your vote, but I\u2019m not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI am pro-choice. And I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision.\u201dThat is, of course, the Democratic position on abortion. But, until recently, Democrats at least tipped their hat to the idea that, aside from legality, reducing the number of abortions is generally a good goal. Buttigieg\u00a0offered no such rhetorical concession.Sarah Pulliam Bailey of The Washington Post wrote a smart analysis of Buttigieg\u2019s response to Day\u2019s question, while also explaining how Democrats have moved well left since former president Bill Clinton said he wanted to make abortion \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d \u2014 and perhaps even since 2018 when Indiana had a pro-life Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly.More from Briggs:Pete Buttigieg is an elitist. He should embrace it.Antiabortion Democrats, she writes, have become politically homeless and, as a result, less enthusiastic supporters of the party.That is one problem for Democrats. A more significant problem is that many Republicans who are fed up with the corruption and mismanagement that have defined the Trump administration are nonetheless prepared to vote for Trump again because they are satisfied that he has fulfilled his promise to chip away at abortion, most notably through Supreme Court appointments.Democrats tend to be perplexed by the dissonance of voters who consider Trump a bad president, yet are likely to vote for him anyway. That misunderstanding comes, at least in part, because the Democratic Party has become too dismissive of conservatives\u2019 sincere beliefs about abortion, as evidenced by Buttigieg\u2019s unwillingness to bend even rhetorically toward the right.Christian ethics professor Andrew T. Walker explained the perspective of frustrated, nose-holding Trump voters in a National Review essay.\u201cTo the average religious conservative (like me), there is no moral ambiguity about abortion. It must be stopped. It\u2019s a morally transcendent issue. The figures bear out the astonishing loss of life sanctioned by American law,\u201d Walker writes. \u201cThat does not make other issues totally irrelevant to religious conservatism. It does evidence a moral urgency that forces religious conservatives to triage their votes.\u201cImmigration policy matters. Police brutality cannot fall on deaf ears. Opioid addiction is ravaging America. Religious conservatives care about these issues and work to find solutions. But to religious conservatives, these concerns do not rise to the level of what seems to be a targeted, lavishly funded assault on human life itself, one proceeding from a worldview that rejects the metaphysical claims of Christianity.\u201d'Today is a moment of truth:' Buttigieg abruptly ends presidential bid 25 images from Pete Buttigieg's 11-month campaign Hashtag 'ThankYouPete' trends on Twitter after Buttigieg suspends bid Limited cash and other observations as Buttigieg courts South CarolinaDemocrats are not going\u00a0to adopt this worldview. They don't have to. But, by leaving no room for it in the party, they risk sacrificing progress on a multitude of issues over their rigidity on one.The view that abortion ends a life is not only defensible in the realm of religious belief, but it is also entirely mainstream. About half of Americans think that abortion is \u201cmorally wrong,\u201d while one-fifth think that it is \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey.On the other hand, a 2019 Pew Research Center survey shows 70 percent of Americans do not think the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling Roe v. Wade should be completely overturned. This cross section of public opinion suggests there should be room for a Clintonesque position that seeks to keep abortion legal while reducing the numbers.Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota who rode a late wave of momentum to a third-place finish behind Buttigieg in New Hampshire, made that point in the past week. She is the only Democratic presidential contender so far to do so, but she did not explain what tolerance to antiabortion views looks like in 2020.\"There are pro-life Democrats, and they are part of our party, and I think we need to build a big tent,\" Klobuchar told ABC.Meanwhile, in Buttigieg\u2019s hometown of South Bend, about 100 people on Wednesday attended a mass burial for 2,411 fetal remains that were found in the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer.It has become easy for Democrats to ignore such demonstrations \u2014 particularly when divisive Republicans stand at the center of them, as Attorney General Curtis Hill did in South Bend. To be sure, disingenuous abortion politics abound. That does not invalidate the earnest values that compel people to show up for a fetal remains funeral on a winter day in Indiana.It is not hard to find people who both oppose abortion and are dissatisfied with Trump\u2019s performance as president. But if Buttigieg\u2019s position on abortion is indicative of the choices conservatives will face in November, it might be hard for Democrats to win any of them.Contact IndyStar metro columnist James Briggs at 317-444-6307.
