Democrats for Life believes in \u201cthe legal protection of unborn life and a comprehensive, bipartisan approach to reducing the number of abortions in America and around the world.\u201d\nLast week, we attended a virtual town hall meeting with pro-life Democratic leaders. Amongst the pro-life leaders included Democratic State Rep. John Deberry of Tennessee\u2019s District 90 from 1995 to 2020, Kristen Day (President of DFL), TJ Burgess (Executive Director for National Men for Life), and Terrisa Bukovinac (Executive Director of Pro-Life San Francisco).\u00a0\nThe town hall began with Rep. DeBerry discussing how one pro-life vote resulted in him being voted out of office. As a result of voting for a heartbeat bill, despite it passing the house 65-21 with bipartisan support, the abortion industry and Tennesse\u2019s Democratic Party sought to remove him from the ballot.\u00a0\nDeBerry and the countless other pro-life democrats across the country are a witness to the pro-abortion extremism of today\u2019s democratic platform. This led Kristen Day, president of DFL, to say, \u201cWe are working on changing the platform. We have a petition and several joint letters coming soon.\u201d According to Democrats for Life, \u201cKristen Day is the Executive Director of Democrats For Life of America and oversees all operations of the Washington, D.C. office.\u201d\nDue to the party\u2019s purging of pro-life candidates, the many pro-life Democrats have diminished over the years. A litmus test over the abortion issue barred Democrats who identified as \u201cpro-life\u201d from running for public office. This serves as a testimony of just how the pro-abortion lobby has taken the Democratic Party hostage.\nDeBerry has since decided to go against the grain because he isn\u2019t going to compromise his values for something that he doesn\u2019t believe in. He\u2019d rather be someone steadfast in his beliefs than one who wavers in order to comply with the party. He believes that the parties don\u2019t have to disagree on every issue and that you should vote based on the validity of the issue, not the party.\nLooking ahead, Democrats for Life of America seeks to expand the party\u2019s commitment to the pro-life cause and remove any roadblocks that candidates like John DeBerry have had to face. With the courageous efforts of pro-life democrats like DeBerry, we can hopefully look forward to a post-roe America within our lifetime.\nAfter attending the town hall meeting and listening to pro-life Democratic leaders, we have confidence the Democratic platform may one day reaffirm it\u2019s support for all human life.\nThis is a guest article by Students for Life leaders Felipe Avila and Teresa Overholser.\n\n Post Views: 1,344\n\nShare this postSFLA Staff\nAbortion DeathReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
