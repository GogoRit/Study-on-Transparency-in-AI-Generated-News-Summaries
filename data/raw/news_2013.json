(Otto Kitsinger for States Newsroom)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Louisiana House committee overwhelmingly rejected two pieces of legislation Tuesday seeking to clarify when an abortion is still legal due to medical complications, in spite of doctors repeatedly complaining over the past year that the current abortion ban is unclear on this matter.\u00a0\nLawmakers in favor of the legislation believe the bills may have been rejected, in part, over a fear they could be amended to carve out additional exceptions to the abortion ban for pregnancies that result from rape and incest. The committee voted down other proposals to allow rape and incest exceptions last week. \n\nHouse Bill 461, sponsored by Rep. Mary DuBuisson, R-Slidell, was supposed to clear up confusion over when legal abortions could be provided to a person who is already losing their pregnancy. \n\n\u201cThe bill will not enhance access to abortion. On the contrary, it will keep our pro-life position in Louisiana,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nDoctors and women have struggled to end unsuccessful pregnancies in Louisiana over the past several months. Current law requires people to carry pregnancies until their own health is threatened, said Ellie Schilling, an attorney who represents abortion rights groups. This results in people having to stay pregnant for weeks or months even after doctors determine a pregnancy will ultimately fail, she said. \n\n\u201cThere is nothing natural about leaving a doctor\u2019s office or a hospital with a dead or dying baby inside of you,\u201d DuBuisson said. \u201cWhat [the bill] will do is prevent a woman from having to carry a dead fetus to term.\u201d \n\nAnti-abortion advocates pushed back on DuBuisson\u2019s characterization of her bill, saying the legislation would legalize elective abortions in the first few months of pregnancy. Lawmakers should question the proposal, given that its backers include abortion rights supporters, they said.    \n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\nRepublicans on the House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice sided with the anti-abortion witnesses and voted down DuBuisson\u2019s on an 8-5 vote.\nThey also rejected House Bill 598, sponsored by Rep.
