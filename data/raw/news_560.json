Terminations are permitted up to 24 weeks when there is a risk to the woman\u2019s physical or mental health.There is no time limit in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or when there has been a diagnosis of a serious physical or mental impairment that would cause a serious disability.Abortions post 24 weeks in those circumstances are extremely rare.During an Assembly debate last year, a majority of MLAs voted in opposition to the particular section of the law that allows late-stage abortions when severe disability has been diagnosed.One high-profile activist involved in the campaign is Heidi Crowter, who has Down\u2019s syndrome.Ms Crowter is also taking a separate legal action against the UK Government against a similar element in the 1967 Abortion Act, which applies in Great Britain.The Bill would not affect the provision within the law that permits abortions up to birth for fatal foetal abnormalities, where babies are not expected to survive outside the womb.Raising a point of order after the Bill was introduced, Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said the Assembly faces an \u201cunusual situation\u201d because Mr Givan had only formally alerted members to the contents of the Bill less than 30 minutes before it was introduced.Ms Bradshaw asked for assurances that MLAs would receive written evidence from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on the Bill before members were asked to scrutinise it.Speaker Alex Maskey said there was \u201cnothing unusual with the procedure\u201d, highlighting that items of Assembly business are often tabled at short notice.Paula Bradshaw asked for assurances that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission would be asked to analyse the contents of the Bill (Brian Lawless/PA)\u201cThis Bill has now had the first stage tabled here this morning. The Bill will be printed and it will go through the normal process through the business committee as an ongoing process by which legislation is always proceeded,\u201d he said.\u201cI will ensure that the legislation will be governed and processed and managed properly in my role as Speaker.\u201dMr Givan\u2019s Bill represents the first legislative attempt since devolution was restored in Northern Ireland to amend the abortion laws introduced by the UK Government.Ahead of introducing the proposed legislative change, the DUP politician said: \u201cThe current law tells those with disabilities that they are worth less than other people, their contribution is less valuable, their lives less important, less full.\u201cIt invites us to view those with disabilities as less deserving of the protection of the law.\u201cThe idea that Down\u2019s syndrome is some huge problem that should be addressed by abortion is chilling. You don\u2019t have to look far to see the full lives those with disabilities lead \u2013 they enrich our communities and families.\u201dBelfast mother Laura Denny, whose son Nathan has Down\u2019s syndrome, is also supporting the law change.Laura Denny, whose son Nathan has Down\u2019s syndrome (JerseyroadPR/PA)Shadow Northern Ireland minister, Labour MP Karin Smyth, said a woman\u2019s right to choose must be upheld.She also expressed concerns around delays in commissioning abortion services in the region following the liberalisation of the laws.\u201cFor women this decision is never taken lightly, nor without careful thought and guidance,\u201d she said.\u201cThe right of women to make an informed choice is fundamental, and guaranteed in law. Those rights must be upheld.\u201cNorthern Ireland had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, which endangered women\u2019s health. A year on, services have still not been commissioned, leaving women and girls at risk. The Secretary of State (Brandon Lewis) must step in and ensure women urgently have access to safe, local services.\u201dKarin Smyth (Chris McAndrew/UK Parliament/PA)If a majority of MLAs support the Bill at its second reading, it will be handed to an Assembly committee to scrutinise the proposed law change.Votes cast in an Assembly debate on the new abortion regulations last year suggest there could be cross-party support for the move.A DUP motion that rejected the new regulations in their entirety, with a particular focus on the provision that permits abortions up to birth in cases of severe disability, passed by 46 votes to 40.While Sinn Fein opposed that motion, the party did table an amendment that also called for the rejection of the non-fatal disability regulation, though without any demand for the broader abortion reforms to be axed. That amendment was defeated by 52 votes to 32.Sinn Fein\u2019s party position is for alignment of abortion laws across the island of Ireland and in the Irish Republic there is no similar provision permitting abortions up to term in cases of serious non-fatal disabilities.Factoring in the three MLAs who supported both the DUP motion and Sinn Fein amendment, that adds up to 75 of Stormont\u2019s 90 MLAs who registered opposition to the section of law that is the subject of Mr Givan\u2019s Bill.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesMotion on extension of EU law to Northern Ireland is defeated at StormontUK News|Just nowJury out in trial of mother accused of murdering toddlerUK News|Just nowMark Drakeford faces his last First Minister\u2019s QuestionsUK News|Just nowVideo shows group trying to stop suspected XL bully during attackUK News|Just nowCouncil tax freeze confirmed as Inverclyde and Argyll and Bute announce U-turnsUK News|Just nowMost popular1Premier Inn sorry after telling mum to breastfeed in cornerNews|9 hours ago2Health vice-president resigns citing \u2018little appetite for change\u2019News|9 hours ago3Aurigny asked if it has enough aircraft to manage networkNews|9 hours ago4Snakes Alive!
