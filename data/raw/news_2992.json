The writing stylebook says to now \u201cuse the modifiers anti-abortion or abortion-rights; don\u2019t use pro-life, pro-choice or pro-abortion unless they are in quotes or proper names. Avoid abortionist, which connotes a person who performs clandestine abortions.\u201d\nScreenshot of new Associated Press Stylebook guidelines on abortion.\nThe Associated Press is the most common stylebook among journalists, used by news outlets on the political left and right, including The Daily Signal. However, the updated abortion guidelines are one set of writing rules The Daily Signal will not be following.\u00a0\nWords have power, and it is no secret that the media sometimes uses the power of words to shift or alter the narrative around an issue or story.\u00a0\nReplacing the term \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-abortion\u201d with \u201cabortion-rights\u201d inaccurately implies that women have a right to end the life of the child growing in their womb. The Declaration of Independence speaks of a right to \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\u201d but neither the Declaration nor the Constitution provides a right to end a pregnancy through elective abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Associated Press Stylebook\u2019s decision to replace the term \u201cpro-life\u201d with \u201canti-abortion\u201d is another attempt from the left to paint the pro-life community in a negative light. The new phrasing is not reflective of the pro-life community that exists today, a community that consists of millions of Americans, more than 3,000 pregnancy care centers, and thousands who give of their time and resources every day to journey with women during and after unplanned pregnancies.\u00a0\nIf news outlets want to represent the pro-life and pro-choice communities accurately, they will be wise to ignore these latest updates from the Associated Press Stylebook.\u00a0\nOn today\u2019s edition of the \u201cProblematic Women\u201d podcast, we discuss further why these updated guidelines from the Associated Press matter. Plus, Elon Musk is airing all of Twitter\u2019s dirty laundry in \u201cThe Twitter Files.\u201d We explain what to expect from Musk in the future. And NASA just took a drive by the moon.
