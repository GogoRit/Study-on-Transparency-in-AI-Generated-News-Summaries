John Sheridan of St. Peter Catholic Church said the parish was not aware of Terry\u2019s visit until contacted Monday morning by The Canton Repository. He declined to make further statements for the article.Terry said he usually provides churches with a pamphlet, which compares Biden to biblical figures who killed babies, after the demonstration begins.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an ambush,\u201d he said.A woman who answered the door of the church office took a pamphlet and told Terry he could call the priest but they can\u2019t tell parishioners it\u2019s a sin to vote for abortion rights candidates.President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden have said they oppose public funding for abortions, but Biden announced last year that he no longer supports the Hyde Amendment \u2014\u00a0which bans federal funding for most abortions.Trump supports overturning Roe v. Wade and letting states determine abortion laws, according to ontheissues.org. He also became the first sitting president to attend the March for Life, an annual event to protest abortion, earlier this year in Washington, D.C.Terry also noted Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d appointments to federal courts and the Supreme Court as well as his \u201cdefunding\u201d of Planned Parenthood.\u201cWhat else could we ask for?\u201d he said.Terry said the goal of his campaign \u2014 other than preventing Biden from becoming president \u2014 is a federal law to outlaw abortion.Reach Kelly at 330-580-8323 or kelly.byer@cantonrep.comOn Twitter: @kbyerREPCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account My Print Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.cantonrep.com.
