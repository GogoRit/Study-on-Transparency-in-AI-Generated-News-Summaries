(Courtesy Don't Screen Us Out via CNA)\n\n\nBishops in Northern Ireland have strongly backed a call by a campaigner with Down syndrome to reject a law permitting abortion up to birth on grounds of disability.\nThe bishops\u00a0spoke out\u00a0ahead of a June 2 debate on the law which was imposed by authorities in Westminster on Northern Ireland.\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly will debate Tuesday whether the practice of late-term abortion in the case of disability imposed by the Westminster parliament should be overturned, in response to an appeal from Heidi Crowter, a 24-year-old woman with Down\u00a0syndrome who advocates for disability rights.\nThe motion up for debate is a proposal to reject \u201cthe imposition of abortion legislation which extends to all non-fatal disabilities, including Down\u2019s syndrome.\u201d\n\u201cAs a person who has Down\u2019s syndrome, I find this proposal for Northern Ireland deeply hurtful and offensive,\u201d Crowter wrote in a letter to the legislative assembly.\n\u201cPlease vote for this motion so the Northern Ireland Assembly can tell the world that you will not accept a law being passed that seeks to prevent people like me being born,\u201d she stated, according to the Belfast Telegraph.\nThe Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020, which came into force March 31, allow elective abortions up to 12 weeks of pregnancy; abortions up to 24 weeks in cases of risk to the mother\u2019s physical or mental health; and abortion without time limit in cases of severe fetal impairment or fetal abnormality.\nSince the imposition of the law more than 100 abortions took place in Northern Ireland in seven weeks. The Belfast Telegraph reported June 2 that Health Minister Robin Swann cited 129 abortions in Northern Ireland between March 31 and May 22.\nThe bishops of Northern Ireland urged legislators to reject the Westminister abortion legislation, which they said\u00a0was imposed \u201cwithout the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\u201cPoliticians and all people of good will, who recognize the extreme nature of the Regulations, should not meekly acquiesce to their promulgation,\u201d the bishops wrote in a letter to legislators June 1.\n\u201cWhile we regard this to be an unjust law, which was imposed without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, we are morally obliged, wherever possible, to do all we can to save the lives of unborn children, which could be lost through abortion, and to protect mothers from the pressures they might experience at the time of an unplanned pregnancy,\u201d the bishops said.\nArchbishop Eamon Martin of Armagh spoke out on social media ahead of the assembly debate.\n\u201cWestminster abortion regulations are unjust, extreme and inhumane -- much further than 1967 Abortion Act -- imagine taking the life of an unborn child because the child has a cleft lip!\u201d Martin wrote on Twitter June 1.\n\n1. Critical motion Tues on Abortion in NI Assembly. Contact your MLA\u2019s to support the motion. Westminster abortion regulations are unjust, extreme and inhumane - much further than 1967 Abortion Act - imagine taking the life of an unborn child because the child has a cleft lip! pic.twitter.com/K8RBws7SWv\n\u2014 Eamon Martin (@ArchbishopEamon) June 1, 2020\n\n\u201cWestminster abortion regulations offer no gestational limits for children with disabilities. Let\u2019s take a stand for the equal right to life and care of all children, before and after birth, as well as their mothers. Contact your MLA\u2019s. Ask them to defend life!\u201d the archbishop wrote in another post.\nIn their letter, the Catholic bishops of Northern Ireland urged politicians to \u201ctake steps to formulate new Regulations that will reflect more fully the will of a significant majority of the people in this jurisdiction to protect the lives of mothers and their unborn children.\u201d\nThe largest party in the assembly, by one member, is the Democratic Unionist Party, which has emerged as a leading pro-life party in the region. However, the unionist party has had links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, an ecclesial community particularly hostile to the Catholic Church.\nThe next largest party is Sinn F\u00e9in, an Irish nationalist party that has historically enjoyed significant Catholic support. It supported the liberalization of abortion laws in Northern Ireland imposed by the Westminster parliament, and its party members endorsed the repeal of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Eighth Amendment, which protected unborn children.\nThe remaining parties in the assembly allow their MLAs a conscience vote on abortion.\nPreviously, abortion was legally permitted in the region only if the mother\u2019s life was at risk or if there was risk of long-term or permanent, serious damage to her mental or physical health.\nNorthern Irish women had been able to procure free National Health Service abortions in England, Scotland, and Wales since November 2017. They are allowed to travel to the rest of the UK to procure abortions during the coronavirus outbreak.\nThough in England, Wales, and Scotland\u00a0two medical professionals must certify in all cases that there were lawful grounds for abortion, in Northern Ireland under the new regulations only one medical professional is needed for certification in elective abortions or in cases of immediate necessity where there is a risk to the life of the mother.\nConscientious objection is allowed for direct participation in abortion, but not for ancillary, administrative, or managerial tasks associated with the procedure.\n\u201cBuffer zones\u201d have been set up around locations where abortions are procured, barring protest in the locations\u2019 immediate vicinity.\nNorthern Ireland rejected the Abortion Act 1967, which legalized abortion in England, Wales, and Scotland; and bills to legalize abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormality, rape, or incest failed in the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2016.\nArchbishop Martin, Bishop Noel Treanor of Down and Connor, Bishop Donal McKeown of Derry, Bishop Larry Duffy of Clogher, and Auxiliary Bishop Michael Router of Armagh all signed the letter.\nThe Catholic bishops of Northern Ireland recalled their \u201cresponsibility to do all we can to promote a culture of care and respect for life in our society.\u201d\n\u201cThis includes a responsibility to inform the conscience of all members of the Catholic Church and people of good will regarding the fundamental moral values at stake in the issue of abortion,\u201d they said.\n\n\n\nArticle Tags\nAbortion, Down syndrome, Northern Ireland, Pro-Life\n \n\n\n\n\nCourtney Mares\n                        Catholic News Agency                    \n\n\n\nCourtney Mares\n                        Catholic News Agency                    \n\nCourtney Mares is a Rome Correspondent for Catholic News Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst religious order created to provide Montessori-style education\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nKate Qui\u00f1ones \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   4  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBehind the feud between Texas archdiocese and a defiant ministry group\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPeter Pinedo \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   3  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaint of the day: Joseph\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAngelus Staff \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   < 1  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee All\n\nRELATED ARTICLESCourt to hear challenge to UK\u2019s Down syndrome abortion law in July  by Catholic News Agency  May 4, 2021 Court rejects challenge to UK\u2019s Down syndrome abortion law  by Catholic News Agency  September 23, 2021 Tennessee Down syndrome abortion ban back in effect while legal challenges continue  by Jonah McKeown  February 3, 2022 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your day with Always Forward!\nA daily email newsletter to help you better understand the Church and the world.\n\nEnter your email address here\n\n*\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy.\n\n Sign Up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbout\nSubscribe\nAlways Forward Newsletter\nContact\nDonate\nArchdiocese of Los Angeles\nAdvertise\nRenew\nArchbishop Jos\u00e9 H.
