The ruling from Idaho\u2019s high court in a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood means the new law won\u2019t go into effect as planned on April 22.\nThe state Supreme Court instructed both sides to file further briefs as it considers the case before its ultimate decision.\nRepublican Gov. Brad Little last month signed into law the measure that would\u2019ve allowed people who would have been family members to sue doctors who perform abortions after cardiac activity is detected in embryos. But when he signed it, Little said he had concerns about whether the law was constitutional.\nREAD MORE: Health care provider sues over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban\nThe law would allow the father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles of a \u201cpreborn child\u201d to each sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortion. Rapists can\u2019t file a lawsuit under the law, but a rapist\u2019s relatives could.\nPlanned Parenthood of Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky had called the law unconstitutional.\n\u201cWe are thrilled that abortion will remain accessible in the state for now, but our fight to ensure that Idahoans can fully access their constitutionally protected rights is far from over,\u201d Rebecca Gibron, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, said in a statement after Friday\u2019s court action.\nThe decision comes amid a nationwide fight over access to abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority signaled willingness in a Mississippi case to severely erode or even strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide until a baby can survive outside the womb. Numerous states with Republican majorities are poised to follow the strictest interpretation of the ruling.\nIf Roe is overturned, 26 states are certain or likely to quickly ban abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that supports abortion rights.\nREAD MORE: Oklahoma state House approves bill to make performing an abortion illegal\nThe Idaho law was modeled after a Texas law that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed to remain in place until a court challenge is decided on its merits. The Texas law allows people to enforce the law in place of state officials who normally would do so. The Texas law authorizes lawsuits against clinics, doctors and anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion that is not permitted by law.\nBackers had said the law is Idaho\u2019s best opportunity to severely restrict abortions in the state after years of trying.\nWhen he signed the bill, Idaho\u2019s governor noted his concerns with the legislation.\n\u201cDeputizing private citizens to levy hefty monetary fines on the exercise of a disfavored but judicially recognized constitutional right for the purpose of evading court review undermines our constitutional form of government and weakens our collective liberties,\u201d Little wrote.\nHe said that he worried some states might use the same approach to limit gun rights.\nThe Attorney General\u2019s office, representing the state, had said the case should start in the state\u2019s district courts, working its way up to the high court.\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s attorneys balked.\n\u201cIn the State\u2019s apparent view, the more unconstitutional the law, the less appropriate for extraordinary relief. That gets things backwards: The state should not be able to evade this Court\u2019s review by violating multiple provisions of the Idaho Constitution instead of just one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A pro-choice demonstrator holds a sign outside the United States Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2021.
