But the annual event, in its 49th year, was upbeat, a reflection of what some attendees said was confidence that the Supreme Court this year may overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide \u2014 and prompted the creation of the march.\u201cOne day at the Smithsonian there will be a display of the pro-life movement ending abortion,\u201d Melanie Frei, 66, of Tomah, Wis., said as she stood on the Mall between various museums. \u201cWe ended slavery, we ended segregation, and now we\u2019ll end abortion.\u201dSupreme Court denies abortion providers\u2019 request to return Texas case to judge who blocked state\u2019s six-week banKatie Gooding, a 19-year-old sophomore at Liberty University, held a sign that declared her a \u201cpro-life lawyer fighting to practice in a post-Roe nation.\u201dAdvertisementGooding, who is a pre-law student, said she was inspired by the abortion ban passed in Texas, which has outlawed almost all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy since September. \u201cThat case is the reason I\u2019m going into law.\u201dGooding said she had started attending antiabortion protests at age 16 and never imagined that Roe might fall so soon. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful.\u201dThe event for the most part had its usual mild, family-friendly vibe \u2014 a sharp contrast to the angry, confrontational antiabortion activism increasingly on display, including late last year when the Supreme Court heard Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.The case is reviewing the constitutionality of a Mississippi ban on abortion after 15 weeks and could determine the future of Roe. With a 6-to-3 conservative majority, the court has signaled its willingness to weaken or even overturn the 1973 precedent.AdvertisementAt one point during the start of the march, police formed a barrier around about 40 people.The group, which held a banner proclaiming that \u201cStrong families make strong nations,\u201d was the Patriot Front, a white supremacist organization. Its leader, Thomas Ryan Rousseau, led chants of \u201cReclaim America,\u201d and counterprotesters supporting abortion rights yelled at the group to go home.The Patriot Front also joined a March for Life event in Chicago earlier this month and marched on the National Mall last month.Asked Friday about the group\u2019s appearance, a March for Life spokesperson  said in a statement that the \u201cMarch for Life promotes the beauty, dignity, and worth of every human life by working to end the violence of abortion. We condemn any organization that seeks to exclude a person or group of people based on the color of their skin or any other characteristic.\u201dAdvertisementAlso in the crowd during the pre-march rally was a small group from the nativist organization America First.The march takes place each year on or around the anniversary of Roe v Wade\u2019s decision. It also comes as the Supreme Court considers the Mississippi law.The justices initially allowed a Texas law prohibiting abortions after about six weeks to stand while a legal challenge worked its way through the courts. In December, the justices said the case could continue only against Texas licensing officials who oversee nurses, physicians and pharmacists \u2014 while again leaving the law in effect.Both the Mississippi and Texas laws prohibit abortions well before the point of viability \u2014 when a fetus could survive outside the womb, usually about 24 weeks. Roe guaranteed a person\u2019s right to an abortion up to viability.Supreme Court denies abortion providers\u2019 request to return Texas case to judge who blocked state\u2019s six-week banIf Roe is overturned, abortion will become illegal in 12 states, with more than a dozen others likely to ban or significantly restrict the procedure soon after.AdvertisementKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told The Washington Post this week that her group has been readying for this moment.Share this articleShare\u201cRoe being reversed really is only the beginning, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been preparing for,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cHaving this army for this ground game of this fight that will go state by state.\u201dSome protesters on Friday said they were particularly worried about abortion in the form of medication and the potential for abortion pills to be delivered illegally through the mail.In past years, abortion rights groups have largely avoided the March for Life, said Jamie Manson, president of Catholics for Choice. But this year, with Roe vulnerable, Manson said the antiabortion activists \u201cneed to be answered.\u201dThe group Thursday projected abortion rights messages on the side of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in the United States and one of the most prominent Catholic landmarks in Washington. One read: \u201cPro choice Catholics, you are not alone.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cThe people coming to this march are coming in very triumphant and very emboldened, with no regard for how this will affect women, how this will affect the poor, how this will affect people of color,\u201d Manson said. \u201cSo we have to speak back to them this year.\u201dCatholic bishops this week will discuss if Biden qualifies for Communion. It\u2019s the culmination of decades of abortion politics.As usual, the crowd at the March for Life skewed young, with many students from Catholic high schools and colleges wearing their school gear and carrying signs and banners with antiabortion slogans. Catholic clergy are also very visible every year, and speakers usually include religious perspectives in their talks. Evangelical groups in recent years also began attending and holding side events during the week.At an early morning \u201cMass for Life\u201d Friday at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in downtown D.C., a message was read from Pope Francis: \u201cOnly when the sacredness of the human person is respected and their rights recognized can the many forms of social injustice be overcome.\u201dAdvertisementAbortion foes in recent years have aimed to highlight more secular, science-based arguments \u2014 in 2018, the march\u2019s theme was \u201cPro-life is pro-science.\u201d However, the religious aspect of the movement remains very prominent \u201cbecause of the current influence of White evangelicals and Catholics and because the right-to-life movement has also thrown itself into related conflicts about religious liberty in the context of birth control, same-sex marriage, and so on,\u201d abortion movement historian Mary Ziegler said in an email.\u201cWhat is striking is that emphasizing faith \u2014 something that once was used against the antiabortion movement \u2014 is now something many in the movement embrace,\u201d she wrote.The role of religion in the movement has been heightened again by the presence in the White House of President Biden, a Catholic who supports abortion rights. Some bishops have attacked Biden\u2019s argument that his faith leads him to respect others\u2019 choices and consciences, and they say he is a dangerous model of a public Catholic.Longtime U.S. House chaplain on Jan. 6, the dangers of \u2018apocalyptic thinking\u2019 and why there\u2019s room to be pro-choice in CatholicismEmma Gladd, 16, said she doesn\u2019t agree with Biden\u2019s views on abortion.Advertisement\u201cIf he\u2019s Catholic, he should fight for all lives,\u201d said Gladd, who wore a Donald Trump beanie with an American flag design and the former president\u2019s slogan: Keep America Great. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t support a lot of the things that we support.\u201dShe was at the march with others from her school in Augusta, Ga. Being antiabortion is an important part of being Catholic, she said. Students pray about it at school, talk with their friends in their antiabortion club and fundraise to help women with unplanned pregnancies opt against abortion.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see so many other people who are so hopeful,\u201d Gladd said of the big crowd. Her friend, Caroline Jackson, 17, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know you\u2019re not alone.\u201dU.S. abortion access, reproductive rightsTracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat. Abortion and the 2024 election: Voters in a dozen states in 2024 could decide the fate of abortion rights with constitutional amendments on the ballot in a pivotal election year. The Biden administration announced new steps intended to ensure access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortions at hospitals. Here\u2019s what the moves on reproductive health mean for consumers. See where the 2024 presidential candidates stand on abortion bans.Abortion pills: The Supreme Court will decide this term whether to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Oral arguments are likely to be scheduled for the spring, with a decision by the end of June. For now, full access to mifepristone will remain in place and Walgreens and CVS said they will start filling prescriptions for mifepristone in states where it is legally allowed.Share CommentsSign upTOP STORIESD.C. regionLocal news, weather, sports, events, restaurants and moreCapitals close trip with win over Flames, move back into playoff spotWizards lose Bilal Coulibaly (fractured wrist) for the rest of seasonThe schedule and the injury report do Wizards no favors vs. CelticsbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
