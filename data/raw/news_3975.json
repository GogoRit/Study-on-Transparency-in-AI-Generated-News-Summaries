Other messages are scrawled on nearby walls. And then there are the pro-life advocates themselves who are waiting for them at the entrance.\u201cAre you going in to kill your child?\u201d asks Mercedes, rosary in hand, as a woman walks toward the clinic. She grabs her arm and gives her a brochure, but before she lets go, she whispers one last message in her ear: \u201cMurderer!\u201d Mercedes is a volunteer for one of the organizations that post activists outside the clinic in a bid to deter women from terminating their pregnancies.Sonia Lamas, a member of staff at Dator and spokesperson for the Association of Accredited Abortion Clinics (ACAI), says she is frustrated by the situation. \u201cWe have been reporting the harassment for months, but the authorities don\u2019t even come to clean up the graffiti,\u201d she says.She considers the coercion to be a direct attack on women and their reproductive rights, which are recognized by the public healthcare system. \u201cThe women who come here have been referred by the public health service,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Madrid government should look after its patients.\u201dWe have been reporting the harassment for months, but the authorities don\u2019t even come to clean up the graffitiSonia Lamas, Dator clinicBesides the street harassment, the pressure groups work on various other levels: legal, administrative and public. In ACAI\u2019s last report, issued in 2018, the association interviewed 300 women who had experienced pressure from pro-life groups. Hazte O\u00edr, Derecho a Vivir, M\u00e1s Futuro and Asociaci\u00f3n Sifra were names that came up again and again. These organizations pour much of their time and resources into trying to prevent voluntary pregnancy terminations. In the report, 89% of women said they had been subject to some form of harassment by these groups, while 67% said they had felt threatened during the medical procedure. However, 100% went through with the termination.Activists with these pro-life organizations gather outside abortion clinics in the mornings and wait for women to arrive. \u201cOur goal is to help people who are dealing with an unexpected pregnancy and women who have already had an abortion and are now living with the consequences,\u201d says a spokesperson for Sifra. This group, which also delivers talks about the ethics of assisted reproduction techniques, offers women two alternatives: motherhood or adoption.Each woman who comes to the Dator clinic copes with the harassment in her own way. But according to the professionals, some patients are so upset by the encounter that by the time they get through the door their condition makes any medical procedure inadvisable, which entails postponing the termination and prolonging the agony of what is always a difficult and complex decision.A doctor and Vox lawmaker, Gador Joya, has been offering ultrasounds outside the Dator clinic in Madrid.Two years ago, a woman who is using the name Mar\u00eda for the purposes of this article made the decision to terminate her pregnancy. On the day of the procedure, a group of men approached her at the entrance to the clinic. \u201cI was very nervous when I arrived because having an abortion isn\u2019t easy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the worst thing was definitely the harassment. Several men lectured me, showed me pictures and told me that women die inside. I hope these people realize the damage they do to us by being there,\u201d she says.Around 8,000 women have been subject to harassment in Spain since the 2010 abortion law was passed, according to the Pro-Rights platform, an umbrella group for 62 organizations across Spain.Handing out leaflets is the most common strategy for exercising pressure, complete with pictures of fetuses and phrases such as \u201cYou are all alone, and your abortion will be for life,\u201d and \u201cAbortion can cause suicide and cancer.\u201dThe pro-life activists always follow the same strategy. Once they have the woman\u2019s attention, they ask how far into her pregnancy she is with the aim of convincing her to accompany them to one of their offices. Once there, she is shown ultrasounds to persuade her to have the baby, regardless of whether there are fetal deformities, risks to her health or the circumstances of conception.Pro-choice groups have been calling for this type of harassment to be incorporated into Spain\u2019s criminal codeA few months ago a doctor named G\u00e1dor Joya, who also sits in the Madrid regional assembly representing the far-right party Vox, made headlines after parking a van outside abortion clinics and offering free ultrasounds because, as the party claims, \u201cwomen don\u2019t know what they are carrying inside them.\u201dThere are other less aggressive but more effective strategies. The most common is to invite the pregnant woman to breakfast, as the medical procedure cannot be performed if the patient has drunk or eaten anything. Consequently, they have to face the ordeal of returning another day.According to ACAI, in Madrid this type of harassment happens mainly outside the Dator clinic, which was the first private center to be allowed to carry out abortions in Spain. Pro-life groups gather here almost daily, while at the Isadora clinic and the El Bosque medical center, it is a weekly occurrence, usually on Saturdays.The harassment is not confined to the patients, either. Lamas, 47, has been working at Dator for five years and says that once an activist followed her and bombarded her with questions, such as \u201cHow much do you make?\u201d and \u201cAre you here for the money?\u201d He also claimed that \u201cI can help you find another job.\u201dFor years, ACAI has been calling for this type of harassment to be incorporated into Spain\u2019s criminal code, like France did in 2017. They have also asked that a minimum distance be established to keep anti-abortionists away from the entrance to abortion clinics, similar to the distance that smokers must observe from schools and hospitals. But their demands remain unanswered.In the Madrid region, 18,914 women had abortions in 2018, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s latest available data. This is a 9.7% drop from 2010, when new legislation went into effect legalizing abortion upon request in the first trimester. And for many, the anguish of making such a momentous decision is exacerbated by those who want to make the decision for them.English version by Heather Galloway.Adheres toMore informationIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact ventacontenidos@prisamedia.com_newsletterSign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletinAp\u00fantateMost viewedLife after OzempicThe small Caribbean island making a fortune from artificial intelligenceTen of the most beautiful graffiti murals in the world from 2023Life at 117 for an unintentional supercentenarianRainn Wilson, actor: \u2018Even though I was making a lot of money on a great show, I wanted more than that\u2019   Recomendaciones EL PA\u00cdSCursosCentrosFranc\u00e9s onlineIngl\u00e9s onlineItaliano onlineAlem\u00e1n onlineCrucigramas & Juegos CursoscursosMaestr\u00eda en l\u00ednea en Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas con concentraci\u00f3n en Marketing DigitalcursosMaestr\u00eda en l\u00ednea en Direcci\u00f3n de Recursos HumanoscursosMaestr\u00eda en l\u00ednea en Psicopedagog\u00edacursosCurso en l\u00ednea de Dise\u00f1o Gr\u00e1ficoCentroscursosonlineMaestr\u00eda en Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas con concentraci\u00f3n en Transformaci\u00f3n Digital y Desarrollo de NegocioscursosonlineCurso en l\u00ednea de experto en Calidad Industrial y Procesos Farmac\u00e9uticoscursosonlineMaestr\u00eda en l\u00ednea en Programaci\u00f3n WebcursosonlineMaestr\u00eda en l\u00ednea en Ciencias en Educaci\u00f3n VirtualFranc\u00e9s onlinecursosinglesMejora tu franc\u00e9s con 15 minutos al d\u00edacursosinglesDisfruta de nuestras lecciones personalizadas, breves y divertidas.cursosinglesObtendr\u00e1 un diploma con estad\u00edsticas de nivel, progresi\u00f3n y participaci\u00f3n. cursosingles 21 d\u00edas de prueba gratuita de nuestro curso de franc\u00e9s \u2018online\u2019Ingl\u00e9s onlinecursosinglesMejore su ingl\u00e9s con EL PA\u00cdS con 15 minutos al d\u00edacursosinglesDisfrute de nuestras lecciones personalizadas, breves y divertidascursosinglesEval\u00fae su nivel y obtenga un certificadocursosinglesPruebe 21 d\u00edas gratis y sin compromisoItaliano onlinecursosinglesMejore su italiano con EL PA\u00cdS con 15 minutos al d\u00edacursosinglesDisfrute de nuestras lecciones personalizadas, breves y divertidascursosinglesEval\u00fae su nivel y obtenga un certificadocursosinglesPruebe 21 d\u00edas gratis y sin compromisoAlem\u00e1n onlinecursosinglesLas mejores oportunidades hablan alem\u00e1n.
