They\u2019re two of the biggest breakthroughs for democracy in U.S. history \u2014 and they were won through the courage and leadership of Black women.\u00a0\n\n\nYet, from the electoral college to the classroom, institutions built on systemic racism have whitewashed America\u2019s voting rights history. White suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony literally wrote the book on women\u2019s suffrage \u2013\u2013 but erased Black women from the narrative.\u00a0\nThis type of erasure has only continued. Black women\u2019s influence and essential roles in bringing our country closer to real democracy have been strategically and repeatedly struck from the history books and the newspaper reels.\u00a0\nNo more.\nSpotlighting Black Women\u2019s Stories in the Fight for Enfranchisement\nThis is the second blog in Planned Parenthood Action Fund\u2019s series honoring Women\u2019s Equality Day, which we celebrate annually on Aug. 26 to mark the official certification of the 19th Amendment. The first blog in the series, \u201c100 Years of the 19th Amendment\u201d is by Planned Parenthood Action Fund President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson. Her blog lifts up the Black women who organized, strategized, and mobilized the suffrage movement.\u00a0\nRead on to learn about the time between the enshrinement of the 19th Amendment in 1920 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Black suffragists helped their white sisters secure the 19th amendment, when the dust settled, they found themselves right where they were when they started. Because of Jim Crow laws, their right was in name only. They had to continue to fight for real suffrage, but now, the white women they had helped weren\u2019t as eager to return the favor.\u201d\n\u2013 Alexis McGill Johnson\nPresident and CEO, Planned Parenthood Action Fund\n[Source: \u201c100 Years of the 19th Amendment\u201d]\n\n\n\n\nSetting the Record Straight on the 19th Amendment\nThe 19th Amendment to the Constitution says that U.S. governments are not allowed to deny citizens the right to vote based on sex. It came to pass in large part because of the contributions of Black women. Ida B.Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, Sojourner Truth, Anna Julia Cooper, Angelina Weld Grimk\u00e9, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and countless other Black women leaders were resilient in the face of racist backlash \u2014 a testament to their passion and self-determination.\u00a0\nDespite the fact that Black women put their lives on the line to help all women gain the right to participate in democracy, the 19th Amendment only ended discrimination against women at the voting booth in theory. In practice, America\u2019s racist and sexist electoral system withheld Black women\u2019s right to vote in states across the country.\nMeanwhile, many white, racist suffragists refused to fight back against racial discrimination in voting and turned their back on the Black suffragists who had helped them. Black women were on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Crow Laws Kept the Promise of the 19th Amendment Away From Black Women\nRacist policies kept Black women from the polls for decades after the 19th Amendment was passed. Voter suppression \u2014 particularly Jim Crow laws \u2014\u00a0denied Black men and women full participation in democracy until the Voting Rights Act became law 45 years later.\u00a0\nBetween 1920 and 1965, Black Americans were shut out from voting in local, state, and federal elections. Their ability to cast their vote was stopped by literacy tests, poll taxes, voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and violence.\u00a0\nBlack Civil Rights Heroines and the 1965 Voting Rights Act\nThere are many stories of Black women who fought to attain full and equal access to democracy. Here are three of them.\nFannie\u00a0Lou Hamer and the Democratic National Convention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFannie\u00a0Lou Hamer worked as a sharecropper for most of her life and became one of the Civil and Voting Rights Movements\u2019 most powerful voices in the early 1960s. She visited cities across the country while working with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), speaking about voting rights and registering Black people to vote.\n\n\n\nIn Mississippi, Hamer was brutally beaten by the police, and the abuse left her permanently injured. Despite this, she went on to co-found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which aimed to integrate the state\u2019s white-only delegation to the 1964 Democratic National Convention (DNC).\nAt the DNC, Hamer gave a fiery speech in which she shared harrowing stories of the white supremacists who abused her and her loved ones for trying to exercise their voting rights.\n\n\nIs this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our telephones off of the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, because we want to live as decent human beings, in America?\n\n\u2013 Fannie\u00a0Lou Hamer, Aug. 22, 1964\n\nHamer\u2019s televised address to the DNC and nationwide civil rights protests \u2014 including a march known as \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d \u2014\u00a0led to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act (VRA).\u00a0\nDiane Nash, Sit-Ins and Freedom Rides\nDiane Nash was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement\u2019s student wing. In 1960, she co-founded SNCC and led groundbreaking sit-ins in Nashville, Tennessee. Her masterful strategies in nonviolent protest brought about the first civil rights campaign to integrate lunch counters.\nBecause transportation was key to making voting accessible, Nash led a major route of the Freedom Rides. Southern racists savagely attacked them. In the face of this violence, Nash and her fellow Freedom Riders ultimately succeeded in desegregating interstate travel.\nAmelia Boynton Robinson and Bloody Sunday\nThe 1965 protest march from Selma, Alabama to the state capital of Montgomery\u00a0was spearheaded by activist Amelia Boynton Robinson, along with Diane Nash and their fellow civil rights pioneers.\u00a0\nBoynton Robinson \u2014 who led voter registration drives in Selma from the 1930s through the 1950s \u2014\u00a0invited Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to help lead the march as a protest against voter suppression. The SCLC set up a temporary headquarters in Boynton Robinson\u2019s home.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Boynton Robinson \u2014 along with many other protesters including Rep John Lewis \u2014 was beaten by Alabama state troopers. That\u2019s why the nationally broadcast racist violence became known as Bloody Sunday. Five months later, on Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeakening the Voting Rights Act\nThe VRA of 1965 banned racial discrimination in all levels of voting. By the next election, Black voter registration increased astronomically.\u00a0\nHowever, the VRA didn\u2019t end the need to fight for equal access to democracy. The VRA was dismantled in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder. In the devastating ruling, the Supreme Court took out a key part of the VRA that required state and local governments with a history of discriminatory voting laws to ask the federal government first before changing their voting laws.\nThe fight for voting rights continues.\n2020 Election: Carrying on the Legacy\nBlack suffrage and civil rights trailblazers helped Black women become the critical voice for democracy, civil liberties, and freedoms that they are today. In an election where Black women are running for office in record numbers, we must honor the 19th Amendment and the VRA by dismantling the systems of white supremacy that are currently restricting Black people\u2019s access to the ballot.\u00a0\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund is fighting for voting access for all voters \u2014\u00a0especially Black, Indigenous, and other people of color who have too long been disenfranchised. Carrying on this fight for voting rights is also essential in the fight for reproductive rights.\nDo your part to ensure that WE decide who gets to be in charge of our country and our futures.
