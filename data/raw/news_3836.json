Protestors and some experts suspect tear gas exposure is causing abrupt and painful changes to menstrual cycles.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Getty / Morgan McMullen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Catherine Ryan Gregory published 21 August 2020 \n\n\nA flash-bang detonated, causing the crowd of 1,500 to crouch and cover their ears. Protestors buckled their bicycle helmets, tightened their goggles, and adjusted their ear plugs. Then a cloud of gray smoke bloomed from the center of the group.Tear gas.People wearing respirators used leaf blowers to disperse the chemical agent volleyed at protestors by the federal agents guarding Portland, Oregon\u2019s Hatfield Federal Courthouse on July 24. \u201cStay calm,\u201d someone shouted. \u201cWalk, don\u2019t run.\u201d Those of us on the periphery of the protest shuffled farther away.I was several blocks from the center of the declared riot and didn\u2019t see any smoke around me, so I was shocked when my eyes began to burn. I heard people retching nearby. A stranger guided me to a pair of medics. They poured water over my face and dripped saline into my eyes.One warned me that the water he doused me in wouldn\u2019t get rid of the tear gas residue on my clothes, skin, or hair. \u201cShower like this,\u201d he said, sticking his face forward and butt back. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this stuff burning down there.\u201d I caught his meaning.Protestors in Portland wear gas masks to protect themselves from chemical crowd control measures.(Image credit: Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)This particular night wasn\u2019t much different from the months of clashes between law enforcement and activists in Portland. A University of Portland study shows that federal agents used tear gas as early as on July 3, sometimes as often as 33 times in a single night, until they transitioned defense of the courthouse to state troopers on\u00a0July 30. Officers with the Portland Police also repeatedly used, and\u00a0continue to use, the chemical agent against protestors.Oregon\u2019s largest city is only one of many places across the country and the world where crowds have demanded justice since the death of George Floyd on May 25. Protestors in at least\u00a0100 cities in the U.S., from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Wilmington, North Carolina, were hit with some form of tear gas this summer. Mass demonstrations\u2014and the \u201cless lethal\u201d methods of dispersing them\u2014don\u2019t show signs of stopping.Now, protestors and some medical experts are questioning if tear gas can do more than cause \u201cburning down there.\u201d People with a uterus have taken to social media to compare notes on unusual changes to their menstrual cycle since being exposed to tear gas\u2014periods coming extra early or late; debilitating cramps; and bleeding heavy enough to require an adult diaper.\u201cI\u2019ve had multiple periods in one cycle,\u201d says Danialle James, an activist in Portland who has protested nearly every night since George Floyd was killed and who\u00a0jointly filed a lawsuit\u00a0against a smorgasbord of federal officials and agencies that have used violence to subdue protestors. She says she has been exposed to tear gas \u201ctoo many times to count,\u201d including every day in a two- to three-week stretch. \u201cWhether it was close to my time [of the month] or not, I also experienced severe menstrual cramps.\u201dWe\u2019re dealing with something that could kill us. But I\u2019m Black. It\u2019s my duty to fight for my freedom.Many other protestors report similar symptoms\u2014in addition to the burning eyes, cough, and breathing difficulties that regularly result from exposure to chemical agents. James says that every night, she and other women compare symptoms they identify as side effects of tear gas. Some symptoms vary\u2014one woman\u2019s eyes are constantly red, one woman is dealing with hemorrhoids, another\u2019s hair has fallen out\u2014but \u201cwe have the same uterus-type things going on,\u201d confirms another Portland activist, Demetria Hester.Still, Hester and James, along with hundreds\u2014even thousands\u2014of others have continued to show up nightly with every expectation of being exposed to tear gas yet again. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with\u00a0something that could kill us,\u201d James continues. \u201cBut I\u2019m Black. It\u2019s my duty to fight for my freedom. My duty to fight for my civil rights.\u201dIrritating Agents\u201cTear gas\u201d is a catch-all term used to describe crowd-control tools that, when dispersed, cause eye pain and tearing, coughing, disorientation, and other quick-acting but typically short-lived symptoms. (They\u2019re also called \u201cirritating agents,\u201d a euphemism that implies they are as mildly annoying as pop-up ads.) A study authored by medical officers in Britain wrote that people exposed to tear gas are \u201chighly motivated to escape from the smoke.\u201d2-Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile, a real tongue twister of a chemical commonly called CS, is often used by law enforcement in the U.S. It\u2019s actually a powder, not a gas, that is dispersed into the air when the cannister carrying it explodes.If this sounds violent, that\u2019s because it is. The tools are prohibited under international protocols, and the reason why law enforcement still uses them is complicated: The Geneva Protocol, signed in 1925, banned weaponized gases in war in response to the devastating chemicals that killed roughly 100,000 soldiers in World War I. The United States ratified the articles under the UN\u2019s 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, which banned the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons in warfare\u2014but included an exception for \u201claw enforcement, including domestic riot control purposes.\u201d More recently, President Trump signed a\u00a0bill banning the export of crowd control supplies, including tear gas, to Hong Kong, where there was a crack down on widespread protests in 2019.Police bureaus in Portland, New Orleans, Oakland, Philadelphia, and other cities have defended their department\u2019s use of tear gas. \"CS gas is uncomfortable, but effective at dispersing crowds,\u201d Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell\u00a0said at a press conference\u00a0on July 1. \u201cWe would rather not use it. We'd rather have those in the area follow the law and not engage in dangerous behavior. We provide plenty of warning and everyone there had the opportunity to leave to avoid the use of force.\u201d Police leaders say that using tear gas causes less harm than other crowd control measures, such as the brute force of batons and riot shields.A protester throws back a tear gas grenade after federal officers tried to disperse a crowd in Portland.(Image credit: Nathan Howard / Getty Images)The prevailing wisdom around tear gas suggests that it causes pain, but no lasting harm. The limited study of CS, primarily in military training exercises, has several limitations, though. For the most part, the subjects in these studies are young, healthy males\u2014not exactly a cross-section of the people who are taking to the streets to decry systemic racism. Plus, the severity of the effects of CS, specifically, can vary based on temperature, humidity, and wind patterns. What\u2019s more, these studies seldom investigate repeated or prolonged exposure or widespread use.Portland was gassed at least 181 times between May 29 and July 15, according to research from the University of Portland. (Researchers believe this is an underestimate, and while tensions have eased since most federal officers left, gas continues to be used as of the writing of this article.) While many uses of tear gas occur after some protestors have gone home, the potential public health exposure to these chemicals has \u201cinnumerable implications for public health,\u201d says Zoey Thill, a family medicine physician in New York and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health.\u201cTear gas is inherently indiscriminate,\u201d says Rohini Haar, an emergency physician and medical expert at Physicians for Human Rights. It wafts in the wind, stagnates in narrow streets and low elevations, and has been found to linger for weeks on surfaces nearly 1,000 feet away from where it was deployed,\u00a0according to research\u00a0conducted during pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong last year. Researchers there\u00a0found CS residue\u00a0on bike paths, walls of apartment buildings, and playgrounds. Those living near or in neighborhoods with protests, people who are homeless, and even those in jail have all reported feeling the effects of deployed tear gas.Thill continues, \u201cPutting aside the\u00a0known\u00a0bodily risks altogether\u2014asthma exacerbations, arrhythmias, permanent vision changes or vision loss\u2014the use of tear gas by police signifies an explicit commitment\u2026to control and to repress.\u201dA \u201cRainbow of Health Concerns\u201dWhile plenty of studies have shown potential impacts of tear gas on respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and eye health, the data on how it might affect reproductive health are sparse.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we don\u2019t have enough data and it\u2019s hard to come by, as conducting studies\u2014especially on reproductive health\u2014would be unethical,\u201d acknowledges Chloe Eudaly, a Portland city commissioner. Eudaly adds, \u201cThe fact that tear gas is a chemical weapon banned in war certainly suggests that it would be harmful to civilians.\u201dHaar agrees. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a randomized controlled trial to know that tear gas is awful for you and that U.S. law enforcement recklessly uses this chemical weapon far too often.\u201dAnecdotal reports from\u00a0Bahrain, the Gaza Strip, and\u00a0Chile\u00a0suggest that miscarriages and intrauterine fetal death increase in communities hit by tear gas. A Physicians for Human Rights survey conducted in the 1980s noted about 40 women\u2019s babies in the Gaza Strip were stillborn, with the women reporting they noticed a lack of fetal movement two or three days after tear gas exposure.The fact that tear gas is a chemical weapon banned in war certainly suggests that it would be harmful to civilians.To fill in gaps in data, there are studies now investigating the possible connection between tear gas and disrupted menstrual cycles, including a University of Minnesota-Planned Parenthood North Central States survey focusing on exposure and reproductive health, and a Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research study about tear gas and overall health, both in initial stages.Many women in Portland don\u2019t need peer-reviewed research to convince them of the connection. Allison V., a 40-year-old mother and master\u2019s student, says that her typically mild periods have gone haywire since she joined Black Lives Matter protests, first in Minneapolis and then in Portland. In the last few months, one period lasted only two and a half days; the next one arrived nine days late and lasted just a day and a half. \u201cThe gas is the only thing that has changed in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe it\u2019s directly related to the gas.\u201dAllison, who prefers not to use her full name, estimates she has breathed tear gas at least 30 times and describes gases of a variety of odors, densities, and colors, from green and red-pink to yellow and gray-white\u2014\u201cthe whole rainbow of health concerns,\u201d she says. (It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly which chemicals are being used by U.S. law enforcement; the type and potency of these crowd control agents aren\u2019t a matter of public record.)\u201cAt first I thought I was crazy,\u201d Allison continues. Then she stumbled across a Facebook post about strange period symptoms among protestors, from late and early cycles to extreme cramps and heavy bleeding. The post racked up 211 comments in three days.Beyond StressOne alternative explanation is that stress is to blame for erratic menstruation.\u00a0Research shows\u00a0high stress is linked to greater chances of irregular periods. (Uterine and cervical cancers, thyroid conditions, and polycystic ovary syndrome can also cause irregular periods.)That\u2019s what a doctor told Hester when she sought medical attention for a barrage of ailments, including twice-a-month periods, after being exposed to tear gas most days since May 29. \u201cShe told me that wasn\u2019t symptoms of tear gas,\u201d the activist says. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh, you could be stressed.\u2019 I\u2019m Black 24/7 and never had these symptoms before. They\u2019re side effects of tear gas, point blank.\u201dHester\u2019s experience with a doctor who was quick to brush off her concerns aligns with what many Black people and other people of color know firsthand: That racial minorities are less likely to have access to quality and consistent health care, that medical providers are more likely to downplay Black patients\u2019 pain, and that BIPOC face a variety of health outcomes worse than their white peers, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health. With Black women leading many anti-racism movements, this could lead to a public health double-whammy: They endure more exposure to chemical agents yet have poorer medical care to treat that exposure.Thill thinks Hester\u2019s intuition is right, that her off-kilter cycle can\u2019t be chalked up to only stress. \u201cThe usual stress response of the menstrual cycle is for things to sort of shut down. Ovulation can be delayed or can stop altogether,\u201d she says. \u201cThe complaints I\u2019m hearing with regard to tear gas exposure are of early periods, prolonged periods, or multiple periods in a month. These complaints can\u2019t be explained by stress alone and are likely related to exposure to tear gas.\u201dThe link could have an unintended chilling effect on activism. \u201cGiven that there is minimal evidence available about a link between tear gas exposure and irregular menstrual cycles, we run the risk of unintentionally intimidating women away from their right to protest and free expression,\u201d Haar says.So far, though, many activists are undeterred. \u201cI keep going out there because Black lives matter at all costs,\u201d Hester says. \u201cIf I lose my life, it\u2019s fine, as long as you keep the work going on. You know we\u2019re not going to stop. We\u2019re going to fight.\u201dRelated Story(Image credit: KEREM YUCEL / GETTY IMAGES)Tips for How to Protest Safely During the Pandemic (marieclaire.com)Related Story(Image credit: Getty Images)How to Help BLM With No Money | Support BLM Without Donating (marieclaire.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nStay In The KnowMarie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
