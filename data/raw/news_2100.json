Such a center doesn\u2019t exist in Palm Beach County now, and we feel that it would fill a critical void.\u201dMore than 60 people attended the dinner.Proceeds benefit First Care Women\u2019s Clinic, which was founded in 1983 to provide compassionate care, including reproductive health screenings, testing and ultrasounds, to its clients from offices in West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, Boca Raton and the western communities.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Public notice certification Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Promote Your Event Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackNewsletters Facebook X eNewspaper Archives InstagramJobs Cars Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.palmbeachdailynews.com.
