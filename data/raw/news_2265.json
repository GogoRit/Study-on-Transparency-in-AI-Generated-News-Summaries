The entity will be responsible for distributing the funds to nonprofits that provide women in unexpected pregnancy with care, support and details on options.\u00a0\nThe license plate is now available for purchase.\u00a0\nThe new design depicts an infant\u2019s hand resting in an adult\u2019s hand. It replaces the original plate\u00a0that featured an image of two children.\u00a0\n\u201cOur message is that every child\u2014born or pre-born\u2014deserves loving protection and support,\u201d Choose Life President Karen LaBarr said in a news release. \u201cWe especially want to encourage expectant\u00a0women to choose life for their babies by parenting them or by entrusting them to adoptive\u00a0parents.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom the press release:\nIn 2006, then-Senator Brian Kemp sponsored the legislation and constitutional amendment that authorized creation of the Choose Life plates among 30 others, allowing the state to share revenue with the various non-profits. Both passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support. A portion of each annual special tag fee is received by Choose Life of Georgia.\nThese funds are passed on to qualified non-profit clinics and centers that provide compassionate care to young girls, women and families trying to navigate the circumstances common to unplanned pregnancy. Some of the clinics provide free ultrasounds and other medical services.First available in 2007, there are approximately 3,000 Choose Life plates on Georgia highways today. The plates have generated nearly $400,000 in revenues distributed to help those in unexpected pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cThousands of couples would gladly adopt the 30,000 babies lost to abortion each year in Georgia, and resources are available to help those who decide to parent,\u201d LaBarr said. \u201cOur license plates carry a message of hope and love for women and their unborn babies.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \nRelated Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Szilagyi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Szilagyi is a former Statewide Contributor for AllOnGeorgia.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to comment\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
