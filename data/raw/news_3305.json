Wade at the Center for Reproductive Health clinic on Thursday, June 23, 2022, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nGina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Having achieved the generational dream of seeing Roe v. Wade overturned, the largest and oldest anti-abortion group in the US is now taking its fight to the state level, with a particular focus on restricting medication abortion.\n    \n\n            At a joyous National Right to Life Committee convention over the weekend in Atlanta, where attendees listened to workshops such as \u201cPreparing for the 2022 Elections\u201d and \u201cGrassroots Lobbying 101,\u201d medication abortion \u2013 which is becoming the more common method of the procedure \u2013 is fast emerging as the most pressing priority for the anti-abortion-rights movement.\n    \n\n            \u201cChemical abortion is the fight we\u2019re going to be having for the next decade, probably longer,\u201d Jennifer Popik, the group\u2019s federal legislation director, told attendees.\n    \n\n            No matter \u201chow many of your wonderful states will now ban abortion either six weeks or almost completely \u2026 these pills will still be coming into your state,\u201d she added.\n    \n\n            The US Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone, coupled with misoprostol, for abortion use in 2000 and recently relaxed certain federal regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic to allow the drugs to be sent via mail. \n    \n\n            In the wake of Friday\u2019s ruling overturning Roe, Attorney General Merrick Garland said states \u201cmay not ban Mifepristone based on disagreement with the FDA\u2019s expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.\u201d\n    \n\n            He also cited \u201cbedrock constitutional principles\u201d as protecting women who live in states that banned abortion from seeking the procedure in places where it\u2019s legal.\n    \n\n            National Right to Life, however, intends to push state and federal legislation that would criminalize and try to prevent the drugs used in medication abortions from not being dispensed in person. The group also wants legislation requiring informed consent, blocking telemedicine for these drugs and promoting the controversial practice of so-called abortion pill reversal, which is regarded by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as an \u201cunproven medical approach\u201d that does \u201cnot meet clinical standards.\u201d\n    \n\n    Model legislation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion activists gather outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on June 24, 2022. - The US Supreme Court on Friday ended the right to abortion in a seismic ruling that shreds half a century of constitutional protections on one of the most divisive and bitterly fought issues in American political life. The conservative-dominated court overturned the landmark 1973 \"Roe v Wade\" decision that enshrined a woman's right to an abortion and said individual states can permit or restrict the procedure themselves. \n\nStefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\n'Pro-mom, pro-baby, pro-life': People at anti-abortion convention celebrate Roe's downfall and focus on 'long battle ahead'\n\n\n\n\n            National Right to Life has outlined its priorities in model legislation that it rolled out ahead of last week\u2019s ruling, including recommendations to restrict abortion except to save the life of a pregnant woman, and language if states want to carve out exceptions for rape and incest.\n    \n\n            The group also is pushing for states to restrict those \u201cconspiring to cause, or aiding or abetting, illegal abortions,\u201d the \u201ctrafficking\u201d of abortion-inducing drugs and \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d of a minor. \n    \n\n            The proposal suggests that criminal penalties should extend to individuals who aid or abet illegal abortions, which would include giving instructions about self-administered abortions or means of obtaining an \u201cillegal abortion\u201d over the phone, the internet or another form of communication. The group suggests criminal penalties should also include hosting or maintaining a website that \u201cencourages or facilitates efforts to obtain an illegal abortion,\u201d offering or providing \u201cabortion doula\u201d services and making referrals to an abortion provider. \n    \n\n            The group recommends states allow civil action to be brought by state or local officials or relatives of the pregnant woman against a person or entity that violates the abortion law. \n    \n\n            \u201cIn addition to criminal penalties and medical license revocation, civil remedies will be critical to ensure that unborn lives are protected from illegal abortions,\u201d the memo says.  \n    \n\n            States are also encouraged to require physicians to report to state agencies when abortion was necessary to prevent the deaths of pregnant women or face misdemeanors. \n    \n\n            James Bopp, a conservative lawyer and general counsel for National Right to Life who helped draft the model legislation, said it \u201creflects the thinking of the whole Right to Life movement on where we need to be post-Roe.\u201d He did acknowledge that \u201cit\u2019s very difficult for states to have extraterritorial enforcement of the law\u201d and \u201cthe violation has to occur in their state.\u201d\n    \n\n            But abortion rights advocates, including Elizabeth Nash, the state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, called the model legislation \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and \u201csimply out of touch with reality in the sense that \u2026 we know that people will always need abortion care.\u201d\n    \n\n            Nash argued that the bill would be in conflict with First Amendment rights and \u201craises some concerns that a provision like this would kill the sharing of information around abortion \u2013 in many ways, not only around self-managed abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n    \u2018Where the battle is going to be played out\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters gather in front of the Los Angeles City Hall in downtown Los Angeles on June 26, 2022, two days after the US Supreme Court released a decision on Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, striking down the right to abortion.\n\nApu Gomes/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nProtests spread across the US after the Supreme Court overturns the constitutional right to abortion \n\n\n\n\n            National Right to Life\u2019s state affiliates now will push the model legislation to state legislators, as a handful of states have announced they\u2019ll hold special sessions to consider abortion legislation.\n    \n\n            Bopp told CNN that National Right to Life plans to aggressively push the model legislation nationwide, though he acknowledged there are several Democratic-led states where such efforts will not make any headway. \n    \n\n            All the while, activists with National Right to Life and other groups that oppose abortion are girding for the next phase of this fight.\n    \n\n            Speaking at the convention over the weekend, Randall O\u2019Bannon, National Right to Life\u2019s director of education and research, pointed to state legislative fights as the place \u201cwhere the battle is going to be played out over the next several years.\u201d In particular, he warned against what he framed as the uniquely pernicious challenge of combating medication abortion that can be ordered online and urged attendees to \u201cstop thinking that abortion is something that\u2019s done by old abortionists operating in dilapidated clinics.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s hard to detect and even maybe harder to control,\u201d O\u2019Bannon said. \u201cCan it be stopped? Yes. Will it be easy? No. But we have faced many tough challenges before.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
