Newsroom, Jan 21, 2022 / 02:00 am\nKatie Shaw is many things: a champion for the unborn, an advocate for those with disabilities, a faithful Catholic, and, now, a March for Life speaker. She also happens to have Down syndrome.\nHer message to the world, she says, is Psalm 139:14.\n\u201cThe main reason I became a national pro-life speaker is because of God calling me to tell everyone Psalm 139:14: \u2018I am fearfully and wonderfully made,\u2019\u201d she told EWTN Pro-Life Weekly in 2020.\u00a0\nOn Friday, the 37-year-old pro-life advocate will witness to this message when she speaks to the tens of thousands of marchers expected at the Washington, D.C., March for Life, the largest pro-life event in the country that condemns abortion and celebrates life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw serves on the board of Down Syndrome Indiana, meets with politicans such as then-president Donald Trump, and lobbies for pro-life legislation, particularly legislation prohibiting the discrimination of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome. Estimates suggest that nearly 70% of these babies are aborted in the United States.\nBut Shaw\u2019s story begins in Indianapolis, Indiana.\u00a0\n\u201cMy dad and mom found out I had Down syndrome when mom was pregnant with me,\u201d she said at Rehumanize Conference 2018. \u201cMy mom's doctors never mentioned abortion. My parents feared the unknown and were sad that I was going to have surgery as soon as I was born, but the doctors started helping my parents plan what would help me have a wonderful life.\u201d\nShe grew up in a Catholic family, she said, and was baptized the day after she was born. She later received First Holy Communion and confirmation.\u00a0\n\u201cMy Catholic faith keeps me strong and knowing God is behind me,\u201d she told EWTN.\nWhile Shaw progressed through school, she picked up hobbies such as violin and softball. She earned her GED, the equivalency of a high-school diploma.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an adult, she worked in child care and retail. Now, she also dedicates her life to the unborn.\n\u201cMy parents have always been pro-life, so they have always taught me that every life is a gift, that every life is wonderful, but the older I get, the more I realize not everyone sees that,\u201d she said during the Rehumanize conference. \u201cAbleism is not just seen in the medical field. As we all know, many people would prefer to end the pregnancy if there even might be a problem and they might \u2018try again.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat is why,\u201d she added, \u201cI want to help unborn babies, and their moms, and everyone see what a wonderful life we can all have.\u201d You can watch Katie's interview with EWTN in the video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Shaw, \u201cpeople with Down syndrome are just like everyone else.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI play sports, I'm in a book club, I like hanging out with my friends and family, and I do the mini marathons, and I volunteer at my parish and Down Syndrome Indiana,\u201d she told EWTN.\nWhile she admitted \u201cwe have ups and downs like everyone,\u201d she added that \u201cI always say I have a wonderful life.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoric \u2018Requiem for the Forgotten\u2019 Mass to premiere in Miami\u00a0\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an interview with Life Issues Institute in 2020, Shaw emphasized the beauty of every life, regardless of disability.\n\u201cEven though babies \u2014 the most defenseless \u2014 have a disability or not, you should not just kill them,\u201d she said. Because we have wonderful lives and all lives should be about celebrating anybody and people with disabilities too.\u201d\nSpeaking with EWTN, she shared advice for moms and dads who might be expecting a baby prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome.\n\u201cI want them to know that the child is a gift from God and to cherish every moment with them,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir child is beautifully and wonderfully made too, and who knows what God has chosen them to be.\u201d\nShe concluded, \u201cHelp your baby's life be wonderful and your life will be wonderful.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \ndown syndrome, \nPro-life advocacy, \nEWTN Pro-Life Weekly, \nMarch for Life 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
