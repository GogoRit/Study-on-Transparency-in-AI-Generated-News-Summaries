Madeline Hinkley/Daily.\n\u00a0Buy this photo.\n\n\n\nJim Harbaugh and his wife, Sarah, attended an anti-abortion fundraiser in Plymouth, Michigan, over the weekend where the Michigan football coach supported the sentiment that carrying a pregnancy to term is \u201cthe right choice.\u201d\nHarbaugh\u2019s comments were a part of his \u201cpro-life testimony\u201d as a guest speaker at the Plymouth Right to Life event which included Father John Riccardo of the Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Church. Harbaugh, a Catholic himself, spoke on his pro-life beliefs that were instilled in him at a young age by his parents.\n\u201cI love life,\u201d Harbaugh said, per the Detroit Catholic. \u201cI believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drives these beliefs in me.\u201d\n \n \n\nHarbaugh went more in depth with his beliefs in front of the crowd as well:\n\u201cIn God\u2019s plan, each unborn human truly has a future filled with potential, talent, dreams and love,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI have living proof in my family, my children, and the many thousands that I\u2019ve coached that the unborn are amazing gifts from God to make this world a better place.\u00a0\n\u201cTo me, the right choice is to have the courage to let the unborn be born.\u201d\nHarbaugh\u2019s comments come in the wake of a monumental Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade (1973), which removed the widespread legal protection granted to women seeking an abortion. The state of Michigan itself is one of several states that have unenforced pre-Roe abortion bans \u2014 with Michigan\u2019s 1931 law currently on hold as a result of a state judge\u2019s injunction \u2014 making it a largely contested issue within the state\u2019s governance.\nHarbaugh has not shied away from controversial topics in the past, addressing both the murder of George Floyd and the National Anthem protests of his former quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, publicly. And while Harbaugh\u2019s headfirst approach to addressing those contested topics hasn\u2019t changed, neither has his stance on the abortion discussion.\n \n \n\nIn 2020, Harbaugh spoke on a podcast with Jay Nordlinger, senior editor of the National Review magazine, about how the pandemic allowed society a new perspective on life.\n\u201cThis is a message \u2014 this is something where, a time, we grow in our faith, having reverence and respect for God.\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cYou see people taking more a view of sanctity of life. I hope that continues \u2014 and not just in this time of crisis or pandemic.\n\u201cWe talk about sanctity of life, yet we live in a society that aborts babies. There can\u2019t be anything more horrendous.\u201d\nHarbaugh was also joined at the event by Michigan linebackers coach George Helow, according to the Detroit Catholic.\nWhile it is not a recent development that Harbaugh is pro-life, his comments now carry more weight than before. With the right to choose sitting in political limbo, Harbaugh has made it clear which side of the line he stands.\n \n \n\n \n\nPlease consider donating to The Michigan Daily\n\n$10\n$25\n$50\nOther\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlay the latest crossword!\t\t\t\n\n\n\nMost ReadUMich does not prepare its students for the futureSportsMonday: It was time for Juwan Howard to go, but that shouldn\u2019t define his Michigan legacy\u00a0Inside the final two minutes that earned Michigan its ticket to the Big Ten Championship\u00a0i love being a slutMy grandma\u2019s bodyguardAAPD investigating shots fired outside of residence in 1000 block of Kensington Drive\n\nLatest\n\n\nTarris Reed Jr. enters transfer portal, third Michigan basketball player to do so\n\n\nPlayer development and practice reps: How Michigan\u2019s rising players buy into the program\n\n\nMichigan\u2019s impressive point production across lines showcases depth in the postseason\u00a0\n\n\nMichigan softball\u2019s pitching staff continuing to evolve as season does\n\n\nJonathan Kim\u2019s absence looms large for Michigan\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nSpotify\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Lipsey Student Publications Building\n\n420 Maynard St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109\n\n\n\nEdited and managed by the students at the University of Michigan since 1890\n\nAbout\nBylaws\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nContact Us\nJoin Us\nDonate\nPrint Issue\nCulture, Training and Inclusion\n \n\n\n\n\nArchives\nPrivacy Policy\nStore\n \n\n\n\u00a9 2024 One hundred and thirty-three years of editorial freedom.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPowered by Newspack\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
