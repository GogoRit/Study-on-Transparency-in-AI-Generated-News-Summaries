On her return home a few days later, she was no longer pregnant, and the 34-year-old wanted to do little more than cry in her own bed. Being in public was a struggle, let alone standing in line and going through airport security.\nShe had flown to Kansas for an abortion that was outlawed in her home state, though she and her doctor considered it medically appropriate. Scans had shown the fetus inside her had a lethal form of skeletal dysplasia. If it survived childbirth, which was extremely unlikely, doctors expected the newborn to soon suffocate from under-developed lungs. The baby\u2019s bones would be so brittle, they would break just from being held.advertisement\n\nKaitlyn and her husband got the news shortly after Texas passed a highly restrictive abortion law, banning the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy except in medical emergencies. Her own doctor was so afraid of being sued, he didn\u2019t bring up the possibility of ending the pregnancy. But if Kaitlyn didn\u2019t have the ability to travel for an abortion, she doesn\u2019t know if she would have survived.\n\u201cThe psychological burden would have been so high and I would have been so hormonal and emotional, I don\u2019t know what could have happened,\u201d she told STAT, which agreed to use only her first name because she fears repercussions for those who helped her if she\u2019s identified. Kaitlyn had postpartum depression before, after she gave birth to her first son. The prospect of carrying a fetus that was destined for suffering and death was unfathomable. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have got up and gone to work with that baby inside of me for seven months,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see suicide being an option.\u201d\nTexas\u2019s exception permitting abortion in medical emergencies likely wouldn\u2019t apply to a circumstance like Katilyn\u2019s, where death isn\u2019t imminent. After the Supreme Court\u2019s impending abortion ruling, whether it repeals Roe v. Wade outright or stops just short of that, several states are expected to pass laws that allow abortion only to save a pregnant person\u2019s life. Some 22 states are certain to ban abortion following a repeal of Roe, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, and a further four are highly likely to follow, with exemptions granted in limited medical emergencies.advertisement\n\nThe wording varies slightly from state to state. Texas allows abortion for \u201ca medical emergency\u201d; Louisiana\u2019s bill makes an exception to prevent \u201cdeath or substantial risk of death,\u201d or \u201cpermanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ\u201d; and Idaho permits abortion \u201cto prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d On Thursday, Oklahoma legislators approved a bill that would ban nearly all abortions starting from fertilization, with an exception to save the life of the mother \u201cin a medical emergency.\u201d\nThose exceptions are so vaguely defined, and with such harsh penalties for providers deemed to have violated the terms, physicians say they will be effectively unable to provide proper medical care or even discuss abortion with patients.\n\u201cWe take an oath to do no harm,\u201d said Amanda Horton, a perinatologist in Texas who treats high-risk pregnancies. \u201cI can\u2019t do my job, I can\u2019t provide ideal care if there are things I\u2019m not allowed to talk about. That ultimately harms patients.\u201d\nThe mental health consequences of being forced to carry an unviable pregnancy, for example, can be deadly. \u201cEspecially in the cases of psychotic illness, risk of suicide or infanticide is pretty high,\u201d said Nichelle Haynes, a perinatal psychiatrist from the Reproductive Psychiatry Clinic of Austin. Studies show suicide is a leading cause of postpartum death. If someone previously had severe postpartum depression and was hospitalized after a suicide attempt, there\u2019s a good chance of that happening again, especially if the pregnancy is unwanted, added Haynes.\nFrom her perspective as a physician, that qualifies as a medical emergency: \u201cThe emergency is preventing that now.\u201d But such a decision won\u2019t be legally recognized in Texas, she said.\nEven in more straightforward situations, where patients are in imminent physical danger, doctors are already struggling to provide care. Natalie Crawford, a fertility physician in Austin, said a pharmacy recently refused to fill a prescription for methotrexate, which treats an ectopic pregnancy by stopping the growth of the fertilized egg.\nThe pregnancy would never have resulted in the birth of a child, but was a serious risk to the mother. The embryo had attached in the patient\u2019s fallopian tube which, if left untreated, would rupture and cause extensive internal bleeding. Emergency surgery could save the woman\u2019s life if she were able to get to an emergency room fast enough but, if not, she would die from the blood loss.\n\u201cWe told [the pharmacist] it\u2019s a life-of-the-mother situation,\u201d said Crawford. But they believed their employer wouldn\u2019t permit the prescription. \u201cThey felt they would get in trouble.\u201d And so Crawford\u2019s team spent a day calling other pharmacies to find the medication for their patient. \u201cIt took extra manpower and time and it made me nervous about where we\u2019re going to find this,\u201d she said.\nDoctors\u2019 abilities to interpret medical exemptions, however they\u2019re worded, are significantly limited when they face potential harsh punishment, said Florida State University law professor Mary Ziegler, who has written extensively on reproductive law.\n\u201cStates are so determined to make it a serious crime, in some instances murder, the act of interpretation changes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more vague the language is, the more chilling effect that could have, because physicians don\u2019t want to roll the dice.\u201d\nNo body of law or precedents lay out what medical exemptions are permissible grounds for abortion. The procedure is considered life-saving treatment for several conditions, such as incomplete miscarriages, which can lead to sepsis and ultimately death if left untreated. But the political environment is so hostile, doctors say they will inevitably be afraid to respond in time.\n\u201cThe more states are worried about exceptions slipping through the cracks, the more likely they are to put doctors in situations with people dying after incomplete miscarriages,\u201d said Ziegler. \u201cPeople will die.\u201d\nPotentially fatal pregnancies are relatively unusual, but still amount to thousands of patients a year in the U.S. Horton sees half a dozen high-risk cases a month, she said. Patients must be treated with an abortion if they develop profuse bleeding, caused by the placenta growing in the wrong location, or preeclampsia, a potentially fatal rise in blood pressure, that doesn\u2019t respond to medication.\nAnd non-pregnancy related health conditions can present serious risks to pregnant patients. Leukemia, for example, must be quickly treated with a form of chemotherapy that no fetus could survive. \u201cIt would be unwise and medically unsafe to allow a woman to experience chemotherapy, then have a pregnancy loss, then induce her,\u201d said Horton. \u201cIt would seem cruel and unusual to receive chemotherapy and know that same medication is costing her unborn fetus its life.\u201d\nPhysicians will inevitably be forced to wait for patients\u2019 health to deteriorate to the point that their lives are clearly threatened, she said. \u201cThere are all kinds of situations where you\u2019re in a gray zone by 1 p.m., and things will be worse by 5 p.m.,\u201d said Wendy Parmet, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University. \u201cHow much worse do you have to let it be? How much danger to the patient?\u201d\nPhysicians are often wary of performing complex procedures during pregnancy, especially if they haven\u2019t done so before. One of Horton\u2019s patients a few years ago suffered heart failure when she was 17 weeks pregnant. \u201cWhat was just terrible was no cardiac surgeon would offer her an operation to save her life, because she was pregnant,\u201d she said. And so the patient needed an abortion before she could have her heart valve replaced.\n\u201cMy concern is, in very restrictive states, that would not be enough to be considered maternal life at risk,\u201d said Horton. \u201cIt would require continued escalation and deterioration of her own health before it\u2019s deemed a medical emergency.\u201d\nThese consequences will be worse for patients who are already marginalized, such as those who can\u2019t afford to take time off work or travel to receive health care. Maternal mortality in the U.S. is significantly worse for Black women, and restrictions on abortion will only worsen that disparity, said Horton. Preeclampsia, one of the leading health risks in pregnancy, is more common in Black women, and symptoms are more likely to be dismissed in Black patients. One study estimates that if all abortions were banned in the U.S., there would be a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths overall, and a 33% increase among Black women.\nParmet noted that the political environment today is more hostile toward abortion than in earlier decades. Even pre-Roe, she said, law enforcement was unlikely to intervene if a hospital committee said an abortion was performed for a patient\u2019s health.\n\u201cThe pendulum has swung in such a striking direction. The needs of mothers and pregnant people have been placed on a backburner, with the intent that we\u2019re a vessel to continue humanity,\u201d said Horton. \u201cThe needs and wants of the mother are less important than the fetus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\t\t\t\t\t\t\nReprints\n\n\n \nOlivia Goldhill\n\nInvestigative Reporter\nOlivia Goldhill works to hold corporations and public bodies to account, with a particular interest in reproductive health, mental health, and psychedelics.\n\n\n\n[email\u00a0protected] \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t@OliviaGoldhill\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\nTags\nlegal\nreproductive health \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTAT encourages you to share your voice.
