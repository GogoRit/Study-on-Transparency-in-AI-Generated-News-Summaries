(Courtesy Kelly Family)Patricia Kelly, tireless pro-life advocate and legislative lobbyist, dies at 88\n September 8, 2020By George P. Matysek Jr. Catholic Review\n\nFiled Under: Feature, Local News, News, Obituaries, Respect Life\n\n\nPatricia Kelly, a tireless advocate for the pro-life cause whose gentle but persistent lobbying efforts helped secure a ban on physician-assisted suicide in Maryland, died Sept. 4 at Portumna, her family farm in Carroll County. She was 88 and had been in declining health in recent years.\nA mother of 10 and a parishioner of St. Joseph in Taneytown, Kelly volunteered for Maryland Right to Life from 1980 to 1990 before working for 11 years as a legislative lobbyist focusing on pro-life concerns for the Maryland Catholic Conference, the Annapolis-based legislative lobbying arm of the state\u2019s Catholic bishops.\n\u201cBefore the Maryland Legislature enacted a very permissive pro-abortion law in the 1990s, Pat was instrumental in keeping a finger in the dike \u2013 in holding back the ever-increasing pressure for liberalizing the state\u2019s abortion law,\u201d said Richard J. Dowling, the former executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference who hired Kelly to work for the conference.\n\nPatricia Kelly greets St. John Paul II during the 1995 papal visit to Baltimore.

She also helped lay the groundwork for an eventual ban on the death penalty in Maryland.\n\u201cMore than anyone, she was responsible for keeping the disparate factions of Maryland\u2019s pro-life movement unified and focused,\u201d Dowling said.\nTimothy Maloney, a former member of the House of Delegates from Prince George\u2019s County, called Kelly \u201cone of one of the finest people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\u201cIn Annapolis, she was deeply respected, even by those on the other side,\u201d said Maloney, who serves on the Maryland Catholic Conference\u2019s administrative board. \u201cI think they could sense her integrity and the deep conviction behind her advocacy.\u201d\nMaloney said Kelly was \u201cwise, kind and direct.\u201d\n\u201cShe was someone people confided in,\u201d he said, \u201cand you never had to guess where you stood with her.\u201d\nThe former delegate said Kelly and Dowling were the major figures in \u201cbuilding the foundation of the modern Maryland Catholic Conference.\u201d\n\u201cUnder Pat and Dick, it became a very respected and effective advocacy organization,\u201d he said, \u201cand one of the top Catholic conferences in the country.\u201d\nJames E. DeGrange Sr., a former state senator from Anne Arundel County, said Kelly used her humble, soft-spoken manner, her knowledge of the issues and personal warmth to full advantage with lawmakers.\n\u201cI think she was respected by anyone who came in contact with her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very inclusive and was able to discuss difficult issues in a way that made people feel comfortable talking with her \u2013 whether they agreed with her or not. She was never overbearing or demanding.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nKelly grew up in Baltimore and Pittsburgh. She graduated from Notre Dame Preparatory School in 1950 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in music education from what is now Notre Dame of Maryland University in Baltimore. For several years, she taught at the Children\u2019s Rehabilitation Institute, a residential school in Baltimore County for children with special needs.\nShe met her future husband, Dr. Edward M. Kelly, on a blind date. They raised 10 children in the Ten Hills section of Baltimore, where they attended St. William of York Parish.\nJohn Kelly, Patricia Kelly\u2019s eldest child, said his mother was a selfless person who was always trying to do the best for her children. His parents were able to send all their children to Catholic schools all the way through college. The girls attended Notre Dame Preparatory School; the boys went to Loyola Blakefield in Towson.\n\u201cShe ran the basketball program at St. William of York,\u201d he said, \u201cand was involved in the Loyola High School Mothers Club.\u201d\nHer love for children and her deep-rooted Catholic faith were the reasons she was so passionately pro-life, he said.\n\u201cIt was a belief that life comes from God,\u201d John Kelly said. \u201cHe is the first and final arbiter of life. She very much believed children are from God and you don\u2019t destroy God\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nPatricia Kelly served as a legislative lobbyist for the Maryland Catholic Conference for 11 years. She died Sept. 4. (Courtesy Kelly Family)\n\nAfter Kathleen Marie Kelly, one of her daughters, was killed in an automobile accident in 1983, Patricia Kelly became even more of a rock for the family, John Kelly said.\n\u201cIt was crushing to both my parents,\u201d he said, \u201cbut her faith was deep and I think that\u2019s what got her through it.\u201d\nPatricia Kelly, who had 23 grandchildren and one great grandchild, was involved in helping the Archdiocese of Baltimore prepare for the 1995 visit of St. John Paul II and was able to meet the Polish pontiff during his visit. A treasured family photo shows a smiling Kelly shaking hands with the pope.\nEven after she retired from the Maryland Catholic Conference, she continued to volunteer for the organization.\n\u201cShe would come down once a week and stay over night just to help out,\u201d said Mary Ellen Russell, Dowling\u2019s successor as executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference and current director of community affairs for the Archdiocese of Baltimore.\nRussell called Kelly a \u201csecond mother to me.\u201d\n\u201cShe always had all the time in the world to help you with whatever you needed,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to laugh and say Pat was also my therapist. She had a way of making everyone feel special and listened-to and cared for.\u201d\nDowling noted that at the time he and Kelly worked together, the Catholic Conference included a staff of about 10, ranging in age from college interns in their early 20s to a man in his 60s.\n\u201cShe was a counselor, a sounding board, a spur to action or a shoulder to cry on, depending on the need as she saw it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she was unerring in discerning how best to apply her considerable interpersonal gifts, not least her common sense, her good humor and her unfailing candor.\u201d\nArchbishop William E. Lori called Kelly \u201ctruly a blessing to all who knew her.\u201d\n\u201cI had the pleasure of working with Pat Kelly for many years,\u201d he said, \u201cand can think of no one who brought a more generous and kind spirit to her work on behalf of the pro-life cause.\u201d\nA funeral Mass will be offered Sept. 9 at 11 a.m. at St. Joseph in Taneytown, followed by a burial and outdoor reception on Kelly\u2019s family farm.\u00a0\nEmail George Matysek at gmatysek@CatholicReview.org\nRead more obituaries here. \nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Catholic Review Media\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nGeorge P.
