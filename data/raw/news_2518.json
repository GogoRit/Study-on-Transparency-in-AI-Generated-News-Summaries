Potter, who was pressured to have an abortion when she was pregnant, said that the resource center was able to point her in the right direction and be a listening ear.Photo Credits: Lisa JohnstonPotter\u2019s husband was between jobs, and Mary Queen of Angels provided the family with necessities such as diapers and formula for London, now 3. In the midst of focusing on her daughter\u2019s needs, Potter discovered she was pregnant again. At this point, she was stressed out and needed to talk to someone.Turning to Mary Queen of Angels again, Potter talked to the organization\u2019s founder Sue Cooke.\u201cWe were getting pressure to not keep the baby,\u201d Potter recalled. \u201cWe questioned a lot, and prayed a lot, and fought hard with decisions. Sue was able to point me in the right direction.\u201d\u201cI told her everything happens for a reason,\u201d Cooke said, recalling how Potter sent her a private message on Mother\u2019s Day with ultrasound pictures of Lilianna, who was born in December. \u201cEverything is a gift from God.\u201dCooke founded Mary Queen of Angels 15 years ago. Praying on the sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood, Cooke was confronted by women visiting the facility for an abortion. They\u2019d say, \u201cSure, you\u2019re out here wanting me to keep the baby, but where will you be when I keep the baby and can\u2019t provide for the baby?\u201d Cooke recalled.The nonprofit organization, which recently moved to a new location in O\u2019Fallon, serves about 500 moms, with a team of about 20 volunteers. Moms come once a month for clothing, wipes, diapers, formula and baby gear, up until the child is 2. If there are older siblings, volunteers will find a way to help them, too.The organization doesn\u2019t receive outside funding, relying on the generosity of donors and volunteers; it also partners with other pro-life organizations to refer clients to additional resources. A thrift store named Simply Blessed recently was opened at the new location to help support the mission. Cooke also manages to balance all of this while working full-time as a human resources professional.Walking with Moms in NeedLast fall, Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kan., announced an initiative to draw attention to resources available to pregnant mothers in need. The chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities said \u201cWalking With Moms in Need: A Year of Service\u201d will help parishes to communicate the support services available to women who are thinking about whether to carry their child to term. The year of service begins March 25, 2020, the 25th anniversary of St. John Paul II\u2019s encyclical \u201cEvangelium Vitae\u201d (\u201cThe Gospel of Life\u201d).At the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 fall general assembly Nov. 11, Archbishop Naumann said parishes could offer a variety of support services to women who may be thinking about whether to carry their child to term. More information on the Sue Cooke held 5-month-old Mia as she visited with Lisbeth Rivera.Photo Credits: Lisa Johnstonnational initiative is available online at \nwww.walkingwithmoms.com.\u201cWomen facing challenging pregnancies should see the Church as a place where they can find help, especially with our myriad of social services and organizations dedicated to meeting the needs of people in crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenges can be immense for women in difficult pregnancies, especially women in poverty.\u201dArchbishop Naumann cited statistics from abortion providers in 2014 that showed that 75% of women who chose abortion were poor, 60% were in their 20s and 86% were unmarried.\u201cThe 25th anniversary year of \u2018Evangelium Vitae\u2019 gives us a wonderful opportunity to assess, expand and communicate resources to pregnant moms and families in need,\u201d Archbishop Naumann told the assembly.In the Archdiocese of St. Louis, a local task force was formed in June of 2019 to identify the wealth of resources available for children from conception through childhood and those who care for them. Its next phase is to create a multimedia campaign to more effectively connect people with those resources. The archdiocesan Respect Life Apostolate is communicating with parish pro-life coordinators; more information on local efforts will be forthcoming.More on Mary QueenCooke sees the work of Mary Queen of Angels as a way of \u201cwalking the walk,\u201d providing tangible and emotional support to pregnant women who find themselves in vulnerable situations. She feels strongly about helping what she calls the \u201cworking poor.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who don\u2019t qualify for (government) assistance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bar is set so low for people in need. These are people who are trying really hard to make it.\u201dLisbeth Rivera is a mom of six children \u2014 19, 16, 8-year-old twins, 18 months and 5 months. She initially sought out Cooke when she was pregnant with the twins. At the time she was a single mom to four children, and she knew she was going to need some extra support. Three years ago, she met her husband, Joe, and their family expanded from four to six children.Rivera said the organization lives up to its name \u2014 \u201can angel,\u201d she said. She teared up thinking about the support she received in her time of need. \u201cI was a single mom,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no one. I didn\u2019t have a job. I had twins, four kids. And I had you guys. That was the only thing.\u201dShe said abortion was never a consideration, even in the stress of previously being a single mom. \u201cYou wonder, how am I going to do this, but to get to the point of terminating (a child) for me, that has never gone through my mind.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done such a good job,\u201d Cooke told her. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good mommy.\u201dThe Rivera family donates items to Mary Queen of Angels, and asks friends to donate, as a way of giving back for the help they\u2019ve received.\u201cI try to do as much as I can,\u201d Lisbeth Rivera said.Sue Cooke visited with Lisbeth Rivera, a mother of 6, at the Rivera home in Lake St. Louis March 9. Rivera hugged Cook and cried tears of thankfulness for the help Cooke\u2019s organization, Mary Queen of Angels, has given to her over the years. \u201cI was a single mom,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI had no one. I didn\u2019t have a job. I had twins, four kids. And I had you guys.
