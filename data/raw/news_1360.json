DeSantis has to explain to every Floridian not only why he signed a law that\u00a0would force child rape and incest victims to give birth and threatens to throw doctors in jail, but what further bans he wants to implement.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first case of children being forced to choose whether to carry their pregnancy or leave the state under DeSantis\u2019 abortion ban. DeSantis has yet to answer for the tragic case of a 16-year-old Florida girl who, thanks to a law he signed, may be forced to give birth.\u00a0\nNBC News: \u201cA pregnant and parentless 16-year-old in Florida may be forced to give birth after an appeals court ruled she was not \u2018sufficiently mature to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy.\u2019\u201d\nDespite vowing to restrict abortion even further, DeSantis has repeatedly refused to answer questions about what \u201cexpanding\u201d anti-choice restrictions would entail.\u00a0\nJuly 8:\u00a0\n\n\nJuly 26:\n\n\n\nAugust 5:\n\n\n\nAugust 17:\n\n\n\nWhile he has repeatedly ducked questions on his plans since Roe v. Wade was overturned, DeSantis has already committed to an abortion ban that\u2019s even more restrictive than the current law in Florida.\nTallahassee Democrat: During his first gubernatorial campaign in 2018, when he was locked in a competitive GOP primary, DeSantis said he supported legislation that would outlaw an abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which is roughly around six weeks of pregnancy.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\n\n\n\nJoin Us\n\n\nEmail address*\n\n\n\nPhone number\n\n\n\nZip code*\n\n\n Sign up to get texts.
