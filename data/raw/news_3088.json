The expansion of abortion violence will not end well for anyone involved, and we strongly urge the residents and elected leaders of these dangerous states to make themselves heard in defense of innocent life.\u201d\nMONTPELIER, V.T., and WASHINGTON, D.C. (02-08-22) \u2013 As Vermont considers Proposition 5, a plan to enshrine abortion until birth, Students for Life Action remains steadfast in promoting the expansion of nonviolent abortion alternatives and opposing the expansion of abortion violence. Amidst select states\u2019 attempts to expand abortion, Students for Life of America offers Standing With You, a well-established initiative aimed at connecting women and families targeted by the abortion industry with the people and resources ready to serve them with nonviolent pregnancy and parenting help.\n\u201cAs the Pro-Life Generation progresses toward the Post-Roe America, Vermont has announced plans to take the state backward, enshrining abortion expansions more draconian than even Roe v. Wade,\u201d said Titus Folks, Grassroots Political Coordinator for Students for Life Action.\n\nKristan Hawkins, President of Students for Life Action and Students for Life of America, commented on the measure, saying:\n\u201cStudents for Life Action works to create oases of support and protection for children, women, and families. And we do not turn a blind eye to the states that are running headlong in the opposite direction, hell-bent on offering up the most vulnerable members of their state to as a sacrifice to appease the powerful abortion cartel. The expansion of abortion violence will not end well for anyone involved, and we strongly urge the residents and elected leaders of these dangerous states to make themselves heard in defense of innocent life.\u201d\nFurther Analysis of Vermont\u2019s Proposition 5 Available at The Federalist, HERE\nLearn more about the grassroots work of Students for Life Action HERE\nFor interviews, contact [email\u00a0protected]\n\u201330\u2013\u202f\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages.
