Megan Hunt, Jen Day and Machaela Cavanaugh embrace an abortion-rights proponent after a bill to further restrict abortion is defeated on Thursday, April 27, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014 The Nebraska Legislature fell one vote short Thursday of advancing a ban on abortions after an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity, at about six weeks into a pregnancy.\n  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston cast the pivotal vote that killed Legislative Bill 626, a proposed abortion ban tied to when an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, usually around six weeks gestation. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nRepublican State Sen. Joni Albrecht\u2019s Legislative Bill 626, fell in a similar fashion as the near-total abortion ban proposed last year. Both lost to Democratic-led filibusters in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.\n\nAlbrecht needed 33 votes to end debate on the bill. She got 32, with two senators \u2014 Merv Riepe of Ralston and Justin Wayne of Omaha \u2014 voting \u201cpresent, not voting.\u201d\nBill likely dead for year, or is it?\nThursday\u2019s vote means LB 626 is likely dead for 2023, although it\u2019s possible the bill could be revived, political observers said. Previous Legislatures have sometimes found ways to resurrect bills after a filibuster, if supporters can secure enough votes \u2014 in this case, one more.\nBut either Riepe or Wayne would have to vote differently. Both are considered swing votes.\nGov. Jim Pillen, shortly after the vote, called on Riepe, a fellow Republican, to reconsider his vote. He said Riepe should remember his pledge to be a pro-life senator.\u00a0\n\u201cPro-life has shades of gray,\u201d Riepe said after the vote.\nWayne did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. He had previously raised questions about the bill.\n  State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston explains that Legislative Bill 626 is aimed at eliminating or sharply reducing \u201celective abortions.\u201d (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\nWhy Riepe withheld his vote\nRiepe had said for weeks he would support the cardiac activity ban if conservatives gave a fair hearing and a vote to his amendment, which proposed banning abortions after 12 weeks.\u00a0\nThe former hospital administrator withheld what would have been the 33rd vote for ending debate, called cloture, in part because fellow conservatives gamed the system to ensure that senators had to vote for cloture before voting on his amendment.\nThis left conservatives little reason to consider Riepe\u2019s proposal because if the bill survived the cloture vote, supporters could pass Albrecht\u2019s initial bill, instead of the more \u201cincremental\u201d version he sought.\nRiepe, who represents a politically divided suburban district in the Omaha area, argued that LB 626 was too strict for many Nebraskans and would lead to GOP losses in 2024.\nHe and others have pointed to polling done by a conservative firm that indicated Republicans would pay a political price with voters for passing an abortion ban stricter than 12 weeks, particularly with women. He also worried about costly litigation.\nRiepe said he made a \u201cpro-life argument\u201d for the 12-week ban. He said a Millard-area constituent told him more women might keep their babies if they had enough time to make a sound decision.\n  A Capitol Security officer watches opponents of Legislative Bill 626 gather outside the legislative chamber. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\nHe said the six weeks from gestation provided by LB 626 was too short a window for many women to know they were pregnant, echoing arguments he heard from doctors he has known for 40 years.\n\u201cI want stability, and I want something that can go forward,\u201d Riepe said. \u201cI\u2019d like to just have another shot at it next year to come up with hopefully some new bill.\u201d\nHe may have additional votes for a 12-week ban, if that is proposed. State Sen. Lynne Walz of Fremont said she would support such a ban next year.\nCardiac ban was compromise, supporters say\nAlbrecht, of Thurston, and many of the Legislature\u2019s other conservatives described the cardiac activity ban as a compromise that would eliminate most \u201celective abortions.\u201d\nState Sens. John Lowe of Kearney and Barry DeKay of Niobrara shared poems and stories from the perspective of the unborn, who they said never got a chance at life.\nSupporters of LB 626 were shocked that they didn\u2019t have the votes. Albrecht appeared stunned and declined to comment. State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha said she was \u201cvery disappointed.\u201d\n  Anti-abortion Nebraskans pray in the Nebraska State Capitol Rotunda after senators voted to kill a bill to further restrict abortion on Thursday, April 27, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb.
