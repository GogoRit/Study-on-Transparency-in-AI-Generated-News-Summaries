They had been waiting all summer to hear a fetal heartbeat from Taft\u2019s belly, and after two previous healthy pregnancies, she was excited for that \u201cfirst connection with our baby.\u201d \nTaft put on a white cloth gown with little blue pansies, and the sonographer smeared gel across her not-yet-swollen abdomen, scanning for signs of life. The ultrasound tech suddenly went silent and excused herself to fetch the doctor. There was no cardiac activity to hear.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a devastating moment for anyone who wants a child,\u201d Taft said.\nFor three brutal weeks, Taft and her husband mourned the child who would never be born and waited for Taft\u2019s body to recognize that she was no longer pregnant. But nothing happened, she said. Her obstetrician, who had delivered her two older daughters, checked her periodically and asked if she had developed a fever \u2013 a sign of infection called septic abortion. One day in late August, Taft\u2019s thermometer hit 102. \nREAD MORE: Majority of Americans think Supreme Court overturning Roe was more about politics than law\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s enough. You\u2019re coming in,\u2019\u201d Taft recalled her doctor saying. \nTaft underwent surgery for an emergency dilation and curettage, often called a D&C, within hours of talking to her doctor. Even under ideal conditions, these infections, whether as a result of miscarriage or an incomplete abortion, force pregnant people and their care team to race against time before bacteria enters the patient\u2019s bloodstream. \nFour years later, infections like Taft\u2019s are likely to become far more common, complicated and costly to treat across the United States, reproductive health experts are warning. As more states ban or severely restrict abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, doctors may be unable or more hesitant to initiate the life-saving procedure that\u2019s conducted after both miscarriage and abortion, and patients may be \u201cafraid to come in,\u201d said Dr. Kim Puterbaugh, an obstetrician based in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\nDoctors may be unable or more hesitant to initiate the life-saving procedure that\u2019s conducted after both miscarriage and abortion, and patients may be \u201cafraid to come in.\u201d\n\nWhen faced with this kind of infection, \u201cit\u2019s all about getting care quickly,\u201d said Puterbaugh, president of the Society of Ob-Gyn Hospitalists, whose members manage emergency reproductive health care in hospital settings.\nEach year, Puterbaugh sees one or two cases of pregnancy-related sepsis. It\u2019s been rare in the United States for decades, and deaths from these infections have been nearly unheard of. According to maternal mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention covering the last three years, no more than 45 people died of complications linked in any way to this form of sepsis. \nBut after more than 17 years of practicing in Texas, where abortion essentially has been banned since last year, Dr. Rakhi Dimino said more patients come to her now with sepsis or hemorrhaging \u201cthan I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d\nBefore Roe enshrined the right to an abortion, these infections \u2013 and resulting deaths \u2013 were far more common, Puterbaugh said. An entire generation of obstetricians and gynecologists have been practicing medicine while sepsis during pregnancy was not a common concern, Puterbaugh said, and they may not all recognize the warning signs. \nProviders are developing new materials tailored for emergency settings. The goal is to equip providers with warning signs and symptoms so they can do a better job of identifying sometimes rapidly escalating conditions that require urgent care and connect them with at times life-saving services. \nIn states where abortion is protected, obstetricians are preparing for an influx of patients requiring care for conditions like sepsis abortion out of fear that they might be prosecuted in their home state, Dimino and Puterbaugh said. \nWhat\u2019s happening in states where abortion is restricted\nDuring a miscarriage, which experts say occur in as many as one out of three pregnancies, a patient may begin spontaneously bleeding, cramping or passing fluid or fetal tissues. Hormones typically help the body flush these products from the uterus (which must remain uncontaminated for the pregnant person\u2019s safety) and out the vagina. But sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen perfectly. After hormone levels subside, some tissue may stay behind. Remnants of that lost pregnancy could cause infection in the uterus. Signs that something has gone wrong include unpleasant odors in vaginal discharge, worsening fever and abdominal cramping. If detected early, these infections can be treated with antibiotics, and the patient\u2019s chances of recovery are high. If untreated, the patient may require a blood transfusion, a hysterectomy or other surgeries. Any delays mount risks against that patient\u2019s life.\nWATCH: Texas clinics resume abortions past 6-week mark, but women fear access may be temporary\nTypically, providers and patients have been able to discuss the risks of continuing a pregnancy and what options a pregnant person might consider for their own safety. But in Texas, which last year passed its so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d law that banned abortion services six weeks after conception (before many people realize they are pregnant), providers cannot provide elective terminations and instead must wait to have those conversations \u201cwhen the risks start,\u201d Dimino said. \nA health care provider who fails to comply with the law \u2013 including reporting people who are suspected to have sought out abortion services more than six weeks after conception \u2013 faces steep fines and the loss of their medical license. Sometimes, physicians avoid asking questions that could incriminate a patient \u2013 but looking the other way could also mean they miss critical details that could save a patient\u2019s life. \nEven in cases where a miscarriage naturally occurs, patients may fear potential legal ramifications if they disclose to their health care provider what brought them to the hospital. When patient trust in the health care system erodes, the dangers multiply, Dimino said. \n\u201cWe could be losing valuable time, [and the patient could] lose her reproductive organs and her life,\u201d Dimino said. \n\u2018The further you are from care, the worse it is\u2019\nWith new restrictions in place across much of the country, more pregnant people will need to travel further and rely on a deeper well of resources (if they have them) to prevent deadly infections. \nSixteen states and the District of Columbia each passed laws that protect the right to have an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. But given how quickly a majority of states have clamped down on abortion access, even people in states withabortion guarantees may still run into access issues because of demand spilling over from more restrictive parts of the country. \nTaft, who received a D&C after her miscarriage, said that if the same circumstances played out today, she would be forced to leave her home state of Wisconsin for treatment, find child care for her children, take time off of work, reserve and pay for a hotel room and drive four hours to Illinois to have the same procedure done. Not everyone can afford to do that. Puterbaugh said she expects sepsis infections to rise among women from low-income households and women of color, and that providers like herself simply want to respond to those in need.\nThose patients are \u201cjust going to delay care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe further you are from care, the worse it is.\u201d \nREAD MORE: Inside a Memphis clinic during its final days of abortion care\nAn obstetrician in New York state, Dr. Brigid McCue is already seeing \u201ca line being drawn\u201d across the country \u201cwhere the most marginalized, least able to care for themselves population is going to truly suffer.\u201d \nThe health care system already has been stretched thin. In 2020, as the nation wrestled with the coronavirus pandemic, maternal mortality, morbidity and related health disparities went from bad to worse. During that year, 861 women died from pregnancy-related complications, the CDC reported, up from 754 women in 2019. Black women died at a rate of 55 deaths per 100,000 live births \u2013 nearly three times the rate of white women. \n\n\n\n\nBefore the Roe decision came down in 1973, hospitals would set aside space where women with infections could die quietly.\n\nNow, in New York, McCue said she is seeing more pregnant people traveling into the state to receive abortion-related services. \n\u201cProviders in border states are completely overwhelmed with people seeking medical and surgical termination and consequences because these people are petrified with going to their emergency rooms,\u201d she said. \nHealth care workers are exhausted but want to be in a position to help anyone who comes to them in need. Puterbaugh and her colleagues with the Society of Ob-Gyn Hospitalists are producing updated training materials and simulations \u201cfor things they don\u2019t see every day\u201d that is devoted to septic abortion before they meet this September. They created similar guidelines when the coronavirus compelled them to figure out how to save pregnant people in crisis and infected with COVID. At the start of the pandemic, Puterbaugh said, no one knew how to treat pregnant people in COVID wards or how to intervene if those patients entered a crisis. They developed guidelines as the pandemic dragged on, treating women who endured respiratory failure and sharing their lessons through remote simulations (another experience largely informed through what they learned along the way). \nWATCH: Doctors worry abortion laws will hinder treatment of patients in life-or-death situations\nPuterbaugh said the new training on septic abortions will include a lecture and simulations that attempt to replicate different scenarios that can develop into septic shock. It will also include hands-on coursework. \n\u201cThe fact is medically, whether a septic abortion occurs after a miscarriage or an abortion, the way OB-GYNs manage the mother is the same,\u201d Puterbaugh said. \nBefore the Roe decision came down in 1973, hospitals would set aside space where women with infections could die quietly. For years, retired obstetricians and reproductive health advocates have reminded the public of these haunting facilities. With restrictions on reproductive health care again descending on a growing number of states, the need for so-called \u201cseptic wards\u201d may return. Puterbaugh\u2019s goal is trying to do everything she can to stop that from happening. \n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                An entire generation of obstetricians and gynecologists have been practicing medicine while sepsis during pregnancy was not a common concern, and they may not all recognize the warning signs, reproductive health experts say.
