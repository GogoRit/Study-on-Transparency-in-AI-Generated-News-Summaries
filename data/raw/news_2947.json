Wade, the Post-Roe Generation is gathering outside of abortion facilities across the nation to cover sidewalks in life-affirming messages and offer abortion-seeking women resources on choosing life. If you don\u2019t have plans today (or if you just want to change them), you should join us in on the frontlines for a unique way to sidewalk counsel. Here\u2019s what pro-lifers around the country will be up to:\nWe will be decorating the sidewalks in front of abortion facilities with colorful, life-affirming messages to remind mothers that they don\u2019t need abortion to succeed and that life is sacred and beautiful. Members of the Pro-Life Generation who signed up in advance will also be handing out Standing With You blessing bags: bags full of informational cards (on when life begins; Abortion Pill Reversal treatment; etc.), a No Woman Stands Alone t-shirt, a hand-written letter, and other gifts for the mother such as lotions and chap sticks.\n\n\nIf you decide to participate in National Pro-Life Sidewalk Day with us today (and we hope you do), here\u2019s a good list of things to remember while you are out publicly witnessing for life.\nDo\u2019s:\nBe peaceful, helpful, goal-orientedSmile and be pleasantStay vigilant and aware of your surroundingsHave compassionKnow the literature you have in your handBack up what you sayShow each woman that you care about her, not just the childSpeak clearly and loudly enough to hear\u00a0\nDon\u2019ts:\nDo not yellDo not display unapproachable body language (crossing arms, grumpy expression, etc.)Do not block the woman\u2019s walking pathDo not be aggressiveDo not evangelizeDo not\u00a0goof aroundDo not touch the person \u2013 be respectful of personal spaceDo not break the law (e.g. don\u2019t touch the front door, respect property lines, etc.)Do not carry signs if you\u2019re counseling. Stick to in-hand literature.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nNot Sure What Messages to Chalk? \nYou Are Loved Need Resources?
