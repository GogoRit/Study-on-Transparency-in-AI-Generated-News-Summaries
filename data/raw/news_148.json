The ordinance aims to outlaw abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court makes it possible to do so. It also grants family members of women who have abortions the ability to sue the provider for emotional distress.\nBig Spring\u2019s vote was tentative; a majority of City Council members will need to vote once more in favor of the ordinance for it to pass. Colorado City\u2019s vote, which also banned the sale of emergency contraception such as Plan B, was final, making it the eighth local government with such an ordinance in effect, according to the anti-abortion group pushing them. The East Texas town of Rusk approved a similar ordinance last week.\nThe ordinances are of contested legality and enforceability. The American Civil Liberties Union has said it is investigating a possible lawsuit seeking to strike them down. Three towns \u2014 Mineral Wells, Omaha and Jacksboro \u2014 have voted down similar ordinances or walked them back under advice from city attorneys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t discouraged Mark Lee Dickson, the traveling anti-abortion activist who hopes to galvanize a statewide movement and perhaps provoke a lawsuit that could change abortion law nationwide.\n\u201cWe have every intention of targeting every part of the state,\u201d said Dickson, who said he is traveling to Levelland this week in hopes of persuading the town west of Lubbock to adopt a similar ordinance. \u201cEvery city, no matter what size, is valuable.\u201d\nAbortion rights advocates say the local ordinances are dangerous and intentionally confusing because they may lead people to believe, falsely, that abortion is illegal.\n\"This extreme proposal is a tactic for abortion opponents to score political points and mislead Texans about their rights,\" said Kamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps low-income women afford abortion. \"Access to reproductive care and abortion allows individuals and families to receive the support needed to thrive in our state.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strategy of bringing the abortion fight to the local level has divided even the staunchest anti-abortion activists. Some groups, including the Texas Alliance for Life, have warned against taking an inflammatory approach that is unlikely to survive a legal contest and could set the anti-abortion movement back in court.\nMost provisions of the ordinance would not take effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court issues a new opinion on the legality of abortion. Specifically, the high court would need to overrule its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, a case that originated in Texas and led to the legalization of abortion nationwide by nullifying state laws that banned the procedure.\nAnd the court would need to reverse its 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allowed states to enact abortion restrictions only if they do not place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman seeking to terminate her pregnancy.\nBut the ordinances, which do not make exceptions for rape or incest, immediately allow \u201cany surviving relative of the aborted unborn child\u201d to sue a person in civil court for performing an abortion within the towns where they were passed. In some towns, a person could also be sued for transporting a woman to an abortion clinic or helping pay for the procedure, though local officials have said that language is largely symbolic and would be difficult to enforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the \u201csanctuary cities for the unborn\u201d is home to an abortion clinic, and the number of clinics in Texas has plummeted in recent years thanks to increasing restrictions on abortion rights imposed by the Texas Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
