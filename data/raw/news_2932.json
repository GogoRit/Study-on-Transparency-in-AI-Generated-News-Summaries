Turner, who does not have a permanent home, came to Washington, D.C., with her 6-month-old son to be close to her mother while seeking refuge from an abusive partner. Similar situations often lead women to consider abortion, and the pro-life movement is working on new ways to make abortion unthinkable for women.

He argues that this form of pro-life advocacy is more consistent with the breadth of Catholic social teaching and also includes possibilities for bipartisan collaboration.\nWhile Pro-Life 3.0 represents a shift in approach, it builds on previous phases of the pro-life movement, as Camosy explained in a recent Religion News Service column. Pro-Life 1.0, he wrote, came before Roe v. Wade and was a \u201cpolitically complex movement\u201d that did not fit within the left-right political divide. Following Roe, Pro-Life 2.0 was defined largely by its fusionism, channeling political activism largely through a coalition of the religious right, small-government libertarians, and anti-communist hawks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis made for some strange bedfellows,\u201d Camosy noted in his column.\n\u00a0\nPro-Life 3.0, Explained\u00a0\nWith the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision, the landscape of abortion law \u2014 and the potential for political action by the pro-life movement \u2014 has changed.\u00a0\n\u201cBefore Dobbs, legislators lacked the ability to take a comprehensive approach to pro-life policy-making,\u201d Rick Garnett, a Notre Dame Law School professor, told the Register. \u201cThe court\u2019s misguided decisions in Roe and Casey denied citizens the capacity to express in law and policy a commitment to the human dignity of both unborn children and pregnant women.\u201d\nFreed from the limitations imposed by Roe, and coinciding with the Republican Party\u2019s populist shift, Camosy said that the pro-life movement now has the opportunity for \u201cnew and creative political arrangements that were not possible before.\u201d\nWithin this possibility for new arrangements, Camosy said this is an opportunity for Catholics to support a political agenda that more fully comports with Catholic social teaching.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[Pro-Life 3.0] combines a firm and uncompromising insistence on the radical equality of all human beings regardless of age, level of ability, wantedness, dependence, etc. \u2014 an equality that demands equal protection of the law for those who don't have it \u2014 with a deep and profound commitment to support those beyond mere equal protection of the law, including massive commitments of social welfare through redistribution of wealth,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGovernment Involvement\nCamosy\u2019s approach has a greater openness to the use of government power and programs in service of mothers and children than has been typical in the previous phase of the movement, given the connection to a broader coalition that emphasized limited government.\u00a0\nGarnett cautioned that Pro-Life 3.0 will need to include good policy, learning from the history of previous American welfare programs and seeking insight from evidence-based evaluations and cost-benefit determinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no virtue involved in well-meaning spending that does not accomplish its goals,\u201d said Garnett, adding that proposals should respect the principle of subsidiarity and the rights of parents and families.\u00a0\n\u201cPro-Life 3.0 need not be \u2018statist\u2019 to be effective,\u201d he said.\nPatrick Brown, a fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center with a focus on developing a pro-family economic agenda, told the Register that the Catholic emphasis on subsidiarity, a principle that recognizes social challenges should be addressed at the most immediate \u00a0level of society capable of doing so, underscores the importance of local faith-based organizations and pregnancy centers. Brown described these initiatives as \u201cthe backbone of the pro-life movement\u201d and noted that the number of women seeking their services will likely increase post-Roe.\nBut Brown also noted that Church teaching on solidarity recognizes a legitimate role for the government in supporting pregnant women.\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying that the pregnant woman \u2014 and, more specifically, her child \u2014 has a claim on society\u2019s resources to make sure that the mom isn\u2019t economically pressured into choosing abortion and that they are happy and healthy,\u201d Brown explained.\u00a0\nHe suggested that states consider expanding Medicaid for pregnant mothers or funding home-visiting programs to address postpartum maternal health. Brown also noted the Providing for Life Act from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and the Family Security Act from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, as encouraging models for pro-family legislation by Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to approach this with [the attitude of] \u2018Let\u2019s replicate a Scandinavian welfare state in the U.S.,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut we can think about ways to be building up civil society outreach and direct funding, in some cases, to groups that are going to be building those webs of support around pregnant moms.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBipartisan Possibilities\nCamosy, a longtime Democrat who left the party in 2020 due to its increasing extremism on abortion, also argued that the end of Roe and a shift to a Pro-Life 3.0 approach will create more opportunities for bipartisanship.\n\u201c[No]w that we got what we needed from the national GOP \u2014 judges which got us the end of Roe and Casey \u2014 the pro-life movement can be much more nimble and intentional about working with multiple players in achieving the fullness of our goals,\u201d he told the Register.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the national level, Camosy argued that many of the circumstantial factors that increase a woman\u2019s likelihood to choose abortion could be addressed through bipartisan action, bringing together both Democrat and Republican policy preferences. He suggested policies like paid family leave, childcare assistance, child tax credits and additional funding for women\u2019s shelters offering safety from domestic violence as starting points for creative pro-life policy aimed at reducing economic factors that push women toward abortion.\u00a0\nCamosy is not alone in envisioning a future that embraces bipartisan political arrangements. Noted legal scholars and pro-life advocates Carter Snead and Mary Ann Glendon recently wrote in The Washington Post that the \u201cculture of life movement\u201d must \u201cact decisively to address the wide range of issues \u2014 from poverty to lack of support from fathers \u2014 that lead women to choose abortion in the first place.\u201d\nAttention to the issues surrounding abortion will create an opportunity for broad coalitions of citizens who, while they may disagree about abortion, nevertheless can work together to support women and children in crisis. Instead of focusing on party preferences regarding the role and size of government, Snead and Glendon suggested that the future of the pro-life movement will require both conservatives and liberals to focus on finding policies that effectively support women.\u00a0\n\u201cThe right answer might very well require new government programs and increased spending, greater support for and delegation to nonprofit care providers, or some combination of these approaches,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLimitations?\nBut not all pro-lifers are optimistic about bipartisan collaboration, especially at a time when, as Brown has noted, Democrats are increasingly presenting themselves as \u201cpro-abortion\u201d and not merely \u201cpro-choice.\u201d\nFor instance, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has voiced her desire to shut down pregnancy centers, which she said spread \u201cdisinformation\u201d about abortion and the various options available to pregnant women. She has introduced a bill that would give the Federal Trade Commission regulatory power over advertising by pregnancy centers. \u201c[W]e need to shut them down all around the country. You should not be able to torture a pregnant person like that,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cTo be clear,\u201d Brown wrote in a column responding to Warren, \u201cthe \u2018torture\u2019 she is talking about is providing baby clothes, diapers, formula, childcare and utilities assistance, job training, and other services aimed at the crucial pre- and post-natal periods in a new mom\u2019s life.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently vetoed more than $20 million in funding aimed at assisting pregnant women in need, promoting adoption as an alternative to abortion and supporting pregnancy centers that help women who choose life, reported the Michigan Catholic Conference.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, Michigan is reeling from abortion extremism,\u201d said Rebecca Mastee, policy advocate with the Michigan Catholic Conference. She added that the Michigan Catholic Conference supports policies to limit or end abortion, while also advocating for policies that strengthen families, promote marriage and provide for children in need.\u00a0\nCurrently, with a \u201cReproductive Freedom for All\u201d constitutional amendment likely to appear on the ballot in November, Mastee said that the conference is focusing on educating Catholics and Michigan residents on the dangers the amendment poses by allowing unlimited abortion up to the moment of birth. \u00a0\u00a0\nAlthough Camosy described Whitmer\u2019s veto as \u201cterrible,\u201d he still sees potential for cooperation across the aisle.\u00a0\n\u201cShe and others like her are people we can and should cooperate with to reduce the demand for abortion,\u201d he told the Register.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown suggested that the increased \u201cfanaticism\u201d of many Democrats on the issue of abortion may determine the political future of the pro-life movement. He said the most viable future for the pro-life movement is within the institutional conservative movement, which can work to address both supply and demand for abortion.\u00a0\nWith the end of Roe, \u201cRepublicans have a golden opportunity to be the party that is authentically pro-life, pro-parent and pro-family,\u201d said Brown.\n\u00a0\nToward a Consistent Ethic\nBrown recognizes that Catholics have long been frustrated by the propensity of both Republican and Democrat platforms to pick and choose aspects of the Church\u2019s teachings, and he sees Pro-Life 3.0 as an opportunity to break down some divides between left and right.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the ideas [of Pro-life 3.0] are new \u2014 the ideas have been around. But they\u2019ve just been unable to be combined because of the political realities on the ground.\u201d\u00a0\nSome politicians have already implemented policies consistent with the Pro-Life 3.0 approach.\u00a0\nPrior to the overturning of Roe, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards \u2014 a Catholic pro-life Democrat \u2014 signed two bills into law that protect life: One updated existing state \u201ctrigger\u201d laws to include criminal penalties for abortionists who break the law, and the other made it illegal to send abortifacients by mail. But he has also previously taken steps to bolster support for women and families, including a 2016 Medicaid expansion in his first act as governor.\nCamosy described Edwards\u2019 actions to protect life as \u201ca beautiful witness to the Pro-Life 3.0 that is to come.\u201d Meanwhile, the White House has denounced Louisiana\u2019s recently passed pro-life laws as \u201cthe latest step in a growing attack against the fundamental freedoms of Americans.\u201d\nJason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference, said that the Pro-Life 3.0 approach reflects the \u201cconsistent ethic of life\u201d that the Church and state Catholic conferences have always brought to questions of public policy.\u00a0\n\u201cIt recognizes that the decision to procure an abortion is multifaceted and that we must love and care for both the mother and the preborn child,\u201d he told the Register.\u00a0\nBy advocating in this way, Adkins said Catholics in the public square \u201care reintegrating what the world pulls apart,\u201d noting that people often \u201ccannot get their head around this concept [of public policy developed from principles of Catholic social teaching] because it doesn\u2019t fit into traditional left-right binaries.\u201d\nSince at least one in five abortions are procured for economic reasons, Adkins said that the Minnesota Catholic Conference has focused its advocacy on policies that remove barriers to family formation and stability, such as a child tax credit. But he also emphasized that the shift of emphasis in the Pro-Life 3.0 approach can\u2019t leave out working to restrict access to abortion.\n\u201cCreative policies that offer economic support for women in need and limit demand for abortion are necessary, but not sufficient,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cAdvocating for childcare assistance, paid family leave and better health care does not absolve one of the responsibility to work for an end to legal abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nCamosy takes a similar stance. \u201cPrenatal justice is still our highest priority,\u201d he told the Register. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut, one, we can walk and chew gum at the same time; and, two, lots of other interventions on other issues end up driving down the demand for abortion, supporting women and families, while saving the lives of babies.\u201d\u00a0\nMary Frances Myler is a fellow with the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Center for Citizenship and Constitutional Government.
