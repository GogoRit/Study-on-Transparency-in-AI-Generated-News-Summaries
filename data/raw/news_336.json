A coalition of dozens of groups held a National Day of Action to Stop the Bans, with other events planned throughout the week.\t\t\n\nBy Judith Kohler | jkohler@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: November 3, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. | UPDATED: November 4, 2020 at 2:49 p.m.A ban on most abortions at 22 weeks or later in pregnancy was defeated Tuesday night as voters rejected the fourth attempt since 2008 to more stringently regulate abortions in Colorado.\nAbout 1.6 million voters, or 59.2%, rejected Proposition 115 with 83% of the vote counted, while 1.1 million, or 40.8%, supported it.\nProponents, who said they had strong grassroots support, were vastly outspent by opponents. Proponents spent $505,488, compared to opponents\u2019 nearly $9 million, according to the Colorado News Collaborative\u2019s FollowtheMoneyCO project.\nThe ballot measure would have subjected doctors even attempting to perform a later-term abortion to misdemeanor charges and at least a three-year suspension of their license. The only exception would have been for an abortion that is immediately required to save the woman\u2019s life.\n\u201cThis measure bears no relation to previous attempts to pass personhood amendments in Colorado, which would have banned all abortions,\u201d said Giuliana Day with Due Date Too Late, an organization that campaigned for the initiative.\nDay said opponents used scare tactics to sway voters even though the proposal was a reasonable restriction and amounted to a human rights issue. \n\n\nHowever, those campaigning against Proposition 115 said it would have undermined women\u2019s rights to reproductive health.\n\u201cFor the fourth time in 12 years, Coloradans have rejected attempts to ban abortion at the ballot, trusting patients and families to make the personal medical decisions that are right for them, without interference from politicians,\u201d Lucy Olena, campaign manager for the No on 115 campaign, said in a statement. \n\n\nColorado was the first state in the country to decriminalize abortion, passing a law in 1967 to allow the procedure in cases of rape, incest, if the woman\u2019s health was threatened or if the unborn child might have birth defects.\nThe vote on abortion restrictions came as the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court has raised the stakes for the fate of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. Barrett has been involved in organizations opposed to abortion.\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\t\t\tTrailblazing Colorado abortion law marks 50th anniversary\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat\u2019s Colorado Proposition 115: Banning abortion at 22 weeks\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOpposition to 22-week abortion ban winning the money race among Colorado issue campaigns\t\t\n\n\nAbortions later in pregnancy make up only about 1.3% of abortions overall, said Karen Middleton, president of Cobalt, a Colorado organization that advocates for access to abortion and reproductive rights. She said the abortions are performed when a woman\u2019s health is endangered or when something is wrong with the unborn child.\n\u201cThe proposition is designed to sound reasonable, but it is not,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is inserting an arbitrary line and essentially putting politics into the doctor\u2019s office and into a family\u2019s decision.\u201d\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPolicies\nReport an Error\nContact Us\nSubmit a News Tip\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularColorado\u2019s first Buc-ee\u2019s opens its doors with Texas brisket, beaver nuggets and super-clean restroomsColorado's first Buc-ee's opens its doors with Texas brisket, beaver nuggets and super-clean restroomsUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at Westminster school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at Westminster school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesNikola Jokic, Nuggets react to Kyrie Irving buzzer beater hook shot in Dallas: \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of basketball\u201dNikola Jokic, Nuggets react to Kyrie Irving buzzer beater hook shot in Dallas: \"That's the beauty of basketball\"Under Colorado\u2019s new water-saving law, here\u2019s where ornamental grass will be banned starting in 2026Under Colorado's new water-saving law, here's where ornamental grass will be banned starting in 2026Avalanche defenseman sells mansion in Denver\u2019s Belcaro neighborhood for $3.75MAvalanche defenseman sells mansion in Denver's Belcaro neighborhood for $3.75MJudge finds sexual assault claim against Colorado lawmaker \u201cincredible,\u201d casting doubt on allegationsJudge finds sexual assault claim against Colorado lawmaker \"incredible,\" casting doubt on allegationsKeeler: NCAA Tournament selection committees did CU Buffs, CSU Rams dirtyKeeler: NCAA Tournament selection committees did CU Buffs, CSU Rams dirtyAvalanche\u2019s Nathan MacKinnon after incredible battle with Oilers: \u201cThat game means a little more\u201dAvalanche's Nathan MacKinnon after incredible battle with Oilers: \"That game means a little more\"March Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentMarch Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentAssault weapons ban, single-stair development, air-quality bills in the Colorado legislature this weekAssault weapons ban, single-stair development, air-quality bills in the Colorado legislature this week \n\n\n\nTrending Nationally\nCalifornia\u2019s largest new reservoir project in 50 years gains momentumUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesMarch Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentSocial media influencer arrested in Irvine on suspicion of joining the attack on the US CapitolInvestigators hunted one of Florida\u2019s most prolific serial rapists for decades.
