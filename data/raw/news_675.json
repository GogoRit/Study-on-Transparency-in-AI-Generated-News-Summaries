The governor is expected to sign the bill into law, and it would go into effect this summer.\nOnce in place, the law would have major regional impacts. More Texans have sought abortions in Oklahoma than in any other state since a Texas law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy went into effect Sept. 1.\n\u201cOklahoma is going from a state where we\u2019ve been a haven for refugees who\u2019ve needed support to a state that has chosen to make refugees of its own citizens,\u201d said Emily Wales, the interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates clinics in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma has been scrambling to keep up with the deluge of patients from Texas for more than seven months. The state\u2019s four providers have extended hours, hired additional staff and worked long shifts to absorb more than 600 additional patients a month.\nBut now, these providers are facing the opposite problem: not a deluge, but a drought, as the state follows its neighbor\u2019s lead in limiting abortion access.\nBefore the ban\nOn a recent Wednesday morning, the Trust Women abortion clinic in Oklahoma City got more than 200 phone calls in just two hours. People were calling, again and again, trying to get through to someone so they could book an appointment for an abortion several weeks out.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything special happening that Wednesday,\u201d said communications director Zack Gingrich-Gaylord. \u201cThat has just been the case every day since Aug. 31.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma\u2019s four abortion clinics \u2014 two in Tulsa and two in Oklahoma City \u2014 have absorbed more Texas patients than any other state. Nearly half of all Texans who got abortions out of state between September and December went to Oklahoma, according to a study from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin.\nOklahoma\u2019s population is a fraction of the size of Texas\u2019, and the state has historically provided a fraction of the abortions \u2014 roughly 5,000 procedures in 2019, compared with more than 56,000 in Texas.\nTo accommodate more than 600 additional procedures a month, the Oklahoma clinics have had to scale up \u2014 and scale back. Trust Women has stopped providing other health care services to focus more fully on abortion care, doubling clinic days and adding half a dozen doctors between its two clinics.\nThe clinics are seeing more patients later in pregnancy because of weekslong waiting lists. And still, they\u2019re having to turn a lot of patients away, creating a regional ripple effect as patients from Oklahoma are pushed into Kansas and Illinois.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe capacity of these states is not enough for their own state, let alone to be able to absorb \u2026 Texas\u2019s needs, even if you split them up,\u201d Gingrich-Gaylord said. \u201cAnd again, people shouldn\u2019t have to leave their own communities for health care.\u201d\nAt Planned Parenthood\u2019s two Oklahoma clinics, Texas patients made up 60% of the caseload between September and January, compared with just 10% during that same period in 2020, according to a spokesperson.\nOklahoma\u2019s existing abortion restrictions also made it a somewhat more convenient option for Texans seeking care. The state has a 72-hour waiting period, but unlike in neighboring Arkansas, the first visit does not need to be in person.\nIf Oklahoma\u2019s new abortion ban becomes law, Texans will have to either travel further or stay longer \u2014 or carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult for people to travel out of state [for an abortion] already,\u201d said Cristina Parker with the Lilith Fund, a nonprofit that helps Texans pay for abortions. \u201cHaving anything happen in a neighboring state that would cut off that access even more just makes every single one of those barriers a little bit more intense.\u201d\nIn the first few months of this year, about a third of the Lilith Fund\u2019s clients went to Oklahoma for care.\n\u201cFor someone who can\u2019t just dip into a savings account, who can\u2019t schedule paid time off, who has to find child care,\u201d Parker said, \u201cit\u2019s not an option to go further, spend more and be away from home longer.\u201d\nThe Oklahoma House of Representatives recently passed a bill that banned abortions by empowering private citizens to bring lawsuits against anyone who \u201caided or abetted\u201d in an abortion. The bill is in front of the Senate and contained an emergency provision that allowed it to go into effect as soon as the governor signed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in a surprise move Tuesday, the House passed a different bill, making it a felony for doctors to provide abortions. The bill already passed the Senate last year, and it now goes to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. According to the Associated Press, Stitt has said he will sign any anti-abortion bill that comes to his desk.\nThe law, which is expected to go into effect this summer, would likely be found to violate the abortion protections enshrined in the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. But the high court is expected to rule this summer on a Mississippi case that could overturn both of those cases, allowing laws like Oklahoma's to withstand court challenge.\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood and the University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
