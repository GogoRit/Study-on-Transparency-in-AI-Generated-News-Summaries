The impetus came from an\r\narticle she read about Luncheons4Life and its founder, Mike Hammer, published in\r\nthe June 2012 issue of The Word Among Us. \nHammer\r\ncredited divine inspiration for the idea of hosting a free luncheon to bring\r\ntogether pro-life workers of all denominations at one of the finest restaurants\r\nin New Orleans. He has been doing so since 2005. \nHis\r\nhope that other businesspeople around the country would step up and do the same\r\nresonated with Marrone, who had just retired and was looking for \u201csomething fun\r\nto do.\u201d \n  Photographer: ANNE DIBERNARDO | FC Luncheons4Life organizer Jacqueline Debs says she wishes to create a safe space where all pro-lifers can gather, support each other, and not judge each other. She also wants to remove the stigma from the pro-life movement in the general community and bring in people who are not necessarily pro-life, but are people of goodwill who have never been to a pro-life activity. \nPartnering\r\nwith Kathie Majerchin, a good friend and then director of development for Solve\r\nMaternity Home, they held the first luncheon in April 2013 in Sarasota. Although\r\nMajerchin died in 2016, divine providence intervened, bringing along Jeannine\r\nByrne, also a retired pregnancy care center director, who became instrumental\r\nin the project before Majerchin\u2019s death. \nToday,\r\nMarrone holds 11 Luncheons4Life per month, seven in Florida and one each in\r\nAtlanta, Alton/St. Louis Metro East, Louisville, and Oklahoma City. \nWith\r\nsmooth, franchise-like consistency, Luncheons4Life functions as if on\r\nauto-pilot. And while the list of speakers is impressive, the apex of the event\r\nis the passing of the mic. \nAs\r\nwith superconductivity, where electrons perform with greater efficiency when\r\nthey pair up, momentum results when abortion counselors come out of their\r\nindependent silos and engage with maternity care centers or adoption agencies. \nMarrone\r\nexplained that silos are great for grain and corn, but they impede activities\r\nthat are beneficial to society, which thrive on interaction. \n\u201cThings\r\nrarely happen over the phone when you don\u2019t see people face to face,\u201d said\r\nMarrone, who believes opportunities for interconnectivity around a good meal\r\nare inside God\u2019s providence. \u201cYou want to link arms and hands and motion in the\r\nsame direction. If you can get them all together, they can do it together and\r\nleverage all that energy, which means less work, less money and optimal\r\noutcomes.\u201d \n\u00a0\nNO\r\nCOST, NO ASK, NO POLITICS\nThe\r\nthree hallmarks of the platform \u2013 no cost, no ask, and no politics \u2013 may fly in\r\nthe face of conventional business wisdom, but Marrone does not want to sell you\r\na bridge, and she will not accept donations. She also holds that it is not laws\r\nthat change hearts, but hearts that change laws. \n\u201cPolitics\r\nsucks the air out of what you can do. There are things that can be done at a\r\ngrass root, local level that do not need a politization or local official\u2019s\r\ninvolvement,\u201d Marrone said.\nAs\r\nfor the luncheons\u2019 smooth running, \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of administration but then\r\nyou just get out of the way,\u201d she said, recounting a story from the early days about\r\na group of ladies who were traveling from Bradenton to the Sarasota luncheon. \nMajerchin\r\nthought about splitting the women up at different tables once they arrived. But\r\nMarrone reasoned otherwise. \u201cNo Kathie, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d she told her. \u201cWe\r\nhave to rely on the Holy Spirit to sit people where they are supposed to be.\r\nOnce you try to over-orchestrate, you are trying to overlay your will with\r\nGod\u2019s will.\u201d\n\u201cHow\r\nmuch easier life could be if I leaned on the will of God in all aspects of my\r\nlife like we do for Lunchons4Life,\u201d Marrone said, emphasizing that\r\nLuncheons4Life is not run by a village, but from the Kingdom above, where she\r\nis confident \u201cKathie is truly, and effectively assisting with \u2018orchestration.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\nCOORDINATION\nIt\r\nmay be worth prefacing that Marrone is a daily communicant and spends much time\r\npraying before the Blessed Sacrament. She also enjoys playing golf, a sport which\r\nshe started inviting God into because of its numerous philosophical parallels with\r\nlife \u2014especially in terms of attitude and decision-making. \nIf\r\nMarrone wouldn\u2019t grab a chipping wedge without consulting God, it\u2019s a safe bet\r\nthat each person she chooses to coordinate and organize the local luncheons has\r\nbeen pre-selected by him. \n  Photographer: ANNE DIBERNARDO | FC Luncheons4Life organizers Tom Walker, top, and Paul Herron take a turn at the mic at Tropical Acres Steakhouse in Fort Lauderdale in January 2022. Herron heads the luncheons for Palm Beach County.\r\n\r\nHe encourages everyone to not give up on adult children.  \r\n\"We have to tell them about the importance and value of chastity and abstinence, and the right time and place to share that true, mature adult love within the context of a holy marriage. It's just really something that we have to do because everything else is trying to recover from not having done that. When you think about all the things we have to do, it\u2019s all after the fact.\" \nPaul\r\nHerron\u2019s homeless feeding ministry led him to come to Luncheons4Life in Broward\r\nCounty, hoping to find help for a pregnant woman on his feeding line. He just happened\r\nto sit next to Marrone herself and was later approached about organizing a\r\nluncheon in Palm Beach County. \nJacqueline\r\nDebs is the Miami-Dade County field director for the Susan B. Anthony List, a\r\nnational prolife networking organization. She has been working for the prolife\r\ncommunity over 30 years, including globally. Marrone approached her to organize\r\nthe Miami-Dade County luncheons.\n\u201cI\r\nknew this was going to be a safe space for all prolifers to come together and\r\nthat is what was needed in South Florida,\u201d said Debs, who first attended the\r\nmonthly luncheon held in Broward County. There she met its organizer, Tom\r\nWalker, director of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s 40 Days for Life campaign. \nBroward\r\nCounty now alternates luncheons each month with Miami-Dade County, with luncheons\r\nheld on second Thursdays. The venues in South Florida include 94th Aero\r\nSquadron (Miami), Tropical Acres Steakhouse (Fort Lauderdale), and Seasons 52\r\n(Palm Beach Gardens).\n\u201cI\r\nwant them to come to this wonderful lunch with wonderful people and understand\r\nthat the prolife\r\nmovement is a grassroots movement that is in their homes, communities, and\r\nchurches and is made of normal, decent people who are trying to do the right\r\nthing, and to also understand all the good that the prolife community is\r\ndoing,\u201d Debs said. \n\u00a0\n\u2018THIS\r\nTHING WORKS\u2019\nGabriela\r\nCejnarova is a Respect Life parish representative at St. Bartholomew in Miramar\r\nwho just began attending the luncheons. Cejnarova brought her pastor, Father\r\nAndrew Chan-A-Sue, and another friend who wants to get involved in the prolife\r\nministry as a result of Luncheons4Life. \n  Photographer: ANNE DIBERNARDO | FC St. Bartholomew's pastor, Father Andrew Chan-A-Sue attended his first Luncheon4Life as a guest of his parishioner and Respect life parish representative, Gabriela Cejnarova. \n\u201cI think that it is a source of encouragement,\u201d said Father Chan-A-Sue. \u201cWe\r\nmeet others who are passionate about defending the sanctity of human life and\r\nthis energizes us because most other Catholics around us are lukewarm on this\r\nissue.\u00a0It is also a source of the many other different ways and techniques\r\nwe can educate others on the sanctity of life.\u201d \nHe\r\ncautioned, however, that \u201cunless we put into practice what we learn at these\r\nmeetings, this could result in lots of discussion and socializing and no\r\naction.\u201d\nBut\r\nif that were true, Marrone said she would have quit years ago. \u201cThis is not\r\njust a fun thing \u2013 this thing works.\u201d\u00a0 \nAsk\r\nSuzanne Mendez, who shared how the Holy Spirit showed up at Seasons 52, the\r\nluncheon venue in Palm Beach Gardens, with an immediate answer to a very\r\nspecific prayer, a desire that had been on her heart for months. She needed resources\r\nto create a national online directory of life-affirming organizations. \n\u201cIt\r\ngoes to show that the Holy Spirit is working through these events,\u201d Mendez said,\r\nadding that the new directory should be available soon. \n\u201cThrough\r\nLuncheons4Life, we have been able to come and help others in their ministries and\r\nthey have brought referrals to us,\u201d said Toni Weiz, founder of Ashes to Beauty,\r\na post-abortion healing program in Palm Beach County that is also available\r\nonline.\n\u201cThree\r\nof us have given our testimonies at Luncheons4Life, which is great experience\r\nand great practice. Now that we have more and more speaking engagements, that\r\nhas launched us into an area that I don\u2019t know that we would be doing if it\r\nweren\u2019t for Luncheons4Life,\u201d Weis said.\n\u201cAbortion\r\nis the most important issue we are dealing with in our society; it is the worst\r\nevil,\u201d said Tewannah Amen, director of Broward Right to Life. \u201cWe are each an\r\nindividual who can make a difference for life. We have that circle of\r\ninfluence, people that we know. It\u2019s so important for us to present the truth\r\nand not be afraid.\u201d \n\u201cEvery\r\ntime the bill is paid, I must question whether there is any other place that\r\nmoney could be better spent, and the answer is no, because it has a knock-on\r\neffect,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cIt\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving.\u201d\u00a0\n\nEXPANDING\r\nTHE CONCEPT\nAs\r\na result of a post-abortion testimony given at a Luncheon4Life in Sarasota, Janine\r\nMarrone realized there is more than one victim of abortion. After bringing Project\r\nRachel, which helps post-abortive women, to the St. Petersburg Diocese, she\r\nestablished another initiative, Support After Abortion, an international\r\ninterfaith clearinghouse that promotes abortion healing.\nMarrone\r\nis now looking to expand the concept to other areas. She is looking at charities\r\nand agencies that work on hunger and homelessness, silos of activity where\r\npeople might not talk to each other and no single agency is one-stop shopping.\n\u201cWhen\r\nyou bring like-minded people around an issue, it can get solved,\u201d Marrone said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature NewsCatholic school eighth graders explore faith and science at Greater Love ConferenceArt at St. Joseph ChurchLivestream: Requiem Mass for the ForgottenCheers to beer and Lenten reflectionsCabrini: patroness of the indomitableA \u2018Lions\u2019 Den\u2019 for the Mighty LionsArchbishop honored for his dedication to Catholic education6 Pierced Hearts Sisters profess final vowsHomiliesWe invoke the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete to stand beside youYou are helping to bring people to JesusEl testimonio del cristiano hoy es dar testimonio de la esperanza \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nArchdiocese of Miami\n9401 Biscayne Boulevard\nMiami Shores, FL 33138\n(305) 757-6241\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nCatholic Links\nNews Widget\nJob Openings\nRSS - Archdiocesan News\nE-Library\nWebmail\n\n\nFAQs\nLooking for a Church?\nMarriage Preparation\nSacramental Records & Certificates\nAnnulment Information\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by  | E-system\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply\n\n\n\n\n"
