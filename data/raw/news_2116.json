In fact, in our review, we found that we were able to get atleast a full day of use and around five to six hours of screen on time. But for some, it still may not be enough.\nLuckily, there are some ways that you can improve the battery life on the OnePlus 8 Pro and get even more juice out of this phone on a single charge.Advertisement\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to dark mode\nOnePlus offers a number of settings for customizing your smartphone, in Oxygen OS. One of those settings includes dark mode. Which is a system-wide dark mode and it looks amazing. In fact, with the OnePlus 8 series, it debuted Dark Mode 2.0, which is even better.\n\nBy turning on dark mode, you\u2019re going to be able to really improve your battery life, because the OnePlus 8 Pro uses an AMOLED display. And the reason why darker colors save battery more, is because OLED displays light up each pixel individually. Meaning that a dark display is going to use a lot less juice than a white display. The difference between dark mode and light mode, is actually pretty astounding.\nIn our testing, we were able to get another hour or two of screen on time by switching to dark mode. Of course, your results are going to vary, as we all use our phones differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the screen resolution & refresh rate\nThe OnePlus 8 Pro has a Quad HD+ display, with a refresh rate of 120Hz. Now out of the box, it will be set to QHD+ and 120Hz. Which is going to give you a really great looking display on your new smartphone. Unfortunately, it is also going to drain your battery faster.\n\nFortunately, OnePlus has options in the Display Settings for changing the resolution and refresh rate. Now you can\u2019t drop down to 90Hz on the OnePlus 8 Pro, only from 120Hz to 60Hz. So the better option here is going to be to drop the resolution down to FHD+.\nGoing from QHD+ to FHD+, you won\u2019t notice much of a difference. But you will notice a difference in battery life. We dropped the resolution down to FHD+ after we finished the review, and were getting way better battery life. At least another two to three hours of screen on time. This varied from day to day, based on how we used the device. But it was a big change to the battery life here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize battery saver settings to your liking\nThe next step to save some battery life, is going to be to optimize your battery saver settings.\nNow we don\u2019t mean turn battery saver on all the time. As that will essentially make your smartphone a dumb phone. But make sure it turns on when it hits 20% or possibly 15% of battery. That way you can get through the rest of your day.\n\nWith the OnePlus 8 Pro, you can also set a schedule based on your routine, to turn on battery saver. So it will turn on if you are likely to run out of battery before your next usual charge. Say if you normally plug in your phone around 11PM every night, and you\u2019re at 15% at about 7PM, the phone will automatically turn on battery saver mode, as you\u2019re likely to run out before 11PM. It\u2019s a really cool feature actually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery Saver doesn\u2019t need to be on all of the time, but it is a really great way to keep your phone running longer, between charges.\nTurn off Motion Graphics Smoothing\nThis should be off by default, but make sure you turn Motion Graphics Smoothing off. This is going to eat up a lot of juice on your OnePlus 8 Pro. And this is because it is going to be smoothing everything that it sees in videos. And hence, use more power and more battery.\n\nIt\u2019s also not really good, so it\u2019s good that it is off by default. It\u2019s like the motion smoothing that is on most TVs that we all immediately turn off. But now, on your smartphone for some reason.\nWrap Up\nBattery life is pretty decent on the OnePlus 8 Pro. But the company does have a way for you to get more juice pretty quickly. The Warp Charge 30T charger that is included in the box. It\u2019ll fully charge your OnePlus 8 Pro in a little over an hour. Or charge to 50% in just 30 minutes. That is pretty great, and better than using battery saver. But if you don\u2019t have your charger with you, these tips will also work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this page\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinkedin2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX_logo_2023_original\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomments_alt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92020 Android Headlines.
