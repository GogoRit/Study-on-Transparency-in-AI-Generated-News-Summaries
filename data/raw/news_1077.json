Wade after speaking at a roundtable discussion at Missouri\u2019s last abortion clinic in St. Louis on June 24, 2022 (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).\n\n\n\n\n\nST. LOUIS \u2013 Shaking her head in disbelief while sitting at Missouri\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush threaded her fingers together and bowed her head as the constitutional right to abortion unraveled.\n\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d Bush said Friday morning, her voice breaking as she was wrapped in a hug. \u201cOh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Forty-nine years. Forty-nine years. I\u2019m sorry. Forty-nine years and they strip it away. Forty-nine years. Thirty-six million people will be affected and it\u2019s, \u2018Oh well.\u2019\n\u201cThirty-six million people and this is a far-right extremist Supreme Court that\u2019s making this decision that affects other people,\u201d Bush said.\nJust minutes before, murmurs of \u201cit just dropped\u201d rippled through the room as a roundtable discussion with Bush, reproductive rights advocates, local officials and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra wrapped up.\n\n\n \nThe roundtable\u2019s focus was on how to bolster access to abortion in a state already living a near post-Roe reality with only one abortion clinic. Even though it was expected, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning the constitutional right to the procedure that has been in place since 1973 still sucked the air out of the room when it was released.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling dismayed that it\u2019s 2022 and this is where we\u2019re at,\u201d Michelle Trupiano, executive director of the Missouri Family Health Council, said after the decision was released. \u201cAnd I am scared for all of the people today and yet to come that all of a sudden don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nThe impact was immediate.\nMere minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision was released, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt issued an opinion to kick off Missouri\u2019s trigger ban \u2014 making Missouri one of the first states to outlaw nearly all abortions. Gov. Mike Parson soon followed with a proclamation declaring the law as in effect.\u00a0\n\u201cToday, the overruling of Roe and Casey permits Missouri to renew its proud pro-life traditions and restore basic legal protection for the most fundamental of human rights \u2014 the right to life,\u201d Schmitt wrote.\u00a0\nIn a statement, Parson said he was pleased that power has been restored to the states.\n\u201cNothing in the text, history, or tradition of the United States Constitution gave un-elected federal judges authority to regulate abortion,\u201d Parson said.\nUnder Missouri\u2019s trigger law passed in 2019, abortions will only be permitted in cases of a medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest under the law.\u00a0\nHealth care providers who violate the law can be guilty of a class B felony, which can result in five to 15 years in prison, and have their medical license suspended or revoked.\nPeople who receive an abortion cannot be prosecuted in violation of the law.\n  The Planned Parenthood in St. Louis on June 24, 2022 (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).\nDuring a press conference, Yamelsie Rodr\u00edguez, president and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said the clinic notified Missouri\u2019s Department of Health and Senior Services that abortion services in the state were being immediately ceased.\nColleen McNicholas, chief medical officer for Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said the clinic conducted its final abortion last week. The clinic in St. Louis has been the state\u2019s sole remaining abortion provider since 2018 after a Columbia Planned Parenthood clinic\u2019s license expired and in the face of the GOP supermajority that controls Missouri\u2019s statehouse steadily increasing restrictions.\n\u201cWe have reached the end of the line for abortion care,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.\nOther provisions included in the law that banned abortions after eight weeks are currently blocked while the the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals weighs a challenge to those statutes. In a news release, Parson\u2019s office said his administration is coordinating with Schmitt to resolve any litigation preventing implementation of the 2019 law.\nOutside of the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, Missourians gathered shortly after the decision was released to both celebrate and decry the news.\nMary Maschmeier, a St. Charles County resident and founder of Defenders of the Unborn, said she cried as she saw the decision announced on Fox News.\u00a0\n\u201cBabies are not dying in the state of Missouri, beginning today\u2026\u201d said Maschmeier, who has advocated against abortion since 1985 and has previously been arrested for her efforts. \u201cI just never thought I\u2019d see it in my lifetime.\u201d\n  Mary Maschmeier, left, founder of Defenders of the Unborn, hugs outside of Planned Parenthood\u2019s St. Louis clinic as she celebrates the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022 (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).\nAcross the sidewalk, 20-year-old Saint Louis University student Kendyl Underwood said she was worried the ruling would signal the erosion of rights beyond just abortion, like access to contraceptives.\n\u201cNo one questions any of those justices\u2019 rights to their religious beliefs or anything like that. They\u2019re constitutionally protected,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cBut now being a woman in this country is a fight in itself. And that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nWith access to abortion already restricted in Missouri, thousands of residents travel out-of-state to neighboring Illinois and Kansas each year to receive an abortion compared to the less than 200 procedures that occurred within Missouri in recent years.\nMissouri lawmakers have floated ideas for policy changes in a post-Roe world, like ensuring a right to abortion doesn\u2019t exist in the state constitution and limits on access to certain forms of contraceptives, and abortion providers have already been laying the groundwork for the imminent fall of Roe.\nJust across the Missouri border in Fairview Heights in Illinois, Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region has partnered on a Regional Logistics Center to provide patients with wraparound support, like funding travel and a place to stay so they can access the procedure.\nIn Kansas, Planned Parenthood Great Plains is working to establish the Center for Abortion and Reproductive Equity, or CARE, that aims to lower barriers to accessing care in the wake of increasing limits on access to abortion.\nPlanned Parenthood Great Plains, which had stopped providing abortions in Missouri years ago, announced it paused abortions services in neighboring Arkansas.\u00a0\n\u201cToday this creeping march to crush fundamental freedoms has reached its awful conclusion: your body is not your own. Your rights are entirely dependent on where you reside,\u201d Emily Wales, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cYet in this very grim moment in American history, Planned Parenthood Great Plains\u2019 doors are still open and will stay open, to provide sexual and reproductive care today, tomorrow, and for years to come.\u201d\nThis is a developing story.
