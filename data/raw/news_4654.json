Gretchen Whitmer (left) and GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon (right) | Photos by Getty Images and Andrew Roth\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion has been one of the top issues for voters this election season, and the two nominees running for governor have taken starkly different approaches to campaigning on the issue.\u00a0\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has centered her support for abortion rights in her campaign, saying repeatedly she is \u201cfighting like hell\u201d against the state\u2019s 91-year-old abortion ban. The governor filed a suit to stop the law from taking effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade.\nGOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon, who opposes abortion rights, has talked about the issue far less than Whitmer in the general election. She did emphasize her endorsement from Right to Life of Michigan during the five-way Republican primary, as well as her opposition to abortion with no exceptions for the mother\u2019s health, rape and incest.\nOn Nov. 8, Michigan voters also will decide a measure codifying abortion rights in the state Constitution \u2014 Proposal 3, know as Reproductive Freedom for All. Polling has shown steady support for the amendment.\nDuring their first debate last week in Grand Rapids, Whitmer said she will be voting for Proposal 3. Although Dixon opposes the measure, she has made the case that Michiganders can vote for both her and Proposal 3.\u00a0\nHere is a look at where both gubernatorial candidates stand on abortion access in Michigan and how their statements have (or haven\u2019t) changed over time.\u00a0\n  Pro-choice protesters gather at the Supreme Court on May 21, 2019 in Washington, DC.

Kay Ivey last week, includes no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, outlawing all abortions except when necessary to prevent serious health problems for the woman.| Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer\nWhitmer saw the writing on the wall that the right-wing U.S. Supreme Court was likely to overturn the 1973 landmark ruling that federally protected a woman\u2019s right to abortion.\u00a0\nSo in early April, she filed a lawsuit with the Oakland County Circuit Court to recognize the right to an abortion under the state Constitution and repeal the 1931 abortion ban, which prohibits doctors from performing any abortions except to save the life of the \u201cpregnant woman.\u201d The law also carries a four-year felony penalty.\nA few weeks after that lawsuit was filed, a leaked draft decision from the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade was made public, and on June 24 the official ruling was released.\u00a0\nA temporary injunction in a Planned Parenthood lawsuit, which was filed the same day Whitmer filed her suit, made the 1931 ban unenforceable.\u00a0\nIn August, the state Court of Appeals gave county prosecutors power to enforce Michigan\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, exempting them from the injunction. Whitmer responded by asking the Oakland County Circuit Court for a temporary restraining order on the ban, which Judge Jacob Cunningham granted and ruled to keep in place.\u00a0\n\u201cThe only reason that law is not in effect right now is because of my lawsuit stopping it,\u201d Whitmer said during an Oct. 13 debate against Dixon. \u201cWhen Roe fell, Mrs. Dixon celebrated that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most profound economic decision a woman will make in the course of her whole lifetime is whether and when to have a child. ... And that\u2019s why this is such an important right for women, and it\u2019s contributed to women being able to participate in the workforce in the numbers that we have been able to in the last 50 years.\n\n\n\u2013 Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\n\nWhitmer also has argued that abortion is an economic issue. \u201cWomen have to be able to make their own health care decisions\u201d in order to attract and retain women to join Michigan\u2019s workforce, she said.\n\u201cThe most profound economic decision a woman will make in the course of her whole lifetime is whether and when to have a child,\u201d the Democratic governor told the Advance in a June interview. \u201c\u2026 Whether it is a collective economy or it is a woman and her family\u2019s individual family economy, there will be a profound impact. And that\u2019s why this is such an important right for women, and it\u2019s contributed to women being able to participate in the workforce in the numbers that we have been able to in the last 50 years.\u201d\nWhitmer, who has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America, has been a longtime supporter of abortion rights as a state House member and senator before she was elected governor.\u00a0\nWhen Whitmer was Senate minority leader in 2013, she opened up on the Senate floor with an emotional story about being a rape survivor to try to block an anti-abortion bill. The GOP-led Legislature passed the bill, but Whitmer\u2019s speech made national news.\nWhitmer has also talked about how as a mom she is concerned that her daughters, who are students at University of Michigan, have less rights than she had at their age.\n\u201cI am horrified, as are so many women who are 50 years old, or in my generation, that the thought that my daughters will have fewer rights than I\u2019ve had virtually my whole life,\u201d Whitmer told \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in June.\nGOP nominee Tudor Dixon\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision came out in June overturning Roe v. Wade, Dixon issued a statement in favor of the ruling.\n\u201cToday is not just a day for celebration as it is an affirmation that life is precious, but it is a day for action,\u201d Dixon said.\u00a0\nIn early June, Dixon secured the Right to Life endorsement, which only goes to candidates who believe in banning abortion in all circumstances, except to protect the life of the mother.\nDixon has said in several interviews that she doesn\u2019t support exceptions for rape or incest. Asked during a July interview with Detroit podcaster Charlie LeDuff, Dixon said she would not support a 14-year-old girl who was raped by her uncle to be able to get an abortion, saying it was the \u201cperfect example.\u201d\nShe has also reiterated her position on FOX-2 in August after winning the GOP primary that she doesn\u2019t support teenage rape victims having the right to get abortions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to those people who were the child of a rape victim and the bond that those two people made,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cAnd the fact that out of that tragedy, there was healing through that baby. It\u2019s something that we don\u2019t think about because we assume that that story is someone who was taken from the front yard then returned. That\u2019s generally not the story there. And those voices, the babies of rape victims that have come forward, are very powerful when you hear their story and what the truth is behind that. It\u2019s very hard to not stand up for those people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is not just a day for celebration as it is an affirmation that life is precious, but it is a day for action.\n\n\n\u2013 GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\n\n\nDuring the debate with Whitmer last week, Dixon denied that she has ever said the she wants to \u201ccriminalize people\u201d or \u201cmake this [abortion] a felony.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, at a GOP debate in Livingston County in May, Dixon called the 1931 abortion ban a \u201cgood law.\u201d That law would make performing an abortion a felony in Michigan for doctors and those who use medication for self-abortion.\u00a0\nDixon has tried not to focus on abortion rights in the general election and has said it\u2019s not one of the \u201cbiggest issues\u201d she is campaigning on.\nShe also has tried to appeal to voters who support Proposal 3.\nDuring a press conference last month in front of the Michigan Department of Education, Dixon told reporters \u201cthe ballot initiative for the constitutional amendment aligns with what Gretchen Whitmer wants. So yes, you can vote for Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s position without having to vote for Gretchen Whitmer again.\u201d\nDuring the debate in Grand Rapids, Dixon said she would accept the results of Proposal 3. Whitmer called that \u201creally ironic.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFor her to stand there and say she will respect the will of the people when she has not even embraced the outcome of the last election or pledged to embrace the outcome of the future election tells me we cannot trust what she is saying,\u201d Whitmer said.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXSince before Roe fell to present day: Where Dixon and Whitmer stand on abortion rights\nby Allison R.
