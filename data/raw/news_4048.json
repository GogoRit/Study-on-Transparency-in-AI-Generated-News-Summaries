Bringing together the work of over 50 artists to raise awareness and funding in support of accessible, safe, and legal abortion, the exhibition\u2019s second half opened this past Tuesday at Arsenal Contemporary. Abortion is Normal was curated by Jasmine Wahi and Rebecca Pauline Jampol, and co-organized by Marilyn Minter, Gina Nanni, Laurie Simmons, and Sandy Tait in response to state laws passed restricting abortion and Roe vs. Wade being in jeopardy of being reversed. (Proceeds raised from the show will be donated in support of voter education and advocacy on reproductive rights, as well as Planned Parenthood PAC efforts in the upcoming 2020 elections via Downtown for Democracy.)\nInstallation view of Abortion is Normal at Arsenal Contemporary (photo by Coke O\u2019Neal)\nFeaturing artists from a plurality of backgrounds, the exhibition speaks to the vastness of how abortion and bodily autonomy affect so many of us in different ways. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I want people to take away from the exhibition,\u201d Wahi told Hyperallergic, \u201cit\u2019s that there are multiple voices in the conversation, and this conversation really does impact everyone; we all have something at stake.\u201d\u00a0\n \n \n\nCindy Sherman, \u201cUntitled\u201d (2019), photograph\nThe show\u2019s title and mission tap into a larger movement to embrace abortion rights and reproductive justice unapologetically. As author Jenny Brown writes in her 2019 book Without Apology, \u201cIt was massive feminist mobilizations, fueled by women publicly discussing what was once secret and stigmatized that won us the abortion rights we have.\u201d Abortion Is Normal features artwork in this justice-minded vein, eschewing the focus on privacy, exceptions, and choice that have dominated the movement for reproductive rights over the last 45 years. Shout Your Abortion, the book and hashtag founded by Amelia Bonow, for example, aims to normalize the procedure through sharing abortion stories, and Viva Ruiz\u2019s \u201cThank God For Abortion\u201d (2019) subverts religious attacks on reproductive rights with clothing, banners, riot gear, and ornately decorated mannequins emblazoned with religious imagery and the words \u201cThank God for Abortion\u201d in English and Spanish. A table at the exhibition featured glitter-encrusted t-shirts, buttons, and stickers featuring all three of these slogans for sale to benefit the cause.\nInstallation view of Abortion is Normal\u00a0at Eva Presenhuber, featuring Dominique Duroseau\u2019s \u201cMammy was here: she equally acceptable\u201d (2019) (photo by Coke O\u2019Neal)\nEach piece in the exhibition contributes to a rich, shame-free counter-narrative to the repressive views on reproductive rights perpetuated by Republicans in power. In Cindy Sherman\u2019s \u201cUntitled\u201d (2019), a pregnant woman stares the viewer dead in the eye as she clutches her stomach, a visceral reminder of how personal the experience of pregnancy is. Grandly towering over the room, Dominique Duroseau\u2019s \u201cMammy was here: she equally acceptable\u201d (2019) calls attention to racial inequities in reproduction and childcare, rooted in the history of enslavement. Composed of miniature perfume bottles filled with decanted period blood that the artist collected from menstruating people of all genders, Christen Clifford\u2019s installation \u201cI Want Your Blood\u201d (2013\u20132019) juxtaposes the trappings of traditional feminine desirability with the often hidden (and shamed) bodily experience of menstruation. The blood used in Clifford\u2019s work, as well as in Portia Munson\u2019s \u201cMenstrual Prints\u201d (1993) series also highlights the arbitrary framing of abortion as an ending of life, since each menstrual period involves the shedding of uterine lining, which contains an egg that could have been fertilized and led to pregnancy.\u00a0\nInstallation view of Christen Clifford\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Blood\u201d (2013\u20132019) at Eva Presenhuber (photo by Coke O\u2019Neal)\nMiguel Luciano, \u201cBarceloneta Bunnies\u201d (2007), acrylic on canvas over panel, 72 x 72 inches\nOther works in the show illuminate parts of the picture that are given less attention within the mainstream abortion debate. Reinterpreting a 1930\u2019s label from Puerto Rican produce sold in the U.S., Miguel Luciano\u2019s painting \u201cBarceloneta Bunnies\u201d (2007), for example, addresses our country\u2019s history of forced sterilization by referencing a Puerto Rico town targeted by such programs as part of the island\u2019s population control policy. Elektra KB\u2019s photo series \u201cQueer Alterations for a Post-Nuclear Kin\u201d (2020) is one of several works in the exhibition focusing on queer, trans, and gender nonconforming experiences of reproductive health.\u00a0\nAbortion Is Normal is very much a call to action. Wahi stresses the urgency of the show\u2019s message in a presidential election year, and the importance of voting and having our voices heard. \u201cGet out there and express yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not able to vote, become active in this conversation, because whatever happens this year is going to determine what happens in the next four to eight years.\u201d\nDetail view of Elektra KB, \u201cQueer Alterations For A Post-Nuclear Kin\u201d (2020), mixed media, dimensions variable\nBetty Tompkins, \u201cAbortion = Normal\u201d (2019), Acrylic on Paper, 5 1/2 \u00d7 8 inches\nAbortion is Normal continues through February 1 at Arsenal Contemporary (214 Bowery, Lower East Side). The exhibition was curated by Jasmine Wahi and Rebecca Pauline Jampol and co-organized by Marilyn Minter, Gina Nanni, Laurie Simmons, and Sandy Tait.\n\n\nRelated\n \n\nTagged: New York,\u00a0Reviews \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarisa Crawford\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarisa Crawford\u2019s writing has appeared in Harper\u2019s Bazaar, The Nation, BUST, and elsewhere.

Life as a genetically unique individual begins at conception. As an adult human, every cell in your body is the decedent of that first cell. So, life begins at conception.\nThat fact has not stopped us from aborting 60 million babies since the practice. So  so it  acis scially accepted. The only thing keeping everyone from agreeing on it is the weird debate over when life begins or, more recently, when it is ok to terminate a life without guilt.\nFor example, should it be ok to kill babies before they have a heart or brain? It seems the most humane time certainly. What is the difference though as ,if not terminated, said baby would develop into an adult so why not terminate them then humanely if you want?\nIt is all a logical disaster and I think we should all just settle on a factual definition of life. I mean back in the day in the US the legal definition of being human excluded blacks so they could be slaves. \nIn Germany the Nazis defined Jews, the Romani and the disabled as sub human and ok to exterminate. \nToday we have defined unborn children as less than han so that we can kill them at will and we have far surpassed the slave owners and the Nazis in numbers.lets just admit that, according to basic science, babies are living human beings and then decide at what point it is cool to kill them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\tComments are closed.\t\t\t\n\n\n\nPopularPatrick Moore to Resign as Warhol Museum DirectorArtist Collective Withdraws from Whitney BiennialDiscovery of 8,600-Year-Old Bread Gives Rise to Half-Baked ClaimsThe Dark Clouds Closing In on Mark RothkoOur Mid-March Picks of New York City Art Shows\n\n\n\n\nMost PopularPatrick Moore to Resign as Warhol Museum DirectorArtist Collective Withdraws from Whitney BiennialDiscovery of 8,600-Year-Old Bread Gives Rise to Half-Baked ClaimsThe Dark Clouds Closing In on Mark RothkoOur Mid-March Picks of New York City Art Shows \n\n\n\nThe Latest\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHyperallergic Mini Art Crossword: March 2024 Look out for pink dolphins and Louis XIV in this maximalist mini crossword.\n\n\nby Natan Last \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscovery of 8,600-Year-Old Bread Gives Rise to Half-Baked Claims Turkey\u2019s narrative surrounding \u201cthe world\u2019s oldest bread\u201d raises questions about how archaeological heritage is used for nationalistic ends.\u00a0\n\n\nby Sarah E.
