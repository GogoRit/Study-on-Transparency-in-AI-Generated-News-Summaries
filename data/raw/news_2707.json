Hoye, speaker and educator Ryan Bomberger, and pro-life activist Bevelyn Beatty speak frankly about abortion, race, and the gospel message.\n\nOctober 27, 2020\nMonica Seeley\nFeatures, Special Report\n15\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter Hoye, Ryan Bomberger, and Bevelyn Beatty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this past summer of protests and racial unrest was heating up, I began hearing increasing criticism directed at the American pro-life movement. An extreme, but telling example came from Rolling Stone Magazine\u2019s Jamil Smith July 15: The moniker \u201cpro-life,\u201d so often used in the service of not just misogyny but also racism, should be retired right along with Aunt Jemima and the \u201cRedskins\u201d team name. \nOther concerns focused on pro-lifers\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d or the movement\u2019s prioritizing abortion over racism and other issues. Critics highlighted the \u201cpoliticization\u201d of abortion. Others faulted the movement for supposedly ignoring the root causes of abortion; still others declared those root causes to be off limits for discussion.\nThe array of concerns\u2014ranging from vitriolic to well-intentioned to seemingly contradictory\u2014puzzled me. To get a better perspective, I sought out three individuals who could speak to the issue from personal experience. All three have put their lives, income, and security on the line to work full time for the pro-life cause. And as African-Americans, they can speak about racism from personal experience. The resulting conversations were humbling and eye opening as we reflected together on abortion, race, and the gospel message.\n\u201cAbortion is the #1 cause of death in black America.\u201d\nMay 13, 2008: Rev. Walter B. Hoye stood outside Family Planning Services in Oakland, California with a sign reading \u201cGod loves you and your baby. Let us help you.\u201d That act resulted in the soft-spoken Baptist pastor\u2019s arrest for violating a \u201cbubble law,\u201d tailor-made by the city of Oakland to remove him from the area. Hoye\u2019s decision to accept prison time rather than give up sidewalk counseling made him a pro-life hero. Today, he runs the Issues4Life Foundation, together with his wife, Lori. The organization works with black leadership to build a culture of life.\n\u201cHow long do you need?\u201d Hoye asks at the beginning of our phone conversation. It\u2019s a Friday night and I don\u2019t want to impose; I suggest fifteen minutes. Little do I know that I am embarking on an engrossing three hour tutorial. Its subject: the evil twins of abortion and racism, two issues so intertwined in American history that they are difficult, if not impossible, to separate.\nMy opening question is simple: Is the pro-life movement racist?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re simply saying it\u2019s a one issue movement,\u201d Hoye replies. The implication is that pro-lifers only care about ending abortion, that they don\u2019t care about the black community or about women in crisis.\n\u201cFrom that perspective, the pro-life movement is not racist at all. Not even remotely,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe goal of the movement is to end abortion, and when you\u2019re talking about killing a baby, obviously that should be your highest priority. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a job waiting on you, or a family waiting on you, or an education waiting on you, or a wonderful future waiting on you. If you can\u2018t get out of the womb, nothing matters. Without life, nothing matters.\u201d\nThe most frequent criticism I hear, I remark, is that the pro-life movement \u201cpoliticizes\u201d abortion. \u201cWhen you hear that, you\u2019re not having an honest conversation\u201d Hoye responds. \u201cYes, when it comes time to elect a new president, everything gets political.\u201d He has strong words for the Democratic party. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can vote Democrat and really be pro-life\u2026 Today the Democratic party\u2019s platform is godless, and they promote abortion, homosexuality, and on down the line. There is no way, if you\u2019re a Christian, and Biblical values are important to you, that you could even remotely think about putting the Democrats back in power.\u201d\nThe conversation turns next to Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cRacism is a Life Issue\u201d panel, which took place in July. I ask Hoye to comment on this remark by panelist and outspoken pro-life advocate Gloria Purvis:\nPro-lifers\u2026You can\u2019t go in and assume a position of superiority over black people as if they don\u2019t know what is best for their community.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to listen, you\u2019ve got to be in solidarity, and you\u2019ve got to be humble.\u00a0 And for goodness sake please, please, stop with the political talking points of the far right\u2026.\u00a0 Don\u2019t use encoded race language like \u201cblack on black crime and [absence of black fathers] \u2026 because it sounds like you\u2019re \u2026 not there to have a conversation, you\u2019re there to dominate.\u00a0 And if you can\u2019t go in a position of listening and being humble, please just stay home because you\u2019re going to do more harm than good.\n\u201cThe reality of black-on-black crime and absent fathers in my community is real,\u201d Hoye acknowledges. \u201cBut as black Americans we don\u2019t like anybody to talk about it. We don\u2019t want anyone to say one word about it. It\u2019s supposed to be an internal conversation, and that\u2019s the code.\u201d\nBecause those are \u201cinternal issues, family issues, black only issues,\u201d whites are not welcome to point them out. \u201cOne reason is that it takes the conversation away from white folk being the problem, to the point where the problem isn\u2019t white folk, it\u2019s black folk that are the problem. And that\u2019s an entirely different conversation.\u201d\n\u201cIf you consider the legacy of racism,\u201d Hoye continues, \u201cYou\u2019ll understand you can\u2019t have this conversation. They\u2019ll say you\u2019re racist and you\u2019ll be dismissed. However, if they were willing to have an honest conversation, you wouldn\u2019t be dismissed. The abortion industry can\u2019t have an honest conversation. If they have an honest conversation, they lose. Because the bottom line is, the child inside the womb is human, made in the image of God, and they\u2019re killing a person.\u201d\n\n\n\nA licensed and ordained black Baptist minister since 1989, Hoye says \u201cI\u2019m in a position where I can talk about it. I talk about these internal issues a lot.\u201d His foundation, Issues4Life, exists specifically to reach black leadership, and \u201cin order for us to focus on black leadership, we have to have that intimate conversation.\u201d\nThe Issues4Life Foundation is one of a mere handful of black, pro-life non-profits in the United States. The reason is simple economics: abortion is so controversial that there is no donor base for the pro-life movement in black America.\nAt one time, however, many black organizations were vocally anti-abortion, including the Nation of Islam and the Black Panthers. A 1973 article in the Black Panther Party\u2019s newspaper argued \u201cThe abortion law hides behind the guise of helping women, when in reality it will attempt to destroy our people.\u201d A 1965 statement by Cecil Moore, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP, said \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s plan is replete with everything to help the Negroes commit race suicide.\u201d\nTragically, as abortion has insinuated itself deeply into the fabric of the black community, those statements are no longer heard and would be considered greatly out of character. \u201cThings have changed dramatically,\u201d laments Hoye. \u201cAbortion is running wild.\u201d\nHe cites four reasons why \u201cnobody wants to talk about it, why nobody\u2019s preaching on it, why the larger pro-life movement is rejected entirely.\u201d\nThe first reason is that \u201cblack leadership is post-abortive.\u201d For pastors, \u201cthat means there is an abortion in his life somewhere\u2026 mother, wife, son, daughter, if he\u2019s a black pastor, probably the entire congregation he\u2019s preaching to is post-abortive. The abortion numbers in my community are highly disproportionate. There are post-abortion issues in the congregation and those issues run really deep. Even though the Bible is clear regarding abortion\u2014the taking of an innocent life\u2014the pastor is not talking about it. And it\u2019s likely because there\u2019s one in his own life. This is something that needs to be dealt with.\u201d\nThe second reason the pro-life movement is rejected by black leadership is racism. \u201cCategory #2 is that he\u2019s racist. What could you possibly do about it? Let\u2019s say you meet him and he\u2019s racist, he hates white folk. How are you going to reach him for the pro-life movement? You can\u2019t, but I can.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany black leaders in this category \u201care struggling with forgiveness,\u201d Hoye says. He had his own struggle with forgiveness. \u201cI get it. At one point I didn\u2019t like white folk at all. My great grandfather was lynched by the Klan. I can\u2019t tell you what they did to my great grandmother because you\u2019re polite company. But I can tell you that they lit the house on fire and they burned seven of the 14 kids alive. And the older seven burned alive to save the younger seven. And one of the youngest seven was my grandmother.\u201d\nHoye continues: \u201cBut\u2026 in my grandmother\u2019s life, when she met Jesus, her world got better\u2026 And when her daughter, my Momma, accepted Christ, her world got better. And when I accepted Christ, my world got better.\u201d\nThe alternative is to be consumed by anger and bitterness. Sadly, \u201csome people don\u2019t mind being consumed. The pastor in that #2 category doesn\u2019t mind being consumed. So if you try to reach him for the pro-life movement, he\u2019ll be polite. But you can\u2019t reach him. I can.\u201d\nThe third reason is financial. Hoye points out that in the Catholic Church, \u201cIf a priest makes a mistake, he\u2019s may be reassigned\u2026 And maybe advancement is not in his future anymore. But he eats and sleeps. He still has healthcare. He has a place to stay.\u201d\nIndependent black pastors have no such assurance. \u201cIn my community, you can preach about abortion at noon, be done at 1, and by 3 o\u2019clock that same Sunday afternoon be voted out of the pulpit. Now you\u2019re jobless and potentially homeless in the street.\u201d\nHoye\u2019s own experience illustrates this. During his month in prison, his only visitor among the clergy was San Francisco\u2019s Archbishop Cordileone. His fellow black pastors stayed away: they would not risk angering their congregations. \u201cAre you willing to lose your job over the pro-life issue? I had to face that. Ultimately my church fired me for being pro-life.\u201d Black pastors have a huge financial stake in not alienating their congregations. And \u201cthey don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d\nThe fourth reason why a black pastor might reject the pro-life movement is that \u201che\u2019s uninformed.\u201d Many black pastors are unaware of the extent to which abortion threatens their flock.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbortion is the #1 cause of death in black America. It outstrips all thirteen leading causes of death combined.\u201d Hoye cites drastically dropping black fertility rates: \u201cWe\u2019re no longer even replacing ourselves. If black America doesn\u2019t stop aborting her children at the current rate, black America has only got about 30 years left. By 2050 black America will be facing irreversibility.\u201d\nMany black pastors are equally unaware of the racist roots of abortion in America: \u201cAbortion is the answer to a problem,\u201d Hoye explains. It exists \u201cbecause black people do. When we were slaves, we were assets. Free labor\u2026 But when we stopped being slaves we stopped being assets to the country and started being a liability.\u201d\nCiting the documentary \u201cMaafa 21\u201d Hoye traces the intertwined history of abortion and racism in the United States. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, \u201cracist as the day is long,\u201d wrote in 1939:\nWe do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\nSanger knew the importance of working through black pastors to achieve her Negro Project\u2019s goals, something Hoye sees as critical for the pro-life movement as well. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to end abortion, you have to reach black Americans. You have to come to my neighborhood. Margaret Sanger understood that\u2019s what she needed to get to the black community.\u201d\nDiscerning the four reasons why blacks reject the pro-life movement was a revelation. It led Hoye to create a unique program, \u201ca modern day underground railroad\u201d to move the hearts and minds of pastors by addressing each issue. Escaped slave Harriet Tubman went deep into the South to lead slaves to freedom, while whites with homes along the route risked everything to hide fleeing slaves. The analogy is a good one. Although white pro-lifers may be unable to reach the black community, their support of black pro-lifers who can carry the message is crucial.\nHoye models his approach after Jesus\u2019 conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well. \u201cJesus understands why she\u2019s struggling and because Jesus understands, He gets right to the heart of the matter,\u201d he reflects. \u201cWhen you understand why somebody\u2019s telling you no, then you can get them to say yes. But if you don\u2019t know why they\u2019re telling you no, you\u2019re not going to get to the heart of the matter.\u201d\nThere is one pro-life strategy that Hoye feels transcends political party lines: personhood. The legal acknowledgement that \u201ceverybody is a person, even the child in the womb, from the very beginning,\u201d the concept appeals to the black community because \u201cwe know what it\u2019s like not to be persons,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nBrilliantly simple, Personhood \u201cmeans the child in the womb is protected by the Constitution\u2026 That means abortion comes to an end.\u201d\nHoye ran three campaigns to put personhood on the California ballot, the last in 2015. The proposed initiatives would have amended the California Constitution to include the unborn under the term \u201cperson.\u201d Blacks were his biggest supporters. After a brief talk at a black church in Los Angeles, Hoye collected over 3,000 signatures for his ballot initiative. Many black pro-lifers feel the personhood movement is key to reaching the black community, with its civil rights legacy, and ultimately key to ending abortion in the United States.\nIf abortion is decimating black America, making it a \u201cminority of a minority\u201d, how does one overcome the bitterness that causes blacks to embrace the party of abortion?\nThe answer, says Hoye, goes back to the Bible. The book of Exodus speaks loudly on race and gives a strategy for dealing with racism. \u201cGod simply said, you follow Me,\u201d Hoye says with conviction. \u201cRacism has been going on as long as it could possibly be. And it\u2019s clear what we should do to end racism,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biblical strategy is for us to do God\u2019s will. Live life His way. To worship Him. That will take care of all the problems.\u201d\nHe acknowledges that the biblical strategy can be more difficult than other approaches. \u201cYet God never fails, so the answer remains: We must embrace God fully and live life His way.\u201d\nHoye has great affection for Exodus and its parallels for black America. \u201cLife is a biblical issue,\u201d he reflects, citing Pharaoh\u2019s command to kill Hebrew infants in Exodus Chapter 1: \u201cThe midwives were supposed to kill the child when it came out of the womb\u2014 that\u2019s a late term abortion.\u201d The midwives obeyed God\u2019s law over Pharaoh\u2019s, and as a result, the Hebrew nation was blessed. The lesson is clear: \u201cGod says\u2026 I\u2019m going to bless the nation through the child. That\u2019s the answer right there.\u201d\nAn Intentionally Destructive Narrative\n\n\n\nApril 19, 2016: Ryan Bomberger addressed a packed auditorium at Harvard University. His topic: \u201cAbortion in Black Communities.\u201d His talk discussed high abortion rates among blacks and covered the issues surrounding abortion: poverty, and fatherlessness as a leading cause of poverty. The audience \u201claughed and mocked me,\u201d he recounts, and it\u2019s clear the memory still saddens him. Indeed, the audience did more than laugh. The Q&A session following Bomberger\u2019s talk devolved into chaos, with students shouting profanities and calling him a racist.\nToday, Bomberger says he is \u201cgrateful to get to actually vocalize my perspective on the pro-life movement and the media-driven propaganda that the pro-life movement is racist.\u201d\nAs a black man who has worked for the pro-life cause for decades, Bomberger has firsthand knowledge of the subject. He and his wife Bethany are co-founders of the Radiance Foundation, which works through education, ad campaigns, multi-media presentations, journalism, and community outreach. The Radiance Foundation is based on the belief that every human life has purpose, and Bomberger has a unique perspective on that belief: conceived through rape, he was adopted into an ethnically diverse family that would grow to 15, with ten adopted children. He himself has two adopted children. His outlook on life and race, he says, comes from \u201cmy white mother who taught me about black Americans and their amazing achievements, their struggle, and how triumph rises from tragedy.\u201d\nMy white father,\u201d he adds, \u201cloved the ones that other men abandoned and the world so easily discarded. In a day and age where many lazily blame everything on \u2018white supremacy\u2019 my dad sacrificed his whole life to help unleash our God-given purpose.\u201d\nDoes the pro-life movement need to examine its conscience with regards to race? Bomberger responds \u201cquite succinctly, that\u2019s absurd.\u201d\nThe first question to ask, he says, is what it means to be racist. \u201cThe problem with our culture today is that we rely on buzzwords and buzzphrases without any specificity. We\u2019re in a culture right now that wants to label everything as racist to the point where the word has become meaningless. It\u2019s now racist to say \u2018All lives matter.\u2019 And, according to the New York Times, it\u2019s racist or white supremacist to say that we are one human race. How in the world is that a racist thing? The converse of that is we are all separate races. What has that ever done for humanity? It has never elevated us to separate ourselves by color.\u201d\nOne thing that is certainly meant when critics talk about race and the pro-life movement, is that the movement primarily focuses on ending abortion. Is the pro-life movement a \u201cone hit wonder?\u201d The charge, Bomberger feels, is punitive. \u201cOther causes are not expected to handle the full spectrum of human experience. But the pro-life movement is. We\u2019re the only ones expected to tackle every single injustice, in order to talk about the issue of abortion\u2026the reason our movement exists.\u201d\n\n\n\nBomberger points out that no one is actually unclear about what \u201cpro-life\u201d generally stands for. The term was coined after Roe v. Wade primarily to describe a movement against abortion, and that holds true today. \u201cWhen I refer to \u2018pro-life\u2019 as the world tends to understand it, we\u2019re tackling the issue of abortion. If it\u2019s better to address it as \u2018the anti-abortion movement\u2019, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s one and the same. What group gets to be denied the label that they give themselves?\u201d\nIn July, during Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cRacism is a Life Issue\u201d panel, Sen. Katrina Jackson (D, LA) said \u201cThere\u2019s a major pushback in the African American community to really come out and support the pro-life movement, because they don\u2019t believe it to be authentic.\u00a0 They believe it to be a pro-birth movement and to not really include the issues that really matter in allowing someone, helping someone and allowing them to choose life and making sure they\u2019re able to give their child a life that they would want them to have.\u201d\nBomberger expresses admiration for Senator Jackson\u2014a pro-life Democrat, a rarity these days in the national scene. He agrees there is a great misperception about who and what the pro-life movement does. Abortion is often seen, in the black community, as a white male Republican issue. \u201cBut that\u2019s the tragic thing. Abortion, statistically, disproportionately decimates the black community. In New York City, more black babies are aborted than born alive,\u201d Bomberger emphasizes. \u201cOur organization tackles a myriad of issues. Many pro-life organizations do; it\u2019s why we have pregnancy medical help clinics, maternity homes, adoption agencies, and parachurch organizations like Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Catholic Charities that deal with the spectrum of needs at every age and stage.\u201d\nThe pro-life movement can, and does, \u201cwalk and chew gum,\u201d Bomberger explains. \u201cPeople think we can\u2019t handle things concurrently. We simultaneously address the issues and causes of poverty and abortion at the same time.\u201d The pregnancy care center movement is a prime example of this, he says. \u201cI work with so many amazing centers. They\u2019re teaching parenting skills, they\u2019re teaching basic life skills, so that people can elevate themselves out of their current situation.\nNonetheless, \u201cyou don\u2019t excuse a violent injustice because there are reasons that have led to it. You stop the injustice and you intervene in these other issues at the same time. But once a child is killed, there is no intervention.\u201d\nBomberger feels that many who are critical of pro-lifers are unfamiliar with the pregnancy care movement. \u201cYou read so many articles about how pro-lifers don\u2019t care about babies after they\u2019re born,\u201d he says. \u201cHave you stepped inside of a pregnancy care center? Have you sat through a class?\u201d He lists some of the classes and services offered by pregnancy care centers: parenting, life skills, basic help like formula and clothing. \u201cThey are the ones who care, deeply, for the child in utero, and often up to two years after the child is born.\u201d\n\u201cI worked with pregnancy centers for decades, and it\u2019s there that the expression \u2018All Lives Matter\u2019 is actually carried out in action. The pregnancy centers that I\u2019ve worked with don\u2019t care about your socio economic background, your ethnic background, all they care about it is that you\u2019re someone in need, someone who needs love and compassion. I have seen that carried out in so many different ways. What leads with the pro-life movement is the pregnancy care center movement. The pro-life movement absolutely cares about every life, regardless of any kind of background.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a college student, Bomberger says, he encountered pro-lifers who were tongue tied when it came to addressing abortion\u2019s contributing factors. He committed to never being in that position. \u201cWhen people talk about poverty, when people talk about maternal mortality, when people talk about joblessness, when people talk about some of these external issues, that are inextricably tied, I\u2019m going to address them. When they talk about incarceration rates. I will address it.\u201d\nYet he is aware that these discussions can be a red herring. He cites his experience at Harvard: \u201cI talked about one of the largest contributing factors to poverty, and therefore abortion, being fatherlessness . . . There\u2019s no denying the majority of studies on father absence. There\u2019s no debate on the negative disparities, on so many different measures, and yet they mocked that. People point to these underlying factors, yet when you talk about the underlying factors, they say \u2018oh wait, that\u2019s not actually the issue.\u2019\u201d\nWe touch on Black Lives Matter. Bomberger believes the Black Lives Matter movement fosters a \u201cfalse empathy\u201d and ignores the suffering of numerous black women who are \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of the abortion industry. Victims such as Tanya Reeves, a black woman who was left to bleed to death after an abortion at a Planned Parenthood facility in Chicago, \u201cget no attention. There are no riots, no protests, no nothing.\u201d\nWhat about racism, plain and simple in the pro-life movement? Bomberger counters \u201cWhat racist movement actually gives up reputation, their financial everything, to rescue those that they\u2019re supposedly racist against?\u201d\nHe sees an agenda behind the bevy of criticisms leveled against pro-lifers.\n\u201cThere is a concerted effort from the pro-abortion left that is trying to cast the pro-life movement as racist\u2026,\u201d he states, \u201cI have worked with every leader in this movement and I\u2019ll tell you, they have gone above and beyond. I have never heard a racist thing said or done. I have only seen people who will fight peacefully with everything in their being, to save human lives. The lives of mothers, of babies born and unborn\u2026 reaching out to fathers. It is a leftist, intentionally destructive narrative that wants to re-cast a movement that saves lives as racist. Meanwhile, the movement that actually is racist continues to kill millions. It\u2019s a bizarre juxtaposition that no narrative can actually change or revise.\u201d\nHis voice sounds weary as he continues. Saying the pro-life movement is racist is \u201ca bumper sticker mantra, from those who try to demonize the pro-life movement. They have to ignore the totality of the movement in order to make statements like that.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy ignore the totality of the movement? In order to downplay abortion, Bomberger says. People insist \u201c\u2018I\u2019m for life, I\u2019m pro-life, BUT\u2019\u2026 and then it\u2019s the same thing, equating every other issue with abortion. But, without life, nothing else matters. A dead child doesn\u2019t need an education. A dead child doesn\u2019t need a safe environment. A dead child needs nothing. If we don\u2019t get the first issue right, we will never get any of the subsequent issues right.\u201d\nDespite his frustration, Bomberger emphasizes \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to hear people repeat these things. I know in their heart they want to do the right thing, they want to be compassionate. But the verse that compels me so much in all this talk about race, is Psalm 89:14: Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne, Oh God. Unfailing love and truth precede you. We can\u2019t get to justice without the unfailing love and truth that comes first. You can\u2019t be fully compassionate and act responsibly if you don\u2019t know the truth of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nPro-Lifers: Take the Gospel With You\nBevelyn Beatty, like Walter Hoye, takes the biblical conversation at the well as her paradigm. Her organization, At the Well Ministries, with co-founder Edmee Chavannes, was founded to reach people with the gospel message through one on one conversations. That goal now includes a broader audience through social media and street preaching, and it has a clear focus on abortion. Its website states its mission: \u201cTaking the message throughout America that pre-born babies have a right to life; to churches, abortion centers, high schools, colleges and the streets.\u201d\nFearless and frequently controversial, the 29-year-old Beatty is in the media frequently, whether it\u2019s being arrested for praying outside Planned Parenthood or exhorting protesters in Seattle\u2019s CHOP zone to care about the unborn black babies killed by Planned Parenthood.\nIn July, Beatty made international news when she smeared black paint on a Black Lives Matter mural in New York. Its support for abortion is the primary reason she does not support Black Lives Matter. \u201cThe number one killer of black Americans is abortion. 28 million babies and counting,\u201d she says, her voice sad. \u201cAveraging to about 675,000 babies a year dead. This is the number one killer. We are dying in massive numbers.\u201d\nSpeaking on the phone, Beatty is soft spoken and articulate, in contrast to her street preacher persona.\n\n\n\nI ask her to comment on a statement by former NFL player and pro-life advocate Benjamin Watson. Pro-lifers, he said at Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cRacism is a Life Issue\u201d conference this summer, should take the issue of abortion \u201cout of the political realm.\u201d While the black community \u201cis overwhelmingly pro-life in the sense of for-life, against abortion,\u201d he said, the pro-life label \u201chas come to mean something totally different than the essence of what it is.\u201d\nBeatty does not shy away from politics, so her response surprises me. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have to agree with him, and this is why: You sit down with the average African American individual and you discuss abortion. Even those who have experienced that trauma are most likely going to agree that abortion is murder. We\u2019re not so liberal that we\u2019re totally delusional about the wrong doing. We just make excuses for why we did it. But pro-lifers have in a sense become very political. \u201c\nFor Beatty, taking abortion \u201cout of the political realm\u201d clearly doesn\u2019t mean ignoring the role of politics. Known for being a fervent Trump supporter, she is well educated in conservative political thought. But her primary motivation is her Christian faith. \u201cThis is bigger than politics,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is sin.\u201d\nBeing pro-life, Beatty maintains, \u201cis bigger than just fighting to end abortion. It means getting involved in your community, getting involved with people\u2019s souls.\u201d It means addressing sin.\nRegretfully, Beatty says, many pro-lifers \u201chave only focused on the political realm.\u201d If the goal is \u201cabout bringing a solution to the problem, it has to be through the Gospel. It can\u2019t just be through regulation and politics. The Gospel has to stand firm.\u201d\nTo be clear, Beatty is not saying \u201cdon\u2019t focus on the politics of it,\u201d but ending abortion means acknowledging \u201cthere\u2019s a reason why these young girls are getting abortions.\u201d She feels there needs to be a dual, but equal, emphasis: changing laws and reaching women \u201cbefore they even head into the clinic.\u201d That means \u201cBeing in the neighborhood, getting involved with families. Discipling. This is what Jesus Christ did. We focus so much on the issues politically that we forget to minister and get to the root of the problem, which is sin.\u201d\nBeatty cites her own childhood as an example. Her mother was not a churchgoer, and Beatty credits her Christian faith to a local church that sent school buses to pick up neighborhood children and take them to church on Sundays. Reaching out to youth \u201cin the neighborhood where these issues are happening, before they hit the clinic\u201d is crucial.\n\n\n\nCircling back to politics, I ask Beatty what she thinks of the statement that pro-lifers only care about black life in the womb when it comes to election time, that pro-lifers are only interested in blacks in order to get votes. Beatty disagrees. \u201cThat would be wrong: a lie.\u201d\nShe gives special credit to Catholics in particular. \u201cWhen it comes to fighting for life, pro-lifers, especially the Catholics, are on the front lines.\u201d Citing the thousands of crisis pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and pregnancy care centers in the United States, many of them run by Catholics, she says Catholics \u201chave been on the job. Period. But I do think that we need to grow to a place as Christians where we hinder the problem from happening at all.\u201d\nWe close by discussing the observation that abortion is exceptionally difficult for whites to address with blacks. Beatty says \u201cIf whites are focused on the issue of abortion, then it is going to be difficult. But if whites are focused on the gospel\u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cThe gospel is a difficult thing for anybody. But if you\u2019re going to speak about abortion, you have to bring the gospel with you.\u201d\n\n\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

Will need to read it again, but few thoughts are as follows: 1.) My simple image of the active pro life movement consisted of a few White, mostly Catholics. This image is probably because I donate to Priest for Life. Just to focus on one of the people mentioned in the article, the work and sacrifice of Rev Hoye is stunning. He went to prison as a result of his protest, he was undetered an in continuing with his work. I wonder if any funds from Priest for Life makes its way to Rev Hoye\u2019s organization, I hope it does. 2.) Did not know that the left demeans pro life by trying to push the idea in the Black Community is that it is a White Issue, who really do not care about the well being of Black babies. 3.) The left  has succeeded, so far, in making it seem  racist by many in the Black Community for Whites to be against abortion and to cite the problem of families without fathers. 4.) While the Black community in general are against abortion, it has nevertheless has incidiously imbedded itself, to the point that the issue cannot be raised by Black Pastors.\nThis type of article should get a broader publication. I may print it and send it to local parishes for publication in bulletins.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMary Kiely\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2020 at 8:04 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nI have been reading pro-life articles, books and every kind of information available since before Roe v Wade.

But in the current political context, it implicitly criticizes the slogan \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d for being under-inclusive. This is wrong and can even be perceived as racist. When a particular threat is mentioned, other threats are not denied. Indeed, to insist on including those other threats is to disparage or even to deny the threats that were originally mentioned. In the same way, if someone suggested that we need to help immigrant children at the border, \u201cLet\u2019s help all children\u201d would rightly be perceived as a hostile response. \nThere is a way, however, that pro-lifers can build on the BLM movement to increase concern for babies of all races threatened by abortion. When we picket our largely-Black-clientele Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, we carry signs saying \u201cYOUR BABY MATTERS\u201d. Our signs do not enter into political debates about threatened groups. Instead, they focus on a particular baby and a particular mom. Because they are so personal, they are more likely than \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d signs (or even \u201cAll Black Lives Matter\u201d signs, which we also considered) to reach a mom, of any race, in a difficult pregnancy situation. And they have the added benefit of demonstrating to passersby that pro-lifers care about individual people, not just about issues. Thus they could be helpful in any pro-life demonstration, anywhere.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDV\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 29, 2020 at 9:39 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRichard Stith writes the following at the beginning of his comments:\n\u201cThe slogan \u2018All Lives Matter\u2019 is certainly correct. But in the current political context, it implicitly criticizes the slogan \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 for being under-inclusive. This is wrong and can even be perceived as racist. When a particular threat is mentioned, other threats are not denied. Indeed, to insist on including those other threats is to disparage or even to deny the threats that were originally mentioned.\u201d \nAlas, Richard, you have been misled like many others with respect to the slogan \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d  Please note the following:\nThe phrase \u2018black lives matter\u2019 when it is used as a slogan in protests and riots is not nearly as benign as many people ignorantly claim and/or believe it to be. Why? Because the primary/basic interpretation insisted upon by those who promote the slogan falsely maintains that black lives are abused and killed in large numbers and/or too often by police officers and white racists, and white people en masse and the legal system do not really care when these particular black lives are abused or destroyed. In this regard, then, the slogan means basically this: \u2018Hey, white people and legal authorities! Stop ignoring and not caring about the ongoing slaughter and abuse of black people by racist police officers, the legal system, and white racists in general. Black lives matter, you immoral racists.\u2019\nHowever, this is an egregiously false and unjust narrative that is not backed up by any objective data and other facts about such killings and abuse that the protesters and rioters and fellow travelers intentionally ignore while also declaring that they want justice as they robotically chant a call for immoral violence in the form of \u2018no justice, no peace\u2019, but they refuse to act justly toward police officers and white people in general. As such, they either participate in immoral violence or encourage it from others, all the while pushing false narratives to support their actions.\nAccordingly, anybody who uses, defends, or supports the \u2018black lives matter\u2019 protest slogan (The hideously immoral, pro-abortion, pro-homosexual marriage, pro-gender fantasies, pro-Marxist organization with the \u2018black lives matter\u2019 name is of course even worse in many ways.) as a legitimate form of protest is intentionally or unintentionally guilty of adopting a bigoted and unjust narrative toward white people in general, the legal system, and the majority of police officers based on the fundamental lie at the heart of the protest slogan.  Moreover, those who defend the protest slogan in part by claiming it does not diminish other lives are using the red herring fallacy to avoid admitting the bigotry of the primary narrative expressed by the protest slogan that automatically diminishes other lives based on the false stereotyping that comprises the essence of the protest slogan.\nAnd so, Richard, the racism is on the side of those who use the bigoted \u201cblack lives matter\u201d slogan in wrongful protest based on false narratives.  Responding to it as some have with \u201call lives matter\u201d is a correct response because it helps to expose the blatant racism and false focus of the \u201cblack lives matter\u201d slogan.  \nFor more insights into this with devastating detail that further exposes the lie of \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as a protest slogan, see the very short video (still available on YouTube) by Heather MacDonald entitled \u201cAre the Police Racist?\u201d\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJohn\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 5, 2021 at 5:14 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGreat response. I think 99% of problems with BLM is that all they had to do was ask for better policing. There are many problems in the current system of policing that do need addressed but the fact that the media translated it into \u201call police are racist\u201d which in turn lead to BLM with the slogan \u201cF the police\u201d as a call to dismantle the largest body of people in our country designated to keep the peace. Many people forget then if the police fail, the communities affected will become subject to the strongest authority in the area whether its military being sent in to stop crime with even more force or gangs in any form including what we saw in \u201cCHAZ/CHOP\u201d in Seattle where we saw a 525% spike in crime. https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2020/07/02/chaz-525-crime-n245149\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKathryn\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2020 at 1:26 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\u201cMy simple image of the active pro life movement consisted of a few White, mostly Catholics.\u201d\n.\nIt\u2019s funny.
