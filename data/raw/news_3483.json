Wade should not be viewed as the end of the pro-life movement. Instead its work \u2014 of supporting women and children \u2014 must now accelerate. For the first time in almost 50 years, the Supreme Court has taken a strong position that supports unborn life.\u00a0The leaked draft of the majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization indicates that the majority of justices are planning to stand squarely in favor of life.Justice Samuel Alito, the author of the draft opinion, wrote plainly: \u201cIt is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives.\u201dMore than 62 million unborn children have been aborted in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.\u00a0A case that was to guarantee that abortion was \u201csafe and rare\u201d has grievously proven otherwise in the subsequent decades. Children were denied the right to exist. Women were also harmed. Millions of women who were supposed to be happy and \u201cempowered\u201d by abortion procedures more often came away carrying psychological, physical and emotional trauma.\u00a0\u00a0Even while some liberal states have preemptively enacted laws permitting abortion up until birth, we are witnessing more broadly the dawning of a significant shift toward greater comprehension and value of life. With greater scientific advancements such as increasingly detailed ultrasound technology that shows fetal development at early stages, people are better understanding that every unborn baby is unique and recognizably human. We now know that a human fetus can, in fact, feel pain and will attempt to avoid it if possible.As more Americans see the undeniable humanity of these tiny human beings, they can no longer remain silent. The science now informs an emboldened culture that recoils from the violence of abortion and rejects industries that profit from dismembering and selling fetal body parts. RelatedIs America really a \u2018pro-choice nation\u2019?Perspective: The Supreme sieveBut, as Roman Catholic Cardinal Se\u00e1n P. O\u2019Malley of Boston noted earlier this year, \u201cDismantling unjust laws is only the beginning. We still have the arduous task of creating a pro-life culture, of changing heart and minds.\u201d He added: \u201cOur task is not to judge others, but to try to bring healing \u2026 to build a society that takes care of everybody, where every person counts, where every life is important.\u201dThe leaked draft opinion notes that 30 states had laws against abortion when Roe v. Wade was first decided. The majority of states did not support this decision in 1973. And in the Dobbs case currently before the court, 26 states joined in asking that Roe be overturned.\u00a0The draft notes that \u201cfar from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and (Planned Parenthood v.) Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.\u201d\u00a0Presuming the opinion and votes remain unchanged, the Supreme Court will effectively end the charade that there is some nebulous right to abort one\u2019s baby within the Constitution.\u00a0 The justices say clearly that no such right exists.\u00a0Then they hand the issue back to the people \u2014 where it has always belonged.  Of course, the issue remains extremely divisive. But that too can change.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have before us an opportunity to grow a culture that embraces life and demonstrates what that really means. We are at a magnificent juncture where we can show what it means to heal from old wounds and build something better. We also have the opportunity to work across the aisle and demonstrate a greater respect for life and women as a collective community. We should work to enshrine this \u201clife culture\u201d as a national value for generations beyond just Dobbs.Each state and its communities must rise up in supporting women in crisis and their unborn family members. Those who have been toiling for years to protect the unborn and support their mothers should also toil with the same intensity to ensure that women and men from all backgrounds have the resources to care for their precious new life.Assuming the opinion stands, what will be the impact in our own state of Utah? In 2020, the Utah Legislature enacted SB174 \u2014 Sen. Dan McCay\u2019s bill that would ban abortion with few exceptions (rape, incest, life of mother, severe fetal abnormality) if Roe were overturned. It appears that may become Utah\u2019s law soon.More than 3,000 babies are aborted in elective abortions each year in Utah. Granted, some women would still choose to travel to other states to obtain abortions. But it\u2019s likely that many thousands of lives will be spared.As a state, we have the opportunity to demonstrate how to celebrate women as they embark on their journey of sacred stewardship over a new life. We can surely do more to empower women to experience motherhood as a contributing asset to society, not just a liability.\u00a0This shift in perspective is ours to create \u2014 with the promise of many new citizens and families with fresh hope for their future.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, organizations such as Pro-Life Utah and Pregnancy Resource Centers have actively supported vulnerable pregnant women with financial assistance, baby supplies, mentoring, connection to resources and friendship. This is a work for all of us.Women carrying heavy burdens need circles of trust and support that span the breadth of their motherhood. They need active and robust pregnancy resource centers that are well funded and supported. They need flexible and specialized accommodations in the school and workplace. But most of all, women need communities that embrace their children and families in a way that feels empowering. This is what our call to maternal feminism and a pro-life culture is all about. It\u2019s time to celebrate this decision, and pray it holds, while concentrating our efforts on providing a robust safety net for women in terms of medical services, mental heath support, financial support and more. We must continue to seek to lessen trauma and reduce violence. Our Legislature has stood firm to boldly protect the rights of our preborn children, and we are grateful for lawmakers\u2019 courage in their continued defense of our most vulnerable citizens.As we await the final outcome of this case, we are hopeful the Supreme Court justices who have voted initially to overturn Roe v. Wade will remain courageous in honoring this life ethic. No matter what happens over the next few months, we have confidence that a new era of life culture awaits.Carolina Allen is the director of Big Ocean Women.
