Halford, right, declined to block Mississippi\u2019s 2007 abortion trigger ban from taking effect in an opinion on July 5, 2022, allowing the state to enforce a near-total abortion ban on July 7. Rob McDuff, left, an attorney with the Mississippi Center For Justice who is representing the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d but \u201creviewing (their) options.\u201d AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, Pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday will be the last day the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization can provide abortions after a state court declined to block a near-total abortion ban from going into effect on Thursday, July 7.\nIn court Tuesday morning, attorneys for the clinic asked the judge, Special Chancellor Debbra K. Halford, to block the state\u2019s 2007 trigger law from taking effect Thursday, July 7. When it does, the ban will \u201cprohibit abortions in the state of Mississippi\u201d at any stage \u201cexcept in cases where necessary for the preservation of the mother\u2019s life or where the pregnancy was caused by rape.\u201d\nLawmakers set the law to become effective only if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed that 1973 precedent on June 24 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, and Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch took steps on June 27 to make the trigger law enforceable 10 days afterward.\nWhile asking the judge to block the law, the clinic\u2019s attorneys cited a 1998 Mississippi Supreme Court ruling in Pro-Choice v. Fordice, which found residents have a \u201cright to have an abortion\u201d as part of the \u201cright to privacy.\u201d Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart, however, told the court that the 24-year-old ruling relied on now-defunct Supreme Court precedents, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\nHalford: \u2018Real Harm\u2019 Would Be To State\nIn her 8-page opinion Tuesday afternoon, Halford agreed with Stewart, saying that the Mississippi Supreme Court will likely reverse the Fordice ruling on appeal after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s momentous ruling in the Dobbs case found \u201cthere is no U.S. Constitutionally protected right to an abortion.\u201d\n\u201cSince Roe and Casey are no longer the law of the land, reliance upon Fordice will almost certainly not be well-founded when pursuing this case in the (Mississippi) Supreme Court,\u201d she wrote, saying that \u201cthere seems to have been inadequate attempts by the Fordice Court to define alternate bases for finding the existence of state constitutional protection to abortion.\u201d\nSolicitor General Scott Stewart argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey means a 1998 Mississippi Supreme Court ruling finding a \u201cright to have an abortion\u201d will likely be overturned. AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, Pool\nIn the Fordice decision, though, the Mississippi Supreme Court cited its own 1985 opinion in the case In re Brown, which found a \u201cright to privacy\u201d and \u201cautonomous bodily integrity.\u201d The court said in the Fordice ruling that \u201cprotected within the right of autonomous bodily integrity is an implicit right to have an abortion.\u201d\nHalford rejected the clinic\u2019s arguments that failure to block the law would cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to its workers and their patients.\n\u201cAlthough many of the harms alleged by Plaintiffs boil down to economic harms to the providers by having to close their clinics and to their patients for the costs of delivery and caring for unwanted children, the Court acknowledges that the psychological trauma suffered by the patients and the perceived loss of life opportunities they will face in a post-Roe world is significant, and irreparable from those patients\u2019 perspectives,\u201d the judge wrote.\u00a0\n\u201cThe loss of licensure and potential imprisonment arguments urged by Plaintiffs are not persuasive inasmuch as those consequences can be avoided by compliance with the statutes as enforced.\u201d\nHalford found that any decision to temporarily block the law \u201cwould clearly harm the state and its citizens\u201d by \u201cdenying the public interest in enforcement of its laws.\u201d She cited the June 24 Dobbs ruling\u2019s finding that states have \u201c\u2018legitimate interests\u2019 in restricting abortion,\u201d including \u201crespect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development\u201d and \u201cthe elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures.\u201d\n\u201cThe laws here advance those interests, and enjoining the laws would undermine those interests,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen considering this, clearly the real harm to the State of Mississippi and its citizens, current and future, flowing from the issuance of an injunction is outweighed by any potential threatened harm to Plaintiffs, if the injunction is not issued.\u201d\nAbortion Clinic Attorneys \u2018Reviewing Options\u2019\nRob McDuff, an attorney with the Mississippi Center for Justice, is representing the clinic and argued for the injunction Tuesday morning. He reacted to Halford\u2019s decision in a short statement to the Mississippi Free Press.\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the Court\u2019s failure to uphold the Mississippi Constitutional rights at stake in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be reviewing our options.\u201d\nThe Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic, will no longer be able to provide abortions after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Photo by Lukas Flippo\nOnce the trigger ban takes effect Thursday, state law will provide no exceptions for incest or severe fetal deformity, and rape exceptions will only be accepted if a victim reported their rape to law enforcement. If federal courts allow a 2019 law banning abortions before six weeks to go into effect, though, there would be no rape exceptions available after the sixth week of pregnancy, either.\nAfter the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit, all Hinds County Chancery Court judges in the 5th District recused themselves from the case. Last week, Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Randolph appointed Judge Debbra K. Halford of the 4th District to preside over the case. Former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour appointed her to the 4th District in 2005.\nRead the Judge\u2019s Ruling\nAt the beginning of the hearing in the trigger law case Tuesday morning, Rev. Calvin Cosnahan, a United Methodist Church pastor, led a prayer as a \u201cspecial chaplain\u201d at Halford\u2019s request.\n\u201cLord, we pray for the presence of your holy spirt in this courtroom today. \u2026 We seek your truth, not our own. We seek your wisdom, not our own,\u201d the minister said, asking God to \u201cgrant that the cause of truth, justice and humanity should in nowise suffer in the proceedings today.\u201d\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, celebrated the decision in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\u201cThe trigger law will go into effect on July 7th, as planned. This law has the potential to save the lives of thousands of unborn Mississippi children. It is a great victory for life,\u201d said the governor, whose state boasts the nation\u2019s highest infant death rate, highest fetal death rate, lowest overall life expectancy rate and where the pregnancy-related maternal death rate is 1.9 times higher than the U.S. as a whole.\nNick Judin contributed to this report.\nSee the MFP\u2019s full coverage and archive on abortion rights in Mississippi here and the Jackson Free Press archive here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshton Pittman \n\n\nAward-winning News Editor Ashton Pittman, a native of the South Mississippi Pine Belt, studied journalism and political science at the University of Southern Mississippi.
