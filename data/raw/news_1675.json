LOUIS (AP) \u2014 A group of religious leaders who support abortion rights filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Missouri\u2019s abortion ban, saying lawmakers openly invoked their religious beliefs while drafting the measure and thereby imposed those beliefs on others who don\u2019t share them.The lawsuit filed in St. Louis is the latest of many to challenge restrictive abortion laws enacted by conservative states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. That landmark ruling left abortion rights up to each state to decide.Since then, religious abortion rights supporters have increasingly used religious freedom lawsuits in seeking to protect abortion access. The religious freedom complaints are among nearly three dozen post-Roe lawsuits that have been filed against 19 states\u2019 abortion bans, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe Missouri lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Christian , Jewish and Unitarian Universalist leaders seeks a permanent injunction barring the state from enforcing its abortion law and a declaration that provisions of its law violate the Missouri Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissouri GOP leaders say LGBTQ+ issues will take a back seat to child care, education policy in 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the lawsuit says is that when you legislate your religious beliefs into law, you impose your beliefs on everyone else and force all of us to live by your own narrow beliefs,\u201d said Michelle Banker of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the lead attorney in the case. \u201cAnd that hurts us. That denies our basic human rights.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissouri Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, a Republican, called the lawsuit \u201cfoolish.\u201d\u201cWe were acting on the belief that life is precious and should be treated as such. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a religious belief,\u201d Rowden said.Within minutes of last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision, then-Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Gov. Mike Parson, both Republicans, filed paperwork to immediately enact a 2019 law prohibiting abortions \u201cexcept in cases of medical emergency.\u201d That law contained a provision making it effective only if Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nThe law makes it a felony punishable by 5 to 15 years in prison to perform or induce an abortion. Medical professionals who do so also could lose their licenses. The law says that women who undergo abortions cannot be prosecuted.Missouri already had some of the nation\u2019s more restrictive abortion laws and had seen a significant decline in the number of abortions performed, with residents instead traveling to clinics just across the state line in Illinois and Kansas.The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the faith leaders by Americans United for Separation of Church & State and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said sponsors and supporters of the Missouri measure \u201crepeatedly emphasized their religious intent in enacting the legislation.\u201d It quotes the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Nick Schroer, as saying that \u201cas a Catholic I do believe life begins at conception and that is built into our legislative findings.\u201d A co-sponsor, Republican state Rep. Barry Hovis, said he was motivated \u201cfrom the Biblical side of it,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here today because none of our religious views on abortion or anything else should be enshrined into our laws,\u201d Maharat Rori Picker Neiss, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of St. Louis and one of the plaintiffs, said at a news conference.Lawsuits in several other states take similar approaches.In Indiana, lawyers for five anonymous women \u2014 who are Jewish, Muslim and spiritual \u2014 and advocacy group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued that state\u2019s ban infringes on their beliefs. Their lawsuit specifically highlights the Jewish teaching that a fetus becomes a living person at birth and that Jewish law prioritizes the mother\u2019s life and health.A court ruling siding with the women was appealed by the Indiana attorney general\u2019s office, which is asking the state Supreme Court to consider the case.In Kentucky, three Jewish women sued, claiming the state\u2019s ban violates their religious rights under the state\u2019s constitution and religious freedom law. They allege that Kentucky\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature \u201cimposed sectarian theology\u201d by prohibiting nearly all abortions. The ban remains in effect while the Kentucky Supreme Court considers a separate case challenging the law.\n\nBut Banker said Missouri\u2019s lawsuit is unique because while plaintiffs in other states claimed harm, \u201cwe are saying that the whole law violates separation of church and state and we\u2019re seeking to get everything struck down.\u201dMissouri Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, said in a statement that he will \u201cdefend the right to life with every tool at my disposal.\u201d\u201cI want Missouri to be the safest state in the nation for children and that includes unborn children,\u201d Bailey said.___Associated Press writer David A.
