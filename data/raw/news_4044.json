It was later revealed Notre Dame would not cover copper IUDs or emergency contraceptives. Notre Dame covers \u201csimple\u201d contraceptives, but requires those enrolled in the university\u2019s health plan to contribute by paying out of pocket.U.S. District Court Judge Philip Simon denied the university\u2019s motions to dismiss the case Thursday and a pretrial conference is scheduled for early March.\u201cOur position is grounded in the autonomy of litigants, including the government, to settle claims, and we are confident that Notre Dame will prevail,\u201d said Paul Browne, Notre Dame\u2019s vice president for public affairs and communications, in a statement emailed to The Tribune.The plaintiffs in the suit include Irish 4 Reproductive Health \u2014 a group of Notre Dame undergraduate and graduate students \u2014 and three unnamed women. Assisting in the suit are the National Women\u2019s Law Center, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Center for Reproductive Rights.On Friday, Irish 4 Reproductive Health released a statement calling the judge\u2019s decision \u201cmomentous.\u201d\u201cIn February 2018, Notre Dame entered into a secretive deal with the Trump-Pence administration to impose unnecessary and burdensome costs on us and restrict our reproductive healthcare options to methods deemed acceptable by (Notre Dame President) Fr. (John) Jenkins\u2019s coterie of advisors,\u201d the statement read. \u201cNo one at Notre Dame \u2014 and no one anywhere \u2014should have to choose between what is right for their body and life and what they can afford.\u201dCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.southbendtribune.com.
