Frank Pavone speaks to the media outside the Supreme Court building in Washington during an anti-abortion protest in November 2006. (Credit: Bob Roller/CNS.)\nListenROME \u2013 Frank Pavone, long a controversial figure in American Catholicism for his unconventional pro-life advocacy who was recently defrocked by the Vatican, has accused his bishop of abuse of authority and \u201cconstant lies,\u201d saying he has no intention of quitting his ministry.\nSpeaking to Crux, Pavone said Bishop Patrick Zurek, who oversees the Diocese of Amarillo where Pavone was incardinated as a priest, has been threatening to dismiss him from the priesthood for the past five years \u201cunder three or four changing, shifting rationales.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn American law you go after a crime in search of a person. Something wrong has been done, and you go and track down the people responsible for it. This is the opposite, it\u2019s a person in search of a crime. They\u2019re going after me and they keep changing the reasons why,\u201d he said.\nPavone called Zurek\u2019s actions an \u201cabuse of authority,\u201d and said he is aware that he\u2019s made mistakes in his ministry, but that he has sought to make reparation for those errors and has been obedient to instructions from his superiors to cease and desist certain activities and functions, such as those tied to US politics.\n\u201cI want to be a priest. I\u2019m not leaving the church under any circumstances. If you close the door, I\u2019m going to be standing on the other side of the door waiting for it to open again, and, I\u2019m going to keep doing my pro-life work,\u201d Pavone said.\n\u201cYou tell me whether this is work that\u2019s consistent with the church or not. I\u2019m going to keep doing it, and I\u2019m going to keep faithful to my calling as a priest. That\u2019s a calling, not a piece of paper,\u201d he said.\nDismissal from the clerical state\nOver the weekend news broke that Pavone, 63, had been dismissed from the clerical state for disobedience and blasphemy after a long and contentious deadlock with Zurek.\nThe news was communicated in a letter dated Dec. 13 and sent to all US bishops by the Vatican\u2019s envoy to the United States, Archbishop Christophe Pierre.\nIn the letter, Pierre said he had been informed by the prefect of the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Clergy, South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, that on Nov. 9 of this year, \u201ca supreme decision admitting of no possibility of appeal directed that Rev. Frank Pavone be dismissed from the clerical state.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S. His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful,\u201d the letter said.\nGiven the interest the decision will likely generate, Pierre included a statement on Pavone\u2019s laicization that he said was approved by the Dicastery for Clergy could be posted to diocesan and archdiocesan websites \u201cif you deem appropriate.\u201d\nThe statement, which has since been published on the Diocese of Amarillo\u2019s website, said that the decision to defrock Pavone \u201cwas taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop.\u201d\n\u201cFather Pavone was given ample opportunity to defend himself in the canonical proceedings, and he was also given multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop,\u201d the statement said.\nHowever, \u201cit was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions.\u201d\nReferring to Priests for Life, the statement said that since it \u201cis not a Catholic organization, Mr. Pavone\u2019s continuing role in it as a lay person would be entirely up to the leadership of that organization.\u201d\nDecades of controversy\nThe Founder and National Director of Priests for Life, which he established in 1990, Pavone has long been a lightning rod in US Catholicism.\nIn one of his most notable controversies during the 2016 US presidential elections, while also serving as co-chair of Donald Trump\u2019s pro-life coalition, Pavone produced a livestreamed video in which he placed a basket containing the body of an aborted fetus onto an altar. The video, which urged Catholics to oppose Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, caused immediate backlash, with Zurek insisting that he would open an investigation into the incident.\nIn January 2020, further controversy erupted over his appointment as co-chair of the Pro-Life Voices for Trump coalition and his announcement in April of that year that he would be joining the Catholics for Trump advisory board.\nIn July of that year, Pavone announced that he would be stepping down from his position on the Catholics for Trump advisory board in compliance with a request from the Congregation for Clergy that he not hold formal titles with political campaigns.\nThat request was based on Canon 287 of the Code of Canon Law, which states in its second article that clergy \u201care not to play an active role in political parties\u2026unless, in the judgement of the competent ecclesiastical authority, this is required for the defense of the rights of the Church or to promote the common good.\u201d\nSpeaking to Crux, Pavone said Zurek\u2019s request that he renounce his priestly duties dates back to at least 2017, when the two of them had a meeting attended by other clergy in which Zurek asked Pavone to limit his prolife advocacy and indicated that he no longer wanted Pavone inside of his diocese.\n\u201cI said, okay, you don\u2019t want me to work inside the diocese and you don\u2019t want me to work outside the diocese. You want me out of the priesthood altogether, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said.\nPavone said Zurek initially denied the claim, but a few weeks later sent him a letter asking him to voluntarily request laicization, or Zurek would formally ask the Vatican to do it.\nTwo years later, in 2019, Pavone said the Vatican \u201cdismissed\u201d Zurek\u2019s request and authorized his transfer to the Diocese of Colorado Springs, which was led by Bishop Michael Sheridan until his death in September of this year.\nOnce this agreement had been reached, Pavone said the Vatican authorized his transfer but ordered him to stay in his new diocese at least half of the year, restricting his ability to travel as part his advocacy with Priests for Life.\n\u201cNeither (Bishop Sheridan) nor I saw that as workable, because the whole purpose here is to enable me to continue this mission and foster this vocation of full-time pro-life work, which is what I\u2019ve been doing for 30 years,\u201d Pavone said.\nAt that point, Pavone said \u201cwe were back to square one, and Bishop Zurek was complaining.\u201d\nHe said he eventually got wind that the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Clergy had issued a ruling on his case with the pope\u2019s approval based on Zurek\u2019s complaints, and was told that needed to have a sit-down meeting with Zurek to go over that decision.\nHowever, Pavone said he refused the meeting after deciding years ago that \u201cI could no longer deal in any way, shape or form, on a human level, with Bishop Zurek, because of the constant lies, manipulation.\u201d\nPavone said he found out about his dismissal from the clerical state over the weekend through media requests for comment on Pierre\u2019s letter.\nDefending past record \nPavone defended his record on the allegations of blasphemy and disobedience in Pierre\u2019s letter, saying no one contacted him about the incident with the video of the aborted fetus in 2016, but that \u201cInstead of asking me what happened, all of a sudden I\u2019m seeing in news reports that the diocese is launching an investigation.\u201d\n\u201cTalk to me, ask me what happened. Call me, sit down with me. But no, they have to make a big show,\u201d he said, saying Zurek \u201cnever asked me once through the whole process, okay, tell me your version of what happened.\n\u201cHe had his own set of facts in his head, and just went public with those facts even after we refuted them. Ultimately, that became one of his reasons for calling for dismissal from the clerical state,\u201d he said.\nIn reference to his support for Donald Trump and the former US president\u2019s MAGA movement, Pavone said that in both cases, the video and his political advocacy in the Trump campaign, \u201cthe things I was asked to do I did. I was obedient, cooperative, I carried out the changes I was requested to make.\u201d\nPavone also denied the allegations of blasphemy, saying this charge is in reference to an angry tweet he sent out to a Biden supporter during the 2020 election cycle, \u201cwhen half the country was furious.\u201d\n\u201cI went off into some tantrum, and I said \u2018G.D. loser Biden supporter.\u2019 I shouldn\u2019t have done that, and I don\u2019t usually do that. It was an unusual moment of anger,\u201d he said, accusing Zurek of blowing the issue out of proportion and making \u201ca theological thing out of it,\u201d saying, \u201cGod does not damn these people, Father Frank is declaring theologically that God is damning Biden and the Democrats.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, bishop, are you living in an alternate universe? In this one, where I live, people get mad and people sometimes say things they shouldn\u2019t say and they say them out of anger and you know what, one of the bad things we say sometimes is the G-D word!\u201d\nHe also lamented the lack of recognition for his lifelong dedication to pro-life ministry, saying Pierre in his letter referred to his association with the pro-life movement in the United States, but there was no sign of appreciation.\n\u201cYou might want to work in a little phrase, just in passing, his 30 years of work \u2018for which the church is grateful,\u2019 or \u2018we judge this action to be necessary but we recognize the value of this work, we\u2019re grateful for the commitment.\u2019 But no, they can\u2019t even bring themselves to throw in a little phrase like that, which tells me all I need to know,\u201d he said.\nPavone said he believes part of the reason this decision was made now is \u201ca change in personnel\u201d inside the Vatican, saying there is more than 20 years of back and forth with the Dicastery for Clergy under both John Paul II and Benedict XVI in which attempts to negotiate different solutions were made.\n\u201cUnder Pope Francis, it\u2019s been different. There\u2019s also been a change in personnel at the Congregation for Clergy\u2026They don\u2019t know the history,\u201d he said, saying he believes there is also \u201cgrowing frustration\u201d among US bishops over allegations that he has been disobedient.\nReferring to his ministry, Pavone said, \u201cThere\u2019s no question that there\u2019s nothing which is inconsistent with church teaching. So, what\u2019s the problem? They\u2019ve never been able to tell me or anyone else the problem.\u201d\nGoing forward\nPavone said that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d intends to continue his work regardless of the Vatican\u2019s ruling, and pointed to what he said are several successful ministries within Priests for Life, such as healing and mercy ministries, and he also credited them as having had an impact on the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision earlier this year to overturn Roe v Wade.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of the accomplishments, so no, I didn\u2019t go along with (Zurek) telling me stop doing this work, and I\u2019m not going to do that now either,\u201d he said, saying, \u201cit\u2019s full steam ahead.\u201d\n\u201cMy board and my staff are 1000 percent united behind me and around me and with each other, we\u2019re in a good situation,\u201d he said, saying the supporters of Priests for Life are \u201csupporting us not because of the bishops, they\u2019re supporting us precisely because we\u2019re doing the work they wish their bishops were doing but they\u2019re not. So, I think we\u2019re in a good position for moving forward.\u201d\nPavone said that if the church \u201ccloses the door\u201d on him then he will not go away, but will be standing \u201con the other side of the door. I\u2019m not going to go join some Protestant church or anything like that, I\u2019m sticking with the church and I\u2019m sticking with the priesthood, this is my vocation.\u201d\nNo Vatican decision can change \u201cwhat\u2019s in my heart,\u201d and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t change my passion and my commitment to this cause, and this mission, it doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d Pavone said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m here. As soon as you want to be reasonable, as soon as you want to open that door again, whether it\u2019s this pope or the next pope, I\u2019ll be around and I\u2019ll walk back through that door.\u201d\nNeither the Dicastery for Clergy nor the apostolic nunciature in the United States responded to Crux requests for comment.\nThe Diocese of Amarillo could not be reached by phone for comment on this story.\nFollow Elise Ann Allen on Twitter:\u00a0@eliseannallen\nFollow John Lavenburg on Twitter:\u00a0@johnlavenburg\nShareLatest Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Related Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Popular\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep Crux IndependentFor the cost of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can help keep the lights on at Crux.Support UsLast Week in the Church with John Allen Jr.Tuesdays onCrux.
