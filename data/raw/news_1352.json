What changed? \n      \n      \n\n                        By Annalies Winny \n      \n      \n\n \nAbortion laws have never been more contentious in the U.S. Yet for the first century of the country\u2019s existence\u2014and most of human history before that\u2014abortion was a relatively uncontroversial fact of life.\n\u201cAbortion has existed for pretty much as long as human beings have existed,\u201d says Joanne Rosen, JD, MA, a senior lecturer in Health Policy and Management who studies the impact of law and policy on access to abortion.\nUntil the mid-19th century, the U.S. attitude toward abortion was much the same as it had often been elsewhere throughout history: It was a quiet reality, legal until \u201cquickening\u201d (when fetal motion could be felt by the mother). In the eyes of the law, the fetus wasn\u2019t a \u201cseparate distinct entity until then,\u201d but rather an extension of the mother, Rosen explains.\nWhat changed?\nAmerica\u2019s first anti-abortion movement wasn\u2019t driven primarily by moral or religious concerns like it is today. Instead, abortion\u2019s first major foe in the U.S. was physicians on a mission to regulate medicine.\nUntil this point, abortion services had been \u201cwomen\u2019s work.\u201d Most providers were midwives, many of whom made a good living selling abortifacient plants. They relied on methods passed down through generations, from herbal abortifacients and pessaries\u2014a tampon-like device soaked in a solution to induce abortion\u2014to catheter abortions that irritate the womb and force a miscarriage, to a minor surgical procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C), which remains one of the most common methods of terminating an early pregnancy.\nThe cottage abortion industry caught the attention of the fledgling American Medical Association, which was established in 1847 and, at the time, excluded women and Black people from membership. The AMA was keen to be taken seriously as a gatekeeper of the medical profession, and abortion services made midwives and other irregular practitioners\u2014so-called quacks\u2014an easy target. Their rhetoric was strategic, says Mary Fissell, PhD, the J. Mario Molina professor in the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cYou have to link those midwives to providing abortion as a way of kind of getting them out of business,\u201d Fissell says. \u201cSo organized medicine very much takes the anti-abortion position and stays with that for some time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Early 19th century and before\n              \nAbortion is legal in the U.S. until \u201cquickening\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n                1857\n              \nAMA campaigns to end abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n                1860\u201380\n              \nAt least 40 anti-abortion statutes are enacted in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n                1873\n              \nComstock Act makes it illegal to sell or mail contraceptives or abortifacients\n\n\n\n\n\n                Late 19th century\n              \nOB-GYN emerges as a specialty\n\n\n\n\n\n                1965\n              \nGriswold v. Connecticut decision finds that the Constitution guarantees a right to privacy, specifically in prescribing contraceptives, paving the way for Roe v. Wade\n\n\n\n\n\n                1973\n              \nSupreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade enshrines abortion as a constitutional right\n\n\n\n\n\n                1992\n              \nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey protects a woman's right to have an abortion prior to\u00a0fetal viability\n\n\n\n\n\n                2005\u201307\n              \nFour states pass trigger laws making it a felony to perform, procure, or prescribe an abortion if Roe is ever overturned\n\n\n\n\n\n                June 2022\n              \nRoe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey overturned; 13 states ban abortion by October 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n-\n\n \n \nIn 1857, the AMA took aim at unregulated abortion providers with a letter-writing campaign pushing state lawmakers to ban the practice. To make their case, they asserted that there was a medical consensus that life begins at conception, rather than at quickening.\nThe campaign succeeded. At least 40 anti-abortion laws went on the books between 1860 and 1880.\nAnd yet some doctors continued to perform abortions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By then, abortion was illegal in almost all states and territories, but during the Depression era, \u201cdoctors could see why women wouldn\u2019t want a child,\u201d and many would perform them anyway, Fissell says. In the 1920s and through the 1930s, many cities had physicians who specialized in abortions, and other doctors would refer patients to them \u201coff book.\u201d\nThat leniency faded with the end of World War II. \u201cAll across America, it\u2019s very much about gender roles, and women are supposed to be in the home, having babies,\u201d Fissell says. This shift in the 1940s and \u201950s meant that more doctors were prosecuted for performing abortions, which drove the practice underground and into less skilled hands. In the 1950s and 1960s, up to 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed each year in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute.\u00a0In 1965, 17% of reported deaths attributed to pregnancy and childbirth were associated with illegal abortion.\nA rubella outbreak from 1963\u20131965 moved the dial again, back toward more liberal abortion laws. Catching rubella during pregnancy could cause severe birth defects, leading medical authorities to endorse therapeutic abortions. But these safe, legal abortions remained largely the preserve of the privileged. \u201cWomen who are well-to-do have always managed to get abortions, almost always without a penalty,\u201d says Fissell. \u201cBut God help her if she was a single, Black, working-class woman.\u201d\nWomen who could afford it brought their cases to court to fight for access to hospital abortions. Other women gained approval for abortions with proof from a physician that carrying the pregnancy would endanger her life or her physical or mental health. These cases set off a wave of abortion reform bills in state legislatures that helped set the stage for Roe v. Wade. By the time Roe was decided in 1973, legal abortions were already available in 17 states\u2014and not just to save a woman\u2019s life.\nBut raising the issue to the level of the Supreme Court and enshrining abortion rights for all Americans also galvanized opposition to it and mobilized anti-abortion groups. \u201cRoe was under attack virtually from the moment it was decided,\u201d says Rosen. \u00a0\nIn 1992 another Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey posed the most significant existential threat to Roe. Rosen calls it \u201cthe case that launched a thousand abortion regulations,\u201d upholding Roe but giving states far greater scope to regulate abortion prior to fetal viability. However, defining that nebulous milestone a became a flashpoint for debate as medical advancements saw babies survive earlier and earlier outside the womb. Sonograms became routine around the same time, making fetal life easier to grasp and \u201cputting wind in the sails of the \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement,\u201d Rosen says. Then in June, the Supreme Court overturned both Roe and Casey.\nFor many Americans, that meant the return to the conundrum that led Norma McCorvey\u2014a.k.a. Jane Roe\u2014to the Supreme Court in 1971: being poor and pregnant, and seeking an abortion in a state that had banned them in all but the narrowest of circumstances.\nThe history of abortion in the U.S. suggests the tides will turn again. \u201cWe often see periods of toleration followed by periods of repression,\u201d says Fissell. The current moment is unequivocally marked by the latter. What remains to be seen is how long it will last.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage at top: Chichester\u2019s English Diamond Brand Pennyroyal Pills.
