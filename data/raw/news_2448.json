eufyCam 2 Pro wireless home security camera system had the potential to shake up the flood of smart security cameras on the market. While it holds its own, it really doesn\u2019t stand out.\n\nContents\nInstallationVideoExtra featuresOur take\n\n\nAlina Bradford / Digital Trends\nInstallation\nThe EufyCam 2 Pro comes as a single camera ($150) or as a two-pack with two cameras and the Eufy HomeBase 2 ($350). I would suggest springing for the pack with the HomeBase 2 if you don\u2019t already have one. You can\u2019t use the EufyCam 2 Pro without a HomeBase, so you\u2019re going to need it anyway. The HomeBase 2 is a hub that connects cameras, stores footage, and works as a Wi-Fi repeater to boost your Wi-Fi, so your cameras get a strong signal.\n\n\n\t\tRelated\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDoes the Ring Stick Up Cam Pro rotate or swivel?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCan you use a Blink Outdoor Camera without a subscription?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWyze Cam Floodlight v2 adds tons of new features at a lower price tag\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThis is really helpful if your signal isn\u2019t the best or you have a long stretch of space between your router and your cameras. On the other hand, the HomeBase takes up yet another Ethernet port on your router and another power outlet that you probably can\u2019t spare.\nAlina Bradford / Digital Trends\nThe installation of this camera is super simple. The EufyCam 2 Pro is magnetic, so you can stick it to a porch railing or just about any other metal surface. If you don\u2019t have anything to stick it to, you can install a mounting bracket with a couple of screws and then twist the camera onto the bracket. All in all, it took about 10 minutes to get the camera mounted and another five minutes to get it set up with the app and Eufy HomeBase 2. Direct sunlight can blind the camera though, so take that into consideration when you\u2019re thinking about a place to put it.\nVideo\nVideo from the EufyCam 2 Pro is on par with most other high-end security cameras, such as the Arlo Pro 3. It can be switched between HD 1080p or 2K HD with a large field of view of 140 degrees. If you place the camera 7 to 10 feet high, it can see a range of up to 30 feet, so one camera can cover a large area of your yard. Video clarity is pretty good, with realistic colors, very little distortion, and good contrast. While it\u2019s decent, I wish Eufy had stepped up and went to 4K resolution, like the Arlo Ultra Smart Cam.\nEufy tackled the problem by adding Smart Image Enhancement.\n\nA problem with some cameras is that the further away a person is, the grittier the image of the person becomes. Within a couple of feet, faces are crisp and clear with a lot of contrast. At around 10 feet, faces are much harder to make out; you can get the general shape, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to make out a stranger\u2019s features. Eufy tackled the problem by adding Smart Image Enhancement. When a face is detected by the A.I., it brightens and clears up any pixelation in the image to make faces clearer.\nNight vision is in black and white, but I really don\u2019t mind the lack of color. The video is clear in very low light. The camera has trouble with faces at night, though, despite the Smart Image Enhancement. The camera washed out almost all facial features, even just a few feet away, on my lighter-skinned test subjects.\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\nOther cameras, such as those from Ring and Arlo\u2019s line of cameras, charge a subscription fee for video storage packages. I hate that. I have enough subscriptions in my life. One of my favorite features of the EufyCam 2 Pro is that you don\u2019t need to pay for video storage. Video footage is stored locally in the HomeBase 2, instead of in the cloud. It has 16GB of storage, which doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but it gets the job done as long as you delete videos you don\u2019t need. It does automatically delete old videos, but it\u2019s probably better to go in and weed them out yourself so it doesn\u2019t delete what you want to keep.\nExtra features\nBeyond the video clarity and storage, there are some notable features to the EufyCam 2 Pro that are useful. One surprising option is the ability to put each camera and the HomeBase 2 on Anti-Theft Detection Mode. This means if anyone moves the camera or HomeBase, an alarm will sound. It would be nice if Eufy also offered to replace stolen cameras like Ring does, but I still think the alarm feature is cool.\nMany newer security cameras feature a mic and speaker, so you can talk to whoever is outside near the camera using the app on your phone. The EufyCam 2 Pro has this option as well. The two-way audio is OK and you can adjust the volume in the app. I wish that it had noise cancellation to make voices clearer, though, like the Ring Stick Up Cam. You can also mute the mic and the speaker independently.\nIt\u2019s hard to say how true the claim of a year-long battery life really is in the everyday household.\n\nThe company says that the EufyCam 2 Pro can last for 365 days from just one charge, if the camera records around 300 seconds of footage per day. If that were true, it would most certainly stand out from other cameras for that alone. Six months is usually the max. Unfortunately, after using the cameras for just one day, the battery gauge said power had dropped by 1%, so it\u2019s hard to say how true the claim of a year-long battery life really is in the everyday household.\nThe app has a Power Manager option for each camera that can make the battery last longer, though. You can set the camera to Optimal Battery Life Mode, which limits video clips to 20 seconds to prevent draining the battery. Meanwhile, an Optimal Surveillance Mode allows clips to be as long as 60 seconds and a Customize Recording Mode lets you choose how long clips last.\nAlina Bradford / Digital Trends\nTo save even more battery life (and lessen how many notifications you get), you can choose when your camera records by putting it on a schedule or by choosing a particular mode. You can also control how many alerts you get by turning off the motion detection feature, adjusting the motion sensitivity, choosing detection areas, or choosing to record only when the camera detects a human.\nLike any good smart security camera, this one can connect to your home assistant. The EufyCam 2 Pro connects with the big three: Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa.\nThe EufyCam 2 Pro also has a siren that sounds at 100dB, which is loud enough to scare someone. If you really want to make a statement, you may want to go with the Ring Floodlight Cam, which has a siren that blasts at 110dB. Those extra 10dB makes a big difference.\nOur take\n\nThe EufyCam 2 Pro at $350 is more affordable than the Arlo Pro 3 ($400), which also comes with two cameras and a base hub, but it\u2019s still more expensive than other comparable wireless security video cameras and doesn\u2019t really have any features that make it stand out from the pack. It\u2019s also missing a big opportunity by not going 4K.\nOverall, I just wasn\u2019t wowed by this smart security camera. It\u2019s a fine choice, but if you take out the claim that the battery lasts a year, there are better cameras on the market. Take a look at our roundup of the best outdoor home security cameras for 2020\u00a0for some alternate choices.\n\nIs there a better alternative?\nYes. If you\u2019re looking for great video quality, the Arlo Ultra Smart Cam is hard to beat. It has 4K resolution and a whopping 180-degree field of view. My personal favorite, though, is the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight. It not only has great resolution, but it also has a 160-degree field of view and a floodlight that will light up most of your yard. You can see how outdoor security cameras match up, head to head, in this scorecard.\nWill it last?\nThe cameras are made of thick, hard plastic and have an IP67 weatherproof rating, so they are made to last. It also has a one-year limited warranty. You would think that sticking the cameras to things would be iffy to their longevity, but the magnets are super strong and once the cameras are stuck, you have to use some heft to remove them.\nShould you buy it?\nNo. There are just too many other cameras on the market that have better features.\n\n\tEditors' Recommendations\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBlink Mini 2 vs. Blink Mini: Is Amazon\u2019s new security camera a worthy upgrade?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRing Stick Up Cam Pro vs. Canary Pro: Which is the better security camera?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWyze Cam Floodlight vs. Wyze Cam Floodlight v2: What\u2019s new about this updated security camera?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best outdoor security cameras of 2024\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo smart home security cameras record all the time?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTopics\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHome Security\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHome Security Reviews\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tProduct Reviews\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSmart Home Reviews\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAlina Bradford\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tFormer Digital Trends Contributor\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfacebook\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tinstagram\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tlinkedin\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\ttwitter\t\t\t\t\nEmail \n\n\n\t\t\tAlina Bradford has been a tech, lifestyle and science writer for more than 20 years.

This refreshed camera supports up to 2K footage capture, offers a similar design to that of the Arlo Pro 4, and clocks in at a much lower price.\nBut should you rush out to replace your Arlo Pro 4 with the new Arlo Essential 2nd Gen?
