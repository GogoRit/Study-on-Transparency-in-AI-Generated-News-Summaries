Poland already has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe, and most of the small number of legal abortions that take place in the country are cases of foetal defects.Once the ruling goes into effect, abortion will only be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is in danger.More than 400,000 people protested in hundreds of towns and cities across the country as part of a \u201cwomen\u2019s strike\u201d after the ruling. Theoretically, the rulings of the court should come into effect immediately, but there have been a number of cases where there have been long delays for apparently political reasons, and there was a sense that the government had been alarmed by the size of the protests and wanted to back away from the ruling.\u201cIt would be good to take some time for dialogue and for finding a new position in this situation, which is difficult and stirs high emotions,\u201d Micha\u0142 Dworczyk, the head of the prime minister\u2019s office, told Polish media in early November.'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rightsRead moreHowever, on Wednesday, the court\u2019s justification for the ruling was published, and the government said it expected to publish the ruling itself on Wednesday too, which would officially make it law.Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has been accused of politicising the constitutional tribunal and using it to push through its ultra-conservative agenda on abortion.The delay in publishing the ruling led to an uneasy situation over the past three months where doctors performing abortions were unsure from one day to the next whether the procedures would remain legal. Many Polish women take pills for medical abortions at home, while thousands of others are forced to travel abroad to seek abortion.Five of the court\u2019s 15 judges dissented from the majority opinion, although some of them only took issue with the justification, not with the substance of the ruling. The court\u2019s ruling framed the issue as being about defending the life of an unborn child, and told Polish legislators they should use the words \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d when talking about abortions rather than \u201cfoetus\u201d and \u201cpregnant woman\u201d.\u201cNo law-abiding government should respect this ruling,\u201d said Borys Budka, the leader of Poland\u2019s largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, Reuters reported. This article was amended on 28 January 2021. An earlier version, describing the effect of the ruling, said that \u201cabortion will only be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger\u201d. This has been changed to refer to \u201cwhen the woman\u2019s life is in danger\u201d.Explore more on these topicsPolandAbortionnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Third night of protests in Poland after abortion ban takes effect29 Jan 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Poland delays abortion ban as nationwide protests continue3 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
