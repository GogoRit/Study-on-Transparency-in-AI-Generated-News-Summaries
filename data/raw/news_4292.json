    "text": "Life in lockdown: when abortion is illegal, where do you go? | HuckHuckToggle openHow lockdown is affecting women\u2019s reproductive rightsThursday 21 May, 2020Text by Rabiya JafferyIllustrations by Simon HayesShareNo fly zones \u2014 In countries where reproductive healthcare is neither safe nor legal, many women rely on travel to access the help they need. But in the age of coronavirus, this is no longer possible.Anna* and her fiance have been living and working in Dubai for the past four years. They had planned to get married back home, in Seychelles, in the summer.The plan for a wedding is now tentative, given the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic. But Anna and her fianc\u00e9 are busy making all the calls they can to secure a marriage certificate from the Seychelles embassy, which has been shut down for all non-emergency situations.\u201cI found out I was pregnant in early April,\u201d says Anna. \u201cI don\u2019t know when the flights will resume. If I would even be able to fly by then, I can\u2019t take the risk by waiting. I just need to get a marriage certificate urgently \u2013 I wish my embassy understood that this is a serious thing.\u201dAnna is worried because article 356 of the UAE Penal Code states that anyone convicted of engaging in consensual sex outside of marriage, if caught, is likely to be punished with a jail sentence, followed by deportation. Although Dubai turns a blind eye to unmarried couples who cohabit \u2013 usually wealthy expatriates \u2013 pregnant women have, over the years, been arrested and then jailed if they fail to provide evidence of being married.To access maternity services \u2013 in both public and private hospitals \u2013 expectant mothers have to open a file and this requires a marriage certificate. While the current circumstances might be rare, Anna\u2019s situation is anything but. Unmarried pregnant expatriates in the UAE frequently carry out most of their pregnancy back home and then return to UAE, if they choose to, after giving birth.\u201cIdeally, I am flying back to Seychelles as soon as flights return to normal, but I will need antenatal care sooner or later and I need to be prepared for the worst,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is legally okay to be an unmarried mother in the UAE so long as you didn\u2019t carry out your pregnancy here. Socially it is just like anywhere else \u2013 depends on your crowd.\u201d\u00a0Anna is currently dividing her time in lockdown between trying to reach out to her embassy and seeking advice from online forums. There are a number of resources dedicated to women currently in the UAE who are seeking advice about the reproductive healthcare services that they would be traveling to access in regular circumstances.\u201cThere [are] a lot of grey areas in the law so I am just turning to corners of the internet for help with information,\u201d she says. \u201cFor instance, I found out that hospitals may compare the date of marriage against the estimated date of conception, but there is usually no issue if you got married at least six months before giving birth.\u201dAnna says she has connected with seven women online, all of whom are all in the UAE and awaiting flights to start operating again in order to access reproductive healthcare in a safe and legal way. Three of them were visiting Dubai when the travel restrictions were implemented and are now reaching out to their embassies for emergency repatriation flights, whereas the other four are seeking out ways to access abortion.Abortions in the UAE are considered illegal in all circumstances but two \u2013 if the mother\u2019s life is at risk because of the pregnancy, or if the fetus has a disorder that makes it \u201cincompatible with life\u201d and below 120 days.\u00a0Some doctors may offer manual abortion services privately but will typically charge extremely high fees and only consult patients who comes with a reliable reference \u2013 because assisting in aborting a pregnancy is also a criminal offence in the country that can lead to imprisonment to up to seven years.It is also possible to purchase \u2018abortion pills\u2019 from the black market \u2013 but prices can go as high as AED 5000 (over \u00a31,100). In comparison, the market price for a set of mifepristone and misoprostol tablets is around AED160 (around \u00a335) in most European countries, and lower still in other Asian countries.The pills sold on the black market can often be fake or expired. Even in the cases when they are not, mifepristone and misoprostol tablets can cause excessive bleeding, infections, and abdominal pain if not administered properly. World Health Organisation guidelines state that the use of mifepristone and misoprostol for termination at more than 63 days \u201crequires an inpatient setting, and raises separate medical, legal, and service issues\u201d.A few years ago, a woman in Sharjah, UAE, went on trial for undergoing abortion after she developed complications from the use of these pills and had to be rushed to the hospital which found traces of misoprostol in her blood.This is why most women who can afford to have been turning to nearby countries where abortion is legal \u2013 such as Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Turkey, or India \u2013 as their safest option to access reproductive healthcare. In fact, a few private clinics in India now offer packages including airport pick-up and drop-off services, as well as assistance with finding a nearby hotel, for women who want to take a single-day trip to India for getting a safe and legal abortion.It is not just women in the UAE, however, that have to travel abroad to access reproductive healthcare services that are restricted at home: abortion is illegal in most circumstances in the entire Gulf region. Given the travel restrictions, they are all turning online to find information on alternatives.Sarah*, a 23-year-old Saudi woman in an arranged marriage, is one of them. \u201cI found out I was pregnant only 6 months after being married to someone I never knew so I did not feel comfortable completing the pregnancy,\u201d she says.Because travel wasn\u2019t an option, Sarah decided to take the risk and get in touch with a local doctor (recommended by a friend\u2019s mother) and ask for help. \u201cIt was risky and scary and she was crying and told me I am a monster for doing it,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cBut I guess she liked the money, so she gave me some pills on the down-low.\u201dThe pills, that Sarah now believes were probably the expired or duplicates that are widely available in the black market across the region, didn\u2019t work. \u201cI told the doctor who then offered, in her words, to \u2018pull the baby out of me\u2019. But at this point, everything seemed too risky and I was in a very bad place emotionally, so I thought about looking for other options,\u201d she continues. \u201cI am sure there are doctors here who are willing to help women without judging them so vocally \u2013 but I didn\u2019t have that luck.\u201dSarah reached out to a black-market dealer, whose number she found online. But the prices they were asking for to deliver the pills amidst the lockdowns were out of her budget.\u201cThey were asking me for money I didn\u2019t have \u2013 I could have gone to another country and back twice for that amount \u2013 and I didn\u2019t want to take the risk in case the pills wouldn\u2019t work again.\u201dThat is how she came across a website that stated it provides abortion rights services, worldwide, to people who don\u2019t have access to it. Women on Web is a Netherlands-based online abortion service that delivers mifepristone and misoprostol pills by mail to women in countries where abortion is illegal.Those seeking an abortion must first have an online consultation with a licensed doctor. If they are less than 10-weeks pregnant and do not have any severe illnesses, pills are delivered, within a week, by mail to their home addresses. They are asked to make a donation of \u20ac70-90 euros \u2013 if their economic circumstances allow \u2013 to ensure that the service continues to be available to everyone who needs one. Sarah had her online consultation and received the misoprostol and mifepristone three days later.In January 2020, Women on Web received 69 help requests from the UAE\u00a0 and 43 from Saudi Arabia that went up to 185 and 94 respectively in April. \u201cThe inquiries we have been receiving from the Gulf region have doubled since lockdowns began to be implemented,\u201d says Hazal Atay of Women on Web. \u201cWe were initially not certain if we\u2019d be able to continue our services seamlessly given the uncertainties of everything but luckily our suppliers, that are based in China and India, have not been affected and postal services have not been disrupted.\u201dSarah had believed she was 9 weeks pregnant but later recognised that she had miscalculated and was 13+ weeks in. \u201cI actually went through labor and gave birth while my husband was asleep next to me. I kept quietly pulling my hair from the pain during the whole process because I couldn\u2019t wake him up.\u201dSarah had to take the pills every three hours and, in the morning, she woke her husband up and informed him she had to go to the hospital as she was bleeding. The doctor confirmed the miscarriage and has asked her to come back in 14 days for a cervix cleaning surgery.\u00a0\u201cIt was an extremely painful experience, physically and emotionally, but at least, I was able to find my way around it given how different everything is right now\u201d she says. \u201cI am lucky that I am married because if I wasn\u2019t, the risk would be so much higher because if something went wrong and I would have gotten caught being pregnant and attempting abortion, I don\u2019t even want to imagine the consequences.\u201d* Different names have been used to protect anonymity.\u00a0Follow Rabiya Jaffery on Twitter.Enjoyed this article?\u00a0Like\u00a0Huck\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0follow us on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0This article has been taggedReportageAbortion RightsFeatureHealthcareNext up: Inside the world\u2019s longest-run...PhotographyWednesday 20 May, 2020Inside the world\u2019s longest-running photo non-profitThis is Kamoinge \u2014 Founded in the \u201960s, when black art was ignored by the establishment, Kamoinge\u2019s influence has remained largely unrecognised \u2013 until now.Written by: Miss RosenScroll to read\u00a9 2024 TCOLondon PublishingPrivacy settingsPrivacy policy"
