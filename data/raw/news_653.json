Such terminations previously made up almost all legal abortions. We spoke to women affected by this change.\nOn 22 October 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal issued a ruling stating that the abortion law of 1993, permitting terminations when tests showed the likelihood of a severe and irreversible impairment of the foetus or an incurable illness threatening its life, was unconstitutional.\nThe judges who made this decision were not unanimous, and some argued that women cannot be forced into heroism. However, the decision was made by the majority, including two judges who before being appointed to the tribunal were MPs for the ruling conservative party.\nAt present, abortion in Poland is permissible only for two reasons: when it constitutes a threat to the woman\u2019s life or health, or when the pregnancy results from a crime such as rape. Women who learn that they are carrying a seriously damaged foetus have no chance of legal termination.\nThe tribunal\u2019s ruling led to a wave of protests in Poland. Thousands of Poles, mostly women, took to the streets despite the pandemic and restrictions for many days to air their opposition to the government\u2019s actions. Banners that could be seen at the protests included the slogans \u201cWomen\u2019s hell\u201d and \u201cThis is war\u201d.\n\nPolice deploy force against Polish abortion protests as hospitals cancel terminations following ruling\n\n***\nKasia (the names of interviewees have been changed) learned that she was pregnant after the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s decision. Her pregnancy was planned and long-awaited.\n\u201cKasia had two miscarriages. When we found out she was pregnant, we jumped for joy,\u201d says Wojciech, her partner. Kasia is 39. The gynaecologist recommended prenatal tests, \u201cjust in case\u201d.\n\u201cOf course, we didn\u2019t allow ourselves to imagine that something might be wrong. We didn\u2019t even talk about that. Unfortunately, there was,\u201d Wojciech tells us.\nThe diagnosis was unequivocal \u2013 a lethal abnormality. \u201cIt was like being given a sentence,\u201d Wojciech says. \u201cThe doctor told us that the baby would probably be born dead or would die just after birth. That it wouldn\u2019t be able to see or hear and would probably have a terribly deformed head. A nightmare.\u201d\n\nPolish ministry proposes \u201croom to cry in\u201d for women forced to give birth by abortion ban\n\nBoth decided to terminate the pregnancy. \u201cWe talked about it for a long time. We decided that we didn\u2019t want Kasia to go through this emotional pain for nine months. To live in the knowledge that our child was suffering. And also she\u2019d started to say several times a day that she wouldn\u2019t survive it. I feared for her.\u201d\nThe gynaecologist told them that there was no chance of an abortion. They went to a psychiatrist because they had read online that some such doctors were able to help. But this one did not. He confirmed the anxiety and suicidal thoughts, but refused to provide a certificate that there were grounds for an abortion on the basis of a threat to the mother\u2019s health.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give details, but our only option was to go abroad,\u201d says Wojciech.\n***\nAmong those protesting against the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling prohibiting abortion in the case of lethal defects to the foetus were mothers raising disabled children. A common complaint was that the state wants to protect life from conception, yet does not give adequate support after birth.\n\u201cWhen the Constitutional Tribunal issued its ruling on abortion, disabled people were in the spotlight,\u201d wrote one such mother in a Facebook post. \u201cThe media were going crazy, politicians were shouting over each other promising help and support. And now? Now reality has set in again.\u201d\n\nLiving off \u201cscraps\u201d: the challenges for parents of disabled children in Poland\n\nPoland\u2019s human rights commissioner Adam Bodnar, meanwhile, noted that the Constitutional Tribunal ruling meant that the state had decided to \u201cstrip women of the right to decide for themselves and often condemned them to torture.\u201d According to Bodnar, the tribunal\u2019s decision almost entirely ignored the rights of women and their families.\n\u201cThey were denied the right to decide, for example, whether to give birth to a baby that would die in suffering after a few days. The main burden of choice and responsibility is shifted to medical personnel \u2013 doctors, but also the hospital and nurses, without assuring them appropriate legal protection,\u201d Bodnar wrote.\n***\nThe Federation for Women and Family Planning currently gets up to several dozen telephone calls and emails a day asking about abortion. Some women who call are pregnant and have received an unwanted diagnosis, but others call the federation to seek help as they are planning to have a baby and want to know what will happen if it turns out that the foetus has a lethal defect.\n\n\u201cAbortion Without Borders\u201d initiative to help Polish women obtain terminations abroad\n\nKrystyna Kacpura, the federation\u2019s director, tells Notes from Poland that the situation is alarming. \u201cThe women who call us are unable to talk, they don\u2019t know how to cope. They sob, weep, and often beg, \u2018Please help me\u2019.\u201d Sometimes, she says, the women tell her that they won\u2019t survive the pregnancy.\nThe federation is also inundated with emails from representatives of \u201cpro-life\u201d organisations. It receives threats, invective and hate.\n\u201cThey threaten us with death,\u201d say representatives of the organisation, which has been helping women for years. \u201cThey sent us our photographs placed on a target saying \u2018die\u2019. Opponents of choice turn out to be terrorists using criminal threats with no regard to human life and dignity.\u201d\nAccording to Kamila Ferenc, a lawyer from the federation, the results of the chilling effect are already visible \u2013 doctors are afraid to make decisions as they are worried about getting a visit from the police or prosecutor:\nThis chilling effect concerns a reason for abortion that is still in place, danger to the pregnant woman\u2019s life and health. I know several cases of women in danger of a uterine rupture, for example, or at risk of infection to the organism, and nothing happens. Because in Poland today, unless a patient is dying on the table, bleeding out here and now, doctors won\u2019t do anything to minimise the risk of endangering her life or health.\n\nPolish government honours pro-life activist who stopped teen having abortion by informing her family\n\nSerious as the situation in Poland is, Ferenc says that it has not yet reached an impasse. There are still some physicians in Poland who understand the women\u2019s situation and try to help them. The hospitals where they work are in large cities, although for safety reasons, their identity is kept secret.\n\u201cThese hospitals are in the minority,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe doctors simply take pity on the patient when their colleagues don\u2019t want to. Some women go to clinics abroad, where they feel safe. That\u2019s how things look at present.\u201d\nGynaecologists have their hands tied. Even when they see the despair of women hearing that they are carrying a foetus with a lethal defect, they cannot refer them for a legal abortion.\n\u201cSo what if I\u2019d like to help that woman?\u201d says one doctor, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cWhat if some of my colleagues agree that the law in Poland today is inhuman and inhumane? We have no influence on that \u2013 we know that for carrying out such an abortion we could go to prison. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nPolish city to support women required to give birth by near-total abortion ban\n\nPsychiatrists are also beginning to get involved with helping women, some of whom experience suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety upon receiving the diagnosis of anencephaly or another lethal defect. In such cases, a psychiatrist may issue a certificate stating that the pregnancy threatens the woman\u2019s life or health \u2013 the premise on which termination is still permissible.\nDr Aleksandra Krasowska has had several such patients. But she says that the problem is that most hospitals do not want to honour such certificates.\n\u201cIt might turn out that we soon have women appearing in psychiatric offices with post-traumatic stress and other serious symptoms,\u201d she warns. \u201cFurthermore, it seems to be a realistic scenario that sooner or later one of these women will die as the result of suicide. We can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\nAccording to Kamila Ferenc, the help of psychiatrists could be a solution, but not on a large scale.\n\u201cI think that if it were to be a systemic rule and all patients who previously qualified for an abortion for embryopathological reasons were supposed to have a certificate from a psychiatrist, that would be stopped in the end,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves \u2013 in Poland everything is done to make sure there is officially no abortion.\u201d\n\nOver 80% of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll\n\nFor now, law enforcement authorities have a weapon in the battle with doctors and have already taken up the fight. The district prosecutor in Bia\u0142ystok asked the local hospital for medical documentation of all patients who had their pregnancies terminated after the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was issued but before its publication on 27 January 2021, which brought it into force.\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office demanded the documents without indicating that there was any probability of a prohibited act being committed,\u201d says Ferenc. \u201cThey wanted to examine the case in general, but also find out patients\u2019 names. It seemed like doing everything possible to dig up some dirt.\u201d\nIn the end, after the affair came out in the media, the national prosecutor\u2019s office found the Bia\u0142ystok authorities\u2019 actions to be incorrect and unjustified. Since the tribunal\u2019s adjudication applies from the day of its publication, not its issue, data on procedures carried out in the meantime may not be collected.\n\nLeader of Poland\u2019s abortion protests charged with \u201cinsulting police\u201d and \u201ccausing epidemic threat\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, these proceedings were discontinued,\u201d says Ferenc. \u201cBut we must note the officiousness of the prosecutor\u2019s office, which showed unequivocally which side it is on and what is really happening.\u201d\n***\nIn the months since the Constitutional Tribunal ruling, Poland has been flooded with billboards from pro-life organisations, with images including a foetus in its mother\u2019s womb and the word \u201clife\u201d written in various languages, or a foetus\u2019s foot with the legend \u201cI am 11 weeks old\u201d. The organiser of the campaign is the foundation \u201cOur Children \u2013 Education, Health, Faith\u201d.\nAccording to estimates by Media People based on data from Kantar Media, the cost of the campaign could be as much as 5.5 million zloty. The media house calculated that the cost of the billboards up to 1 February could have paid for 40,000 hours of psychological help or 1,620 weeks of rehabilitation stays.\n\n\nMiliony na billboardy pro-life. \"Za te pieni\u0105dze m\u00f3j Alex mia\u0142by zapewnion\u0105 opiek\u0119 na ponad 70 lat\" #wyborcza https://t.co/y7h9Z5VIrd\n\u2014 Gazeta Wyborcza.pl (@gazeta_wyborcza) March 15, 2021\n\nAnd it is not just billboards. The public media presenting the ruling party line are also dominated by the narrative that life should be protected from conception and abortion means killing babies.\nIn addition, a civic bill entitled \u201cYes to family \u2013 no to gender\u201d has been submitted to parliament by Ordo Iuris, a legal organisation with radical right-wing views campaigning for protection of life from conception. According to many experts, the bill could lead to a complete ban on abortion.\n***\nAlicja had an abortion \u2013 fully legally \u2013 before the Constitutional Tribunal ruling. She opted to terminate her pregnancy when she learned that the foetus did not have a skull. She remembers this as an extremely traumatic and difficult experience. After the procedure, she was put in a hospital room on her own, but behind the wall she could hear the voices of whimpering new-borns.\n\n\u201cWe are at war\u201d: an interview with the leader of Poland\u2019s abortion protests\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret my decision,\u201d she tells us. \u201cI made it together with my husband. It took me a long time to get over it afterwards. My mourning lasted many months.\u201d Today, Alicja understands very well the pain and fear of women who would like to do as she did but cannot.\n\u201cAbortion for a woman is usually a harrowing experience. It\u2019s not a procedure where you just leave hospital afterwards as if nothing happened. You think about it non-stop. That\u2019s why I think \u2013 I\u2019m certain \u2013 that a woman should have the choice whether she wants to do it or not. And politicians should respect that.\u201d\nWomen in Poland are helped by the Federation for Women and Family Planning, but also other organisations such as Abortion Dream Team and Abortion without Borders. In some cities, billboards have appeared with a telephone number that every woman can call for advice on what to do in a specific situation.\n\n\nThe European Parliament has passed a resolution condemning the constitutional court ruling in Poland that introduces a near-total ban on abortion.\nThey say it violates international agreements, ECJ case law, and the \"dignity, health and lives of women\" https://t.co/ClmrxWn3S8\n\u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) November 26, 2020\n\nInformation published by Abortion Dream Team shows that one in every four pregnancies worldwide \u2013 and one in three in Poland \u2013 ends in abortion. Most of the women affected are aged between 21 and 34.\nThe vast majority of procedures carried out before the Constitutional Tribunal ruling were because of foetal defects. In 2019 in Poland, 1,110 legal abortions took place, of which 1,074 were conducted after prenatal tests confirmed a high probability of severe and irreversible impairment to the foetus. (It is estimated that tens of thousands more illegal abortions take place each year.)\nAccording to article 152 of Poland\u2019s penal code, anyone who terminates a pregnancy with the woman\u2019s consent in violation of the law can be imprisoned for up to three years. If the foetus is capable of independent life outside of the pregnant woman\u2019s body, the penalty may be greater, at up to eight years\u2019 imprisonment.\nTranslated by Ben Koschalka.\u00a0Main image credit: Martyna Niecko / Agencja Gazeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna Gmiterek-Zab\u0142ocka is a journalist at Radio TOK FM, specialising in social issues including migration, domestic violence, and challenges faced by people with disabilities.
