(AP) \u2014 A week after Kentucky voters rejected an anti-abortion ballot measure, the state\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday weighed the constitutionality of a statewide ban approved by lawmakers in a case that seems destined to become a defining moment for abortion rights in the state.An attorney defending the abortion ban urged the court \u201cnot to create the Kentucky version of Roe v. Wade.\u201d A lawyer for two abortion clinics challenging the ban countered that the state\u2019s voters \u201cdeclined to remove protections for abortion from our constitution.\u201dThe case is the first legal test since voters in Kentucky and three other states signaled their support for abortion rights in last week\u2019s midterm elections. Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution.The court hearing at the Kentucky Capitol was closed to the public amid heightened security. Mindful of the ballot\u2019s rejection, abortion rights supporters gathered near the courtroom and chanted: \u201cNo means no.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights supporters are asking the state\u2019s highest court to temporarily block the abortion ban while the case is litigated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defeat of the anti-abortion amendment was raised within minutes of the hearing. Deputy Chief Justice Lisabeth T. Hughes called such ballot measures \u201cthe purest form of democracy\u201d and pressed the attorney defending the abortion ban on why the vote shouldn\u2019t have an impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolicitor General Matthew Kuhn, representing the state attorney general\u2019s office, said the measure\u2019s defeat did not change existing constitutional language, or the absence of any \u201chistorical evidence\u201d to suggest that the state constitution protects abortion.\u201cWhen it comes to abortion, our constitution here in Kentucky is simply silent,\u201d Kuhn told the justices during the more than hourlong hearing.That means the issue of abortion access is left to the state legislature to decide, he said.\n\nHeather Gatnarek, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, said the ban has forced women \u201cto remain pregnant against their will.\u201d She said the right to privacy has consistently been recognized as a key part of the guarantees of liberty under the state constitution.\u201cOur constitutional protections can be interpreted more broadly than those allowed for by the federal constitution, and that is specifically so with the right to privacy,\u201d she said.The Kentucky justices reviewed a challenge to the state\u2019s trigger law that banned nearly all abortions, taking effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June by the U.S. Supreme Court. Approved in 2019, the law carved out narrow exceptions to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life or to prevent disabling injury.Justice Hughes said the the high court has never determined whether Kentucky\u2019s Constitution allows for a complete ban on abortion.\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we have right now, virtually a complete ban on abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t recognize an exception for rape and incest. It doesn\u2019t recognize an exception for women who are under the care of a physician who tells them that the standard of care would be to terminate the pregnancy.\u201d\n\nWhat impact, if any, the anti-abortion measure\u2019s defeat will have on the Kentucky law was a matter for intense debate in the days leading up to the hearing.Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, expressed hope that the state\u2019s highest court \u201cwill listen to the will of the people and know that the people have rejected extremism and rule accordingly.\u201dRepublican Attorney General Daniel Cameron, whose office is defending the statewide ban in court, continued to claim there\u2019s \u201cno right to abortion hidden in Kentucky\u2019s Constitution.\u201d He said abortion policy should be left up to the state\u2019s Legislature, where GOP majorities have passed a series of anti-abortion measures in recent years. Cameron is among several Republicans vying to challenge Beshear\u2019s reelection bid in 2023.The hearing comes a week after abortion rights supporters won every state ballot question put before voters in the midterm elections. Michigan, California and Vermont voted to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions. Voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have forced medical workers to attempt lifesaving measures in the rare event of a baby born after an attempted abortion.\n\nIn Kentucky, the abortion case wound its way through lower courts before reaching the Supreme Court as the referendum battle played out. In July, a Louisville judge said the new, post-Roe abortion bans likely violate \u201cthe rights to privacy and self-determination\u201d protected by the Kentucky Constitution. Judge Mitch Perry said it was not the court\u2019s role to determine whether the state constitution contains the right to abortion, but whether the state\u2019s restrictive laws violate constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.\n\nThe near-total abortion ban was reinstated on an appeal to the intermediate state Court of Appeals. The state Supreme Court later opted to keep the abortion ban in place while it reviews the case, leaving abortions on hold in Kentucky and forcing women who can afford the procedure to look elsewhere. A separate six-week ban that Kentucky lawmakers approved also is being challenged by the two remaining abortion clinics in the Bluegrass State \u2014 both in Louisville, the state\u2019s largest city.A year ago, Kentucky lawmakers added the anti-abortion amendment to the 2022 general election slate as abortion foes hoped to cut off a legal path to restoring abortion rights. The measure would have declared the state constitution didn\u2019t protect the right to an abortion.Now that the amendment has been defeated, the stakes are enormous.\u201cThis case is almost certainly the only realistic path to protecting abortion rights in Kentucky for the foreseeable future,\u201d University of Louisville law professor Samuel Marcosson said ahead of the hearing.___Find AP\u2019s full coverage of the overturning of Roe v.
