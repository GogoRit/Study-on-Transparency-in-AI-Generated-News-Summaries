The so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bill passed Tuesday 28-7 on a party-line vote. Bill sponsor Sen. Patti Anne Lodge, a Republican from Huston, said a fetal heartbeat is a sign that life exists and that she believes the state has a compelling interest in protecting that life. She also said the bill could help families who are hoping to adopt children \u2014 presumably because some women, unable to obtain abortions, might choose to carry to term and then give the infants to adoptive families. \u201cA woman can give birth and continue her life goals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a humane act to protect those who are unable to speak for themselves.\u201d The legislation makes providing an abortion to a woman whose embryo has detectible cardiac activity punishable by up to five years in prison, and it would allow the woman who receives the abortion to sue the abortion provider. Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks using an invasive vaginal ultrasound \u2014 before many women discover they are pregnant. The bill contains exceptions for women whose lives are at risk because of a medical emergency, or women who have become pregnant by rape or incest, but only if they report the crime to law enforcement and give a copy of the report to the health care provider performing the abortion. The bill also contains a \u201ctrigger provision\u201d that means it wouldn\u2019t go into effect unless a federal appellate court somewhere in the country upholds similar legislation from another state. Similar bills have been passed in several other states, and some are already being litigated. Last month, a federal court temporarily blocked a fetal heartbeat bill in South Carolina. Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat from Boise, said the exception for rape and incest would likely be impossible for many women to meet, because Idaho law protects law enforcement reports from active investigations from being released. Many rape victims don\u2019t want to report the crimes to law enforcement right away, and even if they do, the reports are often sealed for three months or more. Forcing women to immediately report their rape and then fight to get a copy of the report quickly enough for any abortion would deeply compound the trauma they have already experienced, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite difficult to get a police report during an active investigation, and police records are exempt from disclosure,\u201d Wintrow said. \u201cI implore you, regardless of all the other things, that this bill cannot go forward for that reason \u2026 support a human life that is as valuable as any other.\u201d Research from the U.S. Department of Justice has found that as many as 80 percent of rapes go unreported for various reasons. The legislation now goes to the House. SUBMIT A CORRECTION       Support local journalism We hope you appreciated this story.
