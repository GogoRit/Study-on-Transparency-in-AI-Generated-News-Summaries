Willingham/Associated PressPull up a crisis pregnancy center\u2019s website and you might find an offer for a \u201cfree abortion consultation\u201d or a rundown of the \u201cfacts\u201d about the \u201cabortion pill.\u201dBut these centers are not what they appear.They aren\u2019t abortion clinics or medical centers. They are an arm of the anti-abortion movement, designed to dissuade women from ending their pregnancies. And they use ultrasound images, free baby clothes \u2014 and in some cases, deceptive messaging \u2014 to achieve their ends. More than 30 such centers operate in Massachusetts, according to one advocacy group.The misleading advertisements have been a source of concern for decades. But the worry has intensified since June, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and returned the question of abortion rights to the states.AdvertisementWith women in conservative parts of the country scrambling across state lines and into unfamiliar territory in search of care, the opportunity for manipulation has grown.Massachusetts legislators can do their part to curb the manipulation by passing a state law barring deceptive advertising by crisis pregnancy centers.The City of Somerville already has a local ordinance in place. And several other left-leaning municipalities are considering similar measures. But a patchwork approach won\u2019t provide the protection that Massachusetts women \u2014 and patients visiting from other states \u2014 require.A statewide law would not be the first of its kind. Last year, Connecticut lawmakers passed their own ban on deceptive advertising.\u201cPut simply, if you sell Subarus, don\u2019t claim it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz,\u201d Representative Christine Palm, a Chester Democrat, said at the time. \u201cIf you\u2019re a bakery, don\u2019t pretend that you sell fruit just because it\u2019s another food item. If you\u2019re a dentist, you\u2019re not an epidemiologist, even though you\u2019re in the medical field. And if you provide adoption counseling and you discourage people from getting abortions, don\u2019t imply, suggest, or insinuate that you do otherwise.\u201dAdvertisementA conservative advocacy group has sued to block the law on behalf of a New London crisis pregnancy center, arguing that it violates the center\u2019s First Amendment right \u201cto operate, publish, speak, and not speak, in accordance with its religious beliefs.\u201dBut Connecticut lawmakers say the measure is based on a San Francisco ordinance that has already passed constitutional muster. In 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the ordinance \u201cmerely seeks to prevent [crisis pregnancy centers] from harming women through false or misleading speech about their services and in no way restricts those entities from expressing their views about abortion to the public or their clients.\u201dThe centers, as the court suggests, have every right to proselytize against abortion. They just don\u2019t have a right to deceive women.To be fair, there are plenty of crisis pregnancy centers that are quite open about their views on abortion. These centers should not \u2014 and would not \u2014 be affected by a statewide ban on deceptive advertising.And even those that do engage in misleading messaging should have a few days to take it down before facing a fine or other enforcement. The Connecticut law allows for just that.The aim is not to infringe on the constitutional liberties of abortion opponents but to guard against manipulation.There is a long legal tradition in this country, on the state and federal levels, of protecting consumers against deceptive advertising.AdvertisementAnd in a moment of deep uncertainty for so many American women, they deserve the same protection.Editorials represent the views of the Boston Globe Editorial Board.
