    "text": "HHS secretary, on Wisconsin visit, hears complaints about abortion banNews Sports Packers Business Suburbs Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals  NEWSOn visit to Milwaukee area, HHS secretary finds Wisconsin abortion ban 'jarring'Caitlin Looby Jessica Van EgerenMilwaukee Journal SentinelThe Biden Administration's top health care official said Friday that he found it a \"jarring experience\" to be in Wisconsin to mark the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision after spending Thursday in Minnesota.\"It's a tale of two cities, and in the worst way,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said during a discussion with health care providers at the Cudahy Health Department.While in Minnesota, where abortion is legal, Becerra visited a Planned Parenthood clinic that provides abortion to Minnesotans, as well as patients from western Wisconsin. The same day, the Minnesota Legislature codified abortion access, guaranteeing people the right to an abortion.On Friday, he made two stops in Wisconsin \u2014 the second was at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee \u2014 to draw attention to its lack of access to abortion care, and to the fear that some health care providers feel since the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson decision in June of last year. In Cudahy, he was joined by Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine and Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul.According to the Wisconsin providers who participated in Friday's discussion, fundamental reproductive care is now jeopardized. Providers said they worry about when to intervene in a crisis pregnancy and what risks they face of being charged under the state's 1849 abortion law, which effectively became state law. Providers said patients are fearful they ultimately will lose their access to basic reproductive care, such as birth control and screenings.Dr. Mercedes Williams, an OB-GYN with Aurora Health Care, said there has been an uptick in young women seeking sterilization procedures to prevent becoming pregnant.\"Everything is re-stigmatized again,\" Williams said.Another provider said that they catch themselves whispering to patients.More:Planned Parenthood expanding services, even offering vasectomies, to meet post-Roe demandFour clinics in Wisconsin that had been providing abortions immediately stopped providing the procedure in June following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, which is 50 years old on Sunday. One of those clinics, Affiliated Medical Services in Milwaukee, was put up for sale in October; the others continue to operate, providing different services.A lawsuit filed by Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul challenges the 1849 law banning abortions except if a women's life is in danger. The lawsuit\u00a0argues it was unenforceable since 1973 under Roe v. Wade and is still unenforceable because it conflicts with abortion measures state lawmakers have passed since then.\u00a0Prior to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, abortions were legal in Wisconsin up to 20 weeks.\"I think we are going to win our suit, but if we don't we're going to keep fighting,\" Kaul said.In response to the Wisconsin visit, state Republican Party spokeswoman Rachel Reisner said: \u201cState residents continue to worry about\u00a0\u00a0inflation,\u00a0failing schools,\u00a0and\u00a0rampant crime, but the Biden Administration and Wisconsin Democrats choose to focus on abortion because they have no solutions. \u201dMore:Republicans block Dems' push to put abortion on the ballot and move ahead with bail measure. Here are the politics behind the moves.For the providers, Friday's visit shows that federal officials \"get it,\" said Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an OB-GYN who formerly performed abortions in Wisconsin and moderated the event. \"You could hear in their comments today that they really understand Wisconsin is in crisis,\" she said.To better support Wisconsin, Becerra said the Office of Civil Rights is ready to protect people from being deprived of the services they are entitled to under federal law, including medication abortions.\"We will continue to make sure that privacy rights for the patient (and) provider are protected under federal law,\" Becerra told the Journal Sentinel. \"We will continue to do what we can with the limited (Title X) funds we have to support those centers of health care that are providing ... reproductive health care to a lot of women.\"A second stop was planned for UW-Milwaukee, where Becerra was scheduled to be joined by medical students and residents, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore for a town hall discussion. A result of Wisconsin's pending lawsuit is the inability of OB-GYN residents to receive necessary training in Wisconsin. The state's three impacted programs are finding medical schools and hospitals in Illinois to train residents.More:Fresh off win on same-sex marriage, Sen. Tammy Baldwin proposes federal travel fund for women seeking abortionsThe attention on the lack of abortion access in Wisconsin will continue Sunday, when the national Women's March, which was first held in 1974, will take place at the Capitol in Madison.\"Dobbs won't stand ... because it's an injustice to women who are of reproductive age,\" Becerra said. \"You can't connect the dots between what our Constitution says and what Dobbs says.\"Caitlin Looby is a Report for America corps member who writes about the environment.
