This translates to about 39 abortions per 1,000 women globally, a rate that has stayed roughly the same\u00a0since 1990. Notably, rates have diverged between countries with fewer restrictions and those with more: Between 1990\u201394 and 2015\u201319, the average abortion rate in countries with generally legal abortion (excluding China and India) declined by 43 percent.\nBy contrast, in countries with severe restrictions on abortion, the average abortion rate increased by around 12 percent.\nRates are shown with and without China and India because the countries have a large effect on the average due to the size of their populations. Graph courtesy Council on Foreign Relations\nAs nations around the globe have expanded the grounds on which people can access reproductive health services,\u00a0the quality and safety\u00a0of abortion care have improved, as has maternal survival. However, the safety of abortion procedures diverges widely between countries where abortion is generally legal and countries with high restrictions on abortion.\nWATCH: What to know about tech surveillance and abortion access\nAlmost 90 percent of abortions in countries with liberal abortion laws are considered safe, compared with just\u00a025 percent of abortions in countries where abortion is banned. According to the WHO, approximately 5\u201313 percent of\u00a0maternal deaths worldwide\u00a0are due to complications from unsafe abortions, the vast majority of which occur in developing countries.\nHowever, there remains strong opposition to abortion among some constituencies. And in recent years, a number of countries, particularly autocracies, have\u00a0pushed back against\u00a0the expansion of women\u2019s and reproductive rights. Abortion opponents in the United States won a major victory in June 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1973 decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion.\nWhat does abortion law look like around the world?\nAlthough the legal status of abortion varies considerably by region, a large majority of countries permit abortion under at least some circumstances; globally, two dozen countries ban abortion entirely. Most industrialized countries allow the procedure without restriction.\nAround 100 countries have some restrictions, typically permitting abortion only in limited situations, including for socioeconomic reasons, risks to the physical or mental health of the woman, or the presence of fetal anomalies. However, legal language concerning exemptions for fetal impairment is often vague, resulting in uncertainty\u00a0for medical professionals about whether performing certain abortions is legal.\nAbortion laws vary by state in the United States and Mexico. Some countries that permit abortion to save the person\u2019s life, to preserve health, or on social or economic grounds also permit it in cases of rape, incest, or fetal impairment. Graph courtesy Council on Foreign Relations\nAccess to safe abortion has been established as a human right by\u00a0numerous international frameworks, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, and regional human rights courts, including the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\nAt the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, 179 governments signed\u00a0a program of action that included a commitment to prevent unsafe abortion. The WHO first recognized unsafe abortion as a public health problem in 1967, and in 2003 it developed technical and policy guidelines that include a recommendation that states pass abortion laws to protect women\u2019s health. According to the U.N. Population Fund, addressing the unmet need for family planning\u00a0would both considerably reduce maternal mortality and reduce abortion by up to 70 percent in the developing world.\nHow does the United States compare?\nThe\u00a0Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0on June 24, 2022, to strike down\u00a0Roe v. Wade, overturns almost 50 years of precedent that conferred a constitutional right to receive an abortion. In the 1973 Roe\u00a0decision, the Court held that the Constitution guarantees the right to choose to have an abortion, though it permitted regulations after the first trimester of pregnancy.\nWith Roe, the United States became one of the first countries to liberalize its abortion laws, along with several Western European nations. In 1992,\u00a0Planned Parenthood v. Casey\u00a0reaffirmed the right to an abortion but permitted additional restrictions, such as waiting periods and parental consent requirements.\nREAD MORE: Biden supports filibuster exception to protect abortion access\nFor decades, states have introduced and implemented various laws regulating abortions. Some states passed laws to protect abortion access, while others imposed more onerous regulations on abortion providers and sought to prohibit abortion at earlier points in pregnancy. This led to the closure of more than\u00a0160 clinics\u00a0and left a handful of states with\u00a0only a single abortion provider.\nIn recent years, many states have passed increasingly strict abortion laws, such as in Oklahoma, where the governor signed legislation to ban all abortions after six weeks, except in cases of life-threatening pregnancies. The law resembles one passed in Texas in 2021; both also allow private citizens to sue anyone they suspect of providing or facilitating an abortion.\nRoe\u2019s reversal allows the thirteen states that have so-called\u00a0trigger laws to either ban abortion automatically or within 30 days. While all of these state laws exempt abortions in cases of life-threatening pregnancies, many do not exempt pregnancies caused by rape or incest. Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates have praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, while Democratic lawmakers and abortion advocates have condemned it.\nWhat have been recent trends?\nThe global trend in abortion law has been toward liberalization. Since 2000, 38 countries have changed their abortion laws, and all but one\u2014Nicaragua\u2014expanded the legal grounds on which women can access abortion services. Since 2020, Argentina and Thailand legalized abortions, with certain gestational limits; Mexico decriminalized abortion, as did South Korea; and New Zealand eased its abortion restrictions.\nMost recently, Colombia made abortion legal on demand up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, the latest sign of a growing \u201cgreen wave\u201d in Latin America. Although most countries have taken steps to expand grounds for abortion, some\u2014including Honduras and the United States\u2014are enacting policies to tighten restrictions.\nFollowing a June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, some states started only allowing abortion to save the person\u2019s life. Following a September 2021 Mexican Supreme Court ruling, some states started permitting abortion on request, and all states are required to eventually do so. Graph courtesy Council on Foreign Relations\nHere\u2019s a look at how abortion laws have changed in a handful of countries around the globe:\nChina\nChina liberalized its abortion law in the 1950s and promoted the practice under its one-child policy, which was enacted in 1979 in an effort to curb population growth by restricting families to one child. The policy, under which abortion services were made widely available,\u00a0came with severe coercive measures\u2014including fines, compulsory sterilization, and abortion\u2014to deter unauthorized births. China raised this long-standing limit to a two-child policy in 2016, along with other incentives to\u00a0encourage population growth\u00a0amid a rapidly aging population. In 2021, it increased the limit to three children, and China\u2019s State Council issued guidelines on women\u2019s development that called to reduce \u201cnon\u2013medically necessary abortions.\u201d\nKenya\nPostcolonial Kenya\u2019s abortion law was rooted in the British penal code, which criminalized abortion. When Kenya adopted a new constitution in 2010, it\u00a0expanded the grounds on which women could obtain an abortion to include emergency cases, or those in which the health of the mother is at stake. In June 2019, a court extended the exceptions to include\u00a0cases of rape. As other former European colonies reevaluate their abortion statutes, many are expanding the grounds for abortion. For instance, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, and Niger\u2014nations whose restrictive abortion laws were\u00a0holdovers from the 1810 Napoleonic Code\u00a0imposed by France\u2014have made abortion legal in cases of rape, incest, or fetal impairment.\nIreland\nIn 2018, the Irish parliament legalized the termination of pregnancy before twelve weeks, as well as in cases in which the health of the mother is at stake. Previously, Ireland had one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, codified in a 1983 constitutional amendment that effectively banned the practice. The 2012 death of Savita Halappanavar after she was denied an emergency abortion\u00a0reignited public debate and protest\u00a0and prompted a countrywide referendum to overturn the amendment; the referendum passed with 66 percent of the vote. In 2019, abortion was legalized in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom (UK). The UK\u2019s 1967 Abortion Act, which grants doctors in England, Scotland, and Wales the authority to perform abortions, was\u00a0extended to Northern Ireland\u00a0following a vote by the UK Parliament.\nZambia\nZambia is one of\u00a0the few countries in Africa\u00a0where abortion is permitted for economic and social reasons, but, despite having a liberal law, structural and cultural barriers make it difficult for Zambian women to obtain abortions. As of 2018, Zambia had\u00a0one practicing medical doctor per 12,000 inhabitants; and for the 55 percent of Zambians living in rural areas, health professionals are few and far between. The law stipulates that only a registered medical practitioner, and not a nurse or midwife, can perform an abortion, rendering safe access out of reach for most. Zambia is plagued by a high rate of abortion-related maternal mortality, with about 30 percent of maternal deaths caused by abortion complications.\nHonduras\nThe Central American country has among the world\u2019s strictest laws on abortion, which has been banned since 1985. In 2021, lawmakers enshrined the ban in the country\u2019s constitution; now, any change to abortion law requires at least a three-quarters majority in the National Congress. U.N. experts estimate that between around 50,000 and 80,000 unsafe abortions take place in Honduras each year. Honduras\u2019s neighbors El Salvador and Nicaragua also have prohibitions on abortion, and they are the only two countries to have imposed new restrictions on abortion since the 1994 Cairo Declaration, which recognized reproductive health as critical to development.\nPoland\nIn 2020, Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortions in cases of fetal impairment are unconstitutional, making the country\u2019s abortion law one of the strictest in Europe. Because the vast majority of abortions performed in Poland prior to the ruling were due to fetal abnormalities, the decision initiated a near-total ban. In response, hundreds of thousands of people\u00a0took to the streets\u00a0to protest the decision, though it remains in effect. Polish law still allows abortions in cases of rape, incest, and life-threatening pregnancies, though doctors have reportedly been\u00a0reluctant to perform\u00a0legal abortions since the ruling. Doctors face\u00a0up to three years\u00a0in prison if the government finds they performed an abortion hastily or without sufficient justification.\nREAD MORE: Polish women mark Women\u2019s Day protesting abortion ban\nEditor\u2019s note: This article is based on original reporting by Rachel B.
