Log in.\nThe ruling has been slammed by women's health and human rights organizations for further limiting women's access to contraception during a pandemic.\u00a0Others say the decision undermines women health while policies that value men's sexual pleasure in the form of medications like Viagra remain intact.\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the ruling could have real health, policy, and economic consequences, a pharmacist said it's not quite true that men can more easily access Viagra than women can access birth control.\n\n\n                              Related stories\n                            \n\n\n\"Birth control is often covered [by insurance] way more times than erectile dysfunction is,\" pharmacist Jessica Nouhavandi, co-founder of the online pharmacy Honeybee Health, said.\u00a0The ruling may leave as many as 126,000 women without contraceptionWednesday's ruling could leave up to 126,000 women in the US without the contraception they've relied on, the government has estimated. According to the National Women's Law Center, 61.4 million women currently don't have to pay for birth control because of Obamacare.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          \n                          Image Point Fr/Shutterstock\n                          \n                          \n\nThe ruling is particularly damaging during the coronavirus pandemic, which has already limited access to birth control while also leading many women to need it more to accommodate new family planning goals, like getting pregnant later or wanting fewer children.\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have pointed out that the decision may also negatively affect people who need birth control medications to manage diseases that have nothing to do with sexual activity.\u00a0\u2014\ud835\udd4a\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd53\ud835\udd5a \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08  (@petitchattnoir) July 8, 2020\u00a0In general, though, birth control is still more accessible than Viagra\u00a0The ruling has reignited anger over claims that American healthcare policies, especially under Trump, value men's sexual pleasure over women's ability to access necessary healthcare.\u00a0Many people on social media, including some politicians, are now saying that Viagra and similar drugs are cheaper and more widely available while access to female contraception continues to tighten.\u00a0\u2014Amee Vanderpool  (@girlsreallyrule) July 8, 2020\u00a0\u2014Scott Huffman For Congress  (@HuffmanForNC) July 8, 2020\u00a0But Nouhavandi, the pharmacist, told Insider those claims aren't entirely accurate. In general, she said, employers aren't required to cover men's sexual health drugs like Viagra and in fact, most insurance companies don't.\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Erectile dysfunction is a disease state that often falls into the lifestyle category, meaning [drugs to treat it] aren't necessary, but often a choice,\" Nouhavandi said.\u00a0She said while how the current ruling affects women's access to birth control remains to be seen, by and large insurance companies do cover it.\u00a0Nouhavandi also said out-of-pocket costs for Viagra and drugs like it, including generic versions, tend to be much higher than what women pay out-of-pocket for birth control.\u00a0For example, generic Viagra could cost up to $400 or $500 a month or as much as $60 a pill, while generic oral contraceptives tend to go for about $25 a month, she said.\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nNouhavandi added that, in some ways, access to birth control has gotten more accessible over the years. For instance, in many states, pharmacists are able to prescribe it to walk-ins. The same can't be said for Viagra.\u00a0She and other representatives of online pharmacy organizations like the Pill Club said there are still ways to access medication if your employer or insurance company limits it.\u00a0\"With pharmacies like us and with great other companies like Planned Parenthood, we have more access to birth control than before,\" Nouhavandi said.\u00a0Read more:Many US women say they want fewer children because of the coronavirus pandemicExperts are calling for an 'urgent investigation' into the high rate of pregnant women of color hospitalized with coronavirusWhat pregnant women should know about the coronavirusPregnant women may be more likely to suffer severe coronavirus infections, according to the largest study of its kind\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Read next\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: Male contraception hasn't changed much since the condom was invented over 5,000 years ago.
