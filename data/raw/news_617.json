The ruling, which overturns a 1993 law that allowed abortions in cases of foetal abnormalities, was abruptly implemented late Wednesday \u2014 and critics believe the timing is intentional.\u00a0The decision was originally made by the Constitutional Tribunal back in October. It was delayed after approximately 430,000 Poles protested the decision in what analysts say were the largest protests Poland had seen in over forty years. On Wednesday, the Polish government announced that the rule was published in the government\u2019s journal and had gone into effect.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTEven before the new ruling, Poland had one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws, causing many people \u2014 approximately 200,000 Poles a year, according to the BBC \u2014 to travel outside the country or seek illegal (and unsafe) procedures. Until now, individuals could get abortions under three circumstances: rape or incest, threats to their lives, or foetal abnormalities. But abortions due to foetal defects, now made illegal, make up the majority of legal procedures performed in Poland. According to the Polish Ministry of Health, 98% of abortions carried out in 2019 were due to foetal abnormalities.Poland is currently ruled by the conservative Law and Justice Party, led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. Borys Budka, the leader of the opposing Civic Platform party, criticised the new abortion law as \u201ccynical\u201d and \u201ccowardly.\u201d He accused Kaczy\u0144ski of \u201csetting fire to Poland\u201d to cover up the government\u2019s failure to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.Poland has been hit particularly hard by the crisis. Just this week, the daily newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported that in 2020, the country had seen its highest number of deaths since World War II. \u201cWe have a huge demographic crisis,\u201d said economic Rafal Mundry, according to ABC News. As a result, gatherings of more than five people are prohibited in Poland. Kaczy\u0144ski accused Wednesday\u2019s protestors of disregarding guidelines and endangering lives \u2014 which, ironically, is exactly what he\u2019s doing by corroding reproductive rights during a time of vulnerability and distress.W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, chairman of another opposing party, agreed with Budka. \u201cA record number of deaths\u2026 the chaos with vaccinations, and the government is once again sparking an ideological war,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDestroying the abortion compromise and taking away freedom of choice in a pandemic is despicable.\u201dHow This Poland Abortion Ban Sparked Mass ProtestsNews \u2022 US Newswritten by Lydia WangPhoto: WOJTEK RADWANSKI/AFP/Getty Images.More from WellnessHoroscopesYour Horoscope This Week: 17th To 23rd MarchPisces Season comes to an end on the 20th and gives way to the astrological new year once the sun enters Aries at 3:06 a.m. GMT.
