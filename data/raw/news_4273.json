The agency has been forced to suspend the provision of reproductive healthcare in 140 out of the 180 health facilities, it supports, meaning only 40 now remain.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThere have already been tragic consequences.\n\u00a0Mariam, a war widow with four daughters, had been receiving antenatal care at the UNFPA-supported BaniShamakh health centre \u2013 the only health centre in the district. But when she arrived with heavy bleeding last week, she found that maternal services had ceased, and the doctor had left. Mariam subsequently haemorrhaged to death.\n\u00a0In another incident, a woman named Zainab died of post-partum bleeding after delivering a daughter, Safiya. The hospital she was planning to use, had lost its gynaecologist due to the funding shortage, leaving Zainab to give birth at home, without help when complications arose.\n\u2018Now we are powerless\u2019\n\n\n\n(Left) women queue for services at Al Shahel Rural Hospital, where reproductive health services have been cut due to insufficient funding; and (right) an expectant mother is attended to at the hospital., by \u00a9 UNFPA Yemen\nCurrent and former health facility staff say they are heartbroken.\n\u201cThe most painful part is that now we are powerless and we cannot do anything about it\u201d, said Adel Shuja\u2019a, a nurse at the BaniShamakh centre. He says all the maternal care \u2013 from iron and folic acid supplements to management of obstetric emergencies \u2013 has stopped. \u201cWe are in this poor community that is exhausted from war. The suffering of poor families has increased, and we may lose many of our mothers and children.\u201d\n\u201cWhat stuck with me most was a man whose eyes filled with tears when he learned that free services were not available\u201d, said a nurse from the key Red Sea port of Hudaydah, who broke the news to several pregnant women that no midwives were available. \u201cHe returned to his home with his pregnant wife\u2026 I felt so helpless that day.\u201d\nMillions at risk\nUNFPA\u00a0is the sole provider of life-saving reproductive health medicines and supplies in Yemen, which has seen its health system all but collapse under five grinding years of conflict for control, between a pro-Government Saudi led coalition, and Houthi rebel forces, who hold the capital.\nLast year, UNFPA reached more than 3.5 million women and girls with reproductive health and protection services, providing support to 260 health facilities and 3,800 reproductive health workers.\u00a0But as funding has run out, these programmes have been scaled back or shut down.\nAt the beginning of 2020, UNFPA appealed for $100.5 million for its humanitarian response in Yemen; to date, only 41 percent of that has been mobilized. An additional $24 million is needed for the COVID-19 response.\n90 per cent will close\nIf no funding materializes by July, UNFPA will be forced to close up to 90 per cent of its life-saving reproductive services across the country.\nThe funding had been a game-changer, said one midwife from Al Shahel Rural Hospital. \u201cWe were able to have reproductive health medicines, a midwife and a female doctor. The health facility never had a midwife or a female doctor before. It was a big turning point for our village\u201d, she described. \u201cWe were serving more than 23,000 people, but unfortunately the support has now stopped.\u201d\nThe hospital had received up to 120 cases per day, she said. \u201cBut now, after suspending the services, we are unable to provide the most basic treatment.\u201d\nThe long-term costs could be staggering: It is estimated that two million women and girls of childbearing age could be at risk due to the loss of reproductive services. Some 48,000 women could die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth.\n\n\n\nMillions of women and girls are at risk as reproductive health services wind down., by \u00a9 UNFPA Yemen\nHealthcare shrinks, as pandemic grows\nReproductive health services are winding down just as Yemen begins to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has so far recorded 282 cases of the disease.\n\u201cWe still continue providing services, even with a lack of face masks and gloves,\u201d said Dr. Eshraq Al-Amrani, a former general physician at Al Shahel Rural Hospital. \u201cI cannot lie that I am very worried.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not have the minimum means of personal protection,\u201d said Nurse Shuja\u2019a.\nUNFPA has been working to provide personal protective equipment and essential medical supplies to Yemen\u2019s health system, so far reaching 114 health facilities. Some 40 ventilators have been provided.\nBut more funding is needed.\n\u201cWe are now in a life-or-death situation. Women and girls will die if we do not provide critical reproductive health services. We can only do so if funding becomes available\u201d, said Nestor Owomuhangi, UNFPA\u2019s acting representative in Yemen.\u00a0\nA virtual pledging conference, co-hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Nations, is taking place on 2 June. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemenreproductive health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nYemen: Amid spike in COVID-19 cases, UNICEF airlifts in badly needed health supplies\n\n\nHealth services for Syrian women caught up in war, foster safety and hope: UNFPA \n\n\nWHO: New guidance on treating complications due to unsafe abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nYemen: Humanitarians seeking $2.41 billion to keep aid flowing amid COVID-19 pandemic28 May 2020\nHumanitarian AidUN agencies and their global partners are seeking $2.41 billion to fight COVID-19 spread in Yemen while continuing to support millions affected by the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\n\n\nYemen aid lifeline near \u2018breaking point\u2019: UN food agency26 May 2020\nHumanitarian AidHumanitarian aid projects to war-torn Yemen are reaching breaking point, and some $870 million is needed to continue giving life-saving assistance to millions of vulnerable people for the next six months, the World Food Programme (WFP), warned on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
