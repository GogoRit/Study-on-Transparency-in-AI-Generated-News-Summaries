While the June 24, 2022, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision was a moment of victory for the pro-life movement, it was the result of a multifaceted approach built up over the decades. The Register honors the pro-life leaders who paved the way for Dobbs, many of whom did not live to see this moment, for their efforts to expose the truth that abortion ends a human life.\nWhen Roe v. Wade was handed down in January 1973, federal attorney Nellie Gray gathered fellow pro-life advocates in her townhouse on Capitol Hill to devise a way to commemorate Roe\u2019s anniversary and the lives lost because of the decision.\u00a0\nHoping that Roe would soon be overturned, she organized what she assumed would be a one-off event: the March for Life. The demonstration became a 49-year annual human-rights protest that consistently draws tens of thousands of marchers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJeanne Mancini, current president of the March for Life, told the Register that the day Dobbs was handed down was Gray\u2019s birthday, and she couldn\u2019t imagine a better birthday gift for a woman who \u201cchose to put all of her gifts and talents towards the culture of life.\u201d\u00a0\nMancini said the annual demonstration that concluded every year outside of the Supreme Court served as one of many factors leading to the eventual overturn of Roe. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more powerful statement that Roe wasn\u2019t settled law other than the marchers literally going past the Supreme Court every single year,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey may feel like one person doesn\u2019t make a difference if they come to the march or not, but take all of those people and pull them away, and there\u2019s no march.\u201d\nMancini also praised the spiritual muscle of the pro-life movement, including figures like St. Teresa of Calcutta and Pope St. John Paul II, who fearlessly spoke the truth on abortion throughout their lives.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, Mother Teresa stated in front of former President Bill Clinton and then-first lady Hillary:\n\u201cThe greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?\u201d\nMancini said that pro-lifers have worked on the issue in so many different ways over the years. Whether it was the legal angle, the work of pro-life pregnancy centers, or the political side of things, she called it \u201cbreathtaking how God\u2019s mysterious plans led to this moment\u201d of the overturn of Roe, saying God was clearly at work through these advocates \u201cto help move us into the next phase of this human-rights issue.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLooking Back\nAmong the early pro-life heroes that made the case against abortion was Dr. Jack Willke, a Catholic obstetrician who spoke out against abortion starting in the 1960s and advocated for pregnancy centers and maternity homes, popularizing the phrase \u201clove them both.\u201d He headed the National Right to Life Committee from 1980 to 1991. Another key influence in the pregnancy-care-center movement was Sister of Social Service Paula Vandegaer, who spoke out on the issue in the 1960s and was one of the founders of Heartbeat International, the first pro-life pregnancy-support center and the largest in the world.\nAnother notable figure in the movement was Dr. Mildred Jefferson, the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, who told Congress in 1981 that Roe \u201cgave my profession an almost unlimited license to kill.\u201d She was among the founders of the National Right to Life Committee, and then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan credited her with changing his mind on the issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bernard Nathanson, an abortionist-turned-pro-life advocate who founded the abortion advocacy group NARAL, was also an important voice early in the movement with his 1985 film The Silent Scream, which showed the abortion of a 12-week-old unborn baby. He said after his conversion that \u201clegal abortion was the greatest mistake this nation has ever conceived.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the Public Eye\nJoseph Scheidler, dubbed the \u201cGodfather of Pro-Life Activism,\u201d dedicated his life to pro-life work after a critical moment before Roe was handed down. His son Eric told the Register that the cause became personal for his father at a rally in 1972, where he saw a picture of a garbage bag of aborted babies at a Canadian hospital and one of those babies resembled a baby picture of Eric. The event made his father see \u201ca connection between his child and an abortion victim.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nThe moment spurred Scheidler, who passed away in 2021, to utilize his past work in advertising and media to get the word out about the evils of abortion. His son said that after Roe was handed down his father began putting advertisements about resources for women in crisis pregnancies in newspapers \u201con the same page as the abortion ads.\u201d Scheidler said his family is still seeing the effectiveness of that technique, saying that a few years ago at an event a family told them that they chose life for their child 40 years ago because of those ads.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that his father looked for creative ways to reach people, asking, \u201cHow can we break through the noise on this issue and bring people around to the pro-life side?\u201d Scheidler\u2019s efforts to break through the noise were occasionally controversial and included \u201cshowing abortion victim photos in the public square, infiltrating abortionist\u2019s meetings, and infiltrating speeches by pro-abortion speakers.\u201d In his 1985 book Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion, Scheidler wrote about practical things pro-lifers could do, including talking to friends and neighbors about the issue, sidewalk counseling, and picketing abortion fundraisers.\nEric Scheidler said that he believes his father played a role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but \u201cin a way you might not expect,\u201d by keeping the abortion issue \u201cever before the American people\u2019s minds and eyes\u201d through protests and media appearances. He said that the efforts of his father and others to keep abortion before the public eye kept up an \u201catmosphere of tension around the abortion issue,\u201d which motivated voters to back senators who approved the nomination of justices to the Supreme Court making it possible for Roe to be overturned.\n\u00a0\nPolitical Accountability\u00a0\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, who heads SBA Pro-Life America, a group founded in 1992 that funds pro-life candidates, had a lot to do with the political efforts leading to Roe being overturned.\u00a0\nIn 2016, she spearheaded a letter in which then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to nominate \u201cpro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d Dannenfelser told the Register that while that pledge turned out to be \u201cvery important,\u201d given that President Trump\u2019s three nominees changed the makeup of the court making the overturning of Roe possible, \u201cwe would never have received that pledge if we hadn\u2019t already built some political strength\u201d in the pro-life movement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the incentive for a candidate to sign that sort of pledge to pro-life voters came after \u201cmany milestones over the years\u201d swaying public opinion due to the work of churches, state pro-life groups, and scientific advances in sonogram technology. \u00a0\nLeveraging the political power of the movement built by early pro-life leaders, Dannenfelser saw a \u201cdramatic change\u201d when pro-lifers held candidates accountable on the issue. All along the way, she said, \u201cwhen there were candidates or officeholders who failed, it was important to make sure that they felt the sting of disapproval from the pro-life movement.\u201d\u00a0\nOver the years, the movement \u201cfound our political voice, and once we made clear that we were a force to be contended with in the political arena,\u201d that made \u201cthe critical Senate, presidential and Supreme Court actions possible.\u201d\u00a0\nSome of these key actions included then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to wait to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia until after the 2016 presidential election, resulting in Trump\u2019s nomination of Neil Gorsuch, later followed by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, to fill the vacancies left by Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe Dobbs Case\nAt this critical moment, the first-ever female attorney general of Mississippi, Lynn Fitch, asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe in their consideration of her state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban. She wrote in The Washington Post that she understood the \u201cmagnitude\u201d of what was being asked, but argued that \u201cthe court put political intuition above sound legal reasoning\u201d in Roe and that it was time to correct that error.\nFitch, a single mom, said Roe pitted women against their children, and that in the years since Roe, \u201cit has become easier for women to reach the very pinnacle of our success, economically and socially, fully independent of the right those seven male justices bestowed upon us.\u201d\nOn June 24, the day Roe was overturned, Fitch said in a video message that now \u201cour work to empower women and promote life truly begins.\u201d Since policymaking on the issue has been returned to the states, she saw the urgent need for advocacy for pro-life legislation that protects unborn babies and provides assistance for women in crisis-pregnancy situations.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLooking Ahead\nDannenfelser said that there is more work than ever before for the pro-life movement, noting that pro-abortion politicians can undo all the state pro-life protections made possible by Dobbs. \u201cI think we need to be doing 10 times what we already were doing,\u201d she said of the next steps for the pro-life movement, calling for \u201ccoordination and unity and leveraging of all of the beautiful education tools\u201d of the movement to target the individual situation of each state, along with backing pro-life candidates who will prevent efforts, like the extreme Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, to undo state protections at the federal level.\u00a0\nMancini said that in response to the \u201ccultural backlash and confusion\u201d following the Dobbs decision, the pro-life movement should focus on continuing to reach hearts and minds by combating disinformation on the issue, redoubling advocacy efforts at the state and federal level, and increasing the existing network of resources for moms in crisis pregnancies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s Note: The March for Life will take place on Jan. 20, but will conclude at the U.S. Capitol building instead of the Supreme Court. The group also plans to expand from five to 10 state marches for life in an effort to have demonstrations in all 50 states.\n\n\nKeywords: \nprolife\npost-roe\nyear in review\nDobbs v.
