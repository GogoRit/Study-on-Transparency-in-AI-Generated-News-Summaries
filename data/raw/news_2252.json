Dan Lipinski. \u201cLook, we want to defeat Donald Trump. We can\u2019t keep pushing people out of the party.\u201d\u00a0\nLipinski is facing two  Democratic primary challengers on March 17: Marie Newman, who came close to defeating him in 2018, and Rush Darwish, a business owner. Both are in favor of abortion rights.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd on March 3, Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar is facing a challenge from immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros. Both Newman and Cisneros have been endorsed by  a range of progressive leaders and organizations including EMILY\u2019s List, which backs women candidates who support abortion rights.\u00a0\nAnti-abortion groups consider just two other House Democrats potential allies: Minnesota Rep. Collin C. Peterson and Utah Rep. Ben McAdams, both of whom are vulnerable in November.\u00a0\nCuellar has more of a mixed abortion record than Lipinski, but both see their primary opponents as products of extreme elements in the party. Their challengers disagree, arguing that both lawmakers are out of step with the constituents, who support access to abortion.\u00a0\n[House votes to void deadline for Equal Rights Amendment ratification]\nParty leaders, meanwhile, insist that there is still room in the party for members who don\u2019t embrace abortion rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the clich\u00e9, we\u2019re a big tent party\u201d that includes Cuellar and Lipinski, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos said at a briefing with reporters last month. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll just see how that all sorts out.\u201d\nTop targets\nCuellar and Lipinski are top targets of EMILY\u2019s List in 2020, said the group\u2019s president Stephanie Schriock. Cuellar opposes federal funding for abortion. Lipinski has been consistently anti-abortion, recently signing onto an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to reexamine precedent set by abortion cases including Roe v. Wade\n\u201cThey are some of the very last anti-choice Democrats in the House of Representatives and we think it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d Schriock said in a recent interview on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program.\u00a0\n[Investors push companies to make business case on abortion]\n\n\n\nThe group\u2019s independent expenditure arm hasn\u2019t spent yet against Lipinski, with his primary still a few weeks away, but NARAL Pro-Choice America has spent more than $211,000 backing Newman.\nNARAL is also supporting Cisneros, but EMILY\u2019s List is responsible for most of the spending against Cuellar, dropping nearly $1.2 million on the race through an affiliated group called Texas Forward.\u00a0\nTexas Forward launched a TV ad noting Cuellar voted to cut federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Cuellar responded with his own ad, saying Cisneros supports allowing minors to have abortions without parental consent. Cisneros\u2019 campaign said the ad featured \u201cfalse, Trump-style attacks,\u201d but did not address the specific issues raised in the 30-second spot. \n\u201cAbortion is \u2014 I\u2019m not making it an issue,\u201d Cuellar said off the House floor last week. \u201cEMILY\u2019s List, when they decided to jump into a South Texas, conservative, Hispanic district, they made it an issue.\u201d\nLipinski said abortion has not played a defining role in his race.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI think most people out there are more concerned about everyday issues that impact them,\u201d Lipsinski said off the House floor last week. He cited a range of issues that dovetail with his moderate record, including transportation, prescription drug prices and job security.\u00a0\nDarwish campaign spokesman Andrew Patinkin also said abortion had not been the \u201cnumber one\u201d issue. But Newman campaign spokesman Ben Hardin said Lipinski\u2019s anti-abortion record\u00a0drew national attention that has helped them make their case that Lipinski is out of touch on a range of other issues.\u00a0\nA similar dynamic helped Newman, who was relatively unknown, come within 2 percentage points of defeating Lipinski in 2018. Newman also has amassed high-profile endorsements, including from progressive presidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\u00a0\nThe primaries are also evidence that the party has moved to the left on abortion since Cuellar and Lipinski were first elected to the House in 2004. The number of anti-abortion Democrats in Congress has dwindled to the low single digits, and the Democratic Party platform now states that the party believes \u201cevery woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.\u201d\nLipinski\u2019s 3rd District, which includes working class neighborhoods on the South Side of Chicago and less densely populated suburbs in Will County, has also changed since he first took over the seat from his father. Residents of Irish, Eastern European and Italian descent have slowly been replaced by a younger and more diverse population that is less socially conservative. Sanders won the Democratic presidential primary there in 2016 by 9 points, according to The Associated Press.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates both Lipinski and Cuellar\u2019s districts Solidly Democratic. Democrats have easily carried Cuellar\u2019s 28th District, which borders Mexico and stretches to the San Antonio suburbs, at the presidential and congressional level. Hillary Clinton won the 28th District by 20 points in 2016.\u00a0\nBut Cuellar noted that his district is nearly 80 percent Hispanic, and can be more socially conservative. Roughly 40 percent of the people in both Cuellar\u2019s and Lipinski\u2019s districts are Catholic, according to calculations by Daily Kos Elections, as are the two congressmen. \nCan the cavalry ride in?\nLipinski got help in 2018 from the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, which usually backs Republicans. It spent $108,000 and sent 70 canvassers to knock on doors of \u201cpro-life Democrat households,\u201d in the last five days of the race.\u00a0\nThe group plans to support him again in 2020 but is not announcing the details yet, spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said. Cuellar has not sought SBA List\u2019s endorsement, and he has\u00a0 an \u201cF\u201d on the group\u2019s scorecard.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDemocrats for Life of America have endorsed both Peterson and Lipinski, and the group\u2019s executive director, Kirsten Day, said they liked Cuellar\u2019s record as well, although they haven\u2019t endorsed him.\u00a0\nBut Day noted group has struggled to fundraise. Their super PAC hasn\u2019t raised any money since the 2016 cycle, when it raised less than $1,000, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures.\u00a0\nWhen the group tried to create a fundraising page through the Democratic juggernaut ActBlue this cycle, it was denied because it was a pro-life group, Day said.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for ActBlue declined to comment. ActBlue accepts Democratic candidates and committees, but it does use discretion when listing non-profit arms on its site, depending on whether those groups work for progressive causes.\u00a0\nFor the most part, pro-life groups spend money on Republicans. Only 5 percent of the $222,000 the Susan B. Anthony List PAC spent in 2018 elections went to Democrats. National Right to Life, which calls itself, \u201cthe nation\u2019s oldest and largest pro-life movement,\u201d hasn\u2019t given to a Democrat since 2010\n\n\n\nIn this Congress, National Right to Life has found little to like about even the most pro-life members of the Democratic caucus. Lipinski had the group\u2019s endorsement in 2018, but scores only 40 percent on the group\u2019s ratings.\u00a0\nThe only Democrat with a higher rating was Peterson, who scored 56%. National Right to Life endorsed Peterson\u2019s Republican challenger, Michelle Fishbach, in January, noting that Peterson\u2019s score was not 100%. Fischbach\u2019s mother, Darla St. Martin, is the longtime co-executive director of the National Right to Life Committee.\u00a0\nThe scorecard is meant to rate members on key abortion-related votes. But anti-abortion Democrats say these scores favor Republicans because they include party-line votes on issues that are not clearly related to abortion, such as the House Democrats\u2019 signature campaign finance overhaul, or sweeping government spending bills.\u00a0\n\u201cThey don\u2019t go out of their way to advocate for pro-life Democrats at all,\u201d said Day, of Democrats for Life. \u201cBut they find ways to tear them down.\u201d\u00a0\nNational Right to Life did not return requests for comment.\u00a0\nA \u2018big tent?\u2019\nAnti-abortion Democrats view their decline in Congress as a broader problem for the party. They argue a \u201cbig tent\u201d party that allows for nuances on abortion can better appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, who are critical voting blocs in competitive races.\n\u201dThe fastest way back to minority status is to start kicking people out of the tent,\u201d said Colin Strother, a spokesperson for Cuellar\u2019s campaign.\u00a0\nJacob Lupfer, a consultant who has worked with groups backing anti-abortion Democrats, said the key to bolstering their numbers in Congress is for anti-abortion groups to support Democrats.\u00a0\n\u201cIf the pro-life movement wants to get a pro-life majority back in the House, it can\u2019t be done on the backs of an aging, white, Christian party that is toxic to nonwhites and young people,\u201d Lupfer said.\nLupfer suggested recruiting more diverse, female candidates who oppose abortion rights to run for Congress.\u00a0\n\u201cThey need to find 15 to 25 female Dan Lipinskis,\u201d Lupfer said.\u00a0\nGroups that support abortion rights say the argument that anti-abortion Democrats are necessary to win in competitive races is a misnomer, pointing Democrats\u2019 success in the midterms.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund executive director Kelley Robinson said in a statement that 2018 was \u201ca sweeping mandate that ushered in a new House majority that supports access to abortion.\u201d The group is backing Newman and Cisneros.\nGroups that support abortion rights also say that allowing access to abortion is a \u201cbig tent\u201d position in itself. A 2019 Pew Research survey found that 70 percent of Americans do not think Roe v. Wade should be completely overturned, and 61 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\u00a0\n\u201cReproductive freedom is a political winner with an overwhelming number of Democrats, Independents, and moderate Republicans,\u201d NARAL president Ilyse Hogue said in a statement. \u201cInching away from this unifying position isn\u2019t a smart strategy: You win no one and you upset a lot of people.\u201d\n\nLoading the player...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Recent Stories\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump support may not be enough to save Bost in Illinois\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus sharpens on China\u2019s tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitol Ink | Cash flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFatal flaw: Buttigieg\u2019s inaction means women\u2019s lives are at risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe election-year dance over ByteDance and TikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A lot of vitriol\u2019: Lawmakers fret over tone of Trump-Biden rematch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Source for news on Capitol Hill since 1955\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nEvents\nPrivacy\nRC Jobs\nNewsletters\nThe Staff\nSubscriptions\n\n\n\nCQ Roll Call is a part of FiscalNote, the leading technology innovator at the intersection of global business and government.
