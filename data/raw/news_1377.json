Annie Kuster, a Democrat seeking reelection, hugs a United Steelworkers member at a North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters labor organizing event in Manchester on 10/22/22 (Capital-Star photo by Jennifer Shutt).\n\n\n\n\n\nWILMOT, New Hampshire \u2014 Voters in this swing state are among the relatively few Americans who will decide control of Congress during November\u2019s midterm elections, shaping domestic and foreign policy for the next two years and delivering a verdict on Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\nGranite Staters interviewed by the Capital-Star\u2019s Washington Bureau, during a mid-October week trailing U.S. Senate and House candidates at stops in strip malls and diners, are focused on the stark rise in inflation, especially the cost of energy\u2014as well as the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0to end the nationwide, constitutional right to abortion.\nThe two issues and more will come to a head on Nov. 8 when New Hampshire voters will decide whether to keep their four-member congressional delegation entirely blue or add some red to the mix. Along with voters in other states with close contests like Georgia, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the ballots they cast will determine whether Democrats continue their narrow control of a 50-50 U.S. Senate.\nIn New Hampshire, the choice when it comes to reproductive rights is particularly stark in the U.S. Senate battle, where Democratic incumbent and former Gov. Maggie Hassan is attempting to secure reelection against GOP nominee Don Bolduc.\nBolduc is seeking to narrow the gap in the last days of the campaign, in part, by saying he won\u2019t back a national abortion ban and incorrectly claiming Congress will have no role in legislating on abortion. Hassan disputes that assertion, and says Bolduc can\u2019t be trusted on reproductive rights given his past opposition to abortion and statements he\u2019s made.\nHow much abortion factors into voters\u2019 decisions remains unclear as Nov. 8 approaches. Nationally, a Pew Research Center\u00a0poll\u00a0from mid-October shows the top five issues that are \u201cvery important\u201d to voters this year are the economy, the future of democracy in the United States, education, health care and energy policy.\nAccess to reproductive health care is a fundamental freedom, advocates say in Capitol rally\n\nAbortion ranked ninth on the list with 56 percent of registered voters surveyed saying it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d to them heading into the midterm elections. That number is spread between the political parties, however, with 75 percent of registered Democrats and 30 percent of registered Republicans saying the issue is very important in determining how they\u2019ll vote.\nHassan, who defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte by a slender 1,017 votes in 2016, is up by 3.6 percentage points,\u00a0according to\u00a0Real Clear Politics. She also has a distinct cash advantage, with $4.8 million in her campaign war chest at the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\nBolduc had less than $770,000 on hand and took a hit when the Senate Leadership Fund, the Republican super-PAC aligned with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, pulled its ad dollars from the state.\nFederal abortion ban\nDuring a debate before the Mt. Washington Valley Economic Council on Oct. 18, and during a Q and A with reporters later in the day at a campaign stop in Rochester, Bolduc said he wouldn\u2019t support a federal abortion ban and that he didn\u2019t want the issue addressed by a national law.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court said it\u2019s a state issue. Our state has a law. That\u2019s what I support. I will not support any federal bans,\u201d he told reporters in the basement of the Rochester GOP.\nBolduc claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision this summer didn\u2019t overturn Roe v. Wade. He also said the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u201conly\u201d sent the issue back to the states, which isn\u2019t entirely true.\n\u201cSo the role of the U.S. Senate and the federal government is not to be involved. And that\u2019s what the Dobbs decision did. It didn\u2019t reverse Roe v. Wade,\u201d Bolduc said during the debate, before alleging Hassan should know the Supreme Court \u201conly moved it down to the state level.\u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0held\u00a0in its\u00a0ruling\u00a0in late June that \u201cThe Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d\nThat decision didn\u2019t allow only state legislatures to enact new abortion laws, but opened the doors to federal legislation as well, since Congress consists of elected representatives.\n  New Hampshire Republican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc, left, with Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for the Trump administration, during a campaign stop at the Rochester GOP headquarters in Rochester, New Hampshire on 10/18/22 (Capital-Star Photo by Jennifer Shutt).\nBolduc has tried to imply the issue cannot be taken up at the federal level under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Yet GOP members of Congress have been racing to introduce legislation.\nHouse Republican leaders\u00a0said in September\u00a0they\u2019ll pass abortion legislation if they regain control of the chamber following the midterm elections and South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 15-week nationwide abortion ban in September, five weeks shorter than the 20-week ban he introduced during the last Congress that garnered 47 co-sponsors.\nHassan, during an interview with States Newsroom following campaign stops on Oct. 19, said voters cannot trust Bolduc on the issue of reproductive rights, especially after statements he made during the primary.\n\u2018I feel the weightiness of the moment\u2019: Pa.\u2019s Shapiro says as governor race enters its final days\n\nBolduc has called New Hampshire\u2019s 24-week abortion law too lax, said people should \u201crejoice\u201d after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling this summer and said he would \u201calways default for a system that protects lives from beginning to end,\u201d\u00a0according to NHPR.\n\u201cHis position is very clear. There is absolutely nothing in his record to support his current claims,\u201d Hassan said.\n\u201cWhat his record supports is that he would be a yes vote for a nationwide abortion ban\u2014something Republicans in Washington have clearly been working to pursue for decades, including making sure there were new Supreme Court justices, who in their confirmation hearings said that they would respect precedent and then clearly didn\u2019t when they got into the position of power they have,\u201d she said.\nU.S. House races\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion is also coming up in New Hampshire\u2019s two races for the U.S. House as Democratic Reps. Annie Kuster, first elected in 2012 in the 2nd Congressional District, and Chris Pappas, seeking his third term in the 1st, face GOP challengers.\nKaroline Leavitt, the GOP nominee challenging Pappas and a former staffer in the Trump White House, said during a debate last week that she \u201cwill not support a federal ban on abortion.\u201d\nHer campaign website, however, says she \u201cwill be a fearless pro-life advocate to defend the lives of the unborn and speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.\u201d\nDuring the debate, Leavitt said she supported New Hampshire\u2019s current abortion law, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions later for a fatal diagnosis for the fetus or the life of the pregnant patient. The law also requires at least one parent to be notified 48 hours before an abortion can be performed on someone under the age of 18.\n\u201cI support our New Hampshire law. I support where it stands. I support the people who signed that law,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAnd despite all of the ads to the contrary\u2014that have no evidence to say\u2014I will not support a federal ban on abortion. And I\u2019ve been very clear on that.\u201d\nPappas said he supports legislation that would ensure women across the country have abortion access, pointing to his vote for the so-called\u00a0Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which the House\u00a0passed\u00a0219-210 earlier this year.\nThe bill would have prevented restrictions on abortion access before viability, typically 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, which was the standard under the 1992 Casey v. Planned Parenthood ruling that upheld the constitutional right to an abortion until the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that decision this summer.\nAfter a pregnancy reaches that thresholds, the U.S. House bill said governments couldn\u2019t restrict abortion access when \u201cin the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient\u2019s life or health.\u201d\nKuster also voted for the bill and Hassan\u00a0voted\u00a0for a similar\u00a0measure\u00a0in the Senate, though neither was able to get past the Senate\u2019s 60-vote legislative filibuster amid Republican opposition.\nDuring a roundtable on abortion rights with three state senators in Nashua on Oct. 21, Kuster said reproductive rights access and issues about the economy aren\u2019t separate, but tied together.\n\u201cI think families just want to have control, right? They just want to manage their life decisions so that they can have a family when they\u2019re ready, when they can afford it, when they can provide,\u201d Kuster said.\nDuring an interview after the roundtable, Kuster said Democrats are talking about both inflation and abortion ahead of the midterms, just differently than many GOP candidates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to talk about both, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t talk about one without the other,\u201d she said.\nKuster added that Republicans often talk about abortion as if it\u2019s \u201cisolated from life,\u201d a choice she said doesn\u2019t often reflect how people decide when and how to have children.\nThe Cook Political Report with Amy Walter\u00a0rates\u00a0the Kuster and Hassan reelection bids as lean Democrat, though Pappas\u2019 bid is seen as one of the 32 toss-up campaigns that will determine control of the U.S. House.\nPolling from Fabrizio, Lee & Associates/Impact Research conducted in early October and sponsored by AARP shows Kuster with a 10-point advantage over GOP challenger Robert Burns, but the Pappas-Leavitt race was much closer with 48 percent of those surveyed backing Pappas and 47 percent supporting Leavitt.\nA survey from Emerson College Polling/WHDH 7 News put Hassan and Bolduc within the margin of error as well, with 48 percent of those polled saying they\u2019d vote for Hassan, 45 percent supporting Bolduc and 4 percent undecided.\nVoter voices\nVoters throughout New Hampshire in interviews often cited the top national issues of inflation, abortion access and energy costs as key to determining how they\u2019ll vote on Nov. 8.\nBolduc supporters overwhelmingly said they were backing him in a bid to reduce inflation and bolster border security and because of his career in the U.S. military.\nMartha Haley, from Dover, said she began supporting Bolduc in the 2020 Republican primary in his bid to challenge New Hampshire\u2019s other Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. Bolduc ultimately lost that GOP primary to Bryant \u201cCorky\u201d Messner, 43 percent to 51 percent.\n\u201cI\u2019m just really pleased with his service to the country and his conservative values,\u201d Haley said, noting the economy and border security are two of her top issues.\n  U.S. Sen.

Chris Pappas attend a North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters labor organizing event in Manchester on 10/22/22 (Capital-Star photo by Jennifer Shutt).\nHaley said she was \u201cpro-life\u201d and that abortion and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision weren\u2019t factors for her this year.\nElaine Plante, from Dover, said she decided to support Bolduc based on his policy proposals and because he is \u201cthe whole package.\u201d\nPlante said she believes Bolduc can help \u201cturn the economy around\u201d and increase security at the border while allowing \u201cchildren to be children\u201d in school. She also said she was frustrated with some of Hassan and Democrats\u2019 campaign ads on abortion.\nInside the Rochester GOP headquarters a few minutes later, Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for the Trump administration, campaigned with Bolduc, encouraging supporters to think about inflation, crime, immigration and opioid addiction when deciding how they\u2019d vote this year.\n\u201cThis race is going to come down to the wire,\u201d Haley said. \u201cBut I think the shining star on election night is going to be the state of New Hampshire, and it\u2019s going to be because you\u2019re going to put Gen. Bolduc in that Senate seat.\u201d\nThe next day, during a stop at Lou\u2019s Restaurant and Bakery in Hanover, near the Vermont border, Hassan walked alongside the diner\u2019s booths, talking with residents and out-of-town visitors.\nSitting in a front booth of the restaurant, just steps from Dartmouth College\u2019s campus, Eloise Osmann, Dartmouth class of 2026, said that reproductive rights are an important issue for her, and she intends to switch her voting registration to New Hampshire.\nWhen the leaked Supreme Court decision was published in May, Osmann said, she and her friends began talking about where they were planning to attend college and whether those states would continue to have the abortion access that had been around for five decades.\n\u201cComing from Connecticut you\u2019d always assumed your rights are there, but in other states\u2014like my friends are going to schools in the South\u2014you can\u2019t just assume that in those states,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d\nDartmouth economics professor Bruce Sacerdote, who was also at the diner, said he expects New Hampshire voters will elect Hassan to another term, noting he\u2019s seen the state skew towards the political left during the last two decades.\n\u201cEven though some of the presidential races have been relatively close, I just think in the end there\u2019s a lot of people who vote Democrat here,\u201d Sacerdote said. \u201cAnd also she\u2019s pretty middle of the road. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s extreme left, where she\u2019s going to draw a lot of fire from people. Whereas her opponent is someone, I think, independents are not likely to gravitate to.\u201d\nSmall business challenges\nAfter meeting with diners, Hassan stood toward the back of Lou\u2019s, talking with co-owners Cailin and Jarett Berke about the challenges they\u2019ve faced during COVID-19 and amid rising inflation.\nJarett Berke said during an interview after the senator left for her next campaign stop that he\u2019s \u201ccertainly thinking about inflation and infrastructure\u201d as well as workforce development and health care costs heading toward Election Day.\n\u201cSmall business owners bear an enormous weight to pay for health care. And unfortunately, even though we pay for 70 percent of our premiums, which is better than a lot of big companies, we still have a lot of people that choose not to get health insurance. And that\u2019s concerning,\u201d Jarett Berke said.\nBoth Cailin and Jarett Berke said they\u2019re also thinking about \u201csome personal things\u201d in determining how they\u2019ll vote this year that are outside the scope of their role as \u201cpolitically neutral\u201d business owners.\nBut as New Hampshire voters mull their choices, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision remains a central component of Democrats\u2019 and President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign message.\nJust last week, Biden\u00a0told supporters\u00a0at a Democratic National Committee event at the historic Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C. that if the party can hold onto the U.S. House and pick up seats in the U.S. Senate he\u2019ll push Congress to ensure abortion access nationwide.\n\u201cThe first bill that I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. And when Congress passes it, I\u2019ll sign it in January, 50 years after Roe was first decided the law of the land,\u201d Biden said.\n\u201cAnd together, we\u2019ll restore the right to choose for every woman in every state in America,\u201d Biden added. \u201cSo, vote. You got to get out the vote.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXHow claims about a federal abortion ban are roiling one state as the midterms near\nby Jennifer Shutt, Pennsylvania Capital-Star October 25, 2022\nHow claims about a federal abortion ban are roiling one state as the midterms near\nby Jennifer Shutt, Pennsylvania Capital-Star October 25, 2022\n WILMOT, New Hampshire \u2014 Voters in this swing state are among the relatively few Americans who will decide control of Congress during November\u2019s midterm elections, shaping domestic and foreign policy for the next two years and delivering a verdict on Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\nGranite Staters interviewed by the Capital-Star\u2019s Washington Bureau, during a mid-October week trailing U.S. Senate and House candidates at stops in strip malls and diners, are focused on the stark rise in inflation, especially the cost of energy\u2014as well as the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0to end the nationwide, constitutional right to abortion.\nThe two issues and more will come to a head on Nov. 8 when New Hampshire voters will decide whether to keep their four-member congressional delegation entirely blue or add some red to the mix.

They just want to manage their life decisions so that they can have a family when they\u2019re ready, when they can afford it, when they can provide,\u201d Kuster said.\nDuring an interview after the roundtable, Kuster said Democrats are talking about both inflation and abortion ahead of the midterms, just differently than many GOP candidates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to talk about both, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t talk about one without the other,\u201d she said.\nKuster added that Republicans often talk about abortion as if it\u2019s \u201cisolated from life,\u201d a choice she said doesn\u2019t often reflect how people decide when and how to have children.\nThe Cook Political Report with Amy Walter\u00a0rates\u00a0the Kuster and Hassan reelection bids as lean Democrat, though Pappas\u2019 bid is seen as one of the 32 toss-up campaigns that will determine control of the U.S. House.\nPolling from Fabrizio, Lee & Associates/Impact Research conducted in early October and sponsored by AARP shows Kuster with a 10-point advantage over GOP challenger Robert Burns, but the Pappas-Leavitt race was much closer with 48 percent of those surveyed backing Pappas and 47 percent supporting Leavitt.\nA survey from Emerson College Polling/WHDH 7 News put Hassan and Bolduc within the margin of error as well, with 48 percent of those polled saying they\u2019d vote for Hassan, 45 percent supporting Bolduc and 4 percent undecided.\n    Voter voices\n\n\t\nVoters throughout New Hampshire in interviews often cited the top national issues of inflation, abortion access and energy costs as key to determining how they\u2019ll vote on Nov. 8.\nBolduc supporters overwhelmingly said they were backing him in a bid to reduce inflation and bolster border security and because of his career in the U.S. military.\nMartha Haley, from Dover, said she began supporting Bolduc in the 2020 Republican primary in his bid to challenge New Hampshire\u2019s other Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. Bolduc ultimately lost that GOP primary to Bryant \u201cCorky\u201d Messner, 43 percent to 51 percent.\n\u201cI\u2019m just really pleased with his service to the country and his conservative values,\u201d Haley said, noting the economy and border security are two of her top issues.\n  U.S. Sen.

She also said she was frustrated with some of Hassan and Democrats\u2019 campaign ads on abortion.\nInside the Rochester GOP headquarters a few minutes later, Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for the Trump administration, campaigned with Bolduc, encouraging supporters to think about inflation, crime, immigration and opioid addiction when deciding how they\u2019d vote this year.\n\u201cThis race is going to come down to the wire,\u201d Haley said. \u201cBut I think the shining star on election night is going to be the state of New Hampshire, and it\u2019s going to be because you\u2019re going to put Gen. Bolduc in that Senate seat.\u201d\nThe next day, during a stop at Lou\u2019s Restaurant and Bakery in Hanover, near the Vermont border, Hassan walked alongside the diner\u2019s booths, talking with residents and out-of-town visitors.\nSitting in a front booth of the restaurant, just steps from Dartmouth College\u2019s campus, Eloise Osmann, Dartmouth class of 2026, said that reproductive rights are an important issue for her, and she intends to switch her voting registration to New Hampshire.\nWhen the leaked Supreme Court decision was published in May, Osmann said, she and her friends began talking about where they were planning to attend college and whether those states would continue to have the abortion access that had been around for five decades.\n\u201cComing from Connecticut you\u2019d always assumed your rights are there, but in other states\u2014like my friends are going to schools in the South\u2014you can\u2019t just assume that in those states,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d\nDartmouth economics professor Bruce Sacerdote, who was also at the diner, said he expects New Hampshire voters will elect Hassan to another term, noting he\u2019s seen the state skew towards the political left during the last two decades.\n\u201cEven though some of the presidential races have been relatively close, I just think in the end there\u2019s a lot of people who vote Democrat here,\u201d Sacerdote said. \u201cAnd also she\u2019s pretty middle of the road. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s extreme left, where she\u2019s going to draw a lot of fire from people. Whereas her opponent is someone, I think, independents are not likely to gravitate to.\u201d\n    Small business challenges\n\n\t\nAfter meeting with diners, Hassan stood toward the back of Lou\u2019s, talking with co-owners Cailin and Jarett Berke about the challenges they\u2019ve faced during COVID-19 and amid rising inflation.\nJarett Berke said during an interview after the senator left for her next campaign stop that he\u2019s \u201ccertainly thinking about inflation and infrastructure\u201d as well as workforce development and health care costs heading toward Election Day.\n\u201cSmall business owners bear an enormous weight to pay for health care. And unfortunately, even though we pay for 70 percent of our premiums, which is better than a lot of big companies, we still have a lot of people that choose not to get health insurance. And that\u2019s concerning,\u201d Jarett Berke said.\nBoth Cailin and Jarett Berke said they\u2019re also thinking about \u201csome personal things\u201d in determining how they\u2019ll vote this year that are outside the scope of their role as \u201cpolitically neutral\u201d business owners.\nBut as New Hampshire voters mull their choices, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision remains a central component of Democrats\u2019 and President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign message.\nJust last week, Biden\u00a0told supporters\u00a0at a Democratic National Committee event at the historic Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C. that if the party can hold onto the U.S. House and pick up seats in the U.S. Senate he\u2019ll push Congress to ensure abortion access nationwide.\n\u201cThe first bill that I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. And when Congress passes it, I\u2019ll sign it in January, 50 years after Roe was first decided the law of the land,\u201d Biden said.\n\u201cAnd together, we\u2019ll restore the right to choose for every woman in every state in America,\u201d Biden added. \u201cSo, vote. You got to get out the vote.\u201d\n\n\n Pennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
