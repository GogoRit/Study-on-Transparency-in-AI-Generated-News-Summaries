After her conversion to Christianity in 1983, she now firmly stands for the protection of people throughout their entire lives, starting at conception and ending at death, which is something she calls \u201cwomb to tomb.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that my mom wanted to abort me in 1950 because she was a college student,\u201d Alveda King said. \u201cAbortion was illegal, but this exploratory procedure is what she wanted.\u201d\nAccording to Alveda King, her mother was persuaded by her grandfather to keep her baby after he described a dream he had several years prior, which described what the baby would look like. Alveda King claims this interaction to be a \u201cprophetic ultrasound,\u201d though she did not link it to her pro-life stance until many years later.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know then that I was born into the pro-life movement,\u201d Alveda King said. \u201cGod called me away from my liberal living. I had two abortions, a miscarriage, divorce, I was just living in the world. In 1983, God said that he wanted me to give my testimony. So I became a voice for life in 1983 when I was born-again, but I had been rescued in the womb, and I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d\nLiz Fitch | Liberty ChampionFAITH \u2014 Alveda King discussed her journey to Christianity and how her views of the world changed through her experience with God with her goddaughters by her side.\u00a0 \nA woman\u2019s right to choose what they do with their bodies is a constant theme in debates regarding abortion, but Alveda King makes the distinction that a baby is no longer your body.\u00a0\nThese beliefs led to Alveda King standing against many of her family members, most of which are Democrats. Because of this, she developed a healthy attitude towards dealing with people whom she disagrees with.\u00a0\n\u201cWe always said at Thanksgiving dinner that we\u2019re not going to take the turkey leg and beat each other with it,\u201d Alveda King said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t agree with someone, there are six things I recommend: gather your information, educate your audience, examine your own heart, go to the negotiating table, seek God and step six should be win-win.\u201d\nPresident Jerry Falwell chimed in, stating that he seeks to find the common traits between himself and those that he disagrees with.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that just because you disagree with someone, does not mean you don\u2019t have anything in common,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cIn fact, some of the people you disagree with the most, you have more in common with culturally. When my father got sick in 2005, the only three national figures that sent him letters were Jesse Jackson, Ted Kennedy and Larry Flynt.\u201d\u00a0\nSenior Vice President for Spiritual Development David Nasser pointed out the societal improvement since the days of Martin Luther King Jr., but acknowledged that improvement is always possible, and even in today\u2019s world, people need to be active in fighting for what is right.\u00a0\n\u201cIn every generation, these truths (racial equality) must be proclaimed out of the word of God,\u201d Alveda King said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t quote chapter and verse, you must always have an answer, so we have to speak and teach with the understanding that John 3:16 is for everybody.\u201d\n\nCraft is the asst. news editor.

My folks fled from Ireland during the potato famine. My ancestors where literally slaves and many died from disease due to being packed in like sardines. I am not a racist but I do not like the phrase \u201cpeople of color \u201c. What am I. I\u2019m a color. Slavery was a horrible thing. I can\u2019t understand that. But we never had any slaves. Poor dirt farmers were we. Then we pulled ourselves up by the boot straps and craved out a life. Hard work. Thank you for all you do and know I pray for our country and those who are in office. God Bless!\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nSean Sullivan\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 22, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4:27 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThe Irish people were initially labeled as brown people and were prohibited from many employment opportunities. \u201cIrish need not apply\u201d. Immigrants of most nationalities were discriminated against. However, black slavery lasted much longer, really didn\u2019t have a choice when immigrating, and the discrimination continued. This is why we don\u2019t really hear about the discrimination of irish and other immigrants.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark McClure\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 23, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4:40 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nScotch Irish Protestant Orangemen.\nThe Tudor period.\nMaritime service in the Royal Navy.\nJews in Muslim countries.\nThe Holocaust\nArmenian genocide.\nSt Augustine during the 15 continental colonies\nChild labor in the English islands\nChristians under Diocletian\nNative Americans fought and enslaved their enemies\nThe Canaanites crushed for their worship of Baal\nThe Punic Wars and Carthage\nThe Septuagint condemned abortion\nPlenty of history in this world.\n60% of black babies aborted in NYC\nMarxist BLM apostates.\nPlenty of homework to study.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nClark Gear\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:11 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nVery powerful testimony, thank you for sharing. I heard Jerry Falwell very young at a rally. He fervently loved the Lord and Loved people. He knew that Jesus was the uniter or the divider. We pray He unites all who turn away from the world and turn to God through Yeshua. Thank you for the healing you provide all us sinners. Especially every woman and man who has been involved in abortion. Heal our wounds and our minds.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
