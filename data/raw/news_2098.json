(Credit: CNS)\nListenNEW YORK \u2014 President Donald Trump identified himself as the \u201cbest [president] in the history of the Catholic Church\u201d in a conference call for Catholic leaders and educators Saturday, where he warned that issues at stake in the upcoming presidential election, particularly on abortion and religious liberty, \u201chave never been more important for the Church.\u201d\nTrump also pledged support for Catholic schools in light of the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an audio recording of the meeting obtained by Crux, the president repeatedly emphasized his support for the pro-life movement and school choice, attempting to paint a stark contrast between his administration and what a Democratic presidency could mean for Catholics.\nCrux was told by two participants that over 600 people were on the call, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston, Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles and president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Bishop Michael C. Barber of Oakland, chair of the USCCB committee of Catholic Education, as well as the superintendents of Catholic schools for Los Angeles and Denver, among others.\nIn his opening remarks, the president noted that he was joined on the call by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Secretary of Housing and Education Ben Carson.\nSaturday\u2019s call comes just one week after the president held another call with faith leaders on April 17, which also included the participation of Dolan and Gomez, meant to discuss the re-opening of houses of worship, but where the president also sought reelection support.\nRELATED: In call with religious leaders on re-opening churches, Trump sought election support\nIn his opening remarks, the president thanked Catholic educators for their efforts in distance learning during the pandemic, as well as the spiritual support they are providing to families. Citing his own childhood of growing up next to a Catholic parish and school in Queens, New York, the president characterized Catholic schools as \u201ca source of strength, hope, opportunity for communities across the country.\u201d\nThe president also referenced the COVID-19 paycheck protection program, which was included in the initial relief package passed by Congress in March to provide forgivable paycheck loans. The president told participants on the call that he insisted that Catholic institutions be included in the program or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do the deal.\u201d\nHe also used his opening remarks to recite a number of economic accomplishments of his administration, saying that prior to the pandemic he was responsible for the greatest economy in the history the country, with the \u201cbest numbers\u201d for African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and women, until the economy was \u201cunfairly hit\u201d by the coronavirus.\nHe said the spread of the virus \u201ccould have been stopped a lot earlier\u2026if it was stopped at the source, and everyone knows what I mean when I say that.\u201d\nLooking ahead to the economy\u2019s re-opening, the president said the country is \u201cgoing to open up with a bang.\u201d\nYet the president\u2019s most frequented theme in his opening remarks was that of his commitment to pro-life cause, saying that it has \u201cbeen at a level that no other president has seen before, according to everybody.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying what everybody is saying,\u201d he said, citing the fact that he was first sitting president to address the March for Life in person in January, the annual event in protest of the legalization of abortion by the Supreme Court in 1973.\nHe also referenced his support for the Mexico City policy, which prevents federal funding for NGO\u2019s that provide abortion related services. The policy was instituted by President Ronald Reagan and has been reinstated by every Republican president since 1984. (On the call, however, the president erroneously stated that Reagan was the last to sign it.)\nHe also highlighted his opposition to the Johnson Amendment, which prevents tax exempt institutions from endorsing or opposing political candidates. He described it as \u201cvery viscous,\u201d adding that \u201cI got rid of it so you can express your views very strongly.\u201d\nFollowing approximately 15 minutes of opening remarks, the president also took questions a pre-selected pool of participants before opening it up to others on the call.\nDolan was the first to speak, whom the president hailed as a \u201cgreat gentleman\u201d and a \u201cgreat friend of mine,\u201d adding that he respects what the cardinal \u201casks for.\u201d\nThe New York cardinal said he was \u201chonored to be the lead-off batter, and the feelings are mutual sir,\u201d noting that the two had been on the phone often in recent months and joking that the cardinal\u2019s 90-year-old mom in Missouri says \u201cI call you more than I call her.\u201d\nDolan praised the support of DeVos, Carson, and special counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway as \u201cchampions\u201d and \u201ccherished allies in our passion for our beloved schools.\u201d\nThe cardinal focused on education, saying that it concerns \u201cparental rights, educational justice, and civil rights of our kids\u201d and thanked the president for his \u201ccourageous insistence that the nonprofits, faith communities, and our schools be included\u201d in the recent stimulus package.\nHe warned, however, that current funding toward schools is only guaranteed through this academic year and that many Catholic schools around the country are \u201creally scared\u201d about September, saying that tuition assistance for parents to continue to send their children to Catholic schools was greatly needed\n\u201cNever has the outlook financially looked more bleak, but perhaps never has the outlook looked more promising given the energetic commitment that your administration has to our schools,\u201d Dolan told the president. \u201cWe need you more than ever.\u201d\nThe president responded by reminding attendees of his reelection efforts, saying the \u201csituation coming up on November 3, the likes of which have never been more important for the Church.\u201d\nHe quickly pivoted to abortion, saying that Democrats \u201cwant abortion and they want it now and they want it to go up to the end of the ninth month and beyond,\u201d and referenced the comments of Virginia Democratic Governor Ralph Northam who faced backlash last year for his support of third trimester abortion. The president also used the occasion to recall the final debate during his 2016 race against Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, where he criticized her support for late term abortion.\n\u201cWe did very well defending that during our last race with Hillary Clinton because she had it right up until the time at birth,\u201d said the president on Saturday. \u201cWe probably helped out the pro-life [cause] more than anything you can imagine.\u201d\n\u201cI hope that everyone gets out and votes and does what they have to do,\u201d he then said of the November election. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a very different Catholic Church,\u201d he warned if he is defeated.\nThe president then took a question from O\u2019Malley, who redirected the discussion to Catholic education, saying \u201cno institution in our country that has been more successful than Catholic schools in moving people from poverty to the middle class.\u201d\nThe Boston cardinal urged the president to guarantee tuition assistance to families sending children to Catholic schools.\n\u201cWe need it now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be done in a quick way that helps them to pay tuition.\u201d\nThe president thanked O\u2019Malley, saying he\u2019d \u201cnever heard it expressed so succinctly [and] frankly\u201d in responding to the cardinal\u2019s description of the value of Catholic education.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be helping you out more than you even know,\u201d he promised.\nBoth Paul Escala and Elias J. Moo, superintendents of Catholics schools for in Los Angeles and Denver, used their time to urge for continued school choice.\n\u201cParental choice cannot be a casualty of this crisis,\u201d said Escala, telling the president that \u201cwe stand with you,\u201d emphasizing that Catholic schools in California have saved the government over 2 billion dollars.\n\u201cThe other side is not in favor of it,\u201d the president warned. \u201cWhat a similarity we have and how the other side is the exact opposite of what you\u2019re wanting so I guess it\u2019s an important thing to remember.\u201d\nThe president zeroed in on the savings amount and asked that a national figure of what Catholic schools save the federal government in education be determined so that he could convince Congress for greater funding.\nBarber noted that the USCCB remains committed to partnering with the administration, hailing DeVos as a great ally to Catholics, as well as thanking the president for his selection of justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, whom he characterized as supporters of school choice.\nGomez highlighted the sacrifices of Catholic educators to continue to provide quality education to children and said Church leaders remained committed to working with the administration to ensure that Catholic education continues.\nHe then offered a prayer asking that the Lord would \u201cdeliver the nation from the plague.\u201d\nFollowing the call, the president took to Twitter on Saturday evening to thank Catholic leaders for joining and to publicly announce that he would be tuning in to the live streamed Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on Sunday, presided over by Dolan.\nPresident Donald Trump tweets about his call with Catholic leaders (photo taken from Twitter)\nIn the opening words of his homily, Dolan said that he understood we have a \u201cformer neighbor worshipping with us,\u201d saying that St. Paul admonishes Christians to pray for their leaders and \u201cthat we do.\u201d\nThe New York cardinal offered his birthday blessings to First Lady Melania Trump, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d and thanked the president and his administration for \u201cworking so hard to see that we can safely return to Church as safely possible.\u201d\nFollowing the Sunday Mass, the president once more took to Twitter.\n\u201cThank you for a great call yesterday with Catholic Leaders, and a great Service today,\u201d he wrote.\nFollow Christopher White on Twitter:\u00a0@cwwhite212\nShareLatest Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Related Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Popular\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep Crux IndependentFor the cost of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can help keep the lights on at Crux.Support UsLast Week in the Church with John Allen Jr.Tuesdays onCrux.
