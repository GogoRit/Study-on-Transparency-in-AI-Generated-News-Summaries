Wade,' said anti-abortion groups paid her to become pro-life in the upcoming doc 'AKA Jane Roe.' \nRobert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorma McCorvey, who  used the pseudonym \u201cJane Roe\u201d in the landmark reproductive rights case Roe v. Wade, said that the reason she was an anti-abortion activist later in life was because she was paid. The revelation comes in the new FX documentary AKA Jane Roe, which premieres this Friday, May 22nd, and was also reported by the Los Angeles Times.\nAKA Jane Roe was directed by Nick Sweeney, who conducted a series of interviews with McCorvey before she died in February 2017 at the age of 69. In the film, she reportedly calls her work for anti-abortion activists \u201can act\u201d and describes her admission that she took money from them her \u201cdeathbed confession.\u201d She also states her true views in the film, \u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion, that\u2019s no skin off my ass. That\u2019s why they call it choice.\u201d\nAs AKA Jane Roe explores, McCorvey was always a peculiar and controversial figure on both sides of the reproductive rights debate. She never actually had an abortion, but after becoming pregnant with her third child, signed an affidavit challenging laws in Texas that prohibited abortion except to save the life of the mother. Lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee saw McCorvey as an ideal plaintiff because she lacked the means to travel outside of Texas to get an abortion had she wanted one.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time Roe v. Wade was finally settled in 1973, McCorvey had given birth and put her child up for adoption. In the film she says, \u201cI know how I felt when I found out that I was pregnant, and I wasn\u2019t going to let another woman feel that way \u2014 cheap, dirty, and no good.\u201d She also recalled her reaction to learning about the decision, saying, \u201cWhy would I be excited? I had a baby, but I gave her away. It\u2019s for all the women who come after me.\u201d\n\nMcCorvey went public as Jane Roe in the Eighties, but reproductive-rights activists tended to be wary of her, especially after she said she\u2019d been lying when she claimed she\u2019d gotten pregnant as the result of rape. Still, McCorvey seemed to fall firmly on the pro-choice side of the argument, and she was actually working at an abortion clinic in Dallas when she became unlikely friends with Flip Benham, the director of the radical anti-abortion Christian group Operation Save America (then known as Operation Rescue). Soon, McCorvey was a regular at anti-abortion rallies, appeared in various documentaries, and in 1998 published a memoir, Won by Love, in which she detailed her conversion on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTrending\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCheech & Chong Return for One 'Last Movie'\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActor and Drag Star Shangela Accused of Multiple Sexual Assaults\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA ChatGPT for Music Is Here.

I took their money and they\u2019d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say. It was all an act. I did it well too. I am a good actress.\u201d\nIn the film, Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister who previously worked for Operation Rescue but has since changed his views on banning abortion, seemed to corroborate McCovey\u2019s claims. He said she was paid for fear \u201cthat she would go back to the other side.\u201d Schenck added, \u201cThere were times I wondered, \u2018Is she playing us?\u2019 And what I didn\u2019t have the guts to say was, because I know damn well we were playing her \u2026 what we did with Norma was highly unethical.
