(Whitney Downard / Indiana Capital Chronicle)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s leading anti-abortion organization, Indiana Right to Life (IRTL), has released its latest voter guide for Hoosiers seeking information on candidates but some decry the lack of transparency in changes to the scorecard.\nThe 2022 survey, distributed to candidates running for federal or state offices, is markedly different from its 2020 counterpart. The 2020 version included detailed breakdowns of each candidate\u2019s response to every survey question while the 2022 version includes just four designations: does or does not support pro-life legislation, mixed and did not respond.\u00a0\nThe voter guide itself doesn\u2019t include IRTL\u2019s process for determining which candidates received which designation, but Mike Fichter, the organization\u2019s president, said it was based on a combination of factors including survey responses and voting records.\u00a0\n  Mike Fichter, president and CEO of Indiana Right to Life (From the Indiana Right to Life website)\nThat means that even Republican candidates who didn\u2019t respond could get a \u201cdoes support\u201d designation based on their previous record. In the 2020 guide, dozens of sitting Republican lawmakers didn\u2019t respond. In 2022, no sitting Republican lawmaker was given the \u201cdid not respond\u201d designation.\n\u201c(IRTL) decided to produce a more concise presentation of candidate positions following feedback from supporters who felt previous voter guides were too detailed, and the print too small, to be effective,\u201d Fichter said in an emailed response to questions. \u201cThe ultimate measure of any voter guide is its usefulness. Feedback on the new style in 2022 has been very positive.\u201d\nMany new candidates from both major parties didn\u2019t respond to the survey. Some of the first-time candidates, without a solid campaign apparatus, may not have the ability or inclination to respond to the organization.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there were some candidates who were tough to track down because we have a fair amount of first-time candidates who aren\u2019t used to getting all these questions or may have simply not put in campaign strategy time to respond to all of them,\u201d said Andrew Downs, a former political science professor at Purdue University Fort Wayne.\u00a0\nFichter said that IRTL didn\u2019t \u201chand hold\u201d candidates to make them respond, and had even corrected the survey when one candidate said their response wasn\u2019t included.\u00a0\n\u201cIf we are contacted by candidates who believe they did respond but were improperly excluded, we make every effort to update our online scorecard in a timely manner,\u201d Fichter said. \u201cIn cases where a candidate does not respond, we advise voters to contact the candidate directly to ask about their positions on issues.\u201d\nBut Downs observed that some candidates may purposefully not respond, especially if they\u2019re a Republican challenging a Democrat in a purple district.\n\u201cThe Dobbs decision wasn\u2019t uniformly loved and (the near-total abortion ban in) Senate Bill 1 didn\u2019t make a lot of people happy,\u201d Downs said. \u201cSo you might, as a candidate, want to distance yourself from that.\u201d\nLawmaker responses to their designations\nSen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, was one of four GOP lawmakers who received a \u201cmixed\u201d designation from the organization, along with Sens. Kyle Walker and Jon Ford as well as Rep. Ann Vermilion.\nAll voted against the near-total abortion ban, believing it was too strict, and are up for re-election.\nAlting said his constituents hav been supportive of his decision, even pro-life Republicans, many of whom said they actually wanted a less restrictive ban at 15 weeks that included exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\u00a0\n\nHere are some questions from the 2022 General Election survey:\n-Will you vote only for party and caucus leadership that is committed to protecting innocent life from conception to natural death?\n-Do you support your political party\u2019s national platform on abortion?\n-Do you support current Indiana law stating that human physical life begins when a human ovum\nis fertilized by a human sperm?\n-Under what circumstances do you believe abortion should be legal? (Mark all that apply.)\nA. Abortion should never be legal.\nB. Life of the mother only\nC. Rape and/or incest\nD. Other\nE. Abortion should be legal in all cases\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 because they live in the real world. They understand that a 15-year-old can be brutally raped\u2026 and not go home to tell mom and dad because she\u2019s scared to death,\u201d Alting said. \u201cIt may pass the 10-week (cutoff) before she thinks to go home and tell them and that\u2019s why the 15 (weeks cutoff) is very, very important. We don\u2019t live in a perfect society.\u201d\nIRTL has maintained that they would only support a total ban on abortion, with the only exception being for the life of the mother. The current law \u2014 on hold due to several legal battles \u2014 allows exceptions for rape or incest victims up to 10 weeks post-fertilization, as well as for the life of the mother and fatal fetal anomalies.\u00a0\nJust one incumbent Republican lawmaker didn\u2019t receive a supportive or mixed designation from the organization: New Albany Rep. Ed Clere, who also voted against the near-total abortion ban, was marked as not supporting pro-life legislation.\u00a0\nClere said he didn\u2019t return the organization\u2019s general election survey, though he said he answered the organization\u2019s primary election questionnaire. But unlike past voting guides, none of the sitting elected officials were designated as such and he was singled out.\n\u201cThe voter guide is misleading, at least in my case,\u201d Clere said. \u201cBecause I have supported pro-life legislation year after year\u2026 I\u2019ve always considered myself a pro-life legislator and I still do.\u201d\nClere\u2019s assertion that he returned the primary voter guide couldn\u2019t be confirmed because the IRTL\u2019s previous voter guides are no longer on their webpage. To compare to the 2020 publication, the Indiana Capital Chronicle used the Wayback Machine, which archives some internet web pages.\u00a0\nFichter clarified that this year\u2019s scorecard was evaluated based on a combination of factors, including: \u201csurveys, voting records, public statements, in-person discussions and more\u201d.\nDowns said that evaluations based on yes or no votes for specific information are more informative but can be complicated if one only considers a tailored list of bills or doesn\u2019t include procedural votes on things like amendments.\u00a0\n\u201cThat aside, groups that are sending out information are doing it so that targeted voters receive a message,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThat message may be \u2018Vote for Person X, because they do what we want.\u2019\u201d\nImpact moving forward\nNearly every race had its candidates in place before the Dobbs decision was released, meaning that candidates motivated either way on abortion access might not have considered running until this summer. Downs said he thought the more interesting question would be whether abortion continued to be an issue moving forward.\n  Andy Downs, a former political science professor at Purdue University -Fort Wayne (From Purdue University \u2013 Fort Wayne website)\n\u201cThere are people who might have run offense had they known about the Dobbs decision before the deadline to file,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThe question is how many people who ran this year\u2026 will continue their campaigns into \u201824?\u201d\nBut, in the 2023 session, Downs was confident that some legislators would attempt to tackle abortion again.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that there will still be legislation introduced. We know there are people who didn\u2019t think (the ban) went far enough\u2026 (and) there will be people who try to walk it back a little bit,\u201d Downs said.\nHowever, the likelihood of leadership allowing the legislation to move forward would be low, particularly since there are many competing priorities for the budget-writing session. Downs said that lawmakers might delay passing other legislation until they receive more clarity from the U.S. Supreme Court on lingering questions.\nFor his part, Alting said future abortion legislation would depend on whether leadership wants to go through the process again, which included late nights and prolonged hours of public testimony.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got the votes to make it more restrictive; I don\u2019t think that will happen,\u201d Alting said. \u201cSo hopefully leadership will not let that go on and make us concentrate on subjects like this versus the budget and other topics we need to focus on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIndiana Right to Life voter guide less transparent after abortion moves\nby Whitney Downard, Indiana Capital Chronicle October 26, 2022\nIndiana Right to Life voter guide less transparent after abortion moves\nby Whitney Downard, Indiana Capital Chronicle October 26, 2022\n The state\u2019s leading anti-abortion organization, Indiana Right to Life (IRTL), has released its latest voter guide for Hoosiers seeking information on candidates but some decry the lack of transparency in changes to the scorecard.\nThe 2022 survey, distributed to candidates running for federal or state offices, is markedly different from its 2020 counterpart.
