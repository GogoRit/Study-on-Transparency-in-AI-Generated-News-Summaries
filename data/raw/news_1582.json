Nine percent of respondents say the law has too few restrictions.\u00a0This poll of 406 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 13-17 by Selzer & Co. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\u00a0Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds summoned lawmakers for a July special session to pass the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, which bans nearly all abortions after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo. Medical professionals say that cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.\u00a0The law includes narrowly defined exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities and medical emergencies.\u00a0Lawmakers passed the legislation in a one-day marathon session, and Reynolds signed it into law soon after. Just days later, a Polk County district court judge issued a temporary injunction, blocking the law from being enforced while courts consider its constitutionality.\u00a0The enthusiasm of likely Republican caucusgoers for the law appears to contrast with the views of a majority of Iowans, according to a March Iowa Poll, when most Iowans said abortion should be legal in most or all cases.\u00a0Abortion providers in Iowa say the fetal heartbeat law, if enforced, would prohibit the vast majority of abortions in the state.\u00a0Currently, abortions are legal in Iowa until 20 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0Republican caucusgoers more supportive of fetal heartbeat law than Iowa adults in general\u00a0The March 2023 Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found that 61% of Iowans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases.\u00a0\u00a0Since September 2008, the percentage of Iowans supporting legal abortion has risen or remained the same in all but one Iowa Poll, in March 2020, climbing from a low of 48% to its peak in March 2023.\u00a0An October 2022 Iowa Poll asked specifically about a fetal heartbeat law: Forty-five percent of Iowans said they agreed with the law, while 49% disagreed. There was more support for the fetal heartbeat law among Republican respondents: 70%.\u00a0August poll respondent Gabe Haugland, a 39-year-old from Clear Lake and former member of the Iowa GOP's central committee, said he supports Iowa's law. He argued \"there needs to be some exceptions\" to allow for abortions in cases where the mother's life is in danger, and he was \"willing to have the discussion\" for victims of rape.\u00a0\u00a0\"I spent a lot of my adult life working for organizations like Caring Pregnancy Center, so this has always been an issue that's close to my heart,\" Haugland said.\u00a0Traci Stillwell, a 59-year-old poll respondent and hair salon owner from Hampton, said she thinks the law isn\u2019t restrictive enough, since she believes life begins at conception.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe any life should just be eliminated because it\u2019s inconvenient, or somebody didn\u2019t use their birth control, or they\u2019re promiscuous,\u201d Stillwell said.\u00a0Stillwell said she would support limited exceptions for \u201cvery, very unique situations\u201d where abortions are necessary to save a woman\u2019s life.\u00a0Michael Boettcher, a 34-year-old poll respondent from Clinton, said he thinks the fetal heartbeat law is too restrictive. He said the law doesn\u2019t give enough time for women to seek an abortion after discovering they are pregnant.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s put an unfair medical strain on females,\u201d he said.\u00a0Poll respondents differ on federal abortion policies as 2024 caucus nears\u00a0Some Republican presidential candidates applauded the passage of the new abortion restrictions in Iowa.\u00a0\u00a0A nonprofit founded by former Vice President Mike Pence spent about $25,000 on ads and texts encouraging Iowans to contact their lawmakers in support of the bill.\u00a0Vivek Ramaswamy visited the Iowa Capitol during the special session to meet with Republican legislators. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been quick to compare Iowa\u2019s law to a similar law he signed in Florida.\u00a0Many presidential candidates have also weighed in on a proposal to pass federal legislation to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions. Fifty-four percent of likely Republican caucusgoers in the new poll say they would be more likely rather than less likely to favor a candidate who supports the 15-week ban.\u00a0\u00a0Twenty-four percent say they would be less likely to support a candidate who favors a nationwide restriction, and 20% say it would not matter.\u00a0Stillwell, the hair salon owner who would support a near-total abortion ban in Iowa, said she believes states should decide the issue for themselves. She\u2019s a fan of former President Donald Trump, and she believes the president should be moral and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t want a nationwide abortion ban.\u00a0\u201cI just think our federal government needs to stay out of a lot of those personal things,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to stay out of our education, our health care, all of that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Haugland said he would support national abortion restrictions if Republicans in Congress can garner the support to pass them.\u00a0\"If the federal government determines through our elected leaders that in this country, we should not abort babies that are pretty well-developed at 14 weeks, then I'm fine with that,\" he said.\u00a0Galen Bacharier contributed reporting.\u00a0Katie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

Iowa Poll: Most GOP caucusgoers doubt Trump committed serious crimesAbout the Iowa Poll\u00a0The Iowa Poll, conducted Aug. 13-17, 2023, for The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 406 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2024 Republican caucuses.\u00a0Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 2,953 randomly selected voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\u00a0\u00a0Questions based on the sample of 406 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.\u00a0\u00a0Republishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.\u00a0View in new tabStaff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote Your Event Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Licensing & Reprints Promote your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper Archives MilestonesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.desmoinesregister.com.
