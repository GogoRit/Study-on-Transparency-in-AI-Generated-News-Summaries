She is one of hundreds of clients who receive aid each month from the pro-life center.

It will become a victim of rezoning, and it now needs financial help it move into and afford a new home.\u00a0\nIt provides counseling and referrals for medical services like sonograms as well as clothes and baby supplies \u2014 all for free.\n\u201cWe are living during RHA (New York state\u2019s Reproductive Health Act), and seeing more young women who are afraid,\u201d Cathy Donohoe, Bridge to Life\u2019s president, said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a strong pregnancy service network is all about \u2014 a number of pregnancy care centers that support one another, from housing and medical needs, to self-diagnosing and material assistance, which is what we do. We do whatever is needed, and we\u2019re not just pro-baby. We support the whole personhood from conception, no exceptions,\u201d she said.\nCathy Donohoe, president, and Francesca Yellico, executive director, in front of Bridge to Life\u2019s current headquarters in Flushing.\nFrancesca Yellico, Bridge to Life\u2019s executive director, understands the center\u2019s clients because she was once in their shoes: She had an unplanned pregnancy when she was 18 years old.\n\u201cAfter I had my baby, I remember being in my bedroom and just holding her, crying at the thought that I even contemplated [abortion] for a second. My daughter wouldn\u2019t be here. And I became more informed, started educating myself on the procedure \u2026 I thought, these poor girls; somebody\u2019s got to do something to help them. So I started volunteering as a counselor, and it changed the course of my life,\u201d Yellico said.\u00a0\n\u201cThat little girl, my daughter, who I once thought about aborting, is now pregnant with baby No. 3. Before she got pregnant, she was also volunteering as a counselor at the same place I used to,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s all about arming people with the truth.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Bridge to Life is a nonprofit that depends on donations. It is trying to help save the lives of the unborn in a city that\u2019s unofficially the abortion capital of the world.\nAccording to the data from Guttmacher Institute reported by Abort73.com, a pro-life site, 31 percent of pregnancies in New York state ended in abortion in 2017, the year for which the most recent data are available, and according to Guttmacher itself, the number of abortions per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the state in 2017 was just over 26, about double the national average.\nBridge to Life volunteers from the Queens Center for Progress. (Photo: Allyson Escobar)\nNew York\u2019s Reproductive Health Act, which was enacted in January 2019 by Gov. Andrew Cuomo expanded abortion rights in the state. The RHA allows abortions in the third trimester \u2014 past 24 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 if the fetus is deemed \u201cnot viable\u201d or the woman\u2019s life is at risk.\u00a0\nAlso, last year, New York City spent $250,000 to pay for low-income women to travel to the city from other states to obtain an abortion. Activists said that it was the first time a U.S. city allocated funds specifically for abortions, according to the New York Times.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWomen deserve better,\u201d Donohue said.\nDonate to help Bridge to Life on GoFundMe\u00a0or\u00a0Facebook.\n\n\nTags: abortion, Queens, The Bridge to Life, The Bridge to Life \u2013 Flushing Queens Login here to comment\nShare this article with a friend.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername or Email\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nRemember Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue with GoogleContinue with Facebook\n\n \n\n\nPrevious Diocesan News Story Next Diocesan News Story\n\n\n\t\t\t3 thoughts on \u201cBridge to Life Needs Help to Move\u201d\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Donohoe says: \n\nFebruary 25, 2020 at 1:13 pm \n\n\nThank you to Allyson Escobar and the staff at The Tablet for always having our back.

But why does this \u201csingle\u201d mother have THREE children?  I can see one, perhaps an accident, even two, but Three?!?!  C\u2019mon, when does it end.\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\nLiss Ferreira says: \n\nApril 6, 2022 at 7:17 pm \n\n\nForgive yourself for being so thoughtless. There are many reasons why a mother is single with three children. I will do you a favor by providing a few. Father probably died, became incarcerated, father became ill, domestic violence, fleeing violence from another country, mom is probably in process of getting child support but court process is beyond lengthy. Instead of opening your mouth to say thoughtless things why don\u2019t you use Google and ask the questions and do research .\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nYou must sign in to leave a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tablet Headlines Delivered Daily\n\n\n\nCatholic Headlines Widget Signup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\r\n        *\n\n\n\n\nYour email will be used to send you The Tablet newsletter.
