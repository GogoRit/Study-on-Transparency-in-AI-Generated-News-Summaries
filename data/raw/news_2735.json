His words represented an irresponsible dismissal of the threat of COVID.\u00a0His exhortation for a big crowd in the stands came after Florida lost to Texas A&M.\u00a0 Instead of blaming the loss on Florida\u2019s consistently poor defense in multiple games, Mullen feebly claimed that Texas A&M\u2019s crowd size made the difference in the game.\u00a0\u00a0While Mullen should be embarrassed and issuing apologies, I have not seen evidence of either.\u00a0Marshall Brass, West Palm Beach\u00a0Pro-life voter caresabout children, momsIn response to the\u00a0letter arguing that\u00a0\"pro-life\" voters shouldn't be tied to one party (Oct. 16), I would like to clarify. Voting with one's conscience and morals is what my privilege entails. I will vote for the person who aligns best with my views and who has accomplished things in his or her tenure in office.I have a clear choice.\u00a0As to the statement that I cannot be pro-life and not simultaneously care about that life and the child's health nutrition and education,\u00a0I can and do! I volunteer at a\u00a0women's outreach program and see women every day, helping them to keep their unborn babies by providing financial and emotional support. We provide free testing, ultrasound and proof of pregnancy forms, community resources for housing, free education classes, food assistance and car seats.Our generous donors at\u00a0Birthline\u00a0Lifeline help these moms by donating baby items used during the first year of the child's life.\u00a0Every three months they can come in for material assistance (formula, diapers, clothing, baby furniture). Our program is partially funded by the state of Florida, which\u00a0also cares about women's choices and the child's prenatal care and health through programs such as Medicaid.I am the voice of the voiceless in the womb who cannot vote...and I will always vote for the pro-life candidate.Phyllis Trainor, Boynton Beach\u00a0Trump acts like bullywho's mad that he's\u00a0losingTrump called Dr. Anthony Fauci, a world eminent physician, a \u201cdisaster and an idiot\" for his pandemic advice.Trump\u2019s behavior is like a childish schoolyard bully lashing out because his team is losing with one minute to go in the game.\u00a0He is behaving irrationally and libelous.We need an adult in the White House.Harriet\u00a0Pashman,\u00a0Jupiter\u00a0The Palm Beach Post is committed to publishing a diversity of opinion.
