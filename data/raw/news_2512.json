Plantation Democratic Sen. Lauren Book fronted the effort after reports\u00a0of\u00a0fertility doctors\u00a0using their own sperm to inseminate women who thought they were receiving sperm from a donor.\nWhen the bill goes into effect on July 1, it will be a third-degree felony to inseminate a women with genetic material she did not consent to. If that material belongs to the doctor himself, the offense becomes a second-degree felony.\n\u201cThe signing of this bill into law is a victory in the fight for women to have control over their own bodies,\u201d Book said in a statement. \u201cWomen seeking fertility treatment in Florida will now be protected from a group of predatory physicians who commit selfish narcissistic acts; and pelvic exams will now require specific consent, except in cases of emergency, finally halting the wholly inappropriate practice of unapproved pelvic exams on unconscious women \u2026 where at best, these exams have been wrongful learning experiences for medical students or at worst, the equivalent of a sexual assault.\u201d\nBook and her husband used IVF to help conceive.\n\u201cWe put our whole lives, a small fortune and complete faith and trust into the hands of a physician,\u201d Book said.\n\u201cOn my IVF journey, I learned that there are many, many good infertility doctors who do the right thing and work to do the best thing by their patients,\u201d she added. \u201cBut since that time, I\u2019ve come to learn about many others who have fallen prey to careless and even intentional harm inflicted in a largely unregulated industry.\u201d\nThe bill also explicitly requires consent before a pelvic examination is performed on a female patient at a hospital. Medical students routinely practice different types of exams on hospital patients, with the patient\u2019s consent.\nHowever, those consent forms\u00a0often don\u2019t elaborate on specifically which types of exams are approved. Book\u2019s legislation requires pelvic exams to be explicitly listed on a consent form.\nDuring the lower chamber\u2019s debate on the bill, House sponsor Rep. Evan Jenne\u00a0added a provision extending that ban \u2014 sans clear consent \u2014 to teaching doctors as well.\n\u201cWe were afraid that even though while it might stop medical students from doing it that you could still have this situation where a teaching doctor was performing a pelvic floor exam on an unconscious, unconsenting women while the medical students just stood there and watched, but it was still happening,\u201d Jenne said.\nThe law was one of several signed by the Governor Thursday, including Jordan\u2019s Law.\n___\nFlorida Politics reporter Ryan Nicol contributed to this report.\n\n Post Views: 855\n\n\n\n\n\nRenzo Downey\nRenzo Downey covers state government for Florida Politics.

Since Senate Bill 698\u2019s final passage in the Florida Legislature in mid-March, Florida Voice for the Unborn had been calling upon Governor DeSantis to veto it.\nSenate Bill 698, sponsored by pro-abortion state Senator Lauren Book (D \u2013 Plantation), sought to address the issue of unscrupulous fertility doctors using their own genetic material to impregnate female patients. While that is a noble aim, the bill also contained language that fundamentally violated the dignity of human life in its most vulnerable state, i.e. as a tiny zygote. \nFlorida Voice for the Unborn vehemently objected to Senate Bill 698 because it contained a novel definition of \u2018reproductive material.\u2019 As defined in the final version of the bill, \u2018reproductive material\u2019 is \u2018any human \u2018egg\u2019 or \u2018sperm\u2019 as those terms are defined in s. 742.13, or human zygote.\u2019 The next line of the bill then defined \u2018zygote\u2019 as \u2018a fertilized ovum.\u2019\nFlorida Voice for the Unborn\u2019s position is that a unique human being comes into existence at the moment of fertilization. As unique human beings, zygotes can never be considered the equivalent of \u2018sperm\u2019 and \u2018eggs\u2019 \u2014 and cannot be termed under the law as \u2018reproductive material.\u2019 Moreover, Senate Bill 698 contained additional troubling provisions, which were added in at the very last minute and implied that human embryos are not unique human beings but rather are \u2018things\u2019 that are in the possession of others.\nFor the past few months, Florida Voice for the Unborn had been sounding the alarm about Senate Bill 698, which was deeply flawed and agenda-driven from its inception. It was a trojan horse that sought to sneak anti-human life provisions into Florida law through the backdoor. Florida Voice for the Unborn\u2019s executive director wrote a formal letter to Governor DeSantis outlining the problems with Senate Bill 698 and requesting that he veto it. Additionally, over ninety (90) pro-life activists throughout Florida contacted Governor DeSantis about Senate Bill 698 via Florida Voice for the Unborn\u2019s website petition. Governor DeSantis\u2019 office shamefully ignored our pleas by failing to give us the courtesy of a response. \nGovernor DeSantis and Florida\u2019s Legislative leaders failed to live-up to their pro-life campaign commitments. On June 2, 2020, Florida Voice for the Unborn\u2019s executive director authored an article about Senate Bill 698, which was published on the website of the Society of St. Sebastian, a national pro-life public policy organization. In his article, entitled, \u2018Florida Senate Bill 698: A Trojan Horse,\u2019 our executive director exposed the dirty legislative tricks that were utilized to pass this flawed bill in Florida\u2019s pro-life majority Legislature. Governor DeSantis\u2019 last-minute, late-night approval of Senate Bill 698 is, sadly, more of the same shenanigans. It is simply not enough for elected officials to call themselves \u2018pro-life.\u2019 They must govern in a pro-life fashion, even when it is hard to do so. By signing Senate Bill 698 into law, Governor DeSantis betrayed the unborn. Florida Voice for the Unborn will not turn a blind eye to this betrayal and will be sure to inform as many Florida pro-life activists as possible about it \u2013 so that nothing like this happens again. \nFlorida Voice for the Unborn is a new grassroots Tallahassee-based lobbying group that only focuses on pro-life issues impacting the unborn. It is strictly independent, and its work is guided by faith in God\u2019s only Son, Jesus Christ. Florida Voice for the Unborn supports all peaceful efforts by elected officials and others to end abortion and save lives.
