The court had already allowed the administration\u2019s changes to begin taking effect while the government appealed those rulings.\nThe changes ban taxpayer-funded clinics in the Title X program from making abortion referrals, a restriction opponents characterize as a \u201cgag rule.\u201d They also prohibit clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers, which critics said would force many Title X providers to find new locations, undergo expensive remodels or shut down \u2014 reducing access to the program.\nWATCH: Trump becomes 1st sitting president to speak at anti-abortion rally\nAbortion is a legal medical procedure, but federal laws prohibit the use of Title X or other taxpayer funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the woman. Under Title X, a 1970 law designed to improve access to family planning services, federal money may not be used in programs \u201cwhere abortion is a method of family planning.\u201d\nAbortion rights supporters and opponents have argued over the decades whether counseling a patient about abortion or referring a patient to a different provider for an abortion violates that language. Abortion opponents and religious conservatives say Title X has long been used to indirectly subsidize abortion providers.\n\u201cCongress has long prohibited the use of Title X funds in programs where abortion is a method of family planning and (the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s) recent rule makes that longstanding prohibition a reality,\u201d U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Mollie Timmons said in a written statement celebrating the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to defend this vital rule against all challenges.\u201d\nMore than 20 states and several civil rights and health organizations challenged the rules in cases filed in Oregon, Washington and California. Judges in all three states blocked them from taking effect, with Oregon and Washington courts issuing nationwide injunctions. One judge called the new policy \u201cmadness\u201d and said it was motivated by \u201can arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women\u2019s health care than their providers.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood, which served 1.6 million of the 4 million patients who received care through Title X, has already left the program over the new rules, giving up about $60 million a year in federal funding. Title X patients also receive other medical care through the program, including breast and cervical cancer screenings and HIV testing.\nThe administration\u2019s new rules are a return to rules that were adopted in 1988 and subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1991 case Rust v. Sullivan. Under the Clinton administration, those rules were abandoned in favor of a requirement that the clinics provide neutral abortion counseling and referrals upon request.\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s majority opinion, by Judge Sandra Ikuta, stressed the Rust decision.\n\u201cIn light of Supreme Court approval of the 1988 regulations and our broad deference to agencies\u2019 interpretations of the statutes they are charged with implementing, plaintiffs\u2019 legal challenges to the 2019 rule fail,\u201d she wrote.\nREAD MORE: Number of abortions in U.S. falls to lowest since 1973\nFurther, she said, the so-called gag rule is no such thing: While providers may not make a referral for an abortion, they may discuss abortion with their patients.\nThe dissent, by Judge Richard Paez, argued that since the Rust decision, Congress had barred the Department of Health and Human Services from imposing rules \u201cthat frustrate patients\u2019 ability to access health care.\u201d He called the ruling a throwback to the \u201cpaternalism of the past.\u201d\n\u201cThe majority would return us to an older world, one in which a government bureaucrat could restrict a medical professional from informing a patient of the full range of health care options available to her,\u201d Paez wrote. \u201cFortunately, Congress has ensured such federal intrusion is no longer the law of the land.\u201d\nHe also said the rule violates the requirement that pregnancy counseling be neutral: \u201cBy its very terms, it requires a doctor to refer a pregnant patient for prenatal care, even if she does not want to continue the pregnancy, while gagging her doctor from referring her for abortion, even if she has requested specifically such a referral,\u201d he wrote.\nThe American Medical Association criticized the ruling as \u201cgovernment overreach and interference\u201d that prohibits frank conversations between physicians and their patients.\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that the government is telling physicians that they can treat this underserved population only if they promise not to discuss or make referrals for all treatment options,\u201d the AMA said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                U.S. President Donald Trump addresses thousands of anti-abortion activists at the 47th annual March for Life  in Washington, U.S., January 24, 2020.
