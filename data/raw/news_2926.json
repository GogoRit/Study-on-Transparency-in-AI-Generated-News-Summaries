(Photo: John Partipilo) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, our Constitution has set up a remarkably unique arrangement, a promise we make to one another about how we will consent to be governed. The words we often use to describe that arrangement are \u201cequal justice under law.\u201d For Christians, the promise echoes another most holy calling: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\nI had that second promise in mind when I adopted two disabled sons from China. Born just shy of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, I grew up in a church that emphasized adoption as part of the pro-life movement. It seemed natural before marrying the man of my dreams at a small Baptist college in Appalachia to imagine the family we would have, filled with children by both birth and adoption. Then infertility changed those plans.\u00a0\nWe pursued adoption with the prayers and support of our church community. Once we became parents, I found my vision of pro-life was no longer big enough. Adoption does not provide an instant \u201chappily ever after,\u201d because children are real people with very real traumas from losing birth families, living in institutional care, having no one person consistently present to mark all the firsts. My sons needed more from me.\nAs big as my love was, it had to grow. I had to set aside my expectations of motherhood and make room for understanding trauma\u2019s long-term impact, letting go of any illusion that I could direct my children\u2019s outcomes if I just tried hard enough.\nThose early parenting years were a blur of doctor\u2019s visits and surgeries at children\u2019s hospitals in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Sometimes we spent two or three months at one of those \u201chome away from home\u201d places for families of children with complicated stories that often didn\u2019t have easy answers or happy endings.\u00a0 Nearly every night, a handful of sleepless mothers found themselves in the family kitchen, emptying the dishwasher or baking muffins in a desperate late-night attempt at normalcy. I was in awe of the pregnant women I met during those years whose babies were diagnosed in utero with complex needs. One story in particular changed my life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAs an adoptive parent of children with disabilities, I met a woman at a Philadelphia hospital. She was pregnant with twins, and one was dying inside her. This woman was fighting for her children, hoping for a miracle, slowly coming to terms with the reality of one child\u2019s gradual demise. She felt alone, forgotten by God.  \n\n\nLauren had traveled a long way to Philadelphia to get help for her babies. Tall and thin, she was pregnant with twins. To her heart\u2019s grief, one was slowly dying. We sat up past midnight near the kitchen, quietly talking over mugs of hot tea. Her husband was back home with their young children, and she was desperate to talk about what was going on inside her. Aside from her doctor, I was the first person who had ever heard of her babies\u2019 condition. Her story was not new to me\u2014the same thing had happened to someone I love more than thirty years ago.\nBack in the late 80s, my loved one was in her third trimester, helpless as one twin expired. His death triggered a stroke in the other baby, stopping his brain from developing further. She refused abortion and carried both babies to term, one dead and one living, risking her own life. The surviving twin defied doctors\u2019 expectations, and his mother fought through every one of his surgeries to keep him alive and as comfortable as possible for thirty years, despite one medical challenge after another. We loved him deeply.\nThree decades later, Lauren had different options. The children\u2019s hospital had found that if the dying twin was aborted shortly before it passed, a stroke could be averted, the surviving twin\u2019s brain would continue developing, and he and his mother\u2019s life would be spared the risk of deadly infection. Lauren was heartbroken. She wanted both babies.\nOnce again, I found my definition of \u201cpro-life\u201d needed expanding. This woman was fighting for her children, hoping for a miracle, slowly coming to terms with the reality of one child\u2019s gradual demise. She felt alone, forgotten by God. What could I do but listen, remind her that she was a good mother, and weep with her? How could I not pray for her to survive the paradox within her, one life failing as the other grew?\nIn those cold silent nights when sleep forgot me, I grieved with this woman and felt the weight of her choice, the chance she had to give one child a life that my loved one could not provide years ago for her surviving son, no matter how brave she was. I began to realize how many women in my life have lost a child\u2014miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, adoption, cancer, abortion, accident\u2014I, the infertile one, am the exception.\nI wonder what it looks like to truly love my neighbor, how that\u00a0 might expand the vision I once recognized as pro-life. As Tennessee\u2019s abortion trigger ban law goes into effect this week, making every single abortion a felony with no exceptions, I can\u2019t help but think it\u00a0 is the opposite of an ethic that truly values life. To me, that ethic\u00a0 means sitting with the grieving in the small hours. It means we respect\u00a0 and trust women with the complexities of decisions surrounding their health care, honor birth parents, affirm adoptees, and center foster youth.\u00a0\nLooking back at Lauren\u2019s story, where her difficult and heartbreaking decision gave her surviving twin the best possible chance at life, I realize if she were in Tennessee now, the law would not even allow her\u00a0 that choice. Lauren\u2013and every mother who faces nonviable pregnancy or the choice they never wanted to make\u2013deserve policies that \u00a0 protect their lives while recognizing the law\u2019s limits to constrain medical complexity and human privacy. \n\nIf we aspire to support a truly \u201cpro-life\u201d ethic, then we must commit to taking responsibility for safeguarding the lives that are here now. Being \u201cfor\u201d life means supporting the flourishing of all children and expanding our vision to see God\u2019s holy image in all\u00a0people. We cannot disregard that truth to further a political agenda. That bold arrangement requires our utmost care.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\u201cPro-life\u201d Christians must answer the call: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d\nby Anna Caudill, Tennessee Lookout August 25, 2022\n\u201cPro-life\u201d Christians must answer the call: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d\nby Anna Caudill, Tennessee Lookout August 25, 2022\n In the United States, our Constitution has set up a remarkably unique arrangement, a promise we make to one another about how we will consent to be governed.
