The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her replacement with conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett jeopardizes the future of Roe v. Wade. A SCOTUS ruling made it harder for women to access birth control under employers who oppose contraceptives. And some states used COVID-19 as an excuse to ban abortion procedures.In the same year, calls for decriminalizing sex work became more fervent, heightening the importance of women, trans, and nonbinary individuals making their own sexual decisions. The trade has resulted in the arrest and abuse of nearly 40 percent of Black and multiracial, trans-identifying individuals who participate. Although an estimated one million Americans are reliant on it to survive, a misogynistic stigma keeps us from making substantial change. But this increase in advocacy proves that there\u2019s a public desire to defend one\u2019s sexual freedom.But while societal and governmental attempts to suppress women's rights and police their bodies continue in real life, artists responded by expressing femininity and sexuality in pop culture and on screens, big and small. It\u2019s refreshing and important to see women reclaiming their power in the music, television, and film industries, where themes of equality, choice, consent, pleasure, and accountability thrive. This year, songs like \u201cWAP,\u201d shows like I May Destroy You, and films like Never Rarely Sometimes Always have provided radical sociopolitical commentary, forcing people to listen, watch, and make necessary changes.Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion break boundaries with \"WAP.\"View full post on YoutubeThe chart-topping, jaw-dropping anthem \u201cWAP\u201d by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, in which the ladies trade bars about what they require in the bedroom, became a cultural behemoth this summer. Despite countless rap songs throughout history by women and men alike discussing their down and dirty sexual desires, \u201cWAP\u201d is in a class of its own, taking an overt approach that leaves nothing to the imagination right out of the gate. (\u201cBeat it up, n***a, catch a charge / Extra large and extra hard,\u201d Cardi demands.)Other hip-hop and R&B stars like City Girls and Doja Cat, Mulatto, and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko also released tracks boasting their sexual power in 2020 (\u201cPu$$y Talk,\u201d \u201cOn God,\u201d and \u201cPussy Fairy (OTW),\u201d respectively). On her turn as \u201cB\u201d in the \u201cSavage\u201d remix, Beyonc\u00e9 spits a bar about OnlyFans, a subscription-based service website praised by Assistant Professor of Sociology at Hollins University Jennifer Turner \u201cas a means for women to own their sexuality, to make a living, to supplement their income, and so forth.\u201d Black women\u2019s loud and proud ownership of their bodies may be threatening to some, but women on the mic couldn\u2019t care less. This year, pleasure won over politeness.Ariana Grande releases 'positions' and Dua Lipa calls out double standards.View full post on YoutubeOutside of the rap sector, Ariana Grande displayed her sexual power and liberation in her latest album, positions, with tracks like the innuendo-filled \u201c34+35,\u201d and the straightforward \u201cnasty.\u201d Dua Lipa\u2019s Grammy-nominated LP Future Nostalgia features tunes such as the bouncy romp \u201cGood in Bed\u201d and the emphatic \u201cBoys Will Be Boys,\u201d which shows the double standards between men and women when it comes to topics ranging from self-sufficiency to street harassment. (\u201cWe hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths,\u201d she sings, adding, \u201cWe smile away to ease the tension, so it don\u2019t go south.\u201d) As leaders of pop music\u2019s new school, Grande taking a firm hold of her sexuality and Lipa calling out society\u2019s shortcomings empowers listeners to do the same.Fiona Apple speaks up for sexual assault survivors on \"For Her.\"View full post on YoutubeOn the rage-filled \"For Her,\" a track from Fiona Apple's critically acclaimed Fetch the Bolt Cutters, the singer-songwriter speaks for those who know what it\u2019s like to not have control of their bodies. Inspired by Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, Apple shares the harrowing experiences of a fellow survivor who\u2019s unable to tell her story. Apple told The New Yorker that her album is about \u201cnot being afraid to speak,\u201d and in this track, she tells the truth for people who might not be ready to say it themselves.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowP-Valley celebrates the female gaze. Jessica MiglioWhen it comes to sexual empowerment, the first season of Starz\u2019s P-Valley provided audiences with a peek into the world of Southern strip clubs through the female gaze. Created by Katori Hall, the series bucked stereotypes, celebrating Black, female physical power. Each episode was directed by a woman and shot in a way that captures the sheer strength and sexuality of the dancers down at The Pynk, the series\u2019 central strip club, without objectifying them. Through powerful storylines, the personal and professional lives of these working women prove that there is more to these establishments than meets the eye, setting a new precedent for how women\u2019s stories can be portrayed.I May Destroy You dissects rape culture.HBOScreenwriter and actress Michaela Coel transformed her experience with sexual assault into an empathetic journey to healing with her HBO drama, I May Destroy You. The series centers on Arabella, played by Coel, who attempts to put the pieces of her foggy memory together after being drugged and raped during a night out. \u201cThe whole show deals with that moment where consent was stolen from you and you lost the moment where you had agency to make a decision,\u201d Coel told BBC News. \u201cWe need to be kinder to ourselves a bit more and forgive ourselves for the times when we didn\u2019t say no loud enough.\u201d I May Destroy You proves it\u2019s integral that those who have been hurt grant themselves peace\u2014that healing takes time and self-forgiveness.Mrs. America includes Gloria Steinem's abortion. FX/HuluFX and Hulu\u2019s Mrs. America explored bodily agency through the lens of reproductive freedom while highlighting the movements surrounding the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972. The second episode covered the real-life experience of feminist icon Gloria Steinem (portrayed by Rose Byrne) getting an illegal abortion at the age of 22, which fueled her decades-long advocacy for legal, safe access to the procedure.\u201cHow many more women are going to die from botched abortions while we wait for men to feel comfortable with us having control over our own bodies?\u201d Byrne's Steinem asked in the episode, titled simply \u201cGloria.\u201d Though it\u2019s set in the 1970s, Mrs. America\u2019s topical look at gender equality, choice, and even voting rights resonates strongly today.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowPromising Young Woman challenges viewers to believe women. Merie Weismiller WallaceEmerald Fennell\u2019s forthcoming Promising Young Woman picks apart rape culture with dark humor. Even the title cheekily references a high-profile sexual assault case; in 2016, Stanford swimmer-turned-convicted rapist Brock Turner was often referred to by the media as a \u201cpromising young man.\u201dThe film, which will have its major release on Christmas Day, follows a woman\u2019s nonviolent vengeance on would-be sexual aggressors who try to take advantage of her when they believe she\u2019s drunk. Fennell challenges her audience\u2019s thoughts surrounding sexual misconduct allegations: Can accused assaulters be innocent if they\u2019re \u201cone of the good guys\u201d? Is a woman ever \u201casking for it\u201d? Promising Young Woman challenges the tendency to excuse deplorable behavior over believing women\u2019s stories.Never Rarely Sometimes Always exposes the realities of abortion access.Angal FieldA woman\u2019s power to choose is also explored in Never Rarely Sometimes Always, directed by Eliza Hittman. The Sundance Film Festival favorite follows pregnant Pennsylvanian teen Autumn as she travels to New York, to get an abortion without parental consent. Over the course of her trip, she muses about past choices and thinks about how her decision to get an abortion has the power to change her future.Hittman told Polygon that she wanted to speak directly to young women and explore the political issue of female autonomy through \u201can intimate lens.\u201d By depicting Autumn\u2019s long, emotional, and physical journey to obtain an abortion, the director reveals the many real-life challenges women must face to safely access the procedure, evoking empathy from viewers while also making the case for better abortion access.\u2015Women in entertainment throughout 2020 proved that the radical power of autonomy and healing is revolutionary, and that empowerment, awareness, and acceptance is possible. While shows, songs, and movies highlighted what is attainable when it comes to feminine freedom and agency, it\u2019s important to take these examples and work toward making changes in ourselves, our communities, and our governments. Only then can we create a better future for women everywhere.J'na JeffersonJ\u2019na Jefferson is a journalist and creative from Brooklyn by way of the Jersey\u00a0Shore.
