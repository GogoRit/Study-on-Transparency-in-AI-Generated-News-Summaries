That removed a major hurdle to enforcing the ban Republicans approved last summer ahead of a wave of restrictions by conservative states in response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade.In a 4-1 decision Monday, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its order that Planned Parenthood and other health care providers \u201ccannot show a reasonable likelihood of success\u201d with their challenge to the abortion restrictions. \n\nThe ACLU of Indiana\u2019s executive director, Jane Henegar, released a statement saying Monday was \u201ca dark day in Indiana\u2019s history.\u201d\u201cWe have seen the horrifying impact of bans like this across the country, and the narrow exceptions included in this extreme ban will undoubtedly put Hoosiers\u2019 lives at risk. ... Every person should have the fundamental freedom to control their own body and politicians\u2019 personal opinions should play no part in this personal decision,\u201d Henegar\u2019s statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge approves new murder charges against man in case of slain Indiana teens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Gov.

We defeated the pro-death advocates who try to interject their views in a state that clearly voted for life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana\u2019s Republican-backed ban ends most abortions in the state, even in the earliest stages of a pregnancy. Indiana became the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court ended nearly a half-century of federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022.Indiana\u2019s six abortion clinics stopped providing abortions late last month ahead of the ban officially taking effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
