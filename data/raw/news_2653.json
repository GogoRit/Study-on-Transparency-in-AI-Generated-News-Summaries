The right to life of the unborn, our treatment of migrants and refugees, the promotion of racial justice, the abolition of the death penalty, promoting peace, and opposing euthanasia are fundamental and necessary Catholic teachings.\n\n\n\nWe must uphold the sanctity of human life. That\u2019s the thread that runs through all these life issues. This has been echoed by at least the last three popes, as well as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n\n\nMy number one job right now is as a mother. The pandemic has brought the importance of this job to the absolute forefront of my life. I am quarantined with my five children, ages 7 to 16. I think of the old saying, \u201cit takes a village to raise a child.\u201d Now I feel like I am the entire village!\n\n\n\nIn the past, especially after my book was published, people would say to me, \u201cWow, FIVE kids! Are you crazy? How do you do it? You must be a SUPERMOM!\u201d The truth is, I had a lot of help. My kids went to school all day. This meant someone else fed them lunch and cleaned up after them. I had a housekeeper to constantly help me with organizing, vacuuming, wiping, and laundry. The kids had friends, playdates, sports, plays, and other extracurricular activities where all I had to do was sign a permission slip or go to an occasional conference or parents\u2019 night. On top of that, I\u2019d say \u201cdo your homework!\u201d occasionally.Advertisement\nNow I am praying to God to help me keep the whole thing together without losing my mind. For the first time in my motherhood I feel like \u201cYes, I actually have five children! Am I crazy?\u201d\n\n\n\nBut complaining aside, it has been wonderful to be able to be so close to my family, to be so involved in their schoolwork and their lives, and to hear their voices loudly and clearly (sometimes too loudly). During this time, we have been devastated by our country\u2019s reaction to this national crisis.\n\n\n\nChildren are smart. They know a bully when they see one.\nUntil recently, our family had not really been engaged in politics, and we always taught our kids to be the change they wanted to see. In other words, if they see that homelessness is a problem in our neighborhood, let\u2019s organize a coat drive or volunteer at a soup kitchen. If they are bothered by inequality, that\u2019s a call to do something about it\u2014find a way to advocate for those who are not being treated with dignity. When we want to protect unborn children, we\u2019ll volunteer at a shelter for women.Advertisement\nIn the past, we did not get deep into public policy with our kids or talk about how the nuances of the Catholic faith relate to the Democratic and Republican parties. Over the past few months, however, it has overwhelmed our lives.\n\n\n\nChildren are smart. They know a bully when they see one. They are on TikTok and Instagram, and every day they see the divisive, hate-filled, openly racist speeches; reckless Tweeting and name calling; constant lying; corruption; nepotism; adultery; sexual assault allegations; and the endless hypocritical behavior by the candidate who supposedly stands up for Christian values.\n\n\n\nIn the face of this, is the correct response really just to look our children in the eye and say, \u201cBut what about abortion?\u201d Do any of us want our children to grow up in an America that is barely democratic with a government they cannot trust? We are in grave danger of heading there.\n\n\n\nI had a vision of raising children who were proud to be Catholic and proud to be American. Sadly, that vision has become blurrier. But I have hope. I believe that this is the right time for Joe Biden.Advertisement\nEvery life is equally important, and we must work to protect and respect every human life. It is essential for Catholics to embrace a consistent ethic of life in order to truly and honestly separate ideology (a worldview that is based upon supporting a political party or candidate) from faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Faithful Catholics obey the church and the inspired leadership of Pope Francis, who we believe was chosen by the Holy Spirit to lead us as the successor of St. Peter.\n\n\n\nI had a vision of raising children who were proud to be Catholic and proud to be American. Sadly, that vision has become blurrier. But I have hope. I believe that this is the right time for Joe Biden.\nIntentionally taking a human life\u2014whether it\u2019s through abortion, assisted suicide, unjust war, or the death penalty\u2014is against Catholic teaching. You can\u2019t cherry-pick and say one life is more valuable than another. In the same way, the church teaches that there is a necessary connection between the right to life and the right to the quality and dignity of life.\n\n\n\nMany Catholics often say that the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d among us are in the most need of protection in our society. I agree, but the most vulnerable are not just the unborn. This also includes the most powerless among us after they are born: the refugee, the undocumented immigrant, the child separated from their parents, the homeless, the hungry, the unemployed, and many other vulnerable people in our society.Advertisement\nFurthermore, racism is a grave injustice that leads people to devalue God\u2019s children based on the color of their skin. Everyone is created in God\u2019s image and viewing anyone\u2019s life as somehow less important because of their race is a serious evil. Therefore, racism is clearly a life issue, an intrinsic moral evil, and an abomination in the eyes of God.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is a rhetorical tactic being pushed by some people in the church that is very difficult for faithful Catholics to argue against. Whenever we try to bring up these other teachings\u2014which are right there in the gospel, the catechism, and the teachings of the popes going back centuries\u2014they are dismissed as less important because abortion outweighs them all.Advertisement\n\n\n\nMany Catholics often say that the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d among us are in the most need of protection in our society. I agree, but the most vulnerable are not just the unborn.\nPeople will argue that the slaughter of millions of innocent unborn lives must be the preeminent issue because they are under a clear and present threat. They will point out that God has created unborn children with no power to defend themselves. For this reason, they need all our attention. These other things all can be \u201cworked out\u201d eventually, but people will argue that we can\u2019t deal with them now because this other issue is an emergency. \u201cYou can\u2019t have human rights if you are not allowed to be born,\u201d they will say.Advertisement\n\n\n\nWhen proponents of this line of defense use statements like \u201cYou support infanticide,\u201d it\u2019s a pretty easy way to shut down any concern for other life issues because\u2014they will ask\u2014what else can be as important as defending innocent babies? The problem is that by putting on blinders to all the other life issues\u2014the causes that lead people to seek abortions\u2014are ignored. Faithful Catholics who want to address these causes are demonized, vilified, and labeled as being somehow \u201cless Catholic\u201d than single-issue Catholics.\n\n\n\nThis begins to look like idolatry when the idea of ending abortion is raised to such importance that it is almost worshiped in and of itself. There is no consideration of how it is connected to other life issues, and other grave and urgent moral issues fade into the background and end up being dismissed as unimportant.\n\n\n\nI believe that since Catholics are called to support protection of the right to life of every unborn child by civil law, logically (and morally) this idea cannot stop at birth. We have a civic obligation to add \u201cquality of life\u201d to the \u201cright to life\u201d and to strive to provide health care, nutrition, housing, employment, and fair taxation policies to all our citizens.\n\n\n\nIt is disingenuous to call for a compassionate society to protect the lives of the unborn without backing this up with compassionate programs for the born, through public policy.Advertisement\nNow here we are at the election, and I must vote.\n\n\n\nIt is disingenuous to call for a compassionate society to protect the lives of the unborn without backing this up with compassionate programs for the born, through public policy.\nMy faith impacts everything I do. As a Catholic and a believer in the gospel, I am called to make choices that serve the common good. That includes when I participate in our political system. The church teaches that we must take our vote seriously and discern, in light of Catholic social teaching, which candidates and ballot measures will best advance the common good. This is a big responsibility, and we must inform our consciences and spend a lot of time in prayer when making this decision.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, we Catholics play a significant role in national politics, but we certainly shouldn\u2019t be under the illusion that ours is a Catholic society. All groups\u2014Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, nonbelievers, atheists, and people from many other faiths and belief systems\u2014take part in our political process.\n\n\n\nWe have a de-facto two-party system in the United States. That\u2019s just the way it is. The only two real options for president this year are Trump the Republican and Biden the Democrat. One of them will win. Neither candidate runs on a platform that is fully in line with Catholic teaching.\n\n\n\nWe do have the option of casting a vote for a third-party or write-in candidate whose platform lines up more closely with our own beliefs, which might allow us to walk home from the polls feeling great about how we were able to participate in our democracy while remaining completely faithful to our principles. In fact, I remember when the late great Mother Angelica of EWTN once said she wrote in \u201cJesus Christ\u201d on her ballot.\n\n\n\nMy faith impacts everything I do. As a Catholic and a believer in the gospel, I am called to make choices that serve the common good.\nWhile it was funny\u2014and I can totally understand her reasons\u2014casting a vote for a candidate who has no chance of winning is not grounded in reality. For me, this would be an individualistic, self-serving choice. If I truly want to participate in this election, I am left with a choice between two candidates.Advertisement\nJoe Biden is the candidate for the Democratic Party. In recent years, the Democratic Party has moved farther and farther to the left on the issue of abortion and has wound up with an extremely radical platform. They have pushed for relaxing restrictions on abortion as well as taxpayer funding for it. This represents a huge conflict with what the Catholic Church teaches about the right to life of the unborn.\n\n\n\nOver the years, the pressure of this extreme position has likely influenced Joe Biden\u2019s political (but probably not his personal) views on abortion. Based on this alone, it is easy to understand why some Catholics conclude that they can\u2019t vote for a Democrat, even if I believe Biden\u2019s platform does a better job of addressing every other social justice issue I\u2019ve mentioned.\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that the legality of abortion and the demand for abortion are two different things. The number of abortions goes down when social programs are put in place that compassionately address the reasons why women consider abortion. This might explain, in part, why the number of abortions drops significantly when mothers have access to social services and health care, while the abortion rate has risen under President Trump.\n\n\n\nWhatever the causes, if we are concerned about reducing the number of abortions, it would be beneficial to study this data rather than simply siding with the candidate whose party\u2019s platform simply uses language more in line with Catholic teaching.\n\n\n\nAs a Catholic, I believe that life issues begin with the family.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d platform. Although Trump has said he is \u201cthe most pro-life president in history,\u201d and he has made a committed (and arguably successful) effort to appoint conservative justices who will have a significant impact on this country for years to come, as Catholic voters we owe it to ourselves to look at the big picture.\n\n\n\nLook at the pandemic. The Trump administration\u2019s inability to come up with a well-coordinated response to COVID has contributed to the deaths of almost 250,000 Americans. This number is growing with absolutely no end in sight. The administration made it clear that they are not going to take an active role in stopping it. We know, based on empirical data, that the majority of deaths have been the elderly, those with preexisting health conditions, and\u2014at alarmingly high rates\u2014people of color and the poor.\n\n\n\nThere is a video from one of President Trump\u2019s recent rallies, where he said the virus \u201caffects virtually nobody\u201d! As a Catholic, I could not help but recall Pope Francis\u2019s warning against a \u201cthrowaway culture,\u201d where we do not value every human life equally.Advertisement\nSystemic racism is another life issue that is poisoning our culture. Donald Trump clearly is not bothered by systemic racism. We have seen Black men and women die with our own eyes, and we can only imagine how Black parents fear for the lives of their children as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s indifference to centuries of racial oppression. Trump has dismissed calls for change and has referred to demonstrators and movements such as Black Lives Matter as dangerous Marxist uprisings. How is this pro-life?\n\n\n\nDonald Trump wants to eliminate Obamacare, leaving millions of Americans without health care coverage. This is not pro-life.\n\n\n\nAs a Catholic, I believe that life issues begin with the family. Let\u2019s look at the Trump administration\u2019s policies for families, such as the separation of thousands of refugee children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Over 500 of these children have still not been reunited with their parents. A truly pro-life, pro-family administration would drop everything right now to fix this crisis. Instead, the Trump administration is trying to find damning emails about Joe Biden\u2019s son on a mysterious laptop. At the same time, the president is traveling around the country holding huge, in-person \u201csuper-spreader\u201d rallies in order to drum up voter support from his base. This is not pro-life.\n\n\n\nAs a Catholic who believes in a consistent ethic of life, I cannot in good conscience vote for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in its current form. I fundamentally disagree with the claim that this party is \u201cpro-life.\u201d\nLet\u2019s look at the environment. Pope Francis has repeatedly taught that destroying the environment is a sin. God has entrusted care for creation to us. Air, water, and soil sustain us. Care for creation is a life issue. Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to address climate change is making the Earth less inhabitable. This will inevitably lead to more poverty and more death. This is not pro-life.\n\n\n\nAs a Catholic who believes in a consistent ethic of life, I cannot in good conscience vote for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in its current form. I fundamentally disagree with the claim that this party is \u201cpro-life.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt would be fair to call them \u201canti-abortion,\u201d but this worldview is certainly not \u201cpro-life.\u201d In fact, I wonder if the label itself has become so corrupted by ideologies and politics that Catholics and others who truly want to build a culture of life and who believe in a consistent life ethic might want to consider adopting a new label. After so many years of manipulation, lies, and hypocrisy, I worry that the term \u201cpro-life\u201d has become compromised beyond repair.\n\n\n\nThere are many life issues I believe will be addressed in a Biden administration. Over the past month, I have met many faithful Catholics in different organizations who are asking the same questions of the Biden campaign. I have confidence that the new administration will provide a platform for Catholic voices in an unprecedented way.Advertisement\nClearly, we can take a look at the statistics that show that the abortion rate will decrease with the types of social programs that Joe Biden supports, which means that this will actually save lives. In that sense, there already is a pro-life voice in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden\u2019s proposed policies will give women more alternatives to abortion, including adoption programs, access to pre- and post-natal care, and access to family income support. He has also proposed concrete plans for affordable health care, child care, and quality education. He supports policies for job training for women, equal pay for the work they do, and paid family leave. These are all pro-life, pro-dignity and quality of life, and pro-family programs that I can get behind.\n\n\n\nWe know that during the Obama administration that the abortion rate fell by 27 percent. I am confident that a Joe Biden administration can improve on that.\nWe know that during the Obama administration that the abortion rate fell by 27 percent. I am confident that a Joe Biden administration can improve on that. Reducing the number of actual abortions is the end goal for me, and it outweighs the idea of pro-life. As I have mentioned before, Trump can say he\u2019s pro-life, but when he cuts social programs abortions go up. That\u2019s just a fact.\n\n\n\nBut is there room for faithful, pro-life Catholics in the Democratic Party?\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is true that the Democratic Party views abortion as a health care issue and primarily an issue of the rights and dignity of women while largely ignoring the baby\u2019s right to life. Right now, the party is not an ideal home for a pro-life Catholic who believes that abortion is always immoral. The party can be a lonely place for a strongly pro-life Catholic, but there is indeed a place for us.\n\n\n\nI look to heroic pro-life Democrats like Louisiana State Senator Katrina Jackson, who passionately advocates for voting rights for convicted felons, supports gun control, is working to abolish the death penalty, and supports increasing the state\u2019s minimum wage. These are positions shared by the most liberal Democrats in the party. At the same time, she was a speaker at the 2020 March for Life in Washington, D.C., and she has pushed for legislation tightening restrictions on abortion in her state. Senator Jackson has earned respect from both sides of the aisle, and she is a glowing example of a passionate pro-lifer having a place in the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nOne of my most profound takeaways from Pope Francis\u2019 most recent\u2014and in my opinion, most powerful\u2014encyclical, Fratelli Tutti (On Fraternity and Social Friendship), is that the world is passing up a great opportunity to build solidarity as we face this global pandemic as a global community. Countries with vastly different governments, religious traditions, races, and creeds have a chance to unite to stop a common enemy: COVID-19.\n\n\n\nIf we as a global community can see the possibility of healing this world by joining hands despite our differences, how much easier might it be to try to work together as a country?Advertisement\nAfter the pandemic, we have another opportunity\u2014to rebuild our world together and work to fix all the problems that this crisis has exposed. If we as a global community can see the possibility of healing this world by joining hands despite our differences, how much easier might it be to try to work together as a country?\n\n\n\nThe current administration\u2019s tactics have done nothing but divide us into tribes or sides. The current climate of doubling down on our ideologies is beginning to threaten our very lives. That is the ultimate life issue because it is all the life issues. It\u2019s time for a change and it\u2019s time to rebuild our country and our church for our children.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why, with a crystal-clear conscience, I can happily say that I mailed in my ballot for Joe Biden. \n\n\n\n\nImage: Chris Hardy on Unsplash\n\nTagsCatholic social teaching Family Parenting Politics \n\n \n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\nJeannie Gaffigan\r\n\t\t\tJeannie Gaffigan is an actress, producer, writer, philanthropist, mother of five, and all around comedic force.
