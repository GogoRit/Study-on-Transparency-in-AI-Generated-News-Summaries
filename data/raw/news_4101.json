With no public transport available, clinics closed and Bhubaneswar at a standstill, she bought an abortion pill without consulting a doctor. While what she did was not unusual, Indian law requires a prescription for the pills from a licensed medical professional.Gupta was not prepared for what was to come. She bled for hours and was in intense pain. Panicking, she called Hidden Pockets, a reproductive health counselling helpline.\u201cIt was a pretty scary situation,\u201d says the helpline\u2019s founder, Jasmine Lovely George, who talked Gupta through the termination. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary if you\u2019ve been bleeding for hours and nobody has counselled you. You\u2019re in a lot of pain and you don\u2019t know what is happening to you.\u201dIn the past three months, calls to the hotline from women unable to access contraception, buy pregnancy tests or get an abortion have quadrupled.The coronavirus pandemic has put huge strain on India\u2019s health system, and women\u2019s reproductive rights have taken a particular hit. Travel restrictions, the diversion of public healthcare towards Covid-19, the closure of private clinics and disruptions in medical supply chains have meant that women have been unable to receive timely care.The Foundation for Reproductive Health Services India (FRHS), an affiliate of Marie Stopes International, estimates lockdown disruption could leave 25.6 million couples unable to access contraception, leading to an additional 2.3 million unintended pregnancies and 834,042 unsafe abortions.Unsafe abortions are the third leading cause of maternal deaths in India.When the Indian government imposed lockdown on 25 March, with only four hours warning, reproductive health was not among the essential services allowed to continue. It was only after a group of doctors and activists appealed to the health ministry that the government added it to the list on 14 April.However, since lockdown most public hospitals have been converted into Covid-19 treatment centres, and have diverted their limited resources and staff to coping with the virus. Many private clinics had to shut down because of transport shortages and a lack of protective equipment. India\u2019s nearly 900,000 accredited community health workers who previously focused on reproductive health and distributed contraceptives have been redeployed to Covid-19 duties.Parivar Seva Sanstha, a reproductive health organisation, was forced to close 31 clinics that provided family planning and abortion services. Although clinics are gradually reopening, Dr Alok Banerjee, a technical adviser at the organisation, says \u201cthere was no public transportation. Most of our clients travel from rural areas and are not able to come.\u201dThe attitude is \u2013 there is a crisis happening and you want to talk about condoms?Suchitra Dalvie, Asia Safe Abortion PartnershipSome women who have tried to travel have been harassed by police.\u201cOnly if someone looks seriously ill, the police lets them travel to see a doctor,\u201d says Ajitha Suhalka, a nurse-midwife who works at a community health centre in rural Rajasthan. \u201cIf a woman looks normal and healthy, she finds it hard to explain that she wants an abortion at a police checkpoint.\u201d On a few occasions, Suhalka\u2019s colleagues have picked up women on their own motorcycles and brought them to the clinic.Since lockdown has eased, rural clinics have reported an increase in the number of women coming to them with complications from taking abortion pills without medical supervision, or visiting unqualified doctors. \u201cWomen are taking abortion drugs by themselves without understanding the dosage, procedure,\u201d says Banerjee. \u201cThen they are coming to us with incomplete abortions, with a dead foetus inside.\u201d About 60% of cases at Parivar Seva Sanstha\u2019s clinics are now related to post-abortion complications.Medical supply chains have also been hit by the ban on inter-state travel and the closure of factories producing family planning products.The termination of a pregnancy using pills is allowed in the first seven weeks, after which a surgical procedure is recommended. Under Indian law, abortion is legal up to 20 weeks, except in cases involving rape, incest or a minor, when it can be extended to 24 weeks. After that special permission is needed from the courts. Many Indian women are unaware that abortion within 20 weeks is legal.Indian girl allowed abortion amid claims doctors \u2018afraid to help\u2019 child rape victimsRead more\u201cThere are women with unwanted pregnancies who were stuck at home, planning to visit a doctor once the lockdown eases,\u201d says Dr Nupur Gupta, director for obstetrics and gynaecology at the Fortis Memorial Research Institute, in Gurugram, one of Delhi\u2019s satellite cities. \u201cNow either they have to have surgical abortions, or if they have crossed that stage they will go to a quack, or continue with an unplanned pregnancy.\u201dThe additional precautions clinics are required to take to prevent Covid-19 are expected to increase the cost of abortion services and could impact women\u2019s decisions to seek care. \u201cAll of these additional costs will have to be borne by the patient at a time when a lot of people are losing their livelihoods,\u201d says Dr Suchitra Dalvie, coordinator for Asia Safe Abortion Partnership, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive rights. \u201cOut of desperation people will definitely try unsafe methods.\u201dGeorge says that in India there is \u201ca disdain for sexual and reproductive health. The attitude is \u2013 there is a crisis happening and you want to talk about condoms?\u201dShe adds: \u201cWho takes the brunt of it. It\u2019s always women.\u201d* Not her real nameExplore more on these topicsReproductive rightsWomen's rights and gender equalityIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
