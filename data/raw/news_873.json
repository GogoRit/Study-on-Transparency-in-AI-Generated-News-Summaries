The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asked the Texas Supreme Court to weigh in on a question of state law before the appeals court proceeds with its own ruling in the case.\nThe law, passed as Senate Bill 8, is designed to evade judicial review, a goal at which it has so far been successful. It specifically precludes state officials from enforcing it, instead deputizing private citizens to bring civil lawsuits against anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawyers representing the abortion providers are trying to prove that the state itself actually will enforce the law, which would open a legal window for them to seek an injunction on some aspects of the law. They argued that the law is enforced by court clerks who docket the lawsuits, judges who hear them, the attorney general and others.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court threw out most of those arguments in a December ruling that allowed the law to remain in effect. The justices did allow one question to proceed, over whether state medical licensing officials play a role in enforcing the law.\nThose agencies would potentially be responsible for disciplining or revoking the licenses of doctors, nurses and pharmacists who violate the law; an injunction would stop them from doing so, but would leave the crux of the law in place.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court threw this question back to the lower federal courts. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then threw it to the Texas Supreme Court for an interpretation of state law, a move the abortion providers decried as adding unnecessary delays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone argued that there was no \u201cordinary English interpretation that entertains any possibility of public enforcement.\u201d\nThe justices questioned whether doctors might be obligated by the rules of the state\u2019s medical licensing board to report any lawsuits brought against them for violating the abortion law, and whether that would constitute state enforcement.\nStone said the board could simply make a rule saying that it has no role in enforcement, so even if a report was made, it would be precluded from taking further action, like revoking a doctor\u2019s license.\nThat argument, and the narrowness of the challenge more generally, presented a problem for lawyers representing the abortion providers, who found themselves in the tricky position of arguing against themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir current argument is that the state\u2019s enforcement authority, through medical licensing officials, contributes to the chilling effect on abortion providers. If the state Supreme Court decides that medical licensing officials do not have enforcement authority \u2014 or the boards add language to their rules confirming that \u2014 that chilling effect is lifted.\nJustice Evan Young asked Marc Hearron, senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights, whether that would be a win for the abortion providers.\n\u201cIf you were to do that, that would, at a minimum, provide our clients some certainty,\u201d Hearron said. \u201cIt would, however \u2026 essentially end our challenge.\u201d\nWithout state enforcement, there is no one to bring a constitutional challenge against, and the law would remain in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court has not said when it will issue its ruling.\nTexas Right to Life legislative director John Seago said before the hearing that while the group hopes the Texas Supreme Court issues a \u201cmore clear, true reading\u201d of the law, it is not too worried about the outcome of this hearing.\n\u201cClearly, the Legislature did not intend these state agencies to play any role in enforcing SB 8,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if the abortion industry wins, if they get exactly what they want. If there\u2019s an injunction against those state agencies, all that means is we end up back to what the Legislature intended in the first place.\u201d\nAbortion providers and advocates are fighting the law on several fronts, including in state court, where a judge in Austin declared the law unconstitutional. He did not enjoin the law from being enforced, though, and that ruling is being appealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible that case will eventually return to these same chambers. The justices acknowledged that Thursday\u2019s hearing is unlikely to be the last time they are asked to rule on this unprecedented new law.\nThursday\u2019s case before the Texas Supreme Court is a question of whether the abortion providers can bring a federal \u201cpre-enforcement\u201d challenge.\nIf that option is foreclosed to them, one option would be to do what a San Antonio doctor did immediately after the law was passed: violate the law, get sued and challenge the statute on its merits in court.\nStone, the solicitor general, indicated that the state is preparing for that eventuality \u2014 and expects those challenges to make it all the way back to the state Supreme Court, perhaps a more favorable venue than the federal courts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe point \u2026 was specifically to preclude federal pre-enforcement challenges,\u201d Stone told the court. \u201cThe state courts and this court are equally competent to determine both the matter of state law and federal law as to any applicable \u2026 defenses, which this Court undoubtedly will be called to do when an appropriate case comes to it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
