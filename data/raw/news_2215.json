Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would ban abortions once a baby in the womb can feel pain. \n\u201cThe future of California, the Democratic Party, and all of America is pro-life!\u201d Pro-Life San Francisco said of the legislation on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill was introduced Wednesday and would ban late-term abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\u201cThe first bill is the \u2018Late Term Abortion Ban\u2019 bill, banning late-term abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother is at risk of losing her life or faces severe, irreversible health consequences if an abortion is not performed. There was a bill previously introduced entitled the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act that I felt that I needed to oppose because it did not include an exception for severe irreversible health consequences. My legislation includes that exception,\u201d Gabbard told the Washington Examiner. \nDemocrats for Life of America also lauded the legislation, saying she has joined \u201cthe right side of history.\u201d\n\u201cFormer Democratic Presidential Candidate Tulsi Gabbard introduced her SECOND Pro-Life bill this week, which would amend Title 18 of the U.S. code to give pain-capable fetuses rights under the law,\u201d Democrats for Life in America announced on Facebook. \u201cTulsi has previously voted against this bill three times, but is now the SPONSOR of the new bill. This is proof that DFLA can convince Democrats to join the right side of history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar legislation, called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, was introduced in 2017 but failed to pass. \nJust last week, Gabbard introduced another anti-abortion bill that would protect babies born after an attempted abortion. \n\u201cThe second is the \u2018Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act, which would prohibit what essentially is infanticide. If a late-term abortion is attempted and the baby is born alive, physicians must follow the same procedures that they would in any case of premature birth. The genesis of this bill came from seeing the infanticide bills introduced in Virginia and New York, how they would make it easier to get a late-term abortion, and if the baby is born alive, they would make the baby comfortable and then allow the baby to die,\u201d she said of the legislation. \nGabbard\u2019s bills also come after she showed solidarity with President Trump on abolishing Section 230, which provides liability protections to internet publishers, telling him to not \u201cback down.\u201d She also joined Republicans in introducing a bill that would block transgender athletes from competing against biological females. \n\n\n\n\n\nTagsAbortionCongressDemocratic PartyTulsi Gabbard\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of immigrants in two cases \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew live-action Popeye movie in development from\u00a0The Sopranos writer \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 450 Jewish figures in Hollywood slam Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscars... \nMarch 19, 2024 12:10 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily on Energy: Biden officials give hints on LNG pause timeline \nMarch 19, 2024 12:08 pm \n\n\n  \n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of immigrants in two cases \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew live-action Popeye movie in development from\u00a0The Sopranos writer \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 450 Jewish figures in Hollywood slam Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscars... \nMarch 19, 2024 12:10 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily on Energy: Biden officials give hints on LNG pause timeline \nMarch 19, 2024 12:08 pm \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information \n\n\n\nAbout Examiner\nMagazine Archive\nPolicies and Standards\nTerms Of Service\nSubscription Terms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\n \n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\nTransparency In Coverage\nAdvertise\nContact\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCareers\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Washington Examiner 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
