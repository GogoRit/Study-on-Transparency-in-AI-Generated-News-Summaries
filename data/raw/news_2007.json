    "description": "North Carolina Republican legislative leaders say there is agreement within their chambers on backing a measure that would prohibit abortion in nearly all cases after roughly the first trimester of pregnancy. House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger announced the consensus late Tuesday. North Carolina law currently bans nearly all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The measure would reduce it to 12 weeks, with new but limited exceptions in cases of rape, incest or fetal abnormality. The final votes will occur later this week. Republicans now hold veto-proof majorities in both General Assembly chambers. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is a strong abortion-rights supporter.",

(AP) \u2014 North Carolina Republican legislative leaders said on Tuesday there\u2019s agreement in the GOP-dominated legislature on backing a measure that would prohibit abortion in nearly all cases after roughly the first trimester of pregnancy. House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger announced at an early-evening news conference that there\u2019s consensus between Republicans in the state House and Senate.North Carolina law currently bans nearly all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The measure would reduce that to 12 weeks, with new exceptions in cases of rape, incest or fetal abnormality. An existing exception for when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger would remain.Final votes for the agreed-upon legislation would occur Wednesday in the House and Thursday in the Senate, legislators said.The bill also contains provisions to make adoptions easier and to improve health care access for children and pregnant women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for North Carolina to take the next step forward in honoring the sanctity of human life,\u201d said Sen. Joyce Krawiec, a Forsyth County Republican and one of the negotiators of the agreement, adding that the bill \u201cwill undoubtedly save lives and improve health outcomes for many pregnant women.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Burns bruises NC State into the NCAA Tournament, and March Madness will be his next big chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad news for the bubble: NC State and Oregon swipe bids as wild tournament results continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s March Madness and more people than ever can legally bet on basketball games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final measure would go to the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is a strong supporter of abortion rights. He said in December he would consider it extreme to ban abortion after less than 20 weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a fundraising email to supporters late Tuesday, Cooper called the bill \u201can egregious, unacceptable attack on the women of our state.\u201d Cooper campaigned last fall for legislative candidates that he said would help uphold his vetoes on abortion. But Republicans now hold veto-proof majorities in both General Assembly chambers after then-Democratic Rep. Tricia Cotham, of Mecklenburg County, switched to the Republican Party last month. Cotham has declined to say publicly whether she would be willing to vote for new restrictions. If she doesn\u2019t vote for the bill, some House Democrats likely would have to vote for an override or be absent for Republicans to overcome a Cooper veto. \n\nAccording to legislators, the bill will place limits on the exceptions, capping abortions at 20 weeks in cases of rape or incest and 24 weeks for \u201clife-limiting\u201d fetal anomalies, including certain physical or genetic disorders that can be diagnosed prenatally. Doctors could face fines for failing to follow some restrictions in the measure.House and Senate Republicans have been working for months toward a consensus to further act upon last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. At the time of the ruling last June, abortions were legal in North Carolina until fetal viability, which generally falls between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, or in certain medical emergencies. That made North Carolina a locale for abortion access for those traveling from other Southern states where abortion was already banned.A federal judge in August reinstated the unenforced 20-week ban following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. At least 88% of the abortions involving North Carolina residents in 2020 occurred at or before 12 weeks of gestation, according to state Department of Health and Human Services data.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic spokesperson Jillian Riley said the restrictions will have \u201cdetrimental effects\u201d on the health of North Carolina residents and others from the Southeast. Other critics complained about how the agreement was worked out privately among Republicans over several months without formal public input.\u201cThe people of North Carolina are taking witness, they are listening, they are watching,\u201d Riley told reporters. \u201cThey do not want any more bans on abortion care. We will remember who voted to strip away legal abortion in North Carolina.\u201d Republican leadership also billed the measure as a $160 million investment in child care access, maternal health care and paid parental leave for teachers and state employees. The bill includes millions of dollars in funding for foster care families and parents who are working to finish community college.\n\nThe money set aside also would go to nonprofit community health centers to provide contraceptives to underserved, uninsured or medically indient patients. \u201cThis is a pro-women and holistic approach,\u201d said Rep. Sarah Stevens, a Surry County Republican and the House\u2019s No. 2 leader. \u201cIt\u2019s equipped with as much information, as many options as we could give at this point, and focuses on the health and safety of the child.\u201d___Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
