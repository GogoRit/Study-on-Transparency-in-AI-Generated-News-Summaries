(Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)\n\n\n\nA proposed ordinance in Pueblo that would effectively ban abortions in the city marks the first attempt by a Texas-based anti-abortion group to poke holes in a Colorado law passed this year that prohibits restrictions on access to abortion and contraception.\nThe organization, Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn, started in east Texas in 2019 and has helped pass about 60 abortion-banning ordinances in Texas, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa and New Mexico.\u00a0\nMark Lee Dickson, who runs the organization, said he hopes to work in other parts of the state as well.\n\u201cEvery city in Colorado needs to become a sanctuary city for the unborn,\u201d he wrote in an emailed statement to The Colorado Sun. \u201cEvery single one of us who values life needs to do our part to protect the inhabitants of those who live within our ZIP code \u2014 both the born and the unborn.\u00a0\nWhether the gambit pays off in Pueblo could become clear Monday, when the city council is expected to take a final vote on the proposed ordinance. The vote follows several packed meetings in which attendees have waved signs and people on both sides of the issue have shouted interruptions.\u00a0\n \n \n\nThe ordinance would prohibit delivery of tools and medicines that could be used for abortions anywhere in the city. It would also require abortion clinics to apply for a license but the city could deny it based on the delivery prohibition.\nSome city council members have expressed concerns that the measure would be in direct violation of House Bill 1279, known as the Reproductive Health Equity Act, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April and protects abortion rights in the state.\u00a0\nThe Pueblo city attorney recommended the council not approve the ordinance.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n \u2600 READ MORE\n\n\n\nWeekend storms bump up Colorado\u2019s mountain snowpack to above-average levels \n4:05 AM MDT on Mar 19, 20249:16 AM MDT on Mar 19, 2024 \n\n\n\n\nAs states, including Colorado, target disavowed \u201cexcited delirium\u201d diagnosis, police groups push back \n4:01 AM MDT on Mar 19, 20245:14 PM MDT on Mar 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\nColorado is at odds with the feds over prescription drug importation, documents show \n3:18 AM MDT on Mar 19, 20249:12 AM MDT on Mar 19, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just feel like this is part of a bigger plan,\u201d said House Majority Leader Daneya Esgar, a Pueblo Democrat and a lead sponsor of House Bill 1279. \u201cIf they\u2019re not successful here they\u2019re going to move on to the next county and they\u2019re going to keep going around the state of Colorado until they find a county that has enough votes to pass an ordinance like this and that\u2019s when we will really start seeing the challenges coming up in different court cases.\u201d\nEsgar, who is term-limited and won\u2019t be returning to the Capitol when the legislative session begins in January, said she expected to see challenges like this after the law was signed but was surprised to see it in Pueblo, where abortion-restricting measures have historically been rejected.\u00a0\nThe most recent statewide effort in 2020, Proposition 115, would have banned abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy. It was rejected in Pueblo County by about 3,600 votes and went on to fail statewide.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Pueblo,\u201d Esgar said. \u201cThis is something happening to Pueblo.\u201d\nFellow council member Regina Maestri feels differently. She introduced the ordinance after an abortion provider, Clinics for Abortion and Reproductive Excellence, purchased a building in the city.\nThe provider, which began offering services in Pueblo on Dec. 5, has clinics in Nebraska and Maryland.\u00a0The organization\u2019s website advertises that its clinics offer abortions throughout pregnancy.\n\u201cI am so glad to have met Mark Dickson,\u201d Maestri said in a Nov. 28 meeting. \u201cYou want to say he\u2019s from Texas coming in here and invading. So are the abortion clinics \u2014 they\u2019re not from Pueblo.\u201d\nPueblo has no other abortion providers and the next-closest option is 50 miles away in Colorado Springs,\u00a0according to The Pueblo Chieftain.\nThe council already approved the first reading of the ban in a Nov. 28 meeting, but it\u2019s unclear if the ordinance has enough support to ultimately pass.\nInspired by Texas\nThe proposed ordinance in Pueblo is similar to a 2021 bill passed in Texas that allows private citizens to sue anyone who provides or receives an abortion after six weeks. Instead of using the criminal court system, the Texas measure is enforced in civil court.\nThe Pueblo measure would subject anyone who has tools or medicines used for abortions delivered in the city subject to a lawsuit punishable by at least $100,000 in damages, according to the ordinance.\n \n \n\nHouse Bill 1279 says a government entity in Colorado may not \u201cdeny, restrict, interfere with or discriminate against an individual\u2019s fundamental right to use or refuse contraception or to continue a pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nThe bill also states that fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses do not have independent rights under the laws of the state.\n \n\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision guaranteeing a certain level of abortion access across the U.S. The Colorado legislature brought the state measure in preparation for that reversal and to prevent local governments from trying to limit abortion access.\nAttorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in a written statement responding to the Pueblo ordinance that he is committed to defending Colorado\u2019s abortion-access law.\n\u201cOur office is monitoring developments regarding the proposed ordinance in Pueblo and has no further comment while it is under consideration by the Pueblo City Council,\u201d Weiser said.\nA spokesperson for the city said City Attorney Dan Kogovsek has declined to talk with reporters about the ordinance to protect attorney-client privilege.\u00a0\nVeto power\nThe city council discussed the ordinance Wednesday during a special work session.\u00a0\nAfter 30 minutes of arguments among city council members about the nature of the meeting and which experts would be permitted to speak, the council decided to only hear comments from local OB-GYNs. The council will hold another work session Monday when they will hear legal perspectives from both sides before meeting in a regular session to hear public comment and make a final decision.\nCouncilmembers Dennis Flores and Sarah Martinez have expressed concern on whether the city should be involved in such a decision.\n\u201cMunicipalities like ours legally cannot supersede the state legislation,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cSo then why are we spending time on this when we have so many other citywide concerns, like freezing temperatures and violent crime?\u201d\n\nDuring the Wednesday meeting, the majority of Parkview Medical Center\u2019s OB-GYNs sat in the audience as their chief of staff spoke, asking the city council not to pass the ordinance. The hospital is the only one in Pueblo providing those women\u2019s health services.\nDr. Mike Growney said that none of the physicians who attended the meeting perform elective abortions, but all of them use the tools and medicines that would be banned under the measure for basic obstetric care.\n\u201cThe ordinance you\u2019re considering would impede our efforts to provide comprehensive medical care to women and detract from our ability to routinely provide lifesaving services for your wives, your sisters, your moms and\u00a0 yourself,\u201d Growney said. \u201cWe can\u2019t order, we can\u2019t ship, we can\u2019t receive medicines that we need to save your citizens.\u201d\nA scene from the city of Pueblo pictured on Dec. 12, 2018. Pueblo is home to the Colorado State Fair. (Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)\nHe described multiple tools and medicines that could be used for abortions but are also used for things like cancer care, miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.\n \n \n\nDickson said his legal counsel, Jonathan Mitchell, the former solicitor general for Texas, has told him it is legal to ship these things as long as they aren\u2019t intended for abortion use. \nThe Pueblo ordinance says fertility treatments, contraception and procedures to remove an unviable fetus and ectopic pregnancy are not defined as abortion. \nIn a Nov. 28 meeting, three council members \u2014 Martinez, Flores and Vicente Ortega \u2014 voted to permanently table the measure. The other four council members \u2014 Maestri, Larry Atencio, Heather Graham and Lori Winner \u2014 voted against tabling but at least two of them, Graham and Atencio, said they had not yet made up their minds on the topic.\nIf the council passes the measure, Pueblo Mayor Nick Gradisar, a Democrat, has seven days to veto it. The council can override a veto with at least five votes.\nGradisar said in an interview he believes the ordinance is illegal but wouldn\u2019t say if he would veto the ordinance if it were to pass. He called the effort a political stunt and said \u201cone way or another\u201d he doesn\u2019t see it becoming law.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s to make noise, mostly,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is a small group of people that have a lot of emotional involvement, but it\u2019s the kind of situation where this determination has been made by the voters, by the legislature, that women have access to reproductive health care, and there\u2019s nothing the City of Pueblo can do to restrict that.\u201d\nCLARIFICATION: This story was updated at 8:14 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 10, 2022, to reflect Pueblo ordinance says fertility treatments, contraception, and procedures to remove an unviable fetus and ectopic pregnancy are not defined as abortion. \nCORRECTION: This story was updated at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 21, to correct information about the Clinics for Abortion and Reproductive Excellence, which opened Dec. 5.
