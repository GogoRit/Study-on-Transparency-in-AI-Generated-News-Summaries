The civil disobedience strategy was borrowed from Martin Luther King Jr. and named \u201crescuing\u201d by Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue in 1986. (Motto: \u201cIf you believe abortion is murder, act like it\u2019s murder.\u201d)\nThe evangelical pro-life movement was only a decade or two old, operating with an energy born of righteous anger. Most protesters stood in front of clinic doorways, though others laid in front of clinic employees\u2019 cars as they arrived, and at least one man chained himself to a heavy metal garbage can. From 1977 to 1989, more than 24,000 pro-life protesters were arrested at abortion clinics.\nRandy Alcorn (back row, second from right) at a 1989 rescue / Courtesy of Kathy Norquist\nThe high number of arrests continued into the \u201990s, then dropped off abruptly: In 1993, there were 1,236 arrests. In 1994, 217. In 1995, 54. By 2000, there were none.\n\u201cThere were two serious obstacles that shut down sit-ins or diminished their effectiveness, and pushed protesters in a different direction,\u201d Americans United for Life (AUL) attorney Clarke Forsythe told TGC. One was the media coverage, which \u201cdid not favor\u201d the demonstrators. The other was the threat of legal prosecution, which culminated in the passage of the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances Act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994.\nBoth were meant to chill the protest wing of the pro-life movement, and in some ways, seemed to succeed. The number of arsons (from 96 in the 1990s to 14 in the 2000s), invasions (117 to 25), and bombings (15 to 1) all dropped.\nBut the opposition also helped the pro-life movement adjust. Along with advocating for the baby, pro-life advocates leaned into helping the mother.\nOver the past 30 years, Care Net and Heartbeat International and others have opened so many pregnancy centers that they outnumber abortion providers three to one. Organizations like AUL and National Right to Life have been working\u2014often with increased focus on assisting women\u2014to curtail abortion through state restrictions. And those who stand outside abortion clinics are more likely to pray quietly, allow women to pass, and be trained\u2014at least a little\u2014in how to counsel women wondering if they should continue an unplanned pregnancy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t look back with regret at all or think I wouldn\u2019t do it over,\u201d said Liberty University English professor Karen Swallow Prior, who was arrested five times for her early clinic protests. \u201cSome things mitigate or make that different now, but still\u2014it was the right thing to do. We were not only preventing abortions, but we were also raising consciousness about abortion.\u201d\nHer students still stand in front of abortion clinics. In fact, they have a lot more company than she did.\nIn 2015, the number of protesters reported by abortion clinics rose dramatically from where it had hovered since the mid-\u201990s (usually between 5,000 to 10,000 a year), to more than 20,000. The next year, it was more than 60,000. The next year, 78,000.\nLast summer, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) said the number of protesters reported by abortion clinics exceeded 99,000 in 2018\u2014the most, by far, ever seen in the United States.\nSo what happened? Why so many, and why now?\nWaking Up the Conscience\nEvangelicals were late to the pro-life protests, mainly to avoid the Catholics already there.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there would be a pro-life movement in America without the Catholic Church,\u201d said Forsythe, an evangelical who joined AUL in 1985. Even before Roe v. Wade, the pope reaffirmed a ban on abortion, and Catholic bishops formed National Right to Life.\nBut Protestant suspicions of the church in Rome are Reformation-deep. \u201cThe mistrust between Catholics and Protestants has become almost as profound as that between the West and communism,\u201d Reinhold Niebuhr wrote in Essays in Applied Christianity in 1959.\nKaren Swallow Prior minutes before her arrest on April 22, 1992 / Courtesy of Karen Swallow Prior\nIn the 1960s, the two began finding common ground in defending religion against secular socialism in Europe, aided by the friendliness of Pope John XXIII and the softening of Catholic language about Martin Luther (from \u201cpsychopath\u201d to \u201ctragic individual\u201d).\nAbortion, too, was an area both were worried about.\n\u201cThis [Roe v. Wade] decision runs counter not merely to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,\u201d read an editorial in Christianity Today\u2014later revealed to have been written by Harold O. J. Brown\u2014in 1973. Soon after, L\u2019Abri founder Francis Schaeffer argued against abortion in the book and film series How Should We Then Live?: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture (in 1976 and 1977), with Whatever Happened to the Human Race? (1979), and in A Christian Manifesto (1981).\n\u201cEach era faces its own unique blend of problems,\u201d Schaeffer and co-author C. Everett Koop wrote in Whatever Happened to the Human Race? \u201cOur time is no exception. Those who regard individuals as expendable raw material\u2014to be molded, exploited, and then discarded\u2014do battle on many fronts with those who see each person as unique and special, worthwhile, and irreplaceable.\u201d\nSchaeffer\u2019s work was enormously popular, and Protestant pastors across the country played his reel-to-reel filmstrips for their congregations. One of them was Alcorn, who\u2019d co-planted Good Shepherd Community Church in Boring, Oregon, in 1977.\nSeeing Schaeffer and Koop \u201ctogether talking about the humanity of the unborn and a culture\u2019s responsibility to advocate for those who could not speak up for themselves just really hit me,\u201d Alcorn told TGC. \u201cSeeing Schaeffer\u2019s face and hearing his words for the unborn\u2014that flipped a switch in my mind.\u201d\nGood Shepherd began supporting a local crisis-pregnancy center\u2014the first in Portland\u2014and Alcorn joined their board. He and his wife, Nanci, took a pregnant teenager into their home, helping her through the pregnancy and the decision to give the child up for adoption.\nMeanwhile, the national pro-life movement was beginning to coalesce. Some of the push was political\u2014abortion was one of the four foundational issues of Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority\u2014and some was technological advancement. As ultrasounds grew more sophisticated and commonplace throughout the \u201980s and \u201990s, the \u201cclump of cells\u201d looked more and more human. The 1984 documentary The Silent Scream, which showed and narrated an abortion, \u201chelped shift the public focus from the horror stories of women who had suffered back-alley abortions to the horror movie of a fetus undergoing one,\u201d Time magazine observed.\n\u201cUltrasound and intrauterine photography have opened a window on the womb that will be Exhibit A at the judgment seat of God,\u201d wrote John Piper, who showed the film at Bethlehem Baptist Church in 1989. \u201cThere is no more excuse. \u2018If you say, behold we did not know this, does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?\u2019 (Prov. 24:12).\u201d\nPrior watched The Silent Scream during a Sunday evening service at her small independent Bible church in New York.\n\u201cI remember being completely amazed,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what abortion was or what they did to the baby or the women\u2019s body. My first thought was, Wow\u2014I\u2019d like to help women not have to make that choice. Who would want to do that?\u201d\nA lot of Christians were wondering the same thing.\nRescuing the Unborn\nIn 1986, Randall Terry started Operation Rescue, which organized large groups of protesters to physically block access to abortion centers. Local protesters picked up on the \u201crescuing\u201d language.\n\u201cWe would get up early, pile into buses, and sit in front of an abortion clinic so that nobody could get in or open the door without stepping on us,\u201d Piper wrote. \u201cEventually, we\u2019d be accused of trespassing, and they would tell us to leave. But we wouldn\u2019t, because we believed that we were there trying to rescue children from being aborted. So the police would come haul us down, tell us not to do it anymore, and let us go. That happened maybe half a dozen times, and one of those times we were sentenced to a night or two in jail.\u201d\nBecause there were so many protesters, police sometimes used school buses to transport them. / Courtesy of Karen Swallow Prior\nFrom 1977 to 1989, police made more than 24,000 arrests in 385 blockades. The first time Prior was arrested, she went limp as instructed.\n\u201cThe police carried us out,\u201d she said. She and 80 others were loaded into a school bus, taken to the police station, and processed. It took all day and into the night.\n\u201cIt was very dramatic,\u201d Prior said. She had a whole wardrobe of cold-weather gear\u2014handwarmers and boots\u2014so she could keep protesting throughout the winter in Buffalo, New York. She ended up being arrested five times.\nAlcorn\u2019s first rescue was in January 1989. \u201cI was certainly uneasy in terms of not knowing what to expect, and not wanting to \u2018do it wrong,\u2019\u201d he said. He was there four hours before the police came.\n\u201cIn theory, I was expecting to be arrested, but it was my first time and definitely was a paradigm shift to have police officers agitated with me,\u201d he said. The cuffs were tight, hurting his wrists and stretching his shoulders backward. \u201cLet\u2019s just say nothing I was taught in Bible college and seminary prepared me for it.\u201d\nOf the nine protests Alcorn attended that year, he was arrested seven times.\n\u201cWe\u2019d have 50 people sitting in front of the door,\u201d said Ron Norquist, who rescued alongside Alcorn after seeing Schaeffer\u2019s How Should We Then Live? video. \u201cWe would not resist arrest, but we wouldn\u2019t comply. The police would have to drag us away.\u201d\nHe dreaded the protests, but he showed up every month anyway. He had to: \u201cBefore rescues, there was the idea of the humanity of the unborn,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing the rescues did was solidify the fact\u2014these are actual human beings being led to slaughter. Proverbs 24:11 says to rescue them.\u201d\nNorquist, who was an insurance agent, \u201cdidn\u2019t really know what Jesus would do, because he didn\u2019t have that situation. But I thought there was enough in Scripture that we should at least do something nonviolent with our own body, like you would if they were taking 2-year-olds in there.\u201d\nAt the beginning, the arrests were just a slap on the wrist. Prior called them \u201cannoying.\u201d\nBut it didn\u2019t take long for that to escalate.\nThey Looked Like \u2018Lunatics\u2019\nThe news coverage didn\u2019t help the pro-life cause.\n\u201c400 Are Arrested in Atlanta Abortion Protests,\u201d The New York Times reported in 1988. \u201cAnti-Abortion Protesters Blockade Clinic in Va.,\u201d The Washington Post said a few weeks later. \u201cHuge Protest at Abortion Clinic Turns Violent,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported in 1990.\n\u201cAt least 242 people were arrested Saturday after militant abortion protesters descended on a Los Angeles women\u2019s clinic during a violence-marred, seven-hour siege that capped a week of abortion rights protests in Southern California,\u201d the Times said. \u201cThe demonstration, organized by the national anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, failed to shut down the Mid-Wilshire clinic. As hundreds of abortion rights activists cheered them on, police cleared a path to the entrance and security guards escorted staff and patients inside.\u201d\nA protester goes limp in 1992 / Courtesy of Karen Swallow Prior\nFor many abortion protesters, the negativity of the media coverage came as a surprise. After all, the nonviolent protests were borrowed from the civil-rights movement, which the national news media supported.\n\u201cHow the media broadcasted the civil-rights movement versus the abortion protests had a significant impact on how the public saw it,\u201d Forsythe said. \u201cThey were generally positive about the civil rights sit-ins and disparaged the pro-life sit-ins.\u201d\nThe bias was clear enough to be documented by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cTwo major media studies have shown that 80 percent to 90 percent of U.S. journalists personally favor abortion rights,\u201d it reported. \u201cAbortion-rights advocates are often quoted more frequently and characterized more favorably. . . . Commentary favoring abortion rights outnumber those opposing abortion by a margin of more than 2-to-1 on the op-ed pages.\u201d\nIt was true that a few abortion opponents did turn violent\u2014though rarely in conjunction with a public protest. Lone actors killed seven abortion providers or supporters in the 1990s. Clinics also reported 15 bombs, 96 cases of arson, and 100 acid attacks.\nMore often, though, participants didn\u2019t even recognize the coverage of the events they attended. \u201cThe media portrayed us as screaming,\u201d Norquist\u2019s wife, Kathy, said. \u201cCertainly that wasn\u2019t what was happening.\u201d\n\u201cThey said we were pulling women\u2019s hair,\u201d Alcorn said. \u201cThat had never happened, and if it had, I would\u2019ve told that person to leave and not to come back.\u201d\nAn early-\u201990s protest / Courtesy of Karen Swallow Prior\nWhat was happening? As Falwell and others threw their weight into politics, abortion was becoming a Republican rallying point. But newsrooms were heading in the opposite direction: In 1992, about 60 percent of staffers at prominent media organizations said they leaned left politically, compared with 33 percent in 1982\u20131983. Their stories followed; more than a third of journalists said media coverage helped Bill Clinton win the 1992 election, compared with 3 percent who said it helped George Bush.\n\u201cI was so na\u00efve,\u201d Prior said. She was working on her PhD in the left-leaning English department at the State University of New York at Buffalo. \u201cI thought, Yeah, people will disagree with me on abortion, but they\u2019ll think it\u2019s cool that I\u2019m protesting\u2014like in the \u201960s.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t how it went. \u201cI got invited to a couple of parties and told people about being pro-life. It was the most awkward thing. I just had no idea how hostile they were to the pro-life position.\u201d\n\u201cThe news was terrible,\u201d said Mike Reid, who was executive director of Portland Pregnancy Resource Centers in the 1990s. \u201cThe [protesters] were portrayed to look like lunatics, and the news was so consistent with that portrayal. That created so much more ardent support for abortion. The protests definitely galvanized both sides.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the law to weigh in.\nCrippling Judgments\nAt first, when protesters got arrested, they were charged with crimes such as trespassing and released after a few hours. (Piper used his time to try to change the mind of the prison nurse.)\nThen things got a little trickier. In 1990, the Lovejoy Surgicenter in Portland sued 27 protesters\u2014including Alcorn and Norquist. Eight were arrested and held until they promised not to return to the clinic. Several, including Norquist\u2014who had a wife and three children\u2014wouldn\u2019t promise and spent several months in jail.\nOver in Pennsylvania, Michael Schmiedicke did much the same thing. The 24-year-old was given a two- to four-year prison sentence after chaining himself to a vehicle parked in front of an abortion clinic\u2014and then telling the judge he wouldn\u2019t stop trying to disrupt abortions. When offered clemency if he\u2019d keep away from clinics, he said he couldn\u2019t and stayed in jail.\nThe opposition also helped the pro-life movement adjust. Along with advocating for the baby, pro-life advocates leaned into helping the mother.\nLegal punishments grew harsher. In Pittsburgh, Mark Nelson was sentenced to a minimum of four to 12 months in prison, even though he was a first-time, nonviolent offender. In Houston, pro-life groups were ordered to pay more than $1 million to Planned Parenthood. And in Portland, a jury handed down the $8.2 million punitive punishment against Alcorn, Norquist, and 25 others.\nThen, in 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, prohibiting protesters from actions such as blocking entrances, trespassing on facility property, or stopping cars from entering the parking lot. First-time convictions of nonviolent protesters could be up to $10,000 and six months in prison. A second conviction could cost $25,000 and 18 months in a cell.\nWith the twin weights of negative media coverage and heavier court punishments, the pro-life rescues began to slow. But the movement did not.\nMaturing of the Movement\nTwo years after Harold O. J. Brown penned his Christianity Today editorial lamenting Roe v. Wade, he founded the Christian Action Council, which would open its first pregnancy center in 1980 and change its name to Care Net in 1995. Today, more than 1,100 affiliates offer free pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, supplies such as diapers and bottles, and abortion recovery groups. Heartbeat International, founded in 1971, has more than 2,700 affiliated pregnancy centers around the world serving 1.5 million clients a year. (At last count, there were 808 abortion clinics in the United States.)\nThe growth is evidence of both natural development and also an attempt to correct a perception problem.\nA 40 Days for Life vigil in front of the Houston Planned Parenthood / Courtesy of 40 Days for Life\n\u201cBack then it seemed like a woman was made almost an enemy by considering going to an abortion clinic,\u201d said Reid, who served as president of Care Net before becoming executive director of Hope Pregnancy Clinic.\nIt wasn\u2019t the message the rescuers were trying to send. \u201cA\u00a0very large number of us, including myself, started pro-life work out of our concern for the mothers every bit as much as the babies,\u201d Alcorn said. \u201cWe never for a moment ceased to help women.\u201d\nOver time, Reid has seen organizations such as National Right to Life use softer language, and clinic campaigns such as 40 Days for Life require training for leaders and a signed peace statement from participants. \u201cToday the motivation to save the life of a baby is much more understanding that the woman is a victim too,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are prayerful, peaceful, and lawful,\u201d 40 Days for Life attorney and board chair Matt Britton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an arrest or an act of violence perpetrated by us.\u201d\nThe organization was started in 2004 to protest the Planned Parenthood in Bryan, Texas, with a vigil of prayer and fasting during Lent. They kept going for nine years, praying outside the building every hour it was open, until it closed down in 2013.\n\u201cIt was just a local initiative,\u201d Britton said. \u201cOver the years, thousands of people were out there praying. And people in other cities said, \u2018How are you doing that?\u2019\u201d\nBy 2010, 40 Days for Life was helping churches train volunteers to fast and pray outside clinics in about 300 vigils around the world. By 2015, more than 500 churches were signed up. By 2019, more than 800. About two-thirds of the vigils took place in the United States.\nIf you\u2019re a numbers person, perhaps you\u2019re already doing the math. Over the past five years, just through 40 Days of Life, the pro-life presence outside abortion clinics has ratcheted up dramatically.\nRatcheting Up\nIn the 2000s, the number of protesters reported by abortion clinics hovered around 10,000 a year. In the early 2010s, that number dropped to about 5,000 a year.\nAnd then, in 2015, the number spiked to almost 22,000. The jump was huge, but easy to explain. From July to September, nine secret videos of Planned Parenthood executives selling unborn-baby body parts were released. Thousands, including John Piper, showed up outside clinics to protest.\nIn fact, pro-life organizers reported 65,000 on one August weekend alone\u2014nearly triple the NAF\u2019s number for the entire year.\n40 Days for Life vigil / Courtesy of 40 Days for Life\nBut even though no videos were released the next year, the number of protesters continued to climb. In 2016, the NAF count nearly tripled to more than 61,000. The next year, there were more than 78,000. In 2018, more than 99,000.\nIf anything, these numbers are low. At the 40 Days for Life vigils alone, Britton said, \u201cthere are hundreds of thousands of participants each year.\u201d\nThere are lots of reasons for the rapid growth. One is Abby Johnson, whose story was told in Unplanned: The Dramatic True Story of a Former Planned Parenthood Leader\u2019s Eye-Opening Journey across the Life Line. The book was followed by a movie, which grossed $19 million in domestic sales in 2019. \u201cThis fall, we got 30 percent more campaigns than we\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d Britton said.\nAnother reason is the momentum created by social media, he said.\n\u201cFIRST BABY SAVED!!\u201d tweeted 40 Days for Life on September 26, the first day of the fall vigil. A few days later, \u201cLess than a week into the vigil, we already know of 26 babies saved!\u201d At Pro-Life Action Ministries, \u201cBaby Saved on Christmas Eve brings our total 2019 Babies Saved to 77!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen 200 abortion workers quit during a 40 Days for Life Campaign,\u201d Britton said. And more than 100 abortion centers closed. And 16,000 lives saved. That news\u2014celebrated faster and more broadly than ever before\u2014encourages and emboldens others to show up.\nPro-life success is building on itself. But there\u2019s another major factor dumping fuel on this fire.\n\u201cAnti-choice individuals and groups have been emboldened by the rhetoric of President Trump, Vice President Pence, and other elected officials,\u201d NAF interim president and CEO Katherine Ragsdale said in a press release. \u201cWe are seeing this play out in more instances of activities meant to intimidate abortion providers and disrupt patient services.\u201d\nRolling to Racing\nAfter failing to overturn Roe v. Wade in 1992, pro-lifers took to the states. From 2011 to 2017, 32 states passed 394 new abortion restrictions, and the number of state legislatures with pro-life majorities grew from about six to about 25, Forsythe said.\nWhere state legislatures were chipping away, Trump came in with a chainsaw. His first Monday in the White House, he revoked U.S. support for any organizations operating in foreign countries that perform or advocate for abortions.\nHe followed it up by nominating two conservative Supreme Court justices (and another 157 lower court judges), signing a law to allow states to defund Planned Parenthood (15 states have taken advantage of it), and creating an office to help medical professionals who don\u2019t want to participate in abortions. He was the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to address the March for Life, appointed Americans United for Life president Charmaine Yoest to the Department of Health and Human Services, and told the United Nations General Assembly that \u201cevery child, born and unborn, is a sacred gift from God.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve seen 200 abortion workers quit during a 40 Days for Life Campaign.\nAs a result, pro-life momentum has moved past rolling to racing. Last year, states passed at least 58 additional restrictions. The New York Times is publishing articles called \u201cHow the Divided Left Is Losing the Battle on Abortion\u201d and \u201c\u2018This Is a Wave\u2019: Inside the Network of Anti-Abortion Activists Winning Across the Country.\u201d And abortion clinics are reporting unprecedented numbers of protesters.\n\u201cThis is a wave that is rolling across our country in the pro-life states,\u201d Susan B. Anthony List state policy director Sue Swayze Liebel told The New York Times. \u201cEverybody just put the pedal down, let\u2019s all go, everybody rushing to the finish line.\u201d\nFinish Line\nIt\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s working\u2014the pro-life legislation, the presence of protesters, the availability of pregnancy centers, the improving ultrasound technology, the destigmatizing of single motherhood, or increased access to birth control\u2014but something is. In 2017, abortions dropped to the lowest rate since Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cThat blows my mind every single time I think of it,\u201d Americans United for Life president Catherine Glenn Foster said. \u201cWe are making incredible progress.\u201d\nIt would be unfair to say the early rescuers invented the pro-life movement. But they were a significant way American Christians sorted out their views on abortion, said Andy Lewis, author of The Rights Turn in Conservative Christian Politics: How Abortion Transformed the Culture Wars. \u201cIn the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, lots of evangelicals didn\u2019t have clear views on this. It was a transition, and part of that was, \u2018How do we protest this? How do we oppose it?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI think God used it,\u201d Reid said.\nPiper\u2019s willingness to go to jail over abortion meant \u201cI had to reconsider all my priorities at that point, and I haven\u2019t been the same since,\u201d Boyce College theology professor Denny Burk wrote. \u201cI was astonished that this man that I admired so much thought enough of the issue to get his own skin in the game.\u201d\nEveryone has a story of a mind changed or a baby saved by the rescues. But God even used the punishments.\nWhile in jail, Norquist started a Bible study; he\u2019s still friends with one of the men he met inside. Schmiedicke worked with fellow inmates in the prison chapel.\nAfter losing the lawsuit, Alcorn\u2019s wages were set to be garnished until he could pay back his share of the $8.2 million judgment. So he resigned from his church, started Eternal Perspective Ministries, and restricted his pay to minimum wage. (Legally, only income more than minimum wage can be taken to pay legal obligations). Since he\u2019s a prolific writer, with more than 50 titles, that meant millions in book royalties were given to ministries such as orphan care, disaster relief, and Bible translation.\n\u201cHe supported every pro-life thing that was working,\u201d said Reid, whose pregnancy center received substantial gifts from Alcorn. Last summer, Alcorn announced that he\u2019s now given away more than $8.2 million\u2014more than the entire original judgment against the group of Portland rescuers.\n\u201cGod is sovereign over all the apparent uncertainties and negative twists in your life and mine,\u201d Alcorn wrote. \u201cHe is never taken by surprise, never perplexed, never faced with circumstances out of his control.\u00a0In this situation, God\u2019s hands weren\u2019t tied by the vengeance of child-killers. He didn\u2019t merely \u2018make the best of a bad situation.\u2019 He took a bad situation and used it for his highest good.\u201d\n \n\nIs there enough evidence for us to believe the Gospels?\nIn an age of faith deconstruction and skepticism about the Bible\u2019s authority, it\u2019s common to hear claims that the Gospels are unreliable propaganda. And if the Gospels are shown to be historically unreliable, the whole foundation of Christianity begins to crumble.\n\nBut the Gospels are historically reliable.
