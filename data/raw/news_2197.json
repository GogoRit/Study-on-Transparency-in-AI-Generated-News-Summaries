Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) turned heads last week by introducing two pro-life bills in the U.S. House of Representatives. The former presidential candidate\u2019s first bill would mandate medical care for babies born alive after an attempted abortion. The second aims to amend Title 18 of the U.S. Code and give pain-capable fetuses rights under the law.The group Democrats for Life of America celebrated, noting that Gabbard had previously voted against the bill to protect pain-capable babies in utero three times. Now she\u2019s not just a \u201cyes,\u201d but a sponsor of the proposed legislation. DFLA says this proves that fellow Dems can be influenced to get on \u201cthe right side of history\u201d on this issue.We can become blind to the full spectrum of attitudes on abortion among Democratic voters because candidates play to the in-house majority to be electable. You won\u2019t ever hear pro-life rhetoric on the Democratic campaign trail. (Similarly, you won\u2019t hear Republican candidates playing to conservatives who hold more moderate views on abortion.)However, a 2019 Pew Research poll showed significant numbers of voters do not track with the party powerbrokers who craft the platforms in both camps. According to their survey, a solid 3 in 10 or more Democrats don\u2019t agree with their party\u2019s position on abortion. Some think that it should be limited and reserved for narrow circumstances, while others believe that all human life is sacred at every stage. In that way, the latter subset tracks with the theological basis for Evangelical Christian efforts to end abortion.Why is it important to recognize these life-friendly Democrats? Because awareness of their existence should temper the way we build coalitions benefitting the cause of life. When we get into the habit of wholesale name-calling and demonization of all Democratic voters, we alienate that 25-30% percent of them who could be persuaded to join our efforts to make substantive advances for life.What do we want to do more? Run our mouths to get cheered by those who already agree with us, or speak with wisdom and restraint and thus create new pathways to save vulnerable children?We spend incredible amounts of time talking past one another in 2020 America. We play to the home team to get that pat on the back, that affirmation that we\u2019re all right, and they\u2019re all wrong. Reaching across the aisle to have hard conversations is scary and fraught with the danger of being misunderstood by everyone on both sides.And when conservatives reach across the aisle with the message that life is sacred and should be protected, it\u2019s going to force some nuanced dialogue about other whole-life issues like capital punishment. It will force us to more thoughtfully articulate--if not reconsider--the theological and philosophical underpinnings and expression of all our positions related to human flourishing.But if abortion in America is the penultimate crisis that we in the pro-life community claim, this is work worth doing. These are discussions worth having.So before you create that next Facebook post or tweet that paints entire groups of people with a broad brush, slow down and ask yourself if it\u2019s accurate and fair. Integrity demands that much of us. Secondly, ask yourself if it\u2019s effective.Many in the pro-life community are passionate about this issue because of their Christian faith. That same faith calls us to consider our words carefully and maintain a posture of love and humility when dealing with others. Why does biblical wisdom provide these guardrails for our communication?Because the God of Creation knows human nature better than we do. He knows that we are more effective emissaries for truth when we carry ourselves in this way.So the next time you are tempted to blast someone who votes differently than you based on an assumption about what they believe, take a minute to rethink it. Perhaps you share more overlapping positions than you realize. Maybe they struggle with how to view the dual concerns of individual liberty for women and the rights of the unborn but are persuadable.Speak like a person seeking to influence, rather than a person seeking to bash. Tell the truth with consistency and humility. You never know who you may help to turn the corner toward embracing and defending human life.Dana Hall McCain writes about faith, culture, and politics.
