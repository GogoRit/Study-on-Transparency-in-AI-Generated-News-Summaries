State officials are not in charge of enforcing it, and challenges to the law have struggled to name defendants in their efforts to stop it.\nMany people are unaware that they are pregnant at the time that fetal activity is detected \u2014 usually around the six-week mark \u2014 and the law has become one of the most restrictive abortion measures in the country.\nA divided Supreme Court found that most challenges against the Texas law should be dismissed, except for one filed against medical licensing officials. That case was sent that to the 5th Circuit, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, rather than a federal district court as abortion providers and supporters had hoped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-judge federal panel, based in New Orleans, wrote in their 2-1 decision Monday that the Texas Supreme Court must certify the case and decide whether the U.S. Supreme Court was correct in allowing a challenge to proceed against the licensing officials. Circuit Judges Edith H. Jones and Stuart Kyle Duncan, both appointed by Republicans, said the state\u2019s highest court should determine whether the Texas attorney general, the Texas Medical Board and other licensing officials can enforce the law if it is violated.\nJudge Stephen A. Higginson, a Democratic appointee, argued the U.S. Supreme Court had already decided that matter.\n\u201cThis further, second-guessing redundancy, without time limit, deepens my concern that justice delayed is justice denied, here impeding relief ordered by the Supreme Court,\u201d he wrote in his dissent.\nState supreme courts do not have to take up cases that are sent to them by federal courts, but it\u2019s likely Texas will this time. Lawyers said it\u2019s unusual to ask the Texas Supreme Court to make this decision after the U.S. Supreme Court has already weighed in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil a decision is made, Texas abortion providers have mostly stopped performing the procedure, even though Supreme Court decisions, including in the landmark 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade, establish a constitutional right to abortion.\nLawyers for abortion providers have said that getting the case sent to a federal district court is the best hope to have it struck down \u2014 and that sending it to the state\u2019s Supreme Court instead could delay any decision by months.\nAbortion opponents said such an extensive delay is exactly what they wanted.\n\u201cWhile all of these complicated legal questions are untangled, we already every day have our victory,\u201d John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, previously told the Texas Tribune. \u201cCourts have allowed this law to stay in effect.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide by June whether a Mississippi law that bans abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional. In that case, the court will consider whether any pre-viability bans can be constitutional. During oral arguments Dec. 1, a majority of the justices seemed inclined to roll back protections for abortion, if not do away with Roe altogether. Texas has already passed a so-called trigger law, which will make abortions illegal in the state if Roe is overturned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
