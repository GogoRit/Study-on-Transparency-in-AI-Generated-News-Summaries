The abortion controversy concerns the ongoing debate and battle over the legal status of abortion in the U.S., both at the state and national levels. Abortion is among the most divisive debate topics in American public discourse. Views on abortion often carry religious, political, and cultural overtones. The debate is largely framed by two competing views: The Pro-Choice view, that abortion is a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitutionally-protected right; and the Pro-Life view, that abortion is immoral, and that the government should have the right to restrict and/or punish abortion. The ongoing public controversy over abortion makes this a popular persuasive essay topic.Key TakeawaysAbortion has long been a controversial topic! When it comes to this topic, people are divided into two parties: pro-choice, who favor lifting limitations and increasing financing access to safe and legal abortions, and pro-life, who attempt to pass laws that restrict or limit access to abortion.Abortions come in a variety of forms. While surgical and medical abortions are extremely safe, there are some side effects to be aware of and a few uncommon complications.Following the US Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022, which secured a constitutional right to an abortion for almost 50 years, the legal conflict over abortion has now been forwarded to the states to decide upon, with some attempting to outlaw it while others are working to protect it.In This Article:A Brief History of the IssueSources of Historical InfluenceThe Current ControversyA Quick Overview of Our MethodKey Terms in the Abortion ControversyInfluential Organizations Involved in the Abortion ControversyAsk A QuestionTable of Contents In This Article:A Brief History of the IssueSources of Historical InfluenceThe Current ControversyA Quick Overview of Our MethodKey Terms in the Abortion ControversyInfluential Organizations Involved in the Abortion ControversyAsk A QuestionWhile research suggests that many Americans harbor views somewhere in between these two divergent positions, beliefs on abortion law and reproductive rights tend to be divided starkly across political party lines. As a matter of broad policy, the Republican Party seeks to make laws restricting or limiting access to abortion while the Democratic Party seeks to remove restrictions and improve funding for access to safe and legal abortions.The debate over abortion often bleeds into many other aspects of American politics, impacting the way that individuals on both sides of the abortion debate craft policy, support candidates, and engage the legal system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 @AcademicInflux  TWEET   POST Affiliates of either party may hold their own views on the controversial topic which diverge from mainstream party beliefs, and the same is true for many Americans who identify as political independents. However, the divide over abortion is truly a major force in America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2-party political system. The debate over abortion often bleeds into many other aspects of American politics, impacting the way that individuals on both sides of the abortion controversy craft policy, support candidates, and engage the legal system.In other words, while the abortion debate ostensibly concerns a single issue, it carries far-reaching religious, legal, and political implications, and bears a central connection to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights movements. As a result, this controversial topic has an encompassing effect on the way people vote and politically identify.A Brief History of the IssueEarly Feminists vs. Early Anti-Abortion LawsIn the early 19th century, abortion was not viewed as a constitutional issue, and was therefore left to the discretion of individual states. Most states imposed their own restrictions. Some states placed limitations on when, or under what conditions, an abortion could be performed. Other states imposed total bans on abortions and criminalized the acts of receiving or performing an abortion. 1820 marked the first time that the federal government weighed in, outlawing abortions after the fourth month of pregnancy.This was the beginning of a tempered national discourse over anti-abortion legislation and reproductive rights. As the feminist movement was itself in an early stage of development, the public push against anti-abortion legislation was measured and muted. However, early leaders of the feminist movement did begin to push back against legislation restricting abortions. Though many early women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights pioneers acknowledged their own moral opposition to the practice of abortion, they also spoke in practical opposition to the criminalization of abortion.While many early feminists expressed disapproval of abortion on moral or religious grounds, they also argued the need for safe and legal abortion as an antidote to pregnancies resulting from marital rape and the forcible seduction of unmarried women. From this view, both unwanted pregnancy and anti-abortion laws were seen as an extension of male control over female lives and bodies, and in particular, an extension of the general disrespect for a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to abstinence.In spite of this view, the mid- and late-1800s saw the acceleration of restrictions around abortion. Among the most notable federal restrictions were those resulting from the Comstock Law, named for United States Postal Inspector General and creator of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, Anthony Comstock. Beginning in 1873, the Comstock Law outlawed the transmission by mail of \u00e2\u0080\u009cobscene, lewd, or lascivious\u00e2\u0080\u009d material, which was deemed to include, among many other things, information regarding abortion, contraception, and the prevention of venereal disease. This law had the effect of dramatically impinging on awareness of, support for, and access to abortion rights.The AMA played a major role in proliferating the moral argument against abortion. This campaign was effective, with state legislators adopting bans on abortion in every single state by 1900.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 @AcademicInflux  TWEET   POST Toward the end of the 19th century, the American Medical Association (AMA) began a long and sustained public campaign decrying the practice of abortion. The AMA played a major role in proliferating the moral argument against abortion. This campaign was effective, with state legislators adopting bans on abortion in every single state by 1900. Though abortion was a criminal act in every state, some states held exceptions in instances where a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health was in danger, or where a pregnancy was the consequence of incest or rape.Shifting Public OpinionWith widespread restrictions on abortion in place, various unrelated groups began to push back, touching off an increasingly public debate over abortion. In particular, some members of the medical community (in contrast to the AMA), began to voice public objection to the prohibition of abortion rights. In light of the restrictions and unavailability of safe and legal abortions, women facing unintended or unwanted pregnancy would resort to \u00e2\u0080\u009cback alley abortions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d procedures performed illegally and often under dangerous and unsanitary conditions. These conditions frequently resulted in health complications and fatalities. In light of the medical and legal dangers facing women with unwanted pregnancies, nurses, physicians, and social workers became part of a more vocal movement for an end to criminalization.Certain religious groups also expressed support for decriminalization, arguing that the effects of unintended pregnancy on members of their community could be devastating. Some members of the Christian clergy took the position that supporting access to abortions was a more ethically grounded position than restricting or criminalizing the practice.And as the feminist movement gained size and momentum, the issue over abortion became increasingly one of freedom, privacy, and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights. The view gained traction that abortion was fundamentally a matter of personal choice and privacy, and that government laws banning abortion were an infringement on those constitutional rights.Increased Advocacy and Access for Abortion RightsIn 1921, nurse, educator, and activist Margaret Sanger formed The American Birth Control League, which advocated for the opening of birth control clinics, and helped raise consciousness about the need for women to control their own fertility and reproductive decisions. In 1942, the league was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.The nonprofit organization has since grown to include more than 600 clinics throughout the United States focused on reproductive healthcare. Today, Planned Parenthood is the leading provider of reproductive health services, including abortions, in the United States.As broader mainstream support emerged for decriminalization of abortion, an array of landmark court decisions and state-level legislative changes began to alter the legal landscape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 @AcademicInflux  TWEET   POST The mid-20th century saw growing support for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights among various cross-sections of the American public. As broader mainstream support emerged for decriminalization of abortion, an array of landmark court decisions and state-level legislative changes began to alter the legal landscape.In the early 1960s, a number of high-profile public cases began to erode the sweeping restrictions over abortion. Among them:In 1962, a pregnant Arizona mother of four named Sherri Finkbine learned that her 5th child would likely be born with significant fetal deformities due to the now-notorious sleeping pill, Thalidomide. Arizona laws held that an abortion could only be performed if the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life was in danger. Finkbine traveled to Sweden to obtain an abortion, but her story had a major impact on the public view of abortion, especially on the behalf of women who might not have had Finkbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial resources or access to travel.In 1964, a Connecticut woman named Gerri Santoro died after seeking an illegal abortion, and was adopted as a tragic symbol of the push for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights.In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling on Griswold v. Connecticut, struck down the Comstock Laws pertaining to contraception, creating access in Connecticut and Massachusetts for those in marital relationships. In 1972, Eisenstadt extended this access to unmarried individuals.In 1967, Colorado became the first state to decriminalize abortion, though only in cases of rape, incest, and the risk of permanent disability to the mother. North Carolina, California, and Oregon soon followed suit.In 1970, Hawaii became the first state to legalize abortion without limiting conditions like those in Colorado. Alaska and Washington soon followed suit.By 1972, 13 states had passed laws similar to Colorado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conditional decriminalization. As some states relaxed prohibition around abortion and others retaining existing restrictions, women seeking abortions traveled across state lines in increasing numbers for access to safe and legal procedures.Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)1973 remains a landmark year in both the abortion debate and the broader struggle for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights. In fact, the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade is among the most consequential court precedents in modern history. At the time of the decision, 30 states had total bans on abortion, 16 states allowed conditional abortion, and four states allowed legal abortions.In Roe v. Wade, a Texas woman filed suit against the state, arguing that its anti-abortion laws were a violation of the 14th Amendment right to privacy. In his majority opinion, Justice Harry Blackmum found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or ... in the Ninth Amendment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor 50 years, Roe v. Wade was viewed as the law of the land regarding abortion. But The long-standing precedent was overturned with a Supreme Court ruling in 2022.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 @AcademicInflux  TWEET   POST In this finding, the Supreme Court would invalidate all existing federal and state-level laws criminalizing abortion, and it would extend new terms around the government regulation of abortion. Subsequent cases, such as Doe v. Bolton (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) have grappled with questions over the viability of a fetus and the health of the woman, especially during the later stages of pregnancy. Roe v. Wade has been challenged frequently. In the 50 years that followed this landmark decision, the findings of Roe v. Wade had been upheld and refined by these and other cases. And for 50 years, its precedent was viewed as the law of the land regarding abortion.The long-standing Roe v. Wade precedent was overturned with a Supreme Court ruling issued in June of 2022. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argued \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the 1973 Roe ruling and repeated subsequent high court decisions reaffirming Roe \u00e2\u0080\u0098must be overruled\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because they were \u00e2\u0080\u0098egregiously wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the arguments \u00e2\u0080\u0098exceptionally weak\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and so \u00e2\u0080\u0098damaging\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that they amounted to \u00e2\u0080\u0098an abuse of judicial authority.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Back to Top  Sources of Historical InfluenceUsing our own backstage Ranking Analytics tools, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve compiled a list of the most influential figures concerning the issue of abortion in the U.S. between 1900 and 2020.

Wade set forth the federal precedent on abortion, the political and cultural orientation of individual states plays a major role in the funding, availability, and access to abortions at the local level. Moreover, groups who are opposed to the practice of abortion maintain a high level of political activity, pushing for legislation to limit or re-criminalize abortion. Within this context, there are essentially two distinct sides on the abortion issue.Pro-Life advocates typically support limits to the access or availability of abortion, and in many cases, support political candidates and legislative actions aimed at limiting, conditionally restricting, or altogether restricting the practice of abortion; whereasPro-Choice advocates typically support the precedent established by Roe v. Wade, that abortion is a constitutionally-protected privacy, and that women are entitled to autonomy over their bodies and reproductive rights.There is a great deal of political activity around this issue, with highly emotional and engaged participants on both sides of the debate. In fact, abortion remains among the most politicized issues in public discourse, with views dividing somewhat rigidly across party lines. The Republican Party identifies closely with the Pro-Life movement, with many of its candidates and priorities echoing the views of anti-abortion activist groups; whereas the Democratic Party identifies closely with the Pro-Choice movement, with many of its candidates and priorities echoing the views of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights activist groups.This divide tends to frame a wide range of directly or tangentially related political issues including debates over the freedom of religious expression, individual healthcare rights, and the appropriate distribution of public resources. The last of these issues\u00e2\u0080\u0093distribution of resource\u00e2\u0080\u0093is of particular importance in the ongoing push and pull over abortion. For 50 years, Roe v. Wade prevented states and municipalities from banning or criminalizing abortion. Still, many states have taken steps to limit abortions by creating obstructions to funding, access, and the availability of reproductive health services.And with the Supreme Court ruling in June of 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade, many of these same states have immediately enacted new laws restricting and criminalizing abortion.Again, consistent with the political divide that frames this issue, \u00e2\u0080\u009cred\u00e2\u0080\u009d states, those which tend to lean Republican in national politics, are most likely to take steps toward limiting abortion access, while \u00e2\u0080\u009cblue\u00e2\u0080\u009d states, those which tend to lean Democratic in national politics, are most likely to create and expand access to reproductive health services including abortion. Because this is an issue which stratifies so sharply across political lines, the legal and practical status of abortion in the U.S., and in individual states, is in constant dispute.Basic Facts About AbortionDespite some restrictive laws regarding abortion, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still considered the safest and most often performed medical procedure in the United States. Many Americans are debating the process\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequency, safety, and dependability as anti-abortion laws spread across the nation.Here is a thorough overview of what abortion in the United States looks like in the present day.Declining abortion ratesAbortions, despite battles over the issue, are very common in the United States. However, the overall number has been decreasing for years. Health professionals believe the decline results from increased awareness of unintended pregnancies and easier access to birth control.Abortions are thought to be very safe medical practicesSerious issues or consequences following an abortion are quite uncommon. The first trimester is the preferred time to have an abortion. There is substantially less chance of problems, such as infection, uterine perforation, or significant bleeding.Abortions often occur in younger women with financial incapability.The woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worry about being able to support the children they already have is the most frequently mentioned justification for induced abortion. Access to birth contraception is incredibly scarce in less affluent areas. As a result, more unexpected pregnancies and abortions are far more prevalent among poorer women.Types of abortion available.How far along your pregnancy is will usually determine which form of abortion you should have. However, there are currently two types of abortion: medication abortion and surgical abortion.The \u00e2\u0080\u009cabortion pill\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a kind of medication abortion in which a woman takes tablets to end the pregnancy by inducing the uterus to evacuate the developing fetus. A pharmaceutical abortion can be performed at home within the initial nine weeks of pregnancy.There are also surgical abortions, commonly known as in-clinic abortions, in which a medical specialist medically removes the pregnancy from the uterus using devices. Abortions performed surgically have been demonstrated to be almost always effective.ConclusionsContraception is widely used in nations where abortion is generally allowed. These nations frequently have developed healthcare systems and are wealthier overall. Thus, the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy is typically low. However, because abortion services are often accessible, a higher proportion of those pregnancies end in abortion.Contrarily, contraceptive use is typically low in nations with restrictive abortion laws. As a result, there are thousands of unwanted pregnancies. However, only a small portion of such pregnancies result in abortions, most likely because of limited abortion access.In the end, restrictive abortion regulations are not associated with a reduction in the number of abortions. Instead, those regulations are linked to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion, resulting in an abortion rate similar to that seen in nations where the procedure is available.Numerous studies have demonstrated that outlawing abortions does not affect their frequency. The requirement for a procedure still exists even after it is made unlawful. Women will hunt for abortion services to end their pregnancies, whether they are safe or not. Back to Top  A Quick Overview of Our MethodOur goal in presenting subjects that generate controversy is to provide you with a sense of some of the figures both past and present who have driven debate, produced widely-recognized works of research, literature, or art, proliferated their ideas widely, or who are identified directly and publicly with some aspect of this debate. By identifying the researchers, activists, journalists, educators, academics, and other individuals connected with this debate-and by taking a closer look at their work and contributions-we can get a clear but nuanced look at the subject matter. Rather than framing the issue as one side versus the other, we bring various dimensions of the issue into discussion with one another. This will likely include dimensions of the debate that resonate with you, some dimensions that you find repulsive, and some dimensions that might simply reveal a perspective you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t previously considered.On the subject of abortion, the debate requires us to consider those who align with both the Pro-Life and Pro-Choice movement, as well as those who may be termed as \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-abortion\u00e2\u0080\u009d and those who advocate for \u00e2\u0080\u009cabortion rights\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009creproductive rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also pertinent are those with a practical or symbolic connection to activist groups such as the Pro-Life organizations Defense of Life and March for Life, as well as those connected to key court cases (Roe v. Wade) and organizations (Planned Parenthood). These terms should deliver us to a nuanced understanding of some key influencers and their position in the public debate.Our InfluenceRanking engine gives us the power to scan the academic and public landscape surrounding the abortion issue using key terminology to identify consequential influencers. As with any topic that generates public debate and disagreement, this is a subject of great depth and breadth. We do not claim to probe either to the bottom of this depth or the borders of this breadth. Instead, we offer you one way to enter into this debate, to identify key players, and through their contributions to the debate, to develop a fuller understanding of the issue and perhaps even a better sense of where you stand.For a closer look at how our InfluenceRankings work, check out our methodology.Otherwise get started with a look at the key words we used to explore this subject: Back to Top  Key Terms in the Abortion ControversyAbortionAnti-AbortionPro-LifePro-ChoiceReproductive RightsPlanned ParenthoodAbortion RightsRoe v.

The \u00e2\u0080\u009cabortion\u00e2\u0080\u009d terminology generally yielded results centered around the Pro-Choice Movement, highlighting activists and physicians who have advocated for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights.InfluencersSusan Hill was an abortion rights activist from Durham, North Carolina. She was President of the National Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Organization in North Carolina, helping oversee a group of abortion clinics in the Southeast. She is most celebrated for her commitment to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights, with the National Organization for Women writing about Hill \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe went on to open the first abortion clinic in the state of Florida and was a founding member of both the National Abortion Federation and the National Coalition of Abortion Providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWarren Martin Hern, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D. is an American physician best known for performing late terminations of pregnancy. In 1973, he founded Boulder Abortion Clinic in Boulder, Colorado. Hern was a founding member of the National Abortion Federation, and authored Abortion Practice, a comprehensive text on operating and evaluating abortion facilities. He and doctors LeRoy Carhart, Shelley Sella, and Susan Robinson were the subject of the 2013 documentary After Tiller about the four providers openly advertising later abortions in the United States after the 2009 assassination of George Tiller.Lucinda Cisler is an American abortion rights activist, Second Wave feminist, and member of the New York-based radical feminist group the Redstockings. Her writings on unnecessary obstructions to medical abortion procedures in many ways predicted anti-abortion strategies in the 2010s, called |Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers by abortion rights advocates.Anti-AbortionAnti-abortion refers to the position taken by contingents of the Pro-Life movement. The results yielded by this terminology generally point to activists and physicians who have opposed the decriminalization of abortion, or who have taken efforts to restrict access and support laws aimed at limiting or re-criminalizing abortion.InfluencersLila Grace Rose is an American anti-abortion activist who is the founder and president of the anti-abortion organization Live Action. She has conducted undercover, investigative expos\u00c3\u00a9s of abortion facilities in the United States, including affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.Bernard N. Nathanson was an American medical doctor and co-founder in 1969 of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws - NARAL - later renamed National Abortion Rights Action League. He was also the former director of New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health, but later became an anti-abortion activist. He was the narrator for the controversial 1984 anti-abortion film The Silent Scream.David C. Reardon is an American electrical engineer and anti-abortion activist. He is the founder of the Elliot Institute, an anti-abortion advocacy group, and the author of a number of articles and books on abortion and mental health. Reardon was described in the New York Times Magazine as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoses\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpost-abortion movement\u00e2\u0080\u009d.Pro-LifePro-Life refers to the anti-abortion movement. Adherents to this viewpoint are often highly politically active, particularly as part of the Republican Party. The Pro-Life position is at once a political disposition in opposition to abortion and a reflection of the religious view that the life of a child begins at the time of conception. From this view, abortion is tantamount to infanticide. Many contingents of the Pro-Life movement also claim close connections to various religious communities, and most particularly to the Evangelical branch of Christianity. In many ways, the Pro-Life movement serves as the connective tissue between religious Evangelicals and the Republican Party, based on their shared opposition to abortion.InfluencersDestiny Herndon-De La Rosa is an American pro-life activist. She is the founder of the pro-life organization New Wave Feminists. She is also a frequent op-ed contributor for The Dallas Morning News.Paul Benno Marx, OSB was an American Roman Catholic priest and Benedictine monk, family sociologist, writer, and one of the leaders of the pro-life movement.

She published a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro-life, pro-family\u00e2\u0080\u009d newspaper, The Nebraska Family Times, widely circulated in northeast Nebraska. The newspaper was fundamentalist and theocratic, but not necessarily aimed at families that adhered to Quiverfull philosophy. She wrote articles for various publications for Christian homeschoolers. After leaving the movement, she began a blog No Longer Quivering, an online resource for women leaving Quiverfull or similar movements.Pro-ChoicePro-Choice refers to the viewpoint that abortion, and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights in general, are a matter of personal choice. The Pro-Choice movement is considered both a philosophy regarding reproductive rights and a political disposition regarding the constitutional right of women to privacy and bodily autonomy. The Pro-Choice movement is closely connected with the Democratic Party, and broadly supports candidates for office who work to protect a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to choose.InfluencersAnne Quesney is the director of the pro-choice campaign group Abortion Rights.
