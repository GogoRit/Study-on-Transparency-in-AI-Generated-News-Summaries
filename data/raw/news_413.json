Those seeking an abortion after this timeframe would have to travel to another state to obtain a legal abortion. Currently, 17 states have a similar gestational limit, which is more restrictive than the standard of viability established by Roe v. Wade.\nPerforming or attempting to perform a prohibited abortion in Colorado would be a Class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by a fine and 3-year suspension of state medical license. People on whom a prohibited abortion is performed would not be charged with a crime.\nOutcome: Rejected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo State Constitutional Right to Abortion: Louisiana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName: Amendment 1 (House Bill 425/Love Life Amendment)\nDescription: Adds language to the Louisiana state constitution clarifying that there is no right to abortion or abortion funding.\nImplications:\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, which holds that under the U.S. Constitution, abortion may not be banned before fetal viability, regulation of abortion would be returned to the states.\nStates that do not have constitutional or statutory provisions safeguarding abortion rights could further restrict or prohibit abortion.\nIf Roe v. Wade is overturned or a future Supreme Court decision gives states more leeway to enact restrictions on abortion, this constitutional amendment would open the door to future state legislation that could block or severely restrict access to abortion in Louisiana.\nOutcome: Approved\n\n\n\n\n\nSex Education in Public Schools: Washington\n\n\n\n\nName: Referendum 90 (Senate Bill 5395) \nDescription: Would require Washington public schools to provide comprehensive sexual health education for all students. The Washington legislature passed and the governor signed the law (SB 5395) in March 2020. Voters were asked whether to uphold or repeal the law.\nImplications:\n\nWashington state law does not currently require comprehensive sex education to be taught in public schools, though local school boards may choose to provide it.\nIf approved, the referendum would require public school students in Kindergarten through 12th grades to receive age-appropriate, comprehensive instruction in human development and reproduction, including affirmative consent and bystander training.\nWould require students to be excused if requested by their parents.\nOutcome: Approved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaid Family and Medical Leave: Colorado\n\n\n\n\n\nName: Proposition 118\nDescription: Establishes a paid family and medical leave insurance program that provides up to 12 weeks of job-protected, paid leave for qualified reasons including to care for own serious health condition or that of a family member, and to care for a new child. Additional 4 weeks provided for pregnancy or childbirth complications. Funded through a payroll tax evenly split between employers and employees.\nImplications:\n\nIt is estimated that 80% of Coloradans currently do not have access to paid family and medical leave. An estimated 2.6 million Coloradans would benefit from this program.\nBenefit covers 90% of average weekly wage for those who earn 50% or less of the state average, and up to 50% for those that earn more than 50% of the state average.\nWorkers who elect coverage are eligible for paid leave after earning $2,500, but must have worked for the employer for at least 6 months for job protection. Covered employees would retain their employer-sponsored health insurance if they were already enrolled. Local governments may opt out of the program, but employees may still elect coverage. Employers with fewer than 10 employees would be exempt from paying the premium, though covered employees would still have access to the benefit. Self-employed individuals are also eligible.\nOutcome: Approved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking Forward\nInitiatives that seek to restrict access to abortion may garner renewed attention and urgency if a new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court rules to permit more state regulations of abortion or to overturn Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion and allowing states to make their own policies regarding abortion access. Alternatively, this could encourage some states to seek to affirm abortion rights. Additionally, the coronavirus pandemic has put a spotlight on the importance of paid leave, and state legislative efforts or ballot initiatives creating paid sick and family leave programs are likely to continue even after the pandemic subsides.\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nWomen's Health Policy\n\n\n\nTags\n\nElections\nReproductive Health\nAbortion\nPaid Leave\nFamily Planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso of Interest\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 2020 Presidential Election: Implications for Women\u2019s Health\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tState Policies Protecting or Restricting Legal Status of Abortion\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tState Sex and HIV Education Policy\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tState Policies on Paid Family and Sick Leave\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElection 2020 Resources\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tGet The Latest On Health Policy\t\t\n\n\t\t\tSign Up For Email Alerts\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tYour Email Address\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tSign Up\t\n\n\nTopics\n\nAffordable Care Act\nCOVID-19\nGlobal Health Policy\nHealth Costs\nHIV/AIDS\nMedicaid\nMedicare\nMental Health\nPatient and Consumer Protections\nPrivate Insurance\nRacial Equity and Health Policy\nUninsured\nWomen\u2019s Health Policy\n\n\nSections\n\nPolling\nState Health Facts\nGraphics & Interactives\nCharts & Slides\nKFF Health News\nSocial Impact Media\nPeterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\n\nNewsroom\n\nNews Releases\nEvents\nSubscribe to Emails\nCite Us/Reprint\nMedia Contacts\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nFrom Drew Altman\nOur People\nOur Programs\nKFF Board\nContact Us\nSupport Our Work\nJoin Our Team\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nFollow Us\n\nEmail Alerts\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nThreads\nX\nRSS Feeds\nYouTube\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 KFF\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPowered by WordPress VIP \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCitations and Reprints\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKFF Headquarters: 185 Berry St., Suite 2000, San Francisco, CA 94107 | Phone 650-854-9400\t\t\n\t\tWashington Offices and Barbara Jordan Conference Center: 1330 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005 | Phone 202-347-5270\t\nwww.kff.org | Email Alerts: kff.org/email | facebook.com/KFF | twitter.com/kff\n\nThe independent source for health policy research, polling, and news, KFF is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
