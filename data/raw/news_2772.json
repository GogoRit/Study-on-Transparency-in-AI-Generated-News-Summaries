Would you call them murderers and have them thrown in jail?Lydia HolmIowa View contributorAnti-abortion voters are single issue voters. They don\u2019t change their minds. That\u2019s the thinking anyway \u2014 \u201cpro-life\u201d on one side, \u201cpro-choice\u201d on the other, and no room in the middle. But sometimes people do change. This is the story of my evolution.I was raised Catholic. As a teenager, I was 100% in the \u201cAbortion is murder, ought to be completely illegal\u201d camp. I attended a rally at the State Capitol and carried a gruesome sign, totally convinced we were in the right. I met some other pro-life teens and we picketed a Planned Parenthood the next weekend.The issue was black and white for me. I didn\u2019t think much about the women coming and going at the clinic. I hope I didn\u2019t yell at any of them.I wasn\u2019t able to vote yet, but if I\u2019d been able to vote in the 1988 election, I might have voted Republican, solely on the issue of abortion. I agreed with the Democrats on basically everything else, and I thought this was consistent with being a Catholic. I was against the death penalty, in favor of programs to help the poor and extend health care coverage. But that one issue might have made the difference.REGISTER EDITORIAL:Women's stories remind us why Roe saved livesI wasn\u2019t active in the anti-abortion movement after those couple of instances, but I continued to believe in it through college.\u00a0Then I went to medical school.\u00a0Once we started clinical rotations, there was an option to excuse yourself from participation in abortions, and I opted out. This was the only medical procedure with that choice. For example, I trained in the pre-Viagra era and scrubbed in on several operations on men to allow them to have erections.It was on the OB/GYN\u00a0rotation that I started to see things differently. There was a woman who was terminating a pregnancy. I don\u2019t remember exactly how far along she was, but into the second trimester. The fetus had anomalies incompatible with survival. She was devastated. This was a wanted pregnancy.\u00a0I stayed, I held her hand. And a light bulb went off in my head. How could I judge this lady? I couldn\u2019t and I didn\u2019t, and right then it dawned on me that for all of the women facing termination of a pregnancy I didn\u2019t know, and no one but the woman knows, what led her to the decision. If it was understandable in this case, who was I to judge what was understandable in any other case?One in four American women will have an abortion by the time they are 45. That means that among people you know, your friends, and your\u00a0relatives and loved ones, there are women who have had an abortion. Would you call them murderers and have them thrown in jail?Starting around the last election, the lie that abortions happen up to the moment of birth and that somehow the Democratic Party was in favor of infanticide became popular. What? That is not true. It\u2019s not real. Where did this come from? Thinking about that reminded me of another family I\u2019ll never forget.\u00a0I was in the NICU and a baby was admitted with multiple abnormalities. She was a beautiful baby, and the parents had no prenatal warning anything was wrong. After some testing we determined what the problem was, and unfortunately it was severe. She wouldn\u2019t live long, even with intervention. So we talked with her parents. We could either put her on a ventilator, feed with tubes, do multiple surgeries, or we could make her comfortable and not intervene. They chose the latter, and after a couple of days she stopped breathing and died in her mother\u2019s arms.\u00a0That\u2019s infanticide? No. Of course it\u2019s not. These decisions are complicated. They\u2019re personal, and they should not be dictated by the government.\u00a0Abortions still happened in high numbers in the pre-Roe v. Wade era, but women died.\u00a0I\u2019m a pediatric emergency room doctor now, and I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to see teenage girls with sepsis, bleeding, and death from complications of illegal abortions. The best way to reduce the abortion rate is to improve access to birth control, health care for women, and child care.Please, when you think about this issue, think about the women you know. Trust them, and don\u2019t judge.Dr. Lydia Holm is a pediatric\u00a0emergency medicine physician and mother of four boys.
