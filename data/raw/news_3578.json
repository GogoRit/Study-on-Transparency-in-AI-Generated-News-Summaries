More than 100 crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), pro-life organizations and churches have been attacked, some more than once, since the May 2 leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade.    Fox News Digital previously reported that while more than a dozen attacks have been claimed by the left-wing pro-abortion group Jane\u2019s Revenge, not a single member of the underground group has been arrested.According to a list updated this month by the Family Research Council (FRC), a Christian nonprofit, at least 38 churches across the country have been firebombed, smashed, ransacked or vandalized with pro-abortion graffiti and threatening messages since the May 2 leak.  At least 58 other pro-life clinics and organizations suffered the same fate, according to the same report.  The Lennon Pregnancy Center in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, was vandalized with its windows smashed and walls spray-painted. (Lennon Pregnancy Center)  ZERO ARRESTS IN AT LEAST 17 JANE'S REVENGE ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE ORGANIZATIONS  An ongoing list by conservative nonprofit lobbying group Catholic Vote, which was updated as recently as Monday, revealed that some organizations have been attacked more than once. The list also included instances of vandalism against five additional CPCs that were not named in FRC's report, including Expectant Mother Care Frontline in New York, Northfield Women\u2019s Clinic in Minnesota, Arches New Hope Pregnancy Center in Utah,\u00a0Abria Pregnancy Resources in Minnesota, and Compassion & Hope Pregnancy Center in Idaho.There were at least 23 \"other incidents\" listed by the FRC in which pro-abortion protesters were arrested or pro-life individuals were physically attacked since the May 2 leak.  ABORTION RANKS 7TH AS MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO LATINO VOTERS, BEHIND ECONOMY AND BORDER: POLLOne of those incidents resulted in seven students at a New Jersey high school being reportedly suspended after physically assaulting a student holding a pro-life sign at a pro-abortion protest during a school board meeting on May 23.  On May 3, pro-life college students who support Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake were reportedly spat upon during a pro-choice rally at the Arizona Capitol.  The group Jane's Revenge claimed responsibility for vandalizing this pro-life pregnancy center in Minneapolis. (Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life)    On May 2, the Students for Life chapter at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis reported that their pro-life memorial was vandalized.In July, Heidi Matzke, the president of Alternatives Pregnancy Center in California, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that a man armed with a machete approached her clinic earlier that month, prompting her to hire additional security and fortify the clinic's walls and doors.  Heidi Matzke, the director of Alternatives Pregnancy Center in California, said that her pro-life crisis pregnancy center has been targeted with graffiti and attempted violence. (Senate Judiciary Committee)Not included in either the FRC\u2019s or Catholic Vote\u2019s lists is the high-profile arrest of Nicholas John Roske, a California man who was carrying a gun, ammunition and a knife when he was apprehended by police outside the Maryland home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.    Roske, who is charged with attempted murder of a federal judge, told investigators that he was upset about Kavanaugh\u2019s positions on Roe v. Wade and that he planned to break into the justice\u2019s home, murder him and then commit suicide.TREATING ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES STILL LEGAL IN STATES WHERE ABORTION BANNED, DESPITE VIRAL MISINFORMATIONThe Federal Bureau of Investigation first told Fox News Digital in June that it had launched an investigation into the targeted attacks against pro-life organizations and churches.  When reached by Fox News Digital on Wednesday, the FBI repeated a statement it gave in September, saying it was still investigating the \"series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the US Supreme Court.\"    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"The incidents are being investigated as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act violations or violent crime matters, depending on the facts of each case,\" the FBI said. \"The FBI takes all violence and threats of violence very seriously, and we are working closely with our law enforcement partners at the national, state and local levels to investigate these incidents.\"  \"There's a right way under our First Amendment to express yourself and violence and destruction of property is not it. And that's what the rule of law is all about. And we have seen a number of attacks against faith-based organizations pregnancy resource centers,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray told Fox News in July.Fox News' David Spunt contributed reporting\u00a0  Jessica Chasmar is an editor on the politics team for Fox News and Fox Business.
