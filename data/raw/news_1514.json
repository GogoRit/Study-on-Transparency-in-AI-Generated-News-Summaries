Last June, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its historic opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case, overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving the legality of abortion up to individual states, that little-known Wisconsin law went into effect. \n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat law \u2014 which was written just one year after Wisconsin became a state \u2014 effectively bans abortions. It quickly became the focus of countless protests across the state when it went back into effect last year, as many decried it as being antiquated. A challenge to the law is being heard in Dane County Circuit Court now, and could be making its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. At WPR, we\u2019ve been researching how, and why, that law was passed, and what it means for people today. WPR reporters have spent months looking into what was happening in Wisconsin, and across the nation, regarding abortion when the law was passed.While the letter of the law in Wisconsin remains the same, the medical understanding of abortion and moral debate around it is fundamentally different now than it was at the time the law was made. \nAn abortion-rights activist reacts outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Friday, June 24, 2022.\u00a0The\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0has ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years in a decision by its conservative majority to overturn\u00a0Roe v. Wade. Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo\nAbortion in the 1800s Finding out you were pregnant in 1849 looked very different than it does in 2023. There were no pregnancy tests, so missing your period was only a first sign. It wasn\u2019t until you could feel the baby kicking that you would know for sure.Still, people at that time who didn\u2019t want to be pregnant had options. There were people who would perform abortions \u2014 \u201cabortionists,\u201d doctors, midwives \u2014 and there were also well-known home remedies. Historians agree that people sought abortions at the time Wisconsin first passed an abortion ban \u2014 in fact, it may have been quite common. According to historian James Mohr, a history professor at the University of Oregon and the author of \u201cAbortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy,\u201d abortion rates were increasing throughout the 19th century across the nation.\u201cIt was very widespread,\u201d he said. \nKimberly Reilly, history and women\u2019s and gender studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\u00a0Matthew Lindsay\nStill, abortion was a different experience in the mid-1800s than it is today. While abortions could be performed by doctors or \u201cabortionists,\u201d they were often carried out at home, said Kimberly Reilly, history and women\u2019s and gender studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Some home medical journals had instructions for \u201crestoring the menses\u201d or remedying \u201cthe most serious form of female complaint,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody would know what you meant by it.\u201dWithout pregnancy tests or ultrasounds to prove someone was pregnant, some historians say people in this time may not have considered early abortion to be ending a pregnancy, per se. \u201cThe lines that we have today, these really kind of bright lines, are just kind of blurred at that point,\u201d said Reilly. If there was a bright line, it was the mother feeling those fetal movements. This was known as \u201cquickening\u201d and was significant both medically and legally at the time.  Wisconsin\u2019s law was part of national effort to \u2018professionalize\u2019 medicineWisconsin officially became a state in 1848, and the first prohibitions on abortion in Wisconsin were introduced in a bill relating to homicide just one year later, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. According to Mohr, there were a number of states passing laws that restricted abortion throughout the mid-1800s, including Michigan, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York and Massachusetts.\nJames Mohr, history professor at the University of Oregon and the author of \u201cAbortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy.\u201d Photo courtesy James Mohr\nWisconsin\u2019s abortion law, which was narrowly passed by the Assembly on March 10, 1849, as a part of a bill related to homicide, used almost the exact language of a Michigan law. This was happening, of course, at a time before women had the right to vote.Mohr calls the spread of abortion bans a \u201cmedically-driven crusade.\u201d In the nascent days of the American Medical Association, physicians were attempting to crack down on medicine being performed by people outside their ranks, and that included performing abortions. \u201cThere was an effort to try to make abortion illegal and especially to drive what the \u2026 so-called regular physicians regarded as quacks from the field, on the grounds that they were dangerous and they were hurting women,\u201d he said. The \u2018quickening doctrine\u2019Under Wisconsin\u2019s original 1849 abortion ban, abortion was only illegal after quickening. The law deemed \u201cthe willful killing of an unborn quick child\u201d to be manslaughter. A number of states\u2019 early abortion bans followed the so-called \u201cquickening doctrine,\u201d or the idea that terminating a pregnancy before quickening was not a criminal act. \u201cSince quickening was the accepted proof of pregnancy, in effect these laws did not ban abortions in the first half of pregnancy,\u201d Mohr said. But a key change to Wisconsin law in 1858 made it into what remains on the books today \u2014 a ban of virtually all abortions no matter the gestational age. Looking back at that history, Reilly said she was \u201cimmediately struck by the deep irony\u201d that people between 1849 and 1858 had more rights to terminate a pregnancy than they do under today\u2019s law in Wisconsin. A key change shapes today\u2019s abortion banThe shift away from the quickening doctrine in Wisconsin is largely credited to state Senate clerk, physician and abolitionist William Henry Brisbane. Brisbane was born in South Carolina in 1806 and eventually settled in Arena, Wisconsin. Historians believe he was responsible for removing the word \u201cquick\u201d from the law, turning it into the abortion ban that we have today. \nWilliam Brisbane in 1853. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images\nIn 1857, Brisbane wrote to leading anti-abortionist Horatio Robinson Storer that he intended \u201cto get a law passed by our Legislature to meet the case, much too common, of administering drugs and injections either to prevent conception or destroy the embryo,\u201d according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. The law was changed in 1858, and Brisbane claimed credit for pushing the change through in an 1859 letter. Still, Brisbane\u2019s exact motivation remains murky and may be lost to history. Brigid Nannenhorn is a UW-Madison doctoral student researching abortion history in the state. She said his writings available at the Wisconsin Historical Society archives don\u2019t provide any clues. \u201cIn his diaries, he talks about anti-slavery, he talks about temperance, he talks about gambling,\u201d she said. \u201cHe does not mention abortion, he does not mention miscarriage, infanticide.\u201d Although Brisbane was a pastor, Mohr said a religious drive to restrict abortion would have been unique at the time. Most of the political movement was driven by the desire to professionalize medicine, he said. \u201cIt is almost impossible for Americans today to think of abortion as an issue that was not tied to religion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the 19th century, it was not tied very closely to religion. That is, it was a medical question. It was not a religious or a moral question.\u201d Brisbane was likely so influential due to his position as clerk. \u201cPeople like Brisbane get the ear of the committee,\u201d Mohr said.Abortion wasn\u2019t a major political issue that captivated the public the way it is today, he said. \u201cThese were not public campaigns,\u201d Mohr said. \u201cThey were campaigns conducted by elite physicians, who had the ear of legislatures, and were able to suggest that this was necessary legislation.\u201d The ban remains  In the years following 1858, the law was never taken off the books, which is why all abortion providers immediately ceased operations in the state last summer. Just days after the Dobbs decision, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit seeking to repeal the law. The case could ultimately be decided by the state Supreme Court, which has its first liberal majority in 15 years after Justice Janet Protasiewicz was seated Aug. 1.
