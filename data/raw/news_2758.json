The initiating committee says they turned in 5,876 signatures gathered mainly through signature-collection efforts at numerous Lubbock churches.\u00a0In the last municipal election in May 2018, only\u00a014,604 votes were cast in the city-wide mayoral election. Twenty-five percent of that is 3,651\u00a0signatures.The city secretary's office has been cross-checking these signatures, and if there are enough valid signatures from registered voters, the city will validate the petition\u00a0and it'll be accepted by the city council. Becky Garza, Lubbock's City Secretary, says her office should be ready to announce its findings this week.If Garza's office deems the petition valid, the city charter says the city council has 30 days to vote on the sanctuary city for the unborn ordinance. Sometime before the vote,\u00a0the city council is required to host a public hearing.\u00a0Garza says the next city council meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 27 is too soon to schedule the public hearing. She says there's a chance the public hearing could be at the following meeting on Monday, Nov. 2 (council meetings are getting moved up a week in November because of Thanksgiving).\u00a0Garza said agendas are usually finalized two weeks prior to meetings, and scheduling it Nov. 2 would\u00a0be a really quick turnaround since agendas are sent out the Fridays before meetings.The City Council could also call a special meeting any day to host a public hearing. Regardless of when, the ordinance will need to be voted on by the city council within 30 days.\u00a0If the city council votes the ordinance down, the city charter simply says the initiating committee \"may require that such\u00a0ordinance or resolution, either in its original or amended form,\u00a0be submitted to a vote of the electors for adoption or repeal.\"Garza said her interpretation of the charter is that if the city council votes no on the ordinance, the initiating committee that filed the petition will have 20 days to file a certified statement requesting the ordinance be put to a public vote. That's it.\"The council can't say yes or no - that's not up to the council at that point,\" Garza said. \"Their job at that point is ministerial... Our charter allows for that\"A special election would be called in the next uniform election date in accordance with state law, which is in May 2021.If the signatures collected at Lubbock's large churches are valid, it would trigger this series of steps outlined in the city charter that was written in the early 1900's.Citizens would vote on an ordinance the city's legal counsel says raises multiple legal concerns.Is it constitutional?Dr. Joe Pojman of Texas Alliance for Life, a statewide non-profit organization of people committed to protecting the fundamental right to life from conception until natural death, according to its website, is a statewide pro-life figure who came out against the ordinance earlier this week.\u00a0Pojman applauded the movement and the\u00a0overall effort. He said he's vehemently opposed to Planned Parenthood coming to Lubbock and hopes the citizens of Lubbock continue to protest it, and that the protesters are successful in closing Planned Parenthood's doors. He said the State of Texas provides resources for women's health services available outside of Planned Parenthood.Pojman said he strongly respects State Sen.\u00a0Charles Perry, the Lubbock Republican who's helping lead the ordinance; Pojman said\u00a0Perry earned their \"Courageous Defense of Life\" award.However, Pojman believes\u00a0this ordinance will not save a single baby from an abortion, and says\u00a0there's a risk this ordinance moves the pro-life cause backwards, not forwards. Pojman said there's a right way to fight for pro-life causes, and he said that's done at the federal and state level, not the city.If this passes, Pojman expects the city to lose money and time defending the ordinance until it gets ruled unconstitutional.\"As someone who has been around on the scene for more than three decades, I do not expect to see any silver bullet that is\u00a0going to end the practice of abortions,\" Pojman said. \"A local ordinance or a state law that bans abortions immediately is not going to stop abortions. It has been tried many times and none of those work. We need more votes on the Supreme Court who are willing to take a fresh look at Roe v. Wade.\"Pojman said the courts will not let states or municipalities ban abortions under Roe v. Wade. He said that's the reality, and he called that reality awful and tragic.The sanctuary city for the unborn\u00a0ordinance\u00a0says, \"It shall be unlawful for any person to procure or perform an abortion of any type and at any stage of pregnancy in the City of Lubbock, Texas.\"There are\u00a0two mechanisms of enforcement, which are identified as public and private. The private enforcement mechanism says a person who provides and abortion can be sued for emotional distress by any member of the women's family, including\u00a0grandparents, siblings and half-siblings.The public enforcement makes it a criminal act to provide or aid and abet an abortion, and it shall be subject to the maximum penalty permitted under Texas law for the violation of a municipal ordinance. The penalty for public enforcement may not be imposed unless one of several identified\u00a0court changes occurs, one of which is the overruling of Roe v. Wade.Private enforcement and the threat of many lawsuits on someone who performs an abortion is how it would mainly be enforced if it were to pass.Mark Lee Dickson is the\u00a0director of Right to Life East Texas and the author of the ordinance who's been pushing for the ordinance in the Lubbock area. The ordinance has been passed now in 16 municipalities in Texas, most recently in New Home and Morton.\u00a0\u00a0None of the towns that have adopted the ordinance have an abortion provider. The largest city to adopt the ordinance so far is Big Spring.A new Planned Parenthood\u00a0is opening in Lubbock on Monday, and the Planned Parenthood intends to start offering abortion services sometime next year.Dickson has refuted the list of red flags raised\u00a0by Lubbock's legal counsel, the Houston-based law firm Olson\u00a0&\u00a0Olson, and\u00a0Pojman. He stands by the legality of the ordinance.\"Unborn children are worth fighting for at every level of government, including the local level,\" Dickson says.Dickson says the ordinance is consistent with Texas Law. He says the State of Texas has never repealed its pre-Roe v. Wade statutes that outlaw and criminalize abortions unless the mother's life is in danger. He also makes the argument for Home Rule.\u00a0\"Since the entirety of the Lubbock Ordinance is consistent with the current laws of the State of Texas, the City of Lubbock is fully within its authority to pass the ordinance outlawing abortion within the city limits of Lubbock, Texas,\" Dickson says. \"I encourage the City of Lubbock and Olson & Olson to be consistent and not ignore State Law on this issue.\"Richard Rosen, a law professor\u00a0at\u00a0Texas Tech, says federal law overrides state law. Rosen is a scholar of the U.S. Constitution\u00a0who began teaching at the Texas Tech School of Law\u00a0after a distinguished career\u00a0as an officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the\u00a0U. S. Army.Rosen has discussed the ordinance with the Avalanche-Journal several times. Throughout the conversations, he has described the ordinance as clever, and fascinating. After he was sent the ordinance, Rosen studied it for more than a week before he felt he could\u00a0talk about it.\"Is this constitutional? I don't think it is. I don't know under what theory it's constitutional,\" Rosen said. \"The Texas Constitution doesn't override the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution is supreme. Roe v. Wade applies to the states.\"Rosen says he's not an expert in Texas law, but his understanding is the state does recognize the practice of abortions by way of the state's health and safety code. Chapter 171 of the Texas Health and Safety Code sets out the rules and regulations regarding abortions.\"What this ordinance does is, it kind of overlooks the state statute,\" Rosen said. \"Doctors could comply with everything that the state lays out, and they could still be held liable. And that doesn't make sense to me.\"He says the ordinance is \"clever\" because in a way it seeks end-around Roe v. Wade by imposing damages on doctors, and allowing many family members to\u00a0sue for emotional relief.\u00a0But Rosen says these family members could not ordinarily prevent the woman from getting an abortion. Even a husband may not override his wife's decision to abort a pregnancy.Based on a decision of the controlling U.S. court of appeals, he also says doctors have no standing to challenge this ordinance on its face, meaning doctors can't challenge the ordinance on the basis of Roe v. Wade until they've been sued. This is likely why the\u00a0ordinance hasn't been challenged in the small towns that have adopted the ordinance \u2014 because there's no abortion provider to sue.Rosen also says cases would not immediately go to federal court. He said the lawsuit\u00a0would get ruled on by the state, appealed and then go through the whole system. Rosen said it would be a drawn-out process with a lot of legal fees.\u00a0Rosen thinks this may be the intent of the ordinance \u2014 the threat of years of legal fees as a deterrent to someone like Planned Parenthood.\u00a0After giving his legal opinion, Rosen said he doesn't want to minimize anybody's beliefs or efforts in the matter. Rosen said he understands there are\u00a0deep feelings about abortions on both sides \u2014 he just expressed his legal opinion.Thoughts from the city councilMayor Dan Pope has fielded the bulk of the questions related to the ordinance,\u00a0but the fact of the matter is the mayor can't bring the ordinance to a council vote. It takes two members of the city council to place an ordinance on an agenda.The Avalanche-Journal contacted each member of the city council this week, and the three who returned messages did not speak in favor of the ordinance.Councilwoman Latrelle Joy, a retired lawyer,\u00a0provided a statement reiterating\u00a0the oath she took: \"As a City Council Member and as an attorney licenses to practice law by the State Bar of Texas, I will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State.\"Councilman Steve Massengale said\u00a0legal counsel has informed them it's not a legal and enforceable ordinance. Whether he believes in what the ordinance seeks to do isn't the issue \u2014 Massengale said it'll be void the moment it passes.Massengale also defended the mayor.\"I find it frustrating, because there's seven of us up there that make these decisions,\" Massengale said. \"I think unfairly, the mayor has been the target of this because it's an election year and he ended up with an opponent. I think I could have equally been a target, had I had an opponent in the race.\"Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Griffith also said he can't let personal beliefs get in the way of the rule of law. He said the city doesn't need to be involved in this. He also said it's not enforceable.Griffith asked the question,\u00a0if Roe v. Wade were to get overturned, does anybody think the state government would let municipalities decide abortion laws? He very much doubts it. He said the state would say it's a state issue.At a news\u00a0conference Friday where Planned Parenthood announced they're opening in Lubbock on Monday, Sarah Wheat of Planned Parenthood said they're watching this ordinance closely.\"We're tracking the discussions that are happening here at the city level about whether or not to restrict access to abortion services,\" Wheat said. \"We're very familiar with efforts to ban abortion, or to restrict access so that it's inaccessible to most people... We're here and we're committed to making those services available to those who need it.\"The Lubbock City Council and legal experts may not think this is an ordinance with legal standing, but in the end, it may be up to the citizens to decide.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.lubbockonline.com.
