Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.ArrowRightFrank Pavone, the national director of the group Priests for Life, was laicized for \u201cblasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,\u201d according to a letter from Pope Francis\u2019s representative to the United States obtained by the Associated Press. The letter was dated Dec. 13 and was sent to American bishops to alert them of the Vatican\u2019s decision.The letter was first reported Saturday by the Catholic News Agency. Its authenticity was confirmed to The Washington Post by a source close to multiple U.S. bishops.Pavone, the national director of the group Priests for Life, has addressed crowds at the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., and sits on the board of directors for the National Association of Christian Lawmakers (NACL). He participated in 2016 and 2020 in pro-Trump Catholic groups working in tandem with the former president\u2019s campaigns. He appeared on his social media platforms in a red MAGA hat.AdvertisementSuch partisan activism is almost never seen by Catholic clergy.Within the antiabortion movement, Pavone is known for the incendiary statements he makes online, which often go beyond what many mainstream antiabortion advocates say publicly. For example, he has spoken about his belief that abortion is never necessary to save a mother\u2019s life.He is most widely known among Catholics, for whom he is a polarizing figure at a time when the U.S. church seems divided between pro- and anti-Trump believers, between people who can\u2019t believe a Catholic president who supports abortion rights can be given Communion and those who think an alliance with Trump is heretical.A Catholic priest put an aborted fetus on the altar in an appeal for Donald TrumpCharles Camosy, a moral theologian at the Creighton University School of Medicine who writes often about abortion, noted that Pavone has been controversial for many years, and that he became more so in 2016, when two days before the presidential election he posted a live video on Facebook of an aborted fetus laid out on a table that he was using like an altar. In the video, he said a vote for Hillary Clinton was for \u201cchild killing\u201d and one for Trump and the Republicans was for protecting children.Advertisement\u201cOver the years, and especially since 2015, he seemed to get consumed by secular politics. But he is certainly not alone in that,\u201d Camosy said. His laicization \u201cis a long time coming, actually.\u201dBen Shapiro is headlining the March for Life. As a pro-lifer, I think that\u2019s a huge mistake.The Rev. Patrick Mahoney, a Presbyterian pastor active on social causes including the antiabortion movement, said Monday that Pavone is an \u201cicon\u201d and mentor to many antiabortion activists. Even if some \u2014 like Mahoney himself \u2014 struggle with Pavone\u2019s activism for Trump, he said the former priest seemed the victim of a double standard.\u201cWhy is Father Frank laicized, when you have other priests who clearly support doctrines not in line with the Catholic Church? Same-sex marriage, being pro-choice, pro-LGBT, whatever it might be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is confusion and anger. \u2026 the fault lines are being drawn right now in a major battle between orthodox and conservative Catholics and more progressive Catholics and especially the authority of Pope Francis.\u201dAdvertisementPavone\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t entirely clear Monday. The letter sent by Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope\u2019s representative to the United States, to bishops included a statement they could use to discuss the laicization with their members, but the statement wasn\u2019t signed.In a statement Monday, Pavone still referred to himself as \u201cFather Pavone\u201d and said his work would not be \u201cdeterred in any way.\u201dHe has been associated with several dioceses over the years and it isn\u2019t clear who his superior is at this time. The statement that accompanied Pierre\u2019s letter says Priests for Life \u201cisn\u2019t a Catholic organization.\u201d He was under the Diocese of Amarillo in 2016, when the bishop there, Patrick Zurek, said his use of a fetus was \u201cagainst the dignity of human life\u201d and \u201cnot consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Church.\u201dAdvertisementPavone could not immediately be reached for comment.Conservatives seek jail time for pill 'trafficking'Pavone said in a video posted online soon after news broke of his dismissal that he has been \u201cpersecuted\u201d by the Catholic Church for decades.In a 26-page letter posted on the Priests for Life website, Pavone outlines what he calls a \u201cSummary of How Fr. Frank and Priests for Life Have Been Treated by Some in the Hierarchy.\u201d\u201cInstead of supporting and encouraging the pro-life work of the Church, some of these men try to obstruct and hinder it, and abuse their authority to try to intimidate priests and laity who make ending abortion the top priority of our lives,\u201d Pavone wrote. \u201c... Cancel culture is alive and well in the Catholic Church.\u201dPavone has been censured by high-ranking leaders including Zurek.After the 2016 video, Zurek opened an investigation.AdvertisementZurek suspended him from activities outside that diocese in 2011, citing \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about the stewardship and alleged lack of transparency around the money being raised by Priests for Life. Recent 990 forms show the group raised more than $9 million in 2019 and again in 2020.\u201cIt seems that (Father Pavone\u2019s) fame has caused him to see priestly obedience as an inconvenience to his unique status,\u201d Zurek wrote to other bishops in 2011, according to the Catholic Review, the Baltimore Archdiocese\u2019s news service.U.S. abortion access, reproductive rightsTracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v.
