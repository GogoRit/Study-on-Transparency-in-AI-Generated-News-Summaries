Wade, ending nearly 50 years of federal protection for abortion, some states began enforcing strict abortion bans while others became new havens for the procedure.

When faced with a patient\u2019s high-risk condition, doctors should be required to \u201cpause and wait this out and see how it goes.\u201d\nTop Republicans like Gov. Bill Lee have defended the state\u2019s abortion law, one of the strictest in the country, as providing \u201cmaximum protection possible for both mother and child.\u201d But currently, the ban has no explicit exceptions, not even for the pregnant patient\u2019s health.\n\n\n\nIt only includes an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d for emergencies, a rare legal mechanism that means the burden is on the doctor to prove abortion care was necessary because the patient risked death or irreversible impairment to a major bodily function.\nThe penalties for getting it wrong are three to 10 years in prison and up to $15,000 in fines. Doctors could expect to lose their medical license just for being charged. Concern over how the unprecedented law will be interpreted by prosecutors and the courts has already resulted in patients with high-risk conditions having to rush across state lines for care.\nSome Republicans are proposing a modest change. An amendment to the law introduced in the House Population Health Subcommittee last week would remove the affirmative defense and clarify that it is not a crime to terminate a pregnancy to prevent an emergency that threatens the pregnant patient\u2019s life or health, among other provisions.\n\u201cNo one wants to tell their spouse, child or loved one that their life is not important in a medical emergency as you watch them die when they could have been saved,\u201d said Republican Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, a nurse and the bill\u2019s sponsor.\nBut the word \u201cprevent\u201d is a sticking point for the anti-abortion groups who wrote the law.\n\u201cThat would mean that the emergency hasn\u2019t even occurred yet,\u201d Brewer told the committee. He made a distinction between immediate, urgent emergencies \u2014 \u201cA patient comes into the ER bleeding out\u201d \u2014 and what he calls \u201cquasi-elective\u201d abortions.\nBrewer, who has no medical experience, defined those as \u201cabortions that aren\u2019t necessary to be done in the moment but are still performed in an effort to prevent a future medical emergency.\u201d He called for an \u201cobjective\u201d standard.\n\n\n\nWhen reached for comment, Brewer said his statements as summarized by ProPublica had been mischaracterized but did not provide additional details. \u201cEnding the life of the baby should not be used as treatment for non-life-threatening conditions or to prevent some unknown possibility in the future,\u201d he said. He did not respond to follow-up questions seeking clarification.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said laws that try to limit or define medical exceptions are dangerous because they interfere with a doctor\u2019s ability to assess fast-moving health indicators in unpredictable situations and don\u2019t account for people\u2019s different thresholds for risk.\nKim Fortner, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist practicing in Tennessee for more than 20 years, testified to the committee and pushed back on Brewer\u2019s characterizations. She described a patient she saw recently whose water broke too early \u2014 the fetus still had a heartbeat, but there was virtually no chance it would survive and a very high risk the patient would get an infection.\nBut because of the law, the woman was sent home without the option of abortion care. She came back with emergency bleeding and sepsis, a life-threatening infection.\n\u201cIt is not always so clear, and things don\u2019t always just work themselves out,\u201d Fortner said. \u201cIt is a significant, in my mind, misuse of resources, if she did not need to have six units of blood that could have gone to the trauma victim or the gunshot wound. Blood is a limited resource. Just because she can wait and come back in and she still lives to talk about it today \u2014 one, that won\u2019t always happen, and two, it also is a significant misuse of an ICU bed. It is a preventable occurrence.\u201d\nAndy Farmer, a Republican state representative, agreed with her.\n\u201cThese things need to be addressed early on,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want doctors to feel they needed to consult a lawyer before offering care that could stop a condition from progressing into an emergency.\nBrewer, however, said he believed giving doctors that kind of power would be too subjective. \u201cOnce one doctor is let off the hook in a criminal trial, it would be open season for other doctors who wanted to perform bad faith terminations,\u201d he said.\nBrewer\u2019s position appears to be out of step with public opinion on abortion, even in a deeply red state. A recent poll found about 75% of Tennesseans support abortion exceptions, including for pregnancies caused by rape and incest.\nYet his organization exerts outsize influence on Republican state politics. Tennessee Right to Life issues an annual scorecard rating lawmakers on their fealty to \u201cpro-life\u201d positions and plows money into primary campaigns to unseat candidates viewed as insufficiently loyal. Already, they retracted the endorsement of one Republican lawmaker who publicly advocated for clear medical exceptions.\nSigns of frustration emerged over the course of the hearing as lawmakers grilled Brewer on how his preferred positions may harm pregnant patients and accused him of trying to intimidate legislators.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made a statement that you are fine with the current trigger law as it is, and nothing more needs to be done,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Sabi Kumar, a retired surgeon, referring to the state\u2019s abortion ban. \u201cDid you believe that?\u201d\nBrewer responded: \u201cThat is our most preferential position, although we would accept an objective standard.\u201d\nKumar said he was surprised Brewer did not appear to be taking into account other changes the bill addresses that are not in the current law, such as exceptions for cases of fatal fetal anomalies, where a baby is not expected to survive, and ectopic pregnancies, which implant outside the uterine cavity, are non-viable and can lead to rupture and death.\n\u201cThose things need to be corrected,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the face of that, it is difficult for you to say that that is your preferential thing.\u201d\nKumar also asked Brewer to consider the plight of doctors. Physicians carry malpractice insurance, but Kumar noted it doesn\u2019t cover costs associated with criminal charges, which can be financially ruinous. Kumar didn\u2019t think they should be threatened with prison time for acting to avoid an emergency.\n\u201cI would have liked to see you, as a friend, be as concerned about a physician who was under that degree of emotional stress and pressure, trying to save the life of a baby and worried about being prosecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have liked you to be gushing with sympathy for that.\u201d\nHe and others pointed out that the bill\u2019s changes would not affect the vast majority of pregnancies, where abortion would continue to be outlawed. The bill explicitly states abortions are prohibited for mental health reasons, such as a patient threatening suicide, and it has no provisions allowing abortion for pregnancies due to rape or incest.\nBut Brewer suggested that lawmakers who vote in support of the bill might stand to lose the endorsement of Tennessee Right to Life.\n\u201cI would not consider this a pro-life law,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cAnd in discussions with our [political action committee], they have informed me that they would score this negatively for those members that wish to vote for it.\u201d\nBrewer\u2019s invocation of the anti-abortion group\u2019s scorecard provoked a strong response. As the hearing wrapped up, Tennessee\u2019s House speaker, Cameron Sexton, appeared in the chamber.\n\u201cSomething happened that I\u2019ve never experienced in my time down here, which was somebody on a committee testifying tried to intimidate our members by telling them they\u2019re gonna score them a vote,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have those conversations in your room, you can have those conversations in email. But to do it in the committee \u2014 to try to intimidate this committee to go a certain direction \u2014 is uncalled for.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rare public rebuke of an anti-abortion activist by a top Republican lawmaker may be a sign of growing GOP support for the modest amendments to the law. However, the bill\u2019s path is not guaranteed. It will need to pass in three more committees before reaching final votes in the state\u2019s House and Senate.\nRepublican state Rep. Bryan Terry\u2019s reaction provided a preview of potential challenges ahead. He was the only member of the committee to vote against the amendment, and he leads the House Health Subcommittee, where the bill is headed next week.\nIn an email to ProPublica, Terry said that he does want to see changes to the law, but that the word \u201cprevent\u201d would need to be removed or redefined in the measure before he could consider voting for it.\n\u201cThere are a multitude of medical emergencies that can occur during a pregnancy, but they usually never materialize,\u201d Terry, who is an anesthesiologist, said. \u201cA concern with the current amendment language is that an abortion could be performed in an instance when it wasn\u2019t \u2018medically necessary treatment.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir States Banned Abortion. Doctors Now Say They Can\u2019t Give Women Potentially Lifesaving Care.\n\n\n\nProPublica followed up to ask if he would consider conditions such as premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, cancer or heart conditions \u201cmedically necessary\u201d reasons for abortions. He did not respond.\nThree days after the hearing, Tennessee Right to Life sent a \u201clegislative alert\u201d obtained by ProPublica to its members, calling on them to oppose the bill at the next hearing.\nThe email described changes in the bill as \u201cloopholes\u201d making the current law \u201cunenforceable.\u201d\n\u201cTragically, some pro-life legislators are currently supporting this bill,\u201d the email read. Below, it listed the nine lawmakers who voted in favor of it.\n\n\nAre You in a State That Banned Abortion?
