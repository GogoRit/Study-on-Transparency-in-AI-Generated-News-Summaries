Yunis, an obstetrician and gynecologist, made headlines last year after allegedly pointing a gun at protesters outside Acacia Women\u2019s Clinic, an abortion provider in central Phoenix.\u00a0\nEleven days earlier, Yunis was in court, pleading not guilty to two charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a charge of disorderly conduct with a weapon. A prosecutor later declined to present the aggravated assault charges to a grand jury, which indicted him on one count of disorderly conduct with a weapon. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge, which is a class 6 felony.\nA flyer for the event lists Congressman Andy Biggs, a Gilbert Republican who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, Congressman David Schweikert and Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward as speakers at the event.\u00a0\nPhotos posted on social media show Biggs, Lamb and Ward in attendance.
