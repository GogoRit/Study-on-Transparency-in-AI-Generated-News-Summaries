The 28-year-old expectant mom was left lying on the table and texted a friend to see if that had ever happened to her.\u201cNever,\u2019\u201d the friend replied.The doctor entered and directed Phillips\u2019 attention to the screen and a gap in a white line down the middle of her baby\u2019s brain. The doctor explained that the gap showed the brain had not fully divided into the right and left hemispheres.  \u201cI felt all the blood just leave my face and my heart sank to the back of my chest and I just felt numb,\u201d Phillips told The Daily Beast on Monday. \u201cI was still there physically, but my mind just kind of left.\u201dShe looked over at her husband, Bryan Lynch. His eyes were welling with tears and she knew he was struggling not to break down in front of her.\u201cI came back to my body,\u201d she later said.  \u201cI immediately began crying, like out loud crying.\u201d A sonogram shows the gap in the line between the hemispheres of the brain.Courtesy Ally Phillips The doctor said it was a rare congenital defect known as holoprosencephaly (HPE). Only 3 percent of fetuses with it survive to birth.To make it all worse, Miley Rose\u2019s heart had only two chambers rather than four. There were also abnormalities in the kidneys and the bladder.\u201cI asked, \u2018Is there any treatment?\u2019\u201d Phillips recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing that can fix all these defects.\u2019\u201dMiley Rose was doomed.\u201cI was like, \u2018What do we do next?\u2019\u201d Phillips remembered.The doctor said that terminating the pregnancy was an option, but they were in Tennessee, where an abortion ban went into effect six months ago.\u201cShe said, \u2018Of course, in Tennessee, I can\u2019t offer you advice if you choose that route. That is something you would have to do your own research on,\u2019\u201dPhillips remembered.The doctor added that if they decided to continue with the pregnancy, the problems would only grow along with the fetus.\u201cWe risk having a stillborn or giving birth only for her to just die shortly after delivery,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring her into this world to suffer for an hour or two just so I can say I held her.\u201dPhillips went home with her husband and sought escape in sleep.\u201cMaybe [you] wake up and it was just a bad dream,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately not. Life was like a living nightmare.\u201d Courtesy Ally Phillips Before the ban in Tennessee, she could have just gone to her doctor for an abortion. Her home state now was a place where she could only wait for her baby to be born into a futile struggle to live a brief time not worth living. And if she miscarried, she would have to wait for her body to expel the deceased fetus. A medical effort to intervene would constitute an abortion.\u201cAn abortion is a procedure,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a heartbeat.\u201dThe couple\u2019s 5-year-old daughter, Adalie Phillips, went with her parents when they had a routine anatomy scan on Feb. 20. The child heard their usual obstetrician say she saw  enough cause for worry that they should see a high-risk obstetrician. Now, five days later, Phillips had to explain to Adalie how things had changed.\u201cRemember on Monday when mommy went to the baby doctor?\u201d Phillips recounts asking the girl. \u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d\u201cYeah, there was something wrong with Miley Rose,\u201d Adalie said.\u201cYou know how mommy had an appointment today when you were in school?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo they found more things wrong with Miley Rose.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why. Sometimes things happen and it\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s not daddy\u2019s fault, it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. Nature doesn\u2019t always do what it\u2019s supposed to do. Because of everything that\u2019s wrong with Miley Rose she\u2019s not going to make it, honey. She\u2019s not going to be born.\u201d\u201cBut you can drink water and grow healthy,\u201d the girl then said.\u201cI wish that was all we had to do,\u201d the mother replied. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s more than just water can help. So, we\u2019re going to have to say goodbye to Miley Rose.\u201d\u201cBut I wanted my baby sister.\u201d\u201cI know you did, honey. I wanted her, too. Sometimes these things are just out of our hands.\u201d Courtesy Ally Phillips On Saturday, Phillips and her husband went to One Like Me, a place near her home in Clarksville that provides ultrasound images and recording of heartbeats as keepsakes. The place was fully booked, but the proprietor fit in Phillips after she explained the situation and said she wanted to have a recording of Miley\u2019s heartbeat.\u201cBefore we say goodbye to our little girl,\u201d Phillips said.The proprietor provided her with several 3D images of Miley Rose as well as a heartbeat recording. Phillips was only charged with the stuffed floppy-eared bunny that she and her husband chose from the stuffed animals that accommodate recordings.On Monday, Phillips made calls to abortion providers in New York and Illinois. She and her husband make too much money to qualify for financial assistance, but not enough that the prospective expense isn\u2019t daunting, especially when compounded by the cost of airfare and a hotel. One quote in Illinois for the procedure at 20 weeks was $1,500, going up to $2,500 in the 21st week.They decided on a facility in Manhattan that said it would cost $1,050 at 20 weeks. A woman there said the price might be less in Phillips\u2019 case, as the baby was smaller than would be expected at 19 weeks.\u201cI know they charge by how big the fetus is,\u201d Phillips said.Phillips and her husband will be setting from Tennessee for New York next week to do what they must do, but cannot do at home thanks to Gov. Bill Lee and the conservative Republicans who are now running her home state.\u201cMaybe I can get Bill to pay for my trip,\u201d Phillips said.She feels sure that the self-described pro-life politicians really value something else.\u201cControl,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all they care about.\u201dAbortion bans, in Tennessee or anywhere else, are \u201cextremely dangerous to women of every background,\u201d she said. \u201cPoliticians should not be making any laws that limit medical treatment for anyone. It\u2019s unconstitutional and a violation to my basic civil and human rights.\u201cBanning abortions doesn\u2019t stop them. It bans safe abortions and makes it nearly impossible for some women to receive life-saving care. Women will die because of these laws. Doesn\u2019t seem very pro-life if you ask me.\u2019\u2019Phillips had announced her pregnancy on TikTok. She now posted a tearful video reporting the terrible turn it had taken, announcing that she and her husband had decided to get an abortion. She posted another video in which she played the recording of Miley\u2019s Rose\u2019s heartbeat as she held the bunny.Her living nightmare is made only worse by the faint stirring inside her.\u201cThere\u2019s little moves,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI can feel it.\u201d  Michael DalySpecial Correspondent@MichaelDalynycmichael.daly@thedailybeast.comGot a tip?
