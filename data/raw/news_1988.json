(Lily O\u2019Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)\nDespite the 59-41 margin in a statewide vote on the constitutional amendment last year, Republican lawmakers passed new anti-abortion laws. Abortion providers will have to tell patients the abortion pill can be reversed, a dangerous proposition based on junk research. Doctors will continue to provide medical care for infants who are \u201cborn alive,\u201d thanks to legislation designed to promote a false narrative that \u201cfailed abortions\u201d are performed on infants who are capable of surviving. And\u00a0 abortion providers would not have been able to obtain liability insurance through the state Health Care Stabilization Fund, even though they are required to contribute to it, but the Senate fell just short of the votes needed to override Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s veto.\nAdditionally, the Legislature allocated tax dollars to support \u201cpregnancy crisis centers,\u201d which actively discourage women from seeking abortions.\n\u201cWe are moral people,\u201d said Rep. Ron Bryce, a Republican physician from Coffeyville who claimed he personally provided aid to 27 babies who survived an abortion. \u201cWe provide care for those who are weak, for those who are disadvantaged, for those who are innocent and powerless.\u201d\nAbortion has dominated Kansas politics for decades, but attention to the issue was heightened last year by the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and Kansas voters\u2019 rejection of the proposed constitutional amendment.\nIn March, supporters of access to reproductive health care gathered en masse to celebrate bodily autonomy and protest anti-abortion legislation. At other times throughout the session, Kevan Myers, of Kansas City, Kansas, and Clifton Boje, of Bonner Springs, picketed the third floor railing with large anti-abortion signs. They are leaders of an abortion abolitionist ministry based in St. George.\nOne sign read: \u201cWe are ambassadors of Jesus Christ pleading from God a message of reconciliation.\u201d\nAnother: \u201cThe laws against murder should be applied equally to all people.\u201d\nRep. Tobias Schlingensiepen, a Topeka Democrat and senior minister at First Congregational Church, said in an interview for this series that he \u201ctalked to a Republican leader, who I shall leave unnamed, who said to me: \u2018We don\u2019t really care about all this stuff, Tobias. We just bring all these abortion bills because we need to let the people who support us know that we\u2019re carrying water for them despite the referendum last summer.\u2019\u2009\u201d\nThe attack on abortion rights in Kansas preserves the status quo.\nSince the Summer of Mercy in 1991, powerful faith-based lobbying forces have influenced elections and established barriers to reproductive health care. Under Kansas law, a woman who seeks an abortion will be given state-mandated propaganda designed to change her mind. She will then have to look at an ultrasound image, wait 24 hours and pay for the procedure out of her own pocket.\nState law prohibits abortion after 22 weeks, except to save the life of a mother.\nIn 2009, Scott Roeder, a member of a militant Christian Patriot group, gunned down physician George Tiller in his Wichita church. Tiller\u2019s clinic had been bombed in 1986, and he had survived a 1993 shooting.\nThe Kansas Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in 2019 that determined the state constitution\u2019s right to bodily autonomy extends to the decision to terminate a pregnancy. The ruling, which was a response to state law that banned a procedure used in 95% of second-trimester abortions, ensured\u00a0abortion rights would be preserved in Kansas after the U.S. Supreme Court removed federal protections last June.\nThe Catholic Church, Kansans for Life, Family Policy Alliance and others funneled millions of dollars into a campaign to overturn the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s decision through a constitutional amendment. Secret audio obtained by Kansas Reflector revealed that state lawmakers planned to ban abortion without exception if the amendment passed.\nBut six weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Kansas voters jolted the political establishment by rejecting the amendment in an unexpected landslide.\n  Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, appears at a Jan. 10, 2023, news conference where Republicans outlined their priorities, including plans to fund anti-abortion \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d for this year\u2019s legislative session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)\nIn an email to supporters a day after the election, Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, said it was his \u201cfervent hope\u201d that more than a half-million Kansans who voted against the amendment were simply misled by campaign ads and \u201ca complicit media.\u201d The alternatives, he said, were \u201cdisturbing and unthinkable.\u201d\nThompson wondered if Kansans were really OK with infants being torn apart, limb from limb, or the prospects of Kansas becoming \u201can even bigger destination site for abortion tourism.\u201d He listed other possible explanations for the popular vote that involved false narratives about abortion clinics.\n\u201cI know that some are absolutely satisfied with the end result and are likely celebrating today,\u201d Thompson wrote in his email blast. \u201cI hope and pray that someday they realize the devastation they have left behind.\n\u201cMay God have mercy on Kansas.
