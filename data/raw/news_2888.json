She is a hero!\u201dThe indictmentOn Wednesday, 30 March, Ms Handy was indicted over an October incident in which she and eight other activists are accused of storming an abortion clinic, knocking over an employee, and blocking people from entering the facility.In a statement unveiling the charges, the US Department of Justice said Ms Handy led the attack.In \u201ca clinic blockade that was directed by Handy,\u201d the DOJ said, the nine defendants \u201cforcefully entered the clinic and set about blockading two clinic doors using their bodies, furniture, chains and ropes.\u201dEach of the defendants has been charged with conspiracy against rights and violating the US Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. If convicted, Ms Handy and her collaborators could face up to 11 years in prison and a $350,000 fine.On 4 April, Ms Handy pleaded not guilty.

When a WUSA9 reporter asked what was in the house, she replied, \u201cPeople will freak out when they hear.\u201dThe next day, the Metropolitan Police Department announced that it had found five human foetuses at the address.\u201cOn Wednesday, March 30, 2022, at approximately 12:30pm, MPD responded to the 400 block of 6th Street, SE, to investigate a tip regarding potential bio-hazard material at the location,\u201d a spokesperson for the department told The Independent. \u201cUpon further investigation, MPD located five fetuses inside a residence at the location. The fetuses were collected by the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. This is currently a pending investigation.\u201dNo charges have yet been announced with regard to the foetuses. At a press conference, MPD Executive Assistant Chief Ashan Benedict said they appeared to have been aborted legally.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be anything criminal about that \u2013 except for how they got into that house,\u201d Mr Benedict said.\u2018Private cemetery\u2019On Tuesday, PAAU held a press conference and announced that Ms Handy had 115 more foetuses that she helped baptise and bury in a private cemetery. The group screened a video that purportedly showed activists using a kitchen knife to cut into a cardboard \u201cCurtis Bay Energy\u201d box with a biohazard label before discovering what they claimed were 115 foetuses, most at the early stages of gestation, reported the Washingtonian.They said a priest came to Ms Handy\u2019s apartment to name and bless the babies, holding a funeral mass before burying 110 of the foetuses in an unidentified \u201cprivate cemetery\u201d.Ms Handy, who is the director of activism of the group, said at the press conference: \u201cDuring the five days they were under my stewardship, the 115 victims of abortion violence were given funeral mass for unbaptised children and 110\u2026 were given a proper burial in a private cemetery.\u201dOn 25 March, she, along with several other activists, had gone to a Washington Surgi-Clinic to protest abortions when they found a driver loading biohazard boxes into his truck outside, reported The Daily Beast.The group allegedly convinced the driver to give them a box, promising to give the foetuses a \u201cproper burial.\u201dPAAU founder and executive director Terrisa Bukovinac said in the press conference that the US Department of Justice should prosecute Cesare Santagelo, a doctor at the clinic.The driver\u2019s employer, Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services, has denied the group\u2019s account.The Independent has reached out to PAAU for more information.More aboutWashington DCMetropolitan Police DepartmentDepartment of Justiceabortion1/2Police found five foetuses in Lauren Handy\u2019s home.
