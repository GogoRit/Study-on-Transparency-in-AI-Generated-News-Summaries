She was neutral about abortion, Raab said, and when the girl\u2019s pregnancy test showed positive there was no reaction from the young client. The mother gave permission for Raab to meet one-on-one with her daughter.\n\u201cI learned she wanted to further her education and she perceived the baby to be a big stumbling block to obtaining her goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, when asked, Cathy was able to identify several successful teen moms including her own! She saw no way out but abortion, yet she admitted to knowing little about abortion or any of the possible complications.\u201d\nCathy filled out the center\u2019s decision guide, an assessment gauging where a client may be in the choice between abortion and life for their child.\u00a0\n\u201cAbortion was almost 100 percent,\u201d Raab said.\nAfterward, Raab, who knew Cathy from a ministry at her church, prayed with the girl.\n\u201cWe prayed together and went over pregnancy options information,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had a reaction when she learned what abortion really is.\u201d\nCathy was scheduled for an ultrasound the following week.\n\u201cBoth daughter and mom were very emotionless upon returning for the ultrasound,\u201d Raab recalled.\u00a0\n\nPCC of SE Indiana ultrasound room\n\n\u201cAs I sat in the ultrasound room as a support, I was concerned Cathy was not connecting at all to the little life growing inside of her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe met again alone after the scan for over an hour.\u201d\u00a0\nCathy was interested in what an abortion was really like, Raab said, so she shared the center\u2019s book outlining each type of procedure. Raab also shared her personal testimony of her abortion as a teen.\u00a0\n\u201cI reminded Cathy before leaving that we would always be here for her no matter what decision she made,\u201d said Raab.\nThrough follow-up calls, Raab learned Cathy had made a doctor\u2019s appointment and shown family and friends the ultrasound picture.\n\u201cShe came around slowly and now has a beautiful baby and has learned to balance school and being a mom,\u201d Raab said.\nPregnancy Care Center of Southeast Indiana is like many pro-life pregnancy centers in ministering to women who often see abortion as their first or only option.\u00a0\nLast year, more than 80 percent of the center\u2019s clients were assessed as either abortion-vulnerable or abortion-minded/determined.\u00a0\nSimilarly, a Colorado center, which operates two facilities, assessed 65 percent of its 2019 clientele as abortion vulnerable, minded, or determined, and Options Pregnancy Center in Helena, Montana has experienced an increase in the number of abortion-minded/determined women.\nRewarding work\nRaab finds her job rewarding.\n\u201cI\u2019m a teacher by trade \u2013 my work is just an extension of teaching,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPCC of SE Indiana reception area\n\n\u201cI want to help women find an alternative to Planned Parenthood, to help them find a safe place,\u201d Raab said. \"That\u2019s the difference between pregnancy centers and Planned Parenthood \u2013 we are the safe place where they can make an informed decision.\u201d\nTweet This: \"That\u2019s the difference between pregnancy centers and Planned Parenthood \u2013 we are the safe place where they can make an informed decision.\u201d\nThat decision is often spurred because of an ultrasound. The center received a new, upgraded machine earlier this year, Raab said.\n\u201cWe offer so much, but the most important thing we do is the ultrasound and giving the client a picture,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe center closed March 20 due to COVID-19 and re-opened on June 22. However, Raab stayed in touch with the center\u2019s clients during that time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to work remotely,\u201d she said. \u201cI would check in with the women to find out where they were at in their decision-making, to provide them encouragement and support, and to give them resources they needed.\u201d\nRaab said she was looking forward to meeting in-person with women again.\u00a0\n\nKarla Raab\n\n\u201cI have a personal motive \u2013 I can help others through my story,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always my hope to not let anyone feel the need to go into a Planned Parenthood \u2013 it\u2019s so life-altering.\u201d\nShe says she is \u201cdriven\u201d to make a positive impact on women facing an unplanned pregnancy and in that she believes pregnancy care centers do make a positive impact.\n\u201c[A pregnancy center is] a safe place, a place of healing, a place for them to learn about the wonderful grace of God,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen can process things in a safe way and have a chance of making a better decision, a more informed decision, that\u2019s going to affect them for the rest of their lives. The choices we make today are always going to affect us, for positive or negative.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nabortion\npostabortion\nPregnancy Care Center of Southeast Indiana\npregnancy help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGayle Irwin\n\nGayle M.
