Wade, the Rev. Norman K. Douglas, like many other religious leaders, spoke about abortion from his pulpit at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Parish in Akron.He read a statement from\u00a0Bishop Edward Malesic of the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, which applauded the ruling and listed resources for new and expecting parents. Douglas then added his own message about the need to advocate for policies like universal health care, paid parental leave and the continuation of enhanced child tax credits.\u201cThe key from our point of view, too, is we got to make sure that we\u2019re not only concerned about a baby being born, but we\u2019re concerned about the family and we\u2019re concerned about the help that people get after the baby\u2019s born,\u201d Douglas told the Beacon Journal. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to show we\u2019re pro-life through everything, we need to encourage our people to vote in these ways.\u201dAs those who oppose abortion embrace and celebrate a post-Roe future, many say they also are working to provide services to individuals experiencing unplanned pregnancies who can no longer obtain an abortion legally in Ohio. Roughly 20,600 abortions were performed in Ohio in 2020, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health.More:Akron celebrates, mourns the end of constitutional right to abortionHours after the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, Ohio reinstated its so-called \u201cheartbeat law,\u201d which outlaws abortion after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, typically around six weeks of gestation, except when the mother\u2019s life is at risk.\u00a0At that point, many don't yet realize they are pregnant.\u2018A defining moment\u2019Mary von Carlowitz, who directs the Diocese of Cleveland\u2019s Office for Human Life, said now is a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for the Catholic Church, which has long opposed abortion.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about supporting pro-life, being pro-life and walking with all moms in need, but this is a time where we have to really show them that we\u2019re going to do what we said we would all along,\u201d she said.When an individual seeking help calls or walks through the doors of St. Vincent\u2019s, Douglas\u00a0or another member of the pastoral team first sit down with the person and listen to their story.\u201cWe\u2019re not so much providing all the resources. We\u2019re listening. We\u2019re letting them know they\u2019re cared about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just,\u00a0\u2018Hey, here\u2019s a list of resources. Here\u2019s a piece of paper. Go to them.\u2019 No, it\u2019s spending time with the person and then letting them know the resources available.\u201dOther anti-abortion groups also\u00a0serve a link to available resources for expectant parents, even though they don't provide those services themselves.When a pregnant person seeking help calls Right to Life of Northeast Ohio, Allie Frazier, the organization\u2019s executive director, immediately connects them with a resource in the community, often a pregnancy resource center.Frazier\u2019s organization does not provide services because it's focused on advocacy, but she said Right to Life\u00a0has personal relationships with many of the resources in what she describes as the\u00a0\u201cholistic safety net.\u201d Beyond the pregnancy centers, the safety net includes organizations like LoveLine, a national organization that provides financial assistance to pregnant and single mothers.\u201cIn this post-Roe environment, there\u2019s a lot of concern that women aren\u2019t going to be getting the supplies they need,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThat is absolutely not going to happen. The pro-life movement is 100% committed to meeting these needs.\u201dMore:Their pregnancies fall just outside Ohio\u2019s new six week abortion ban. What do they do now?But Kellie Copeland, who leads Pro Choice Ohio and is based in Akron, questions whether these needs will actually be met.\u201cI want you to know who\u2019s responsible for this:\u00a0It\u2019s Gov. Mike DeWine, it\u2019s Dave Yost, it\u2019s the anti-choice organizations in this state and it\u2019s the Republican Party, none of which have lifted a finger to make being pregnant in this state easier,\u201d Copeland said.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have a minimum unpaid maternity leave, and these politicians and organizations have the unmitigated gall to say now, somehow, they\u2019re going to be here for people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere the hell have they been? Where? What took them so long? If this was about supporting pregnant people and about babies, they would\u2019ve done something.\u201dOhio ranked 31st in child well-being in 2021, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation\u2019s Kids Count report.\u2018We are going to just continue as we did before\u2019None of the organizations the Beacon Journal talked to said they had started or planned to start a new initiative after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. They varied on whether they were increasing existing services.Both Akron Pregnancy Services and Embrace Clinic and Care Center in Barberton\u00a0insist that nothing changes in their operations now that Roe has been overturned.\u201cPre-Roe and post-Roe, there\u2019s going to be women that are facing unplanned pregnancies and maybe have a hard time getting the support that they need or the material goods that they need,\u201d said Peggy Swyrydenko, Embrace Clinic and Care Center\u2019s executive director. \"We are going to just continue as we did before.\u201dSwyrydenko said that the center\u2019s staff did not make an official plan to alter or increase services before the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling because they knew that people would still be facing unplanned pregnancies. For now, she said, they\u2019re prepared for a potential increase in people seeking services.\u201cWe\u2019re well staffed and well-funded, and we have a lot of supplies already on hand,\u201d Swyrydenko said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had anything that we\u2019re running out of that people are looking for.\u201dThe two centers each provide free diapers, infant and toddler clothing, wipes, baby food, formula and parenting classes. The Barberton clinic also offers pregnancy testing, birth control and ultrasound services.At the Akron center, parents can earn vouchers for larger items by attending parenting classes or viewing parenting videos. Attendance at five classes, for instance, is enough to earn a Pack \u2018N Play, a type of portable crib and playpen.For services the Barberton clinic does not provide, such as housing and food assistance, the center typically refers individuals to other organizations, Swyrydenko said. Those include state- and county-run resources like WIC \u2014 the special supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants and Children \u2014 and the Akron Metropolitan Housing Authority.In 2021, the state budget set aside $6\u00a0million for the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which funds several crisis pregnancy centers throughout the state. Centers that receive funds through the program are not allowed to be involved in or associated with any abortion activities, which includes providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics. Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order\u00a0earlier this year that gave another $1.7 million to the program.More:New budget earmarks $7.5 million of Ohio taxpayers' money for pregnancy centersFrazier said her organization regularly provides supplies to local pregnancy centers that come from the baby supplies drive at Right to Life of Northeast Ohio\u2019s annual banquet and donations left at the organization\u2019s office. They also sometimes buy specific items that are in short supply at a\u00a0pregnancy center.She\u00a0expects those efforts to increase as the pregnancy centers\u2019 needs grow.\u201cThey are the ones who are boots on the ground and bring real support to women in crisis,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cGoing forward, the pro-life movement is just unshakingly focused on providing the best possible support for them.\u201d\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be anyone that feels unaccompanied\u2019\u00a0Although\u00a0a couple of local Catholic parishes directly offer resources for new and expecting parents, most refer parents to pregnancy centers and\u00a0services\u00a0run by the Cleveland Diocese or affiliated with it.Currently, the diocese is continuing a push started a year ago to expand its parish-run efforts, largely through the Walking with Moms in Need initiative. The nationwide program was initially launched by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and works at a parish level to pair congregants with local mothers facing difficult pregnancies.Von Carlowitz called the initiative a \u201cfocal point\u201d for the Cleveland Diocese. About 20% of the 185 parishes in the diocese have begun putting the initiative into effect and another 20% are looking into the initiative, she said.\u201cWalking with Moms in Need is just to have a very personal touch so that a woman, especially in an emergent pregnancy situation, that feels alone or scared or, you know, finding out that she can no longer obtain an abortion legally in the state of Ohio knows that she\u2019s not going to be alone,\u201d von Carlowitz said.Beyond providing basic supplies to new and expecting parents, the program also intends to help parents meet all of their needs, whether that involves day care, housing, education or job training, according to von Carlowitz. The goal, she said, is for each parish to have\u00a0the structure to provide support themselves and the resources needed to connect parents with local organizations that can provide services outside the parish\u2019s scope.\u201cEveryone in the parish community should know where to refer a pregnant woman in need,\u201d von Carlowitz said. \u201cWe want people to know that we\u2019re here to accompany them. Like I said, not only through pregnancy but through parenting as well.\u201dSt. Vincent\u2019s in Akron aims to formalize its Walking with Moms in Need initiative by the beginning of August, Douglas said.The Cleveland Diocese\u2019s Catholic Charities organization also operates one of the many Help Me Grow programs in Ohio. Help Me Grow is a state-run home visiting program that provides education on infant growth, development and parenting skills.Beyond providing education, home visitors help connect families enrolled in Help Me Grow with all of the other services provided by Catholic Charities. In Summit County, those include providing grocery gift cards, bus passes, baby supplies and emergency financial assistance for rent and utilities, according to Julie Neely, one of Catholic Charities\u2019 program administrators for Help Me Grow.For the next year, the organization also has access to a safety grant that\u00a0allows them to provide items like child proofing supplies, car seats and high chairs, Neely said.\u201cWe are really there just to be a partner with families to help them, you know, parent the way they want to parent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there, you know, to judge or to lecture. We\u2019re just going to support them in the best way that we can and in the manner they need us to.\u201dThose who oppose abortion remain excited and hopeful for the future.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying in the pro-life movement, \u2018Love them both,\u2019 and I think that a lot of times people think that that\u2019s just like a platitude, and it\u2019s really not,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cIt is a pledge that we are going to take care of women, and we are going to do what it takes to provide for these babies, and honestly, we are ready for the challenge. We cannot wait for what comes next.\u201dCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper NIE ArchivesAkron Classifieds Kent Classifieds Jobs Cars Homes Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.beaconjournal.com.
