Wade, has been in effect since September 1 and has forced thousands of Texans to travel out of state for abortions.\nThe law has survived legal challenges because of its unusual structure. Instead of criminalizing the procedure after six weeks, it deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d the provision of such an abortion, with successful plaintiffs receiving a minimum of $10,000.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block the law. In December, it ruled that abortion providers could challenge the law, but only on very narrow grounds. The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority ruled abortion providers could sue state medical licensing officials \u2014\u00a0health boards, for example \u2014 that are empowered to penalize health care providers who violate the abortion ban. But in a loss for the providers, the justices said they could not sue state officials who helped process the civil lawsuits that constitute SB 8\u2019s main penalty.\nAt the time, legal experts suggested that the decision significantly weakened abortion providers\u2019 odds of eventually getting the law blocked. And the Friday decision from the Texas Supreme Court suggests they were right.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More abortion coverage from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban is still causing more than twice as many patients at clinics in nearby states\n                \n\n\n\n                    Why so many abortion restrictions are working their way through state legislatures now\n                \n\n\n\n                    Idaho is the second state to ban abortion after six weeks\n                \n\n\n\n\nAfter ruling on SB 8, the U.S. Supreme Court relegated the case back to a lower federal court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. That court was asked to reconsider a question that the Supreme Court appeared to have settled: whether abortion providers could in fact sue state medical licensing officials. If the answer was no, there would be no state entity abortion providers could sue, and no avenue for them to challenge the law in court and seek a ruling blocking its enforcement.\nAt the end of January, the 5th Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, sent the case to the Texas Supreme Court. In a decision released Friday, that court dealt a blow to the state\u2019s abortion providers, finding that medical licensing officials don\u2019t actually enforce the state\u2019s abortion ban.\u00a0\nThe decision has effectively blocked a significant pathway for abortion providers to challenge the law in its totality. Providers can challenge individuals who sue under SB 8. Lawsuits are also pending in the state court.\u00a0\nThe decision comes at a critical moment for abortion rights law. The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a challenge to Roe v. Wade, and expected to issue a ruling this summer that could weaken federal abortion protections. In anticipation, conservative-led state are pushing forth bills that would further restrict abortion access.\nOklahoma and Idaho\u2019s state Senates have passed bills that would emulate Texas\u2019 six-week ban. Those bills have yet to be voted on by the respective Houses or signed by the governor. But Friday\u2019s decision could encourage them to move forward with such bills, by signaling that a Texas-inspired abortion ban is likely to stay enforced and successfully survive legal challenges.\nLeah Litman, a constitutional law expert at the University of Michigan, said the ruling could impact how policymakers in other statehouses think about the enforcement component.\n\u201cIt basically provides more incentives to states to adopt laws like SB 8 in order to insulate their laws from judicial review and allow states to put in place laws that nullify people\u2019s ability to exercise constitutional rights without having to defend those laws\u00a0in court,\u201d she said.\nThe decision could have an impact on other kind of bills moving through statehouses, Litman said. In Missouri, two bills have been introduced that would ban ectopic pregnancies and traveling out of state to obtain abortions. Both use a similar punitive structure to Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no reason to think that this enforcement structure and these implications are going to be limited to the context of abortion bans after six weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich makes the implications all the more troubling.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: Will Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban be blocked by the courts?\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: Will Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban be blocked by the courts?\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court to hear two challenges to Texas abortion law on November 1\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban is still stuck in court.
