Serene JonesGuest ColumnistIn the coming months, the Supreme Court\u00a0likely will curtail or overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 upending decades of precedent and dramatically limiting women\u2019s right to choose. Conservative lawmakers nationwide\u00a0already are beginning to pass harsh abortion bans that would be plainly unconstitutional under Roe \u2014 but might soon be perfectly legal in the post-Roe world.\u00a0There\u2019s no question that conservative religious beliefs are at the heart of this anti-abortion movement. Far-right politicians, pastors\u00a0and organizations constantly invoke the word of God to justify controlling women\u2019s bodies.But here\u2019s one of the tragic ironies of these anti-choice religious voices: The same voices arguing that a fertilized egg is a life that should be protected at all costs are actively opposed to providing even minimal protections for actual living, breathing children once they\u2019ve been born \u2014 or to giving parents the paid leave, affordable health care or other support they need to raise healthy kids.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my well-worn Bible, I find references to \u201ccaring for others\u201d on virtually every page. It\u2019s a central tenet of the entire book. But abortion? I\u2019m hard-pressed to find it mentioned anywhere, and those who claim otherwise have to contort the text. But listening to anti-choice voices, you\u2019d think preventing abortion was the first above all other commandments, and that \u201clove thy neighbor\u201d was a trivial issue that can be tossed aside for party ideology. A maniacal focus on the fetus has corrupted their faith.\u00a0One needn\u2019t look hard to find their hypocrisy. Just look how some anti-choice Christians have rallied around Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks \u2014 a man who has literally killed children in his quest to conquer Ukraine. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Lauren Witzke \u2014 a GOP candidate for the Senate in Delaware who has previously decried abortion \u2014 said, \u201cRussia is a Christian nationalist nation \u2026 I identify more with Putin\u2019s Christian values than I do with Joe Biden.\u201d Meanwhile, televangelist Pat Robertson \u2014 a longtime abortion opponent \u2014 recently stated that President Putin was \u201ccompelled by God\u201d to invade Ukraine.\u00a0Ukraine is just the latest illustration of this hypocrisy, but it\u2019s far from the only one. Consider how purportedly \"pro-life\" policymakers have approached the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 which has claimed the lives of nearly 1 million Americans.\u00a0Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example \u2014\u00a0a staunch anti-abortion advocate who consistently refers to his Christian faith in policymaking \u2014\u00a0is poised to sign an incredibly strict 15-week abortion ban. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin\u00a0Stitt, meanwhile, once proclaimed, \u201cGod our creator recognizes that life begins in the womb, and he knew every one of us before we were born ... We want to be No. 1 in protecting life in the U.S.\u201d He has signed multiple bills restricting abortion.And yet, both have allowed COVID-19 to spread like wildfire across their states \u2014 and have even proactively prevented constituents from taking steps to keep themselves safe. They have issued executive orders banning mask mandates and taken steps to block vaccine mandates. To date, more than 70,000 Floridians and 13,000 Oklahomans have died from COVID-19.There was also a massive campaign from \u00a0anti-abortion lawmakers to kill the Build Back Better package \u2014 would provide parents with funding to support their children and would establish paid leave for caregivers \u2014 along with a host of other measures to allow future generations to thrive.\u00a0The list goes on. The Family Research Council, a Christian-centric advocacy organization, is strongly \u00a0anti-abortion and yet has published content bashing masks and demonizing Obamacare, which has provided health care to tens of millions of people. The Heritage Foundation \u2014 which has strong religious ties \u2014 filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration for vaccine mandates and has repeatedly criticized the kind of paid leave that new parents would need as they recover from the physical and financial stresses of childbirth.\u00a0What\u2019s perhaps even more telling than what anti-abortion activists do say, is what they don\u2019t say. They barely make a sound when immigrant children are separated from their parents and kept in cages. Or when Black children are killed by police officers. Or when poor children are evicted from their homes in the middle of a pandemic. Their silence screams volumes.\u00a0As a theologian, I fully understand that people have different interpretations of when life begins. But here\u2019s what shouldn\u2019t be open to interpretation: God tells us to help the poor, sick\u00a0and weary.\u00a0It\u2019s crucial that Christian leaders of principle speak up. That\u2019s why, at Union Theological Seminary \u2014 which I lead \u2014 we hosted a summit on March 23\u00a0featuring prominent pro-choice Christian leaders. We explored how the \u201cpro-life\u201d movement is riddled with anti-life messages.\u00a0Virtually every part of the Bible shows that we have a constant obligation to care for one another. By focusing on abortion and ignoring the very real struggles of living human beings, anti-abortion activists are not living up to the word of God.\u00a0The Rev. Serene Jones, whose hometown is Enid, Oklahoma,\u00a0is president of Union Theological Seminary, a globally recognized graduate school of religion devoted to putting faith into practice for the common good.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.oklahoman.com.
