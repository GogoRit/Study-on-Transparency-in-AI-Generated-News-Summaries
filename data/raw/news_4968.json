Wade, which had guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. (Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2013 the decision that had guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion for nearly 50 years \u2013 has shifted the legal battle over abortion to the states, with some prohibiting the procedure and others moving to safeguard it.\nAs the nation\u2019s post-Roe chapter begins, here are key facts about Americans\u2019 views on abortion, based on two Pew Research Center polls: one conducted from June 25-July 4, just after this year\u2019s high court ruling, and one conducted in March, before an earlier leaked draft of the opinion became public.\nHow we did this\nThis analysis primarily draws from two Pew Research Center surveys, one surveying 10,441 U.S. adults conducted March 7-13, 2022, and another surveying 6,174 U.S. adults conducted June 27-July 4, 2022. Here are the questions used for the March survey, along with responses, and the questions used for the survey from June and July, along with responses.\nEveryone who took part in these surveys is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.\u00a0Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\n\nA majority of the U.S. public disapproves of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe. About six-in-ten adults (57%) disapprove of the court\u2019s decision that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee a right to abortion and that abortion laws can be set by states, including 43% who strongly disapprove, according to the summer survey. About four-in-ten (41%) approve, including 25% who strongly approve.\n\nAbout eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (82%) disapprove of the court\u2019s decision, including nearly two-thirds (66%) who strongly disapprove. Most Republicans and GOP leaners (70%) approve, including 48% who strongly approve.\nMost women (62%) disapprove of the decision to end the federal right to an abortion. More than twice as many women strongly disapprove of the court\u2019s decision (47%) as strongly approve of it (21%). Opinion among men is more divided: 52% disapprove (37% strongly), while 47% approve (28% strongly). \nAbout six-in-ten Americans (62%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to the summer survey \u2013 little changed since the March survey conducted just before the ruling. That includes 29% of Americans who say it should be legal in all cases and 33% who say it should be legal in most cases. About a third of U.S. adults (36%) say abortion should be illegal in all (8%) or most (28%) cases.\n\nGenerally, Americans\u2019 views of whether abortion should be legal remained relatively unchanged in the past few years, though support fluctuated somewhat in previous decades.\nRelatively few Americans take an absolutist view on the legality of abortion \u2013 either supporting or opposing it at all times, regardless of circumstances. The March survey found that support or opposition to abortion varies substantially depending on such circumstances as when an abortion takes place during a pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is life-threatening or whether a baby would have severe health problems.\nWhile Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 views on the legality of abortion have long differed, the 46 percentage point partisan gap today is considerably larger than it was in the recent past, according to the survey conducted after the court\u2019s ruling. The wider gap has been largely driven by Democrats: Today, 84% of Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from 72% in 2016 and 63% in 2007. Republicans\u2019 views have shown far less change over time: Currently, 38% of Republicans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, nearly identical to the 39% who said this in 2007.\n\nHowever, the partisan divisions over whether abortion should generally be legal tell only part of the story. According to the March survey, sizable shares of Democrats favor restrictions on abortion under certain circumstances, while majorities of Republicans favor abortion being legal in some situations, such as in cases of rape or when the pregnancy is life-threatening.\nThere are wide religious divides in views of whether abortion should be legal, the summer survey found. An overwhelming share of religiously unaffiliated adults (83%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, as do six-in-ten Catholics. Protestants are divided in their views: 48% say it should be legal in all or most cases, while 50% say it should be illegal in all or most cases. Majorities of Black Protestants (71%) and White non-evangelical Protestants (61%) take the position that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while about three-quarters of White evangelicals (73%) say it should be illegal in all (20%) or most cases (53%).\n\nIn the March survey, 72% of White evangelicals said that the statement \u201chuman life begins at conception, so a fetus is a person with rights\u201d reflected their views extremely or very well. That\u2019s much greater than the share of White non-evangelical Protestants (32%), Black Protestants (38%) and Catholics (44%) who said the same. Overall, 38% of Americans said that statement matched their views extremely or very well.\nCatholics, meanwhile, are divided along religious and political lines in their attitudes about abortion, according to the same survey. Catholics who attend Mass regularly are among the country\u2019s strongest opponents of abortion being legal, and they are also more likely than those who attend less frequently to believe that life begins at conception and that a fetus has rights. Catholic Republicans, meanwhile, are far more conservative on a range of abortion questions than are Catholic Democrats.\nWomen (66%) are more likely than men (57%) to say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to the survey conducted after the court\u2019s ruling.\nMore than half of U.S. adults \u2013 including 60% of women and 51% of men \u2013 said in March that women should have a greater say than men in setting abortion policy. Just 3% of U.S. adults said men should have more influence over abortion policy than women, with the remainder (39%) saying women and men should have equal say.\nThe March survey also found that by some measures, women report being closer to the abortion issue than men. For example, women were more likely than men to say they had given \u201ca lot\u201d of thought to issues around abortion prior to taking the survey (40% vs. 30%). They were also considerably more likely than men to say they personally knew someone (such as a close friend, family member or themselves) who had had an abortion (66% vs. 51%) \u2013 a gender gap that was evident across age groups, political parties and religious groups.\nRelatively few Americans view the morality of abortion in stark terms, the March survey found. Overall, just 7% of all U.S. adults say having an abortion is morally acceptable in all cases, and 13% say it is morally wrong in all cases. A third say that having an abortion is morally wrong in most cases, while about a quarter (24%) say it is morally acceptable in most cases. An additional 21% do not consider having an abortion a moral issue.\n\nAmong Republicans, most (68%) say that having an abortion is morally wrong either in most (48%) or all cases (20%). Only about three-in-ten Democrats (29%) hold a similar view. Instead, about four-in-ten Democrats say having an abortion is morally\u00a0acceptable\u00a0in most (32%) or all (11%) cases, while an additional 28% say it is not a moral issue.\u00a0\nWhite evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly say having an abortion is morally wrong in most (51%) or all cases (30%). A slim majority of Catholics (53%) also view having an abortion as morally wrong, but many also say it is morally acceptable in most (24%) or all cases (4%), or that it is not a moral issue (17%). Among religiously unaffiliated Americans, about three-quarters see having an abortion as morally acceptable (45%) or not a moral issue (32%).\n\n\nTopics\nAbortionReligion & Abortion \n\n\nShare this link:       \n\n \n\n\nCarrie Blazina\u00a0 is a former  digital producer at Pew Research Center. \n\nPOSTS BIO EMAIL\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletterFresh data delivered Saturday mornings\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nshort reads | Jul 15, 2022Key facts about the abortion debate in America\n\n\nfact sheet | May 17, 2022Public Opinion on Abortion\n\n\nreport | May 6, 2022Majority in U.S. say abortion should be legal in some cases, illegal in others\n\n\nshort reads | Jun 18, 2020Three-in-ten or more Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree with their party on abortion\n\n\nshort reads | Jan 22, 2020Partisanship a bigger factor than geography in views of abortion access locally\n\n\n\nTopics\nAbortionReligion & Abortion\n\n\n\nMOST POPULAR\n18 in 10 Americans Say Religion Is Losing Influence in Public Life\n2More Americans are getting news on TikTok, bucking the trend seen on most other social media sites\n3What we know about unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S.\n4How Teens and Parents Approach Screen Time\n510 facts about the death penalty in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800Washington, DC 20036USA\n (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main\n (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax\n (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Topics\n\n\n\nPolitics & PolicyInternational AffairsImmigration & MigrationRace & EthnicityReligionAge & GenerationsGender & LGBTQFamily & RelationshipsEconomy & WorkScienceInternet & TechnologyNews Habits & MediaMethodological ResearchFull topic list \n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n Email Newsletters\n Instagram\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n YouTube\n RSS\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.
