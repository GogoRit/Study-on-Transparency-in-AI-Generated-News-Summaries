Jackson, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to set their own laws about abortion.\nAbortion clinics across Texas had already stopped performing the procedure, fearing prosecution under state laws that were on the books before Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas now has three significant abortion bans in place and several administrative regulations governing the procedure, setting up a potential conflict as the largest state to ban abortion navigates this new legal landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n New Texas law increasing penalties for abortion providers goes into effect Aug. 25 \n\n\n\n\n        \n          Updated:\n        \n        July 27, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nThe trigger law criminalizes performing an abortion from the moment of fertilization unless the pregnant patient is facing \u201ca life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy.\u201d The statute specifically prohibits prosecuting a pregnant patient who undergoes an abortion.\nViolations of the law are punishable by up to life in prison. The statute also says that the  attorney general \u201cshall\u201d seek a civil penalty of not less than $100,000, plus attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe Texas District and County Attorneys Association has raised concerns about this language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf this sends up a double jeopardy red flag for you, congratulations,\u201d a memo on the group\u2019s website reads, citing a 1994 case where the Supreme Court ruled that a defendant who is convicted and punished for a criminal offense cannot also have a non-remedial civil penalty imposed against them. Similarly, if a defendant pays a civil fine, they cannot be criminally prosecuted for the same offense.\n\u201cBy requiring [the office of the attorney general] to pursue a minimum six-figure civil penalty for the same conduct that potentially incurs a felony sentence of imprisonment and a criminal fine,\u201d the memo reads, \u201cthe legislature has created a legal framework that could prevent a criminal conviction for certain violations of the new anti-abortion \u2018trigger law\u2019 crime if any of those civil fines are collected by OAG.\u201d\nCharles \u201cRocky\u201d Rhodes, a law professor at the South Texas College of Law, said it\u2019s not yet clear whether the $100,000 penalty would foreclose criminal prosecution.\n\u201cI might try [that defense] if I was representing somebody, but \u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear slam dunk there,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe civil fine, though, may prove to be an important piece of enforcement as more prosecutors come out publicly in opposition to the criminal laws. Several major cities are considering or have passed measures that prohibit the use of local funds to investigate or prosecute abortion-related crimes, and district attorneys in five large counties \u2014 Bexar, Dallas, Fort Bend, Nueces and Travis \u2014 have said they won\u2019t bring criminal charges in these cases.\nAlready, conservative lawmakers have said they intend to propose legislation to allow prosecutors to bring abortion cases outside their own jurisdiction if the local district attorney won\u2019t.\n\u201cThat\u2019s never been done in Texas, but the Legislature probably can at least start that ball rolling,\u201d said Dallas attorney David Coale. \u201cThen, you\u2019ve got prosecutors with conflicting opinions about the same set of facts, and then you\u2019ve really got a zoo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOther abortion laws\nThere are also looming legal questions about how these laws align with the state\u2019s other abortion statutes. The pre-Roe statutes, which date back to Texas\u2019 first criminal code in 1857, come with two to five years in prison, compared with the five years to life in the trigger ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach of the laws have a little bit different scope, different punishments and potential arguments about how far they extend,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThe position of the Texas Legislature is going to be that these laws are complementary, rather than in conflict.\u201d\nThe pre-Roe statutes are currently in effect, but the state Supreme Court has not issued a final ruling on whether they can be criminally enforced going forward. Coale said this legal limbo may push prosecutors to bring charges under the trigger law.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a prosecutor, why on earth would you go anywhere near that?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to charge something under the new statute in the most limited way you can that clearly doesn\u2019t conflict with anything in the old statutes.\u201d\nIf a prosecutor brings a case under the trigger law, Coale said defendants will likely try to argue that the statutes conflict. But much of this will remain theoretical until a test case is identified and charged, which may not happen immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy expectation is what\u2019s going to happen is exactly what happened in SB 8,\u201d he said, referring to the civilly enforced ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. \u201cPeople are going to err on the side of caution and \u2026 the deterrent effect is going to be huge.\u201d\nOne significant distinction between the two laws is that, while both statutes criminalize the person who performs the illegal abortion, the pre-Roe statutes also allow charges to be brought against anyone who \u201cfurnishes the means\u201d for an abortion.\n\u201cThe trigger law really is targeted at the abortion provider, while the old law \u2026 also has this additional basis of accomplice liability for the person who procures the means to be able to have an abortion,\u201d said Rhodes. \u201cThe law is vague as to what that really means though.\u201d\nIn the age of medication abortion, where people can get abortion-inducing pills mailed to their homes from overseas pharmacies or advocacy networks, identifying who performed or furnished the means for an illegal abortion will likely become more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready, nonprofit abortion funds that help people travel out of state have stopped their work, fearing potential criminal prosecution under the pre-Roe statutes. Lawmakers in Texas and in other conservative states have discussed finding ways to prohibit interstate travel for abortion.\n\u201cPeople are saying some things in their zeal about abortion that are just not very democratic, and there\u2019s no other polite way to say it,\u201d Coale said.\nEven in jurisdictions where police and prosecutors aren\u2019t actively working to identify and charge these cases, the threat of civil action still looms. Texas remains under Senate Bill 8, which allows any private citizen to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d in an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.\nWith $10,000 per abortion on the line, Coale said, there\u2019s significant motivation for private citizens to try to identify people who have had an abortion \u2014 and, in the process, bring them into the criminal justice system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as we have SB 8, people are going to be out there \u2026 trying to get that $10,000 penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cWho else will have their hand in it will depend on who is in charge.\u201d\n\nThe full program is now LIVE for the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in Austin.
