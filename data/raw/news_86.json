The country\u2019s ban on abortions has sparked mass demonstrations alongside the return of a seminal women\u2019s rights poster by the famed American artist Barbara Kruger which has appeared across Poland\u2019s streets. \nA Polish gallery plastered Kruger\u2019s famed work Untitled (Your body is a battleground) across the city of Szczecin \u2014 nearly three decades since the artist developed the graphic work. \u201cThe urgent and brave protesting of marginalized, disempowered and newly empowered bodies is an insistent threat to the dominant and extremist choreographies of religion, power, and politics in Poland,\u201d said Kruger to\u00a0The Art Newspaper. \u201cThe brazen hypocrisy of the church and its predictable fist-bumping with the political right make for a grotesque dance of male bonding and resolute abuse of power.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe artist initially created the work back in 1989 for the Women\u2019s March on Washington, a protest against anti-abortion laws in the United States that threatened to undermine Roe v. Wade \u2014\u00a0the US Supreme Court decision guaranteeing the right to access abortion care. Poland began launching strict restrictions on abortion and sex education after the fall of communism when the Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art mounted hundreds of posters of the work in Polish translation on buildings in Warsaw.\nIn the past few weeks, The TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art in Szczecin received new prints of the poster from Kruger\u2019s Berlin gallery, Spr\u00fcth Magers. TRAFO described the importance of the poster on its website, saying that its first appearance in Poland came at a time \u201cwhen we were in the process of forming a modern society.\u201d Having added: \u201cToday, a quarter of a century later, body politics is still a valid issue. With the politicians trying to objectify the female body, Kruger\u2019s work remains extremely relevant and \u2018ready to use.\u2019\u201d\n\n                                                \n                                                                                                    \n\n                                                            Read Full Article\n                                                        \n\n\n\n\nWe got you covered.
