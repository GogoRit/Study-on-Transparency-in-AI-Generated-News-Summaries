    "description": "Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Wednesday pledged to sign a federal ban on abortion but again did not set down a marker for what timeline such a proposal should encompass. Haley suggested during remarks in Manchester, New Hampshire, that passing one would be highly unlikely without significantly more Republicans in Congress. The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said \u201cno one has been honest\u201d about how difficult a ban could be to achieve. The comments come amid a continuing debate over abortion among Republicans seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination. As South Carolina governor, Haley signed a ban on abortions after around 20 weeks. On Tuesday, South Carolina\u2019s Senate passed a ban on the procedure after around six weeks.",

(AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Wednesday pledged to sign a federal ban on abortion but noted that passing one would be highly unlikely without more Republicans in Congress.Although Haley didn\u2019t say how many weeks a federal ban should encompass, her commitment to signing one is the most specific she has been on the issue during her presidential campaign. The former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said \u201cno one has been honest\u201d about how difficult a ban could be to achieve, in a closely divided federal government.\u201cIt would take a majority of the House, 60 senators and a president to sign it,\u201d Haley said at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, suggesting that even a few GOP pickups in the 2024 elections wouldn\u2019t make the difference in passage. She was referring specifically to the supermajority required for major legislation to clear the 100-member Senate. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had 60 Republican senators in 100 years,\u201d Haley said. \n\nThe comments come amid a continuing debate over abortion restrictions among the Republicans seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination. Sen. Tim Scott, Haley\u2019s fellow South Carolinian who launched his bid this week, has said he would sign a 15-week ban. Other candidates, like former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, have said the issue should stay in the states without a Republican supermajority in Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to launch his campaign later Wednesday, recently signed a six-week ban in Florida, which former President Donald Trump subsequently implied was \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d Former Vice President Mike Pence, preparing his own campaign, has said he supported Florida\u2019s bill and would sign such a measure as president. The six-week threshold comes before many women realize they are pregnant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked by an attendee how she would square her own opposition to abortion to \u201coverwhelmingly pro-choice\u201d states like New Hampshire, Haley said she would not personally compromise.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t suddenly change my pro-life position because I\u2019m campaigning in New Hampshire,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly personal, and I\u2019m going to treat it with the respect it deserves.New Hampshire was among the least restrictive states on abortion until 2021, when it enacted a ban on the procedure after 24 weeks of pregnancy. This year, lawmakers have considered more than half a dozen bills on both sides of the issue. With a closely divided Legislature, none have passed.In South Carolina, Haley signed an abortion ban after around 20 weeks. On Tuesday, South Carolina\u2019s Senate passed a ban on the procedure after around six weeks, which the current Republican governor has said he would sign. Abortion rights groups have already pledged to file legal challenges.\u201cNow it\u2019s back in the states where it belongs,\u201d Haley said Wednesday, referencing last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Haley referenced national consensus in her speech last month at the headquarters of a major anti-abortion group, which has said it wouldn\u2019t back any White House candidate who did not at a minimum support a 15-week federal abortion ban. During those remarks at the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America headquarters, Haley said she saw a federal role on the issue but stopped short of endorsing a federal ban.\n\nIntroducing Haley at a \u201cWomen for Nikki\u201d event later Wednesday, the co-chair her women\u2019s coalition in New Hampshire sought to shift the focus away from abortion.\u201cIt\u2019s time to put a woman in the White House to lead the charge on some important issues other than our reproductive rights,\u201d said Sharon Bolduc, whose husband unsuccessfully challenged Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire last year.\u201cWe as women voters have so much more to offer the American people than just talking about our uteruses,\u201d she said in an interview afterward. \u201cLet\u2019s get over that already.\u201dHaley on Wednesday again referenced her call in 2015 for the removal of a Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina Statehouse as evidence of her consensus-building ability. She had previously dismissed a Democratic challenger\u2019s call for removal of the flag, calling it a stunt. But Haley later sought its removal after the racist killings of nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by a white supremacist. \n\n\u201cIt starts at the top, when you go and you govern or lead, without judgment of your people,\u201d Haley said. \u201cBut with getting them to see the best of themselves to go to a better place, that\u2019s the key.\u201d___Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina, and can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEG KINNARD\n\n\n                Kinnard covers national politics for The Associated Press.
