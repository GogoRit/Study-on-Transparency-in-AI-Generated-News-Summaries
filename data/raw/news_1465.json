Ron DeSantis recently signed a ban on abortions after just six weeks of pregnancy. Although the state is still awaiting a verdict from the Florida Supreme Court on whether a 15-week ban signed into law last July can continue to be upheld, this even stricter bill is now waiting in the wings to replace it. That move would be a sharp right turn for the state. Until recently, Florida has, for the most part, been an easier place to receive abortion care than most states that surround it. Before the 15-week ban passed in July 2022, Floridians could get abortions until 24 weeks of pregnancy (though they were\u2014and still are\u2014subject to a number of barriers to care, including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period enacted one year ago). Following the repeal of Roe v. Wade, Florida saw the largest 6-month increase in legal abortions for any state. People who had to travel across state lines for care likely accounted for about 5% of those abortions; the nearby states Georgia and South Carolina effectively have six-week bans, while Alabama and Mississippi both ban abortion outright.A six-week ban would more closely align Florida with its neighbors and effectively ban most abortions in the state, says Dr. Shelly Tien, a maternal fetal medicine physician who provides abortion care at Planned Parenthood clinics across Florida. Many people aren\u2019t even aware they\u2019re pregnant by six weeks; a two-week delay in a menstrual cycle is fairly normal and could happen for a \u201cmultitude of health reasons,\u201d says Tien. \u201cThese bans make it impossible as health-care providers to provide the care that we were trained to provide to our communities.\u201dRead More: Abortion Rights Benefit People Who Want Kids, TooIf and when the six-week ban takes effect, people who might otherwise have sought care in Florida will end up having to travel many states away to get an abortion. The resulting influx of patients could further strain already overburdened care systems in those states. Florida is \u201cone of the few remaining options for women who are already desperate not to be pregnant and already traveling really far,\u201d says Tien. But not, it appears, for long.Florida\u2019s new six-week ban will erode access even further by allocating $25 million from the state toward funding anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers, which are known to offer misinformation aimed at dissuading those seeking abortion from going through with it. Funding these types of facilities can make some vulnerable people less inclined to get proper care at legitimate clinics, says Tien. \u201cThese centers may not be providing scientific, evidence-based information for patients, which is our primary responsibility as health-care providers.\u201dThe bill allows exceptions for rape, incest, medical emergencies, and fatal fetal abnormalities at varying cutoff points, but these aren\u2019t easily categorized in practice. \u201cThere are many complex and nuanced health situations that arise that don\u2019t fit these narrow exceptions,\u201d says Tien. \u201cAs physicians and health-care providers, it is our primary pressing professional and ethical duty that we are proactive in offering interventions before patients get too sick.\u201d Because of this, she says, \u201cwe see health-care providers placed in a difficult position,\u201d afraid that the counseling and interventions upheld by the best medical standards won\u2019t be respected in a court of law.Because of this, practitioners say, strict bans such as Florida\u2019s often end up contradicting politicians\u2019 stated intentions to protect and provide for expectant and new mothers. \u201cIf we truly wanted to shift the focus to supporting patients and their families, then we should be providing services for prenatal care, expanding Medicaid and insurance coverage for pregnant women who don\u2019t have that care, supporting education and teaching for nurses and health care providers, and supporting birthing hospitals so that they can keep their labor and deliveries in their NICUs open,\u201d says Tien.More Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
