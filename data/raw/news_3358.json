FRC will be hosting a Pro-Life Legislative Summit Saturday morning after the conference,\u201d an invitation sent to ALEC legislators and obtained by CMD reads.While the invite states the \u201cevent is hosted by FRC and is not part of the ALEC conference,\u201d it was sent to ALEC members and asks recipients to \u201cPlease wear your event badge.\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated FRC as an anti-LGBTQ hate group.It\u2019s not the first time ALEC has cozied up to the hate group or other religious Right organizations. FRC hosted a \u201cValues Action Dinner\u201d at ALEC\u2019s annual meeting in Utah last July, where the group promoted anti-trans legislation to ALEC legislators. ALEC has also provided space at its meeting for Alliance Defending Freedom, the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, and the National Pro-Life Women\u2019s Caucus.The event also fits into ALEC\u2019s strategy of outsourcing access to its legislative members on controversial issues that could jeopardize the group\u2019s support from the corporations that\u00a0bankroll its operations.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a history of working on other issues like gun rights and social issues and things like that, which has not ended well for ALEC,\u201d said CEO Lisa Nelson at a \u201cSaving America Through the States\u201d action session at the 40th Anniversary May 2021 meeting of the Council for National Policy, a secretive, far-right Christian network. \u201cBecause of our intersection of business and legislators we kind of stick to the fiscal issues.\u201dAt that forum, State Sen. Jason Rapert (R-Ark), an ALEC member, described how, \u201cWe created the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, which is basically ALEC from a Biblical worldview\u201d to \u201callow[] us to deal with those issues that [Nelson] said [are] not the direct mission\u201d of ALEC.Using the Texas \u201cHeartbeat\u201d Bill as a ModelDecember\u2019s FRC \u201cPro-Life Legislative Summit\u201d for ALEC members featured Jonathan Mitchell, \u201cthe author of the groundbreaking Texas Heartbeat Act,\u201d speaking on \u201chow states can respond to one of the most eagerly awaited Supreme Court cases \u2013 Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2013 and see successful legislation like the Texas Heartbeat Act passed in your state.\u201dJoining Mitchell in addressing ALEC lawmakers were FRC\u2019s Senior Fellow for Biblical Worldview and Strategic Engagement Joseph Backholm; Research Fellow for Legal and Policy Studies Katherine Johnson; and Director of Federal Affairs \u2013 Life and Human Dignity Connor Semelsberger.The Texas Heartbeat Act, or Texas Senate Bill 8, essentially bans abortions in the state at around six weeks of pregnancy or when fetal cardiac activity may be detected, even in cases where conception resulted from rape or incest.\u00a0The reference to a \u201cheartbeat\u201d in the SB 8 is \u201cmedically inaccurate,\u201d because an embryo does not have a developed heart at six weeks, and the \u201cbeat\u201d is actually electrical impulses. The sound one hears is generated by the ultrasound machine.A divided Supreme Court used its shadow docket to allow the law to stand pending numerous legal challenges shortly before it went into effect on Aug. 31.Mitchell, a former solicitor general in Texas, is credited with coming up with the strategy that exploited legal loopholes that has allowed the law to stand by effectively outsourcing enforcement to private individuals.\u00a0At least 12 states have versions of a heartbeat bill on the books that could go into effect if the landmark decision upholding abortion rights, Roe v. Wade, is overturned.Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, challenging Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortion after 15 weeks, were heard in December, and a decision is expected from the nation\u2019s highest court by June.Anti-abortion groups like FRC believe the case \u201cchanges the trajectory of the pro-life movement\u201d because the Supreme Court is now firmly captured by the Right following Trump\u2019s appointment of justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.ALEC\u2019s former national chair, Speaker Phillip Gunn (R-MS), touted the case and its prospects for overturning Roe v. Wade during an ALEC panel at the CNP meeting\u00a0last May, CMD reported.\u00a0\u201cWe think that\u2019s going to be a landmark case. All of us know that the United State Supreme Court composition has changed. We believe, in a way, that is more pro-life,\u201d Gunn told meeting attendees. \u201cThey say that Amy Coney Barrett is one of the most active, pro-life people in America, so we believe that she brings a new dynamic to that court. We think our case, our law that we passed in 2018, will be transformative in the arena in abortion. We\u2019re proud of that.\u201dUtah State Senate President J. Stuart Adams, ALEC\u2019s 2021 national chair, added that the Utah legislature \u201ccopied Mississippi\u2019s anti-abortion bill and joined with them\u201d in defending the Mississippi law.FRC Pushes its Agenda at ALEC SummitFRC circulated numerous papers at the ALEC meeting in December, obtained by CMD, promoting anti-abortion and anti-trans policies.In one paper, FRC argues against women\u2019s access to abortion, and another provides policy prescriptions to \u201cdefund both abortions and abortion centers.\u201dOther policy papers argue for total abortion bans, legal protections for aborted fetuses, abortion pill bans, and other extremist policies.FRC also circulated a paper on anti-trans legislation, known as the \u201cSave Adolescents from Experimentation Act\u201d (SAFE Act), that would ban gender-affirming medical treatments and hormone therapies for transgender youth.In one paper, FRC argues that these treatments \u201cviolate the most fundamental principle of medical ethics \u2013 \u2018First, do no harm.'\u201dFRC\u2019s \u201cValues Action Dinner\u201d at last year\u2019s ALEC annual meeting featured Arkansas Rep. Robin Lundstrom, the bill\u2019s primary sponsor in that state.Arkansas\u2019s SAFE Act, enacted over the governor\u2019s veto in April 2021, was blocked by a federal judge after the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit arguing that the law violates the U.S. Constitution. FRC filed an amicus brief in the support of Arkansas in the case.About David ArmiakDavid Armiak is research director and an investigative journalist with the Center for Media and Democracy.
