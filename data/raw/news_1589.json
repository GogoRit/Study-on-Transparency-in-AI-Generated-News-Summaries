(Courtesy\u00a0of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebrask\nTwenty-nine senators have signed on as sponsors of the \u201cNebraska Heartbeat Act,\u201d Legislative Bill 626. But 33 votes are needed in the 49-member Legislature to overcome an expected filibuster and pass the measure.\nAlbrecht confident\nThe 33-vote threshold has eluded abortion opponents in recent months.\nBut State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, the main sponsor of the bill, said Monday that two other senators, John Arch of Papillion and Ben Hansen of Blair, are in support, as well \u2014 leaving the bill two short of 33. Albrecht said two other opponents of abortion rights, Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth and Christy Armendariz of Omaha, have told her they want to listen to the floor debate before casting their votes.\n  State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston. \u00a0(Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\nAlbrecht expressed confidence that Armendariz will support LB 626 in the end. She added that the bill was amended to include exceptions in the case of rape and incest because of concerns raised by Brandt.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to get it passed,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201c(But) I\u2019m not confident until Tom Brandt says he\u2019s with me.\u201d\nThe 2022 elections, she said, \u201cmade a difference\u201d in the vote count, as opposed to the past.\nLB 626 would ban an abortion if a doctor can detect a heartbeat from a developing embryo, typically after six weeks. Exceptions would be allowed in the event of a medical emergency involving the mother, or in a case of rape or incest.\nOpponents of LB 626 have labeled it a \u201cnear total ban\u201d on abortions because many women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant until after six weeks. Currently, Nebraska law bans abortions after 20 weeks of gestation.\nThe Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee is expected to vote out the bill this week for debate by the full Legislature \u2014 a debate likely to extend at least eight hours.\nBut the magic number to pass any controversial bill in the Legislature is 33 votes \u2014 a super majority to overcome a filibuster.\nLast year, a bill that would have triggered an abortion ban in Nebraska in the event the U.S. Supreme Court tossed out the constitutional right to abortion granted in Roe v. Wade fell short by two votes of halting a filibuster.\nAnd, last summer, then-Gov. Pete Ricketts abandoned plans to call a special session of the State Legislature to restrict abortion, saying he could not find agreement among 33 senators to do it.\nA recent vote count conducted by the Flatwater Free Press also indicated that LB 626 had 31 supporters, two short of the required 33.\nOthers viewed as possible supporters\nBesides Brandt and Armendariz, Fremont Sen. Lynne Walz and Omaha Sen. Justin Wayne, two Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, are viewed as possible supporters. Only one Democrat signed on as a cosponsor of LB 626, Omaha Sen. Mike McDonnell.\nThe only abortion-related vote taken so far during the 2023 session was a Jan. 26 vote to refer the bill to the Legislature\u2019s Judiciary Committee \u2014 which traditionally deals with abortion issues \u2014 rather than the Health and Human Services Committee, as had been decided by the Legislature\u2019s Reference Committee.\nThe vote was 32-14 to reject the re-referencing attempt by Omaha Sen. Megan Hunt, an abortion rights advocate \u2014 one vote short of 33. However, one opponent of abortion, Norfolk Sen. Robert Dover, was absent that day.\nThe Planned Parenthood of Advocates of Nebraska point out that a December poll by the ACLU of Nebraska found that 59% of respondents opposed \u201cmore restrictive abortion bans in Nebraska,\u201d compared to 36% of respondents who supported it.\n\u201cWe are standing side by side with Nebraskans to keep abortion safe and legal in Nebraska,\u201d Curry Grubb said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAbortion rights group says fight \u2018far from over\u2019 involving new restrictions in Nebraska\nby Paul Hammel, Nebraska Examiner February 21, 2023\nAbortion rights group says fight \u2018far from over\u2019 involving new restrictions in Nebraska\nby Paul Hammel, Nebraska Examiner February 21, 2023\n LINCOLN \u2014 Despite recent reporting that abortion opponents are two votes short of the super-majority needed to pass a so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill in the Nebraska Legislature, a Planned Parenthood official says the fight is far from over.\n\u201cWe know it will be close, but we have successfully blocked four abortion bans in the past year and we can do it again,\u201d said Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska.\nCurry Grubb, in a press release, said that the vote will come down to a \u201crazor thin\u00a0margin\u201d but that supporters of abortion rights feel the \u201cdangerous\u201d impacts of a near total abortion ban will cause the proposal to fall short.\n  Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska.
