They marveled\r\n  at mesmerizing videos of 4D ultrasounds, awe-inspiring\r\n  details of human development, and\r\n  stunning lifelike models of babies depicting the\r\n  nine-month development from fertilization to just\r\n  before birth. \nBut just a few miles away, the museum\u2019s design\r\n  studio was quiet, with the lights turned off, computers\r\n  dark, and desks deserted. After more than\r\n  a year of planning, designing, crafting\u2014and several\r\n  weeks of long days that were necessary to\r\n  meet the grand opening deadline\u2014the designers\r\n  and fabricators were taking some well-earned\r\n  vacation time.  \nThe psalmist declares, \u201cI praise you, for I am\r\n  fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are\r\n  your works; my soul knows it very well\u201d (Psalm\r\n  139:14). The design team certainly knows.\r\n  Lead production designer Allen Greene said,\r\n  \u201cOur team has tried in a small way to fearfully\r\n  and wonderfully create this exhibit. It\u2019s been a\r\n  labor of love.\u201d  \nIn the beginning, God formed the first human,\r\n  Adam, from dust and breathed into him life (Genesis\r\n  1:26, 2:7). Creating an exhibit that merely\r\n  mimics that life was an incredible effort. But the\r\n  challenge of creating gives these artists a deeper\r\n  understanding of the Creator. \n\n\nLead artist Doug Henderson adds\r\ndetails to one of the baby models.\n\nMasterpiece on Display  \nFearfully and Wonderfully Made (FAWM) is a\r\n  bit different from the museum\u2019s other exhibits,\r\n  which focus on the authority of God\u2019s Word, starting\r\n  with the six-day creation just over 6,000 years\r\n  ago. Though Answers in Genesis (the ministry\r\n  behind both the Creation Museum and the Ark\r\n  Encounter) has always been pro-life, this is their\r\n  first exhibit that specifically celebrates the sanctity\r\n  of human life created in God\u2019s image from\r\n  fertilization.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s very controversial and very timely,\u201d noted\r\n  Patrick Marsh, vice president of attractions\r\n  design. \u201cPeople get lied to by so many people out\r\n  in the world about what is a baby. We\u2019ve lost the\r\n  preciousness of life.\u201d  \nThere\u2019s never been a better time for the Creation\r\n  Museum to unveil this life-promoting exhibit, to\r\n  showcase the Creator\u2019s masterpiece\u2014us. \nCasting the Vision\nFrom the first vision-casting meeting in May\r\n  2019, the team decided that the exhibit would\r\n  focus on celebrating human life and the fact\r\n  that we are made in the image of God, rather\r\n  than focus on abortion. In fact, the word abortion doesn\u2019t appear until halfway through the exhibit. \nWith their vision in place, it was time to think\r\n  about the message. Content manager Tim Chaffey\r\n  met with lead production designer Allen Greene\r\n  to discuss a strategy for tackling the number of\r\n  sensitive concepts in a way that would blend with\r\n  the style proposed by the designers and artists. \n\nBeing able to see the details of little babies moving and smiling in the womb gives us insight into our\r\nCreator\u2019s handiwork that no generation before us has ever seen.\r\n \u2014Tim Chaffey, Content Manager\n\nThey brainstormed with people of different\r\n  ages and backgrounds who were committed to\r\n  the sanctity of life. They met with medical professionals,\r\n  people involved in pro-life ministries,\r\n  young women from other countries, parents who\r\n  adopted, parents of premature babies, and many\r\n  others. They also viewed footage of 4D ultrasounds,\r\n  getting a close-up look at how babies grow.  \nTim and Allen interviewed expert scientists like\r\n  Dr. Georgia Purdom (PhD, molecular genetics), Dr.\r\n  Elizabeth Mitchell (a former obstetrician), and the\r\n  late Dr. Tommy Mitchell. They also relied on the\r\n  indispensable expertise of AiG\u2019s anatomist Dr.\r\n  David Menton (PhD, biology), an award-winning\r\n  former professor from Washington University\u2019s\r\n  School of Medicine and a long-time advocate of the\r\n  unborn. (A plaque honoring Dr. Menton\u2019s lifetime\r\n  of research that informed this new exhibit is on\r\n  display for museum visitors.)  \nIn addition to describing the science behind the\r\n  process of development, the exhibit also addresses\r\n  other issues, such as adoption, abortion, and what\r\n  happens after a baby dies\u2014all topics that require\r\n  a sensitive approach. But it would take more than\r\n  just words to create an environment that would\r\n  both inspire wonder at God\u2019s design and communicate\r\n  God\u2019s comfort and forgiveness. \nA Life-Giving Design\nThe delicate design language of FAWM stands\r\n  in stark contrast to the other exhibits Allen Greene has worked on, such as the ruggedness\r\n  of Noah\u2019s workshop at the Ark Encounter and the\r\n  rusty warehouse textures of the new Relevance of\r\n  Genesis space in the museum. But as a designer,\r\n  Allen has learned to be flexible to make his style\r\n  faithful to whatever message an exhibit means to\r\n  convey. \n\nI\u2019ve had three kids, and I\u2019ve never understood the kind of stuff that I\u2019m just beginning to peer into.\r\n\u2014Allen Greene, Lead Production Designer \n\n\u201cWe are God\u2019s art,\u201d Allen explained. \u201cSo this\r\n  exhibit is a celebration of creativity and art.\u201d The\r\n  walls feature soft watercolor textures and cursive\r\n  font. At the entrance, the exhibit\u2019s sign features\r\n  a unique lighting effect, pulsating with the slow,\r\n  calming tempo of breathing or a heartbeat. That\r\n  was graphic designer Jenelle Cervenka\u2019s idea.  \nJenelle said she designed the walls and signs for\r\n  the exhibit with one thing in mind: \u201cWe wanted\r\n  it to be a space that would be healing and truly be\r\n  pro-life, and not in just the terms you might think\r\n  of, but truly be life-giving.\u201d \n\nStudying anything God made gives you a deeper\r\nunderstanding of who he is.\r\n\u2014Jenelle Cervenka, Graphic Designer \n\nThe team knew that some guests who would\r\n  visit the exhibit would have lost a child through\r\n  miscarriage or some other tragedy, and\r\n  even some who might have chosen to abort\r\n  their baby.  \nJenelle\u2019s past work at a support clinic\r\n  for women facing unexpected pregnancies\r\n  allowed her to lend a first-hand perspective\r\n  of the challenges these women face.  \n\u201cThey are usually afraid and lack the support\r\n  they need. Knowing this, I thought it\r\n  very important for the [exhibit] space to be\r\n  gentle and genuine.\u201d  \nThe sensitive atmosphere Allen and\r\n  Jenelle created prepares guests to appreciate\r\n  the main attraction\u2014the stunningly\r\n  lifelike model babies. \nMaking Babies\nInstead of sculpting nine models, one for\r\n  each month, the team sculpted twelve, representing\r\n  the baby\u2019s age when certain features\r\n  are developing, particularly features\r\n  that people often identify with personhood.\r\n  For example, one model corresponds to\r\n  the age when the heart begins to beat and\r\n  another to the age when fingerprints appear.  \nRather than purchasing models of babies\r\n  from an outside source, lead artist Doug\r\n  Henderson wanted to design his own that\r\n  he could pose as if they\u2019d been moving and changing\r\n  in the womb.  \nFor 20 years, Doug has sculpted likenesses for\r\n  museums around the world, among them sculptures\r\n  of Kentucky Fried Chicken\u2019s Colonel Sanders, baseball\r\n  legend Roberto Clemente, and actor Matthew\r\n  McConaughey.  \nBut the babies for the FAWM exhibit were probably\r\n  the hardest human models he\u2019s ever worked on.  \n\u201cMaking something that looks like what God has\r\n  made is one of the most difficult things you could possibly\r\n  do,\u201d Doug said. \u201cThe difference between something\r\n  that looks like a baby and an actual baby is like\r\n  the difference between a photo of a skyscraper and a\r\n  skyscraper. No matter how good of a job we do, it\u2019s not\r\n  even comparing to what God has done.\u201d  \nBut guests at the exhibit who leave with a tissue\r\n  pressed against their tears testify to the team\u2019s masterful\r\n  ability to replicate the Creator\u2019s elaborate design. \nGetting Started \n\n\nFrom fertilization to full\r\nterm, the lifelike baby\r\nmodels give guests a peek\r\nat the process of life.\n\nEach of the baby models began on a computer\r\n  screen. Studying the footage of 4D ultrasounds, consulting\r\n  medical textbooks, and seeking Dr. Menton\u2019s\r\n  expertise, exhibit artist Eric Remus created a digital\r\n  sculpture of each model in a 3D modeling program\r\n  called ZBrush.  \nNext, using a 3D printer, Eric printed the sculptures\r\n  out of resin. The printed sculptures came out with a\r\n  slightly uneven texture. Unlike the Ark Encounter\r\n  animals Doug and his crew sculpted in the past,\r\n  a model of a baby has no scales or feathers to hide\r\n  imperfections. A baby\u2019s skin is smooth, so the sculptures\r\n  had to be carefully sanded, with any cracks\r\n  filled in with modeling putty. Too much sanding\r\n  could flatten a curve or round a straight edge.  \nFrom his years of sculpting, Doug knows the\r\n  importance of precision. \u201cThe differences look big\r\n  until you start measuring and realize that we\u2019re all\r\n  very tiny bits different from each other. A millimeter\r\n  on a model can make a huge difference.\u201d\n First Things First\n Next, the design team used the sculptures to make\r\n  precise molds that would hold the material necessary\r\n  to form the models.  \nThe first model doesn\u2019t actually look like a baby at\r\n  all. But that\u2019s because the designers chose to replicate\r\n  the first part of life\u2014fertilization, when the DNA in\r\n  the father\u2019s sperm combines with the mother\u2019s DNA\r\n  within the egg to create the unique combination of\r\n  information necessary for an individual human.  \nThe first eight models were made of clear resin,\r\n  carefully custom tinted by exhibit artist Jesse Pi\u00e9 to\r\n  get just the right translucency of an embryo. Then,\r\n  starting with the ninth model, the\r\n  babies were cast from flexible silicone,\r\n  better for showing a growing baby on\r\n  the move.  \nBut Doug was puzzled over how\r\n  to mold the silicone babies without\r\n  showing seams all over. One night, in\r\n  a dream, he pictured a mold with only\r\n  one slit in the back. When the silicone\r\n  had cured (hardened), the team could\r\n  crack open the seam and \u201cbirth\u201d the\r\n  baby out the back.  \nEasier dreamed than done. The process\r\n  was more like a nightmare. Due to\r\n  chemistry problems with the material,\r\n  the team was left with only one good\r\n  copy of each of the last four models.\r\n  Time was closing in, and the final deadline\r\n  had to be met. Yet some of those\r\n  castings had to be patched with more of\r\n  the silicone used to cast them. Silicone\r\n  is temperamental, requiring exact conditions\r\n  to cure. The team learned that silicone\r\n  was \u201callergic,\u201d as Doug called it, to their nitrile\r\n  gloves and to latex. With even a small latex rubber\r\n  band in the room, the silicone refused to cure.  \n\u201cIf this was my first experience, I would have\r\n  said I need to find something else to do for a living,\u201d\r\n  Doug confessed. \u201cIt was the worst experience\r\n  of my entire career.\u201d  \nWhen a silicone model cured, Doug poured in\r\n  a liquid soap to help loosen the silicone from the\r\n  mold. Even then, the models sometimes came out\r\n  with parts of the mold attached and other times\r\n  the model left behind bits of fingers or toes in the\r\n  mold and even a chunk from the neck.  \nWhen it came time to mold the full-term baby,\r\n  the silicone cured on the outside of the model but\r\n  not the inside. Just weeks out from the exhibit\r\n  opening, the model looked like a baby-shaped\r\n  bag of pudding. So he wrapped it in plastic wrap\r\n  and propped it up. Eventually, the silicone cured\u2014but it bore a wrinkled texture all over from the\r\n  imprint of the plastic wrap. He had to resculpt the\r\n  surface out of silicone.  \nOnce the babies were molded, Doug and his\r\n  team scooped the silicone out of the floppy\r\n  sculptures and threaded wires into the arms and\r\n  legs to make them posable. Next they poured\r\n  resin inside to anchor the wires. \n\nSounds of Life\n\n\nProduction designer Ben Iocco composed the exhibit\r\nsoundtrack to help guests experience the wonder of life.\n\nBenjamin Iocco has been fascinated with\r\n  sound his whole life. As a boy, he took a tape\r\n  recorder outside and recorded sounds in nature\r\n  for hours. When he was 12, he started composing\r\n  his own music. \u201cI love telling stories,\u201d Ben\r\n  said. \u201cMusic is one of the best story languages.\u201d  \nBen is a production designer with Answers in\r\n  Genesis attractions, not a full-time composer.\r\n  But in 2019, Ben composed music for the Biblical\r\n  Authority exhibit at the Creation Museum. It\r\n  seemed a natural fit, then, for him to compose\r\n  music for Fearfully and Wonderfully Made. \nFirst, Ben learned what kind of message the\r\n  designers wanted to reflect in the exhibit. Then\r\n  he collected and tested sounds that captured\r\n  the mood and emotion. \u201cI look for the right\r\n  sonic blend to tell a story. I wanted to reflect a\r\n  feeling of wonder and beauty as well as a simplistic\r\n  familiarity and intimacy.\u201d  \nHe settled on sounds of the piano to bring an\r\n  intimate feel, with ambient textures in the background\r\n  to give a sense of awe. He meant the\r\n  underlying rhythm to replicate a heartbeat and\r\n  the softness to resemble the way a baby hears\r\n  sound within the mother\u2019s womb.  \nThough you won\u2019t see Ben\u2019s design, his\r\n  creativity plays a large part in preparing guests\r\n  to receive the message. \u201cI just hope the music\r\n  allows the guest to reflect on the wonder of life.\u201d \n\nFinal Touches\nWhen all the models were finally\r\n  molded, Doug\u2019s team set up a \u201cclean\r\n  room\u201d where he could add his final\r\n  touches in a dust-free environment.\r\n  Someone hung the word nursery in pink\r\n  and blue letters above the big windows\r\n  in the front of the room. For weeks anyone\r\n  passing by could watch Doug daubing\r\n  the babies with flesh tone paints.  \nDoug claims he\u2019s always resented\r\n  sleep. \u201cWhy would I be sleeping when I\r\n  could be making something?\u201d His nonchalant\r\n  relationship with rest serves\r\n  him well. For weeks, he spent 10\u201314\r\n  hours a day, seven days a week, working\r\n  on the models. The pace caught up with\r\n  him while he was painting. He shuddered.\r\n  \u201cThe most unforgiving, valuable\r\n  thing I ever painted, and I fell asleep\r\n  right in the middle of painting.\u201d \nThe Fine Details\nTo represent the fact that there is\r\n  truly only one race of humans, the\r\n  designers intended for the babies to be\r\n  ethnically ambiguous, referencing a\r\n  variety of genetic traits. The dark hair\r\n  they decided to use meant a tedious\r\n  task for the workers who would be\r\n  punching (inserting) each individual\r\n  hair into the silicone heads.  \n\n\nAmber Harbin, along with other\r\nexhibit artists, meticulously\r\npunched in each individual\r\nhair on the baby models.\n\nWhile trying to decide which kind of\r\n  hair would work best on the models,\r\n  Doug ordered a bag of yearling goat hair\r\n  for $60. The bag that arrived was the\r\n  size of a sandwich baggie. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d\r\n  he thought. There had to be a less\r\n  expensive option. One day, while walking\r\n  through the fabrication rooms in the\r\n  studio, he spotted some yak skins, most\r\n  likely left over from the team\u2019s work on\r\n  the Ark Encounter animals in 2016.  \nDoug showed a small team of designers how to\r\n  punch hair. After cleaning and coloring the yak\r\n  hair, they practiced punching it into the silicone\r\n  heads. The designers learned to appreciate the\r\n  complexity of growth patterns as well as the varying\r\n  density and length across the head, reflecting\r\n  often on the knowledge that God numbers the\r\n  hairs on our heads.  \nA professional who punches hair into models\r\n  like these on a regular basis takes 33 hours for\r\n  one head of hair. But the complications with the\r\n  silicone models had left the designers with under\r\n  two weeks to punch hair into the baby models.\r\n  The work was worth it. The silky hair adds a\r\n  final touch that makes these models look like real\r\n  babies, adding to the wonder of life.  \nAllen hopes these specific details will inspire\r\n  each guest in individual ways. \u201cFor one person it\r\n  might be a choice to let their baby live instead of\r\n  taking the baby\u2019s life. For another person it might\r\n  be to find the eternal life God gives through the\r\n  gospel. For another person it might be they\u2019ve had\r\n  a miscarriage and they see the hope of the gospel\r\n  in that situation. Others might be contemplating\r\n  suicide and see that they are fearfully and wonderfully\r\n  made\u2014that their life is valuable because\r\n  they are God\u2019s creation.\u201d \nSecrets on Display\n\u201cBy the time you\u2019re at the end [of designing an\r\n  exhibit], you think, \u2018I\u2019ll never do that again.\u2019\u201d Doug\r\n  chuckled. \u201cAnd about a week later you think, \u2018That\r\n  wasn\u2019t that bad. I could do that again.\u2019\u201d  \nAnd the design team will do it again.  \n\n\nIn 2021, the\r\nFearfully and\r\nWonderfully\r\nMade exhibit\r\nwill be\r\nexpanded and\r\nmoved to a\r\npermanent\r\nexhibit space.\n\nFearfully and Wonderfully Made is the first\r\n  phase of an expanded exhibit which, if all goes as\r\n  planned, will open later this year at the Creation\r\n  Museum. Though the message of life will be the\r\n  same, the expanded exhibit will include more\r\n  technology, more of the lifelike models of babies\r\n  in different stages of development, and more educational\r\n  aspects, such as a section exploring the\r\n  placenta\u2019s amazing design. \nThe Psalmist said we are \u201cmade in secret, intricately\r\n  woven in the depths of the earth\u201d (Psalm\r\n  139:15). But some of those secrets are now on display,\r\n  exquisitely crafted to give guests a greater appreciation\r\n  of life created in the image of the Creator. \n\nMatchless Wonder\nFar from merely a\r\nclump of cells or\r\na blob of tissue\r\ninside the mother\u2019s\r\nwomb, a baby\r\ndisplays incredible\r\ncomplexity and\r\npurposeful design.\r\nThe process of human\r\ndevelopment from\r\nfertilized egg to\r\nbirth is a matchless\r\nwonder revealing\r\nthe Creator\u2019s awe-inspiring\r\ncreativity\r\nand care.\n\n\n\nTHE BABY\u2019S AGE. The dates on this timeline show the embryonic age\r\nof the baby, which begin at the moment of fertilization. Pregnancy\r\ndates are usually based on the gestational age, which starts from the\r\nday of the mother\u2019s last menstruation. This common practice yields\r\nan age approximately two weeks older than the baby\u2019s actual age.
