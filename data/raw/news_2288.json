It will create a new living community for retired religious sisters, Milwaukee senior citizens, and single mothers attending Mount Mary University. The new building will also include a child day care for up to 100 children!\nCurrently, no such day care exists on campus. Part of the purpose for the establishment of one by the university is to assist the student population, especially student parents who make up 10 to 20% of the student body. The school hopes that this will not only lead to more single mothers being able to finish their degrees, but also increasing enrollment from the Milwaukee area. The project is slated to start construction on the home in July of this year and for it to open in September of 2021.\n\nThe building will exist to house pregnant students and retirees, but it will also look to create community between the two groups. It will provide spaces where people can dine, converse, and pray together. The purpose is to create not only a place for students to live, but cultivate an environment in which pregnant and parenting students can thrive. It also highlights an important point; in order to properly help the preborn child, you must also care for his/her mother. As the President of the University said, \u201cThis seemed like a perfect way to bring the sisters together with a demographic of students in the Milwaukee area that could benefit tremendously from having the support and resources a program like this could offer.\u201d\nMount Mary made an important decision here that should help pregnant and parenting students. Because this demographic size is so significant, you\u2019d think it would be common for colleges to be accommodating. But that is not always the case. For more about how different schools treat pregnant & parenting students (and what Students for Life is doing to help), click here.\nIt is important for colleges to help pregnant and parenting students. It is also an area the Pro-Life Generation is leading in. In fact, Students for Life groups across the country, in addition to educating peers about abortion, commit to be a resource for pregnant and parenting students on their campuses.\nTo learn more about Students for Life\u2019s Pregnant on Campus Initiative, visit the site here. The Pro-Life Gen is also going even farther, lobbying for Paid Family Leave, improved foster care, and providing resources to students on campus. In the end, it helps create a change in our culture, one that supports and strengthens women, and one that leads to a post-Roe society.\n\n Post Views: 1,308\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeEnd Student AbortionsFeaturedleadershipSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
