Police also matter. These two ideas are not mutually exclusive.\u201d\nBarcomb said the use of the particular phrase unmistakably embraces the Black Lives Matter movement at the heart of\u00a0sometimes violent\u00a0demonstrations across the country. And the words de facto endorsed the \u201cDefund The Police\u201d message central to recent protests.\nMcFarland fired back, stating unequivocally that she does not support the Black Lives Matter movement or efforts by the fringe to defund the police:\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the Barcomb campaign is purposely spreading misinformation,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me be very clear, I do not support the BLM movement or the anarchist and Marxist undertones of that movement. Anybody who knows me knows that I\u2019ve always stood with law enforcement and will always stand with law enforcement.\u00a0 But I unapologetically support our African American community, and I cherish the diversity of this community and this country.\u201d\nAs a Navy veteran, McFarland referenced police as \u201cpublic safety brothers and sisters.\u201d\nMcFarland\u2019s campaign took particular umbrage with a misleading text sent out by Barcomb that read, \u201cMcFarland called defunding police dangerous, but she said it\u2019s critical\u2026 \u2018Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u201d\nThat was a line from a Florida Politics\u00a0article\u00a0on the forum, but the ellipses eliminate the words \u201cin the wake of instances such as\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s death that institutional racism be addressed.\u201d\n\u201cI would never support defunding our police, and in fact think we should give law enforcement the resources they need to do a difficult job,\u201d McFarland said.\nAmong the memorable passages of Barcomb\u2019s email, she suggests a lack of perspective explains McFarland\u2019s view. \u201cFiona is probably too young to remember the tumultuous civil unrest in the 1960\u2019s \u2013 I am not,\u201d the email reads.\nThe phrase seemed especially potent coming out the same day civil rights leader\u00a0John Lewis\u00a0died.\nBarcomb said that line was meant to stress that \u201cthe violence in the 1960s is similar to what we are seeing today.\u201d\n\u201cYes there is peaceful protesting and I believe strongly in the Constitutional right to peaceful protesting. Sarasota has been fortunate in that regard,\u201d Barcomb said.\n\u201cBut the issues we are seeing with tearing down statues, looting and violence, that has nothing to do with the peaceful right to protest.\u201d\nAsked about whether she thought any positives were netted from the violence in the \u201860s political movement, Barcomb does not.\n\u201cOh my goodness no,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get to the point where it\u2019s that violent.\u201d\nNevertheless, Barcomb told Florida Politics she was shocked by statements McFarland\u00a0made at a Tiger Bay forum Thursday\u00a0featuring candidates for House District 72.\u00a0Barcomb said she was equally shocked at the Tiger Bay forum when all candidates were asked if they would accept the endorsement of Planned Parenthood.\nBarcomb immediately brushed away the suggestion and said no, she would not accept it.\n\u201cI\u2019m a pro-life candidate,\u201d she said. Democrat\u00a0Drake Buckman\u00a0said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would embrace the support. Republican\u00a0Jason Miller\u00a0surprised many saying he too would accept, if only on the hope he could bring the group closer to \u201ca version of pro-life.\u201d \u00a0McFarland said she is pro-life but any organization has the constitutional right to endorse whoever they want:\n\u201cI support free speech so Planned Parenthood is welcome to endorse whichever candidate they think aligns with their values,\u201d she said. \u201cI also am pro-life so I wonder if I might not be that person for them.\nMcFarland told Florida Politics she considers the answer to a hypothetical a strange place to level attacks. \u201cThe protection of life, particularly protection of a life that cannot defend itself, is a moral obligation,\u201d she said.\nBarcomb said she felt surprisingly alone at the forum in supporting a complete defunding of Planned Parenthood even though none of the candidates were specifically asked whether or not they support defunding it.\n\u201cRepublicans have a choice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can choose me. I am a true conservative. Or they can choose Fiona. She\u2019s trying to embrace true conservative values. But she was raised by her New York liberal upbringing.\u201d\nThat shot echoes criticism McFarland just moved to the district before filing to run and has drawn much of her\u00a0support from out of state. In Barcomb\u2019s email, she notes McFarland spent more time in California and New York than Sarasota.\nBarcomb, as it happens, also grew up in\u00a0California.\u00a0As for the reason McFarland lived there, she was stationed in the Golden State for six years serving on guided-missile destroyers.\nRegarding New York, McFarland said she did not grow up in a liberal household. \u201cMy mother ran against\u00a0Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said.\n\n\n Post Views: 545\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob Ogles\nJacob Ogles has covered politics in Florida since 2000 for regional outlets including SRQ Magazine in Sarasota, The News-Press in Fort Myers and The Daily Commercial in Leesburg.
