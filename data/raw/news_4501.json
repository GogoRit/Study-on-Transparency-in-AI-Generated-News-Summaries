In addition, the Trump Administration has made or proposed many changes to health policies and programs that could have a significant impact on health coverage and health care.\nPresident Trump\u2019s record on health care illustrates his priorities. An incumbent president\u2019s record is always relevant, but especially so for President Trump, who has not released more conventional campaign policy proposals. Moreover, the President\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis, and its economic consequences could influence how voters view the president in terms of his character, his leadership and his ability to protect the nation \u2013 particularly given widespread and ongoing transmission of the virus in the U.S. and evidence that the U.S. has fared relatively poorly compared to peer nations.\nFrom the start of his presidential term, President Trump took aim at the Affordable Care Act, consistent with his campaign pledge leading up to the 2016 election. He supported many efforts in Congress to repeal the law and replace it with an alternative that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, eliminated the Medicaid expansion, and reduced premium assistance for people seeking marketplace coverage. While the ACA remains in force, President Trump\u2019s Administration is supporting the case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ACA in its entirety that is scheduled for oral arguments one week after the election.\nThe Trump Administration has moved forward on many other health care fronts. The Administration has proposed spending reductions for both Medicaid and Medicare, along with proposals that would promote flexibility for states but limit eligibility for coverage under Medicaid (e.g., work requirements). The President has made prescription drug prices a top health policy priority and has issued several executive orders and other proposals that aim to lower drug prices; most of these proposals, however, have not been implemented, other than one change that would lower the cost of insulin for some Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, and another that allows pharmacists to tell consumers if they could save money on their prescriptions. The Trump Administration has also moved forward with an initiative to improve price transparency in an effort to lower costs, though it is held up in the courts. President Trump has made other policy changes that have had a direct impact on reproductive rights, immigration, and on other health care issues that convey his priorities for the future.\nThis issue brief provides a detailed overview of the Trump Administration\u2019s record on health care issues, including major proposals and actions on health care during his tenure in office relating to: the Administration\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACA and private insurance markets, Medicaid, Medicare, reducing prescription drug and other health care costs, sexual and reproductive health, mental health and substance use, immigration and health, long-term care, HIV/AIDS policy, and LGBTQ health. A separate resource compares President Trump\u2019s record and proposals to those of former Vice President Biden.\n\n\nIssue Brief\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAffordable Care Act\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nMedicaid\nMedicare\nRacial Equity and Health Policy\nPrivate Insurance\nWomen's Health Policy\nHealth Costs\nGlobal Health Policy\nUninsured\n\n\n\nTags\n\nElections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnews release\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSep 2020\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom the Federal Response to COVID-19 to Ongoing Efforts to Repeal the ACA and Proposals for Lowering Drug Prices, President Trump Has an Extensive Record on Health Care\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso of Interest\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHealth Care and the 2020 Presidential Election\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComparing Trump and Biden on COVID-19\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19, Mental Health, and the 2020 Election: A Review of Candidate Platforms\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElection 2020 Resource Page\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tGet The Latest On Health Policy\t\t\n\n\t\t\tSign Up For Email Alerts\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tYour Email Address\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tSign Up\t\n\n\nTopics\n\nAffordable Care Act\nCOVID-19\nGlobal Health Policy\nHealth Costs\nHIV/AIDS\nMedicaid\nMedicare\nMental Health\nPatient and Consumer Protections\nPrivate Insurance\nRacial Equity and Health Policy\nUninsured\nWomen\u2019s Health Policy\n\n\nSections\n\nPolling\nState Health Facts\nGraphics & Interactives\nCharts & Slides\nKFF Health News\nSocial Impact Media\nPeterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\n\nNewsroom\n\nNews Releases\nEvents\nSubscribe to Emails\nCite Us/Reprint\nMedia Contacts\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nFrom Drew Altman\nOur People\nOur Programs\nKFF Board\nContact Us\nSupport Our Work\nJoin Our Team\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nFollow Us\n\nEmail Alerts\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nThreads\nX\nRSS Feeds\nYouTube\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 KFF\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPowered by WordPress VIP \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCitations and Reprints\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKFF Headquarters: 185 Berry St., Suite 2000, San Francisco, CA 94107 | Phone 650-854-9400\t\t\n\t\tWashington Offices and Barbara Jordan Conference Center: 1330 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005 | Phone 202-347-5270\t\nwww.kff.org | Email Alerts: kff.org/email | facebook.com/KFF | twitter.com/kff\n\nThe independent source for health policy research, polling, and news, KFF is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
