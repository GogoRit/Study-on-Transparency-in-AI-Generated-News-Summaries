pregnancy loss, she\u2019s raising her voice.  \n    \n\n            A conservative Christian and former Ms. South Carolina, Jill was a Republican until last summer, when in the wake of new abortion restrictions in her state, she endured the \u201cexcruciating\u201d experience of terminating a pregnancy with a baby who had a severe heart defect.  \n    \n\n            Because of South Carolina\u2019s abortion laws, Jill and her husband, Matt, had to spend weeks waiting for availability at a clinic out of state, fly there, endure wrenching time away from their family and support system, fly home the day after a painful three-day medical procedure, arrange for their daughter\u2019s remains to be shipped back to them and find thousands of dollars to pay for it, \u201call while grieving the loss of your child,\u201d Jill said. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShot of an unrecognizable pregnant woman sitting on a bed and holding her belly in her bedroom at

Hartles, who say they\u2019ve always supported abortion rights, have now formed the Ivy Grace Project, named after their daughter who died, to educate the public and policy makers about fetal anomalies, which are often detected four or five months into a pregnancy \u2013 too late in states like South Carolina to terminate a pregnancy.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for the government to tell you what you should or should not do,\u201d Jill said.  \n    \n\n            The Ivy Grace Project is just a few months old, but Jill says already it has had an impact.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI got messages this fall \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ve never voted blue in my life, but I decided to vote blue because of your, Matt and Ivy\u2019s story,\u2019 \u201d Jill said. \u201cThere are so many of their constituents who do not want (a six-week abortion ban), and I need the Republican party to understand that, because I do think it will ultimately alienate some of their conservative (constituents) and then they in fact will then vote across party lines.\u201d  \n    \n\n            CNN reached out to sponsors of South Carolina legislation that restricts abortion rights.  \n    \n\n            The primary sponsor of a Senate bill, Sen. Larry Grooms, said, \u201cI regret to hear about the (Hartle) family and of their baby with a heart defect. However, I remain committed to protecting the lives of children from those who would choose to end those lives.\u201d  \n    \n\n    A gift of \u2018Dad shoes\u2019  \n\n\n            As the Hartles told their story to CNN, Matt\u2019s hand rested on his wife\u2019s knee, comforting her as she remembered the emotional details.  \n    \n\n            Jill, 35, grew up in the town of Moncks Corner, South Carolina, going on retreats with her Christian youth group and attending sleepaway summer Bible camp with her twin sister.  \n    \n\n            In 2012, at a mutual friend\u2019s wedding, Jill met Matt, a college football coach who\u2019d moved back home to Charleston three days before.  \n    \n\n            Matt, 40, a cellarman at a local brewery, says that when he saw Jill walk into the reception, he turned to his mother and said, \u201d \u2018There she is! That\u2019s the one!\u2019 \u201d  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJill and Matt married in 2021 and about a year later, Jill became pregnant.\n\nIvy Grace Project\n\n\n\n            Matt proposed on the edge of the Grand Canyon in 2019, and the couple married in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, in April 2021.  \n    \n\n            A year later, excited that she might be pregnant, Jill swung by a CVS near the hair salon she owns in Charleston to get a test. At work at the salon, she was thrilled to see the positive result.  \n    \n\n            Her twin, Brett Brock, was nearby, and together the sisters devised a plan to tell Matt. After she finished work, she went shopping for \u201cDad shoes,\u201d and presented the white sneakers to Matt, with the positive pregnancy test on top.   \n    \n\n            \u201cAs soon as I opened that shoebox with the white shoes and the pregnancy test, I felt different,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI immediately felt like a Dad and a father - my whole role now is to protect my family.\u201d  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJill told Matt she was pregnant with a gift of \"Dad shoes.\" \n\nIvy Grace Project\n\n\n\n    Healing in heaven  \n\n\n            Matt would need to take on that role sooner than he thought. \n    \n\n            At a routine ultrasound on July 27, when Jill was 18 weeks pregnant, their obstetrician came in the room and said, \u201d \u2018her heart isn\u2019t what we want it to look like,\u2019 \u201d Jill remembers.\n    \n\n            The diagnosis was a severe form of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a condition where the left side of the heart has multiple malformations and can\u2019t pump blood properly. An ultrasound a month later, when the baby was larger and the heart could be seen more clearly, confirmed the severity of the diagnosis.  \n    \n\n            The Hartles say the doctors offered them two options.  \n    \n\n            One, Jill could carry Ivy to term. Their care team explained she might be stillborn, and if she was born alive, she would be given medicine for the pain caused by her failing heart, and could live for a few days at the most.   \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTravel time to abortion facilities grew significantly after Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\n\n\n\n\n            The second option was that Ivy could have an open-heart surgery in her first week of life, but Jill says her doctors warned that she likely wouldn\u2019t survive it. Babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who do survive the first surgery then have another open-heart procedure at around 6 months old, and a third before age 4. These surgeries are not a cure, and even after the three procedures, these children may need a heart transplant, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n    \n\n            In states with less restrictive abortion laws, doctors can offer a third option: terminate the pregnancy.  \n    \n\n            Pediatric heart doctors say patients often choose that option. Dr. Joseph Forbess, surgical director of the Children\u2019s Health Program at the University of Maryland Medical System, said in his program, most parents opt to terminate when the fetus has hypoplastic left heart syndrome.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019re basically talking about a child who\u2019s going to have, at best, a chronic medical condition that limits their cardiac output,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to need a lot of high-level medical care their entire life.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Heather Woolwine, a spokesperson for the Medical University of South Carolina, where Jill got her care, said that \u201cthe mortality rate associated with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome is high in the first year of life and severe complications plague most survivors.\u201d  \n    \n\n            The Hartles prayed for guidance.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI grew up in a very Christian conservative household,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI\u2019m a very faithful woman. I live my life with faith.\u201d  \n    \n\n            They researched hypoplastic left heart syndrome, talked to another family who\u2019d been in their situation and asked questions of their care team at the Medical University of South Carolina.  \n    \n\n            \u201cOur goal is to provide all the information families need to make their decision,\u201d said Paige Babb, the prenatal genetic counselor who worked with the Hartles. \u201cJill and Matt were so thoughtful with everything.\u201d  \n    \n\n            After prayer, research and discussion, Jill said her \u201cmother intuition\u201d told her that \u201cthe best thing for her was to give [Ivy] the peace of not having pain and suffering.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cThe best option to protect our daughter from pain and suffering was to send her to heaven,\u201d Jill said. \u201cWhen I prayed for healing \u2013 sometimes that healing does not happen on this earth.  Sometimes the way they get healed is to be free in heaven.\u201d   \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Jill was 18 weeks pregnant, a routine scan showed their baby's heart had multiple malformations.\n\nIvy Grace Project\n\n\n\n    South Carolina\u2019s changing abortion laws  \n\n\n            But the Hartles\u2019 doctors would not terminate the pregnancy.  \n    \n\n            Both the couple and their doctors were caught in the middle of South Carolina\u2019s changing abortion laws last summer.  \n    \n\n            On July 27, when Ivy\u2019s heart defect was first diagnosed, South Carolina law effectively banned abortion after about six weeks, and Jill was way beyond that timeframe.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhy a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas\n\n\n\n\n            Then on August 17, the state\u2019s Supreme Court temporarily blocked the six-week ban and the law reverted to abortion being \u201cprohibited when probable post-fertilization of unborn child is twenty or more weeks.\u201d \n    \n\n            The Hartles weren\u2019t due for their next ultrasound for another six days, but Jill was fast approaching the window in which abortion would be illegal under the 20-week law. She says she called her doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina to ask if she could come in earlier for the second ultrasound, knowing that she and Matt would want to terminate the pregnancy if the severity of Ivy\u2019s hypoplastic left heart syndrome diagnosis was confirmed.  \n    \n\n            But the doctors told her again that they would not terminate the pregnancy. \n    \n\n            Woolwine, the MUSC spokesperson, said this was \u201cstill a very volatile legal time\u201d since the South Carolina Senate was \u201cactively pursuing new legislation.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cBy the time the two day procedure could be scheduled, (Jill) was also at the end of the gestational window on the (20-week) law, and given the legal volatility, no one wanted her to be halfway through and the law could then change midstream,\u201d Woolwine wrote in an email to CNN.  \n    \n\n            Jill says she asked if there might be an exception in Ivy\u2019s case considering that South Carolina law allows for abortion if the fetus has an anomaly that \u201cwith or without the provision of life-preserving treatment, would be incompatible with sustaining life after birth.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Again, she was told no.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new medical terms glossary is part of a broader, ongoing effort to make conception and pregnancy language more humane. \n\nShutterstock/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\n36% of US counties are 'maternity care deserts,' raising risks for women and babies, new report finds\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cThe diagnosed fetal anomaly did not clearly meet a permitted exemption under the law,\u201d Woolwine wrote.  \n    \n\n            CNN reached out to 16 South Carolina state legislators who sponsored abortion restrictions to get their response to the Hartles\u2019 story, and three responded.  \n    \n\n            Grooms, the primary sponsor of the Senate six-week abortion ban expressed his commitment to \u201cprotecting the lives of children.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Sen. Katrina Frye Shealy, a co-sponsor of that bill, said there should be exceptions for \u201cfatal fetal anomaly.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Sen. Brian Adams, another co-sponsor of that legislation, said he supports bills \u201cwhich will allow those parents to make that tough decision when they have received a sad prognosis from the doctors about the pregnancy and their child has a fetal anomaly.\u201d Adams did not respond to a CNN email asking him to be more specific about how he defined \u201cfetal anomaly.\u201d  \n    \n\n            US Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who introduced a bill in September that would ban abortions after 15 weeks, did not respond to emails from CNN asking him for comment.  \n    \n\n            Jill and Matt say given the penalties health care providers can face for violating South Carolina law \u2013 heavy fines and prison time - they don\u2019t blame the doctors for refusing to terminate the pregnancy, or for declining to help them find a doctor who would.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe were on our own to figure it out medically from that point on,\u201d Matt said.  \n    \n\n    A broken heart  \n\n\n            Because of restrictive abortion laws in states like South Carolina, there\u2019s a backlog at clinics in nearby states that do allow abortion. That meant the Hartles had a lot of work in front of them.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt was logistically a nightmare, trying to make this happen and figure out how to set this up,\u201d Matt remembers.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOULDER, CO - JANUARY 31, 2022: Dr Warren Hern organizes his tools inside his  clinic on January 31, 2022 in Boulder, Colorado.

How are you guys doing?\u2019\u201d Matt remembers.  \n    \n\n            Jill said it was particularly \u201ctorturous\u201d at her hair salon, where Matt says she is \u201cvery close to her clients, and they\u2019re invested in her life.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cEvery two hours I have a new person coming into my salon thinking everything is great, asking me how I\u2019m doing, am I excited, do I have a day care picked out,\u201d Jill remembers.  \n    \n\n            While the Hartles were enduring this \u201cexcruciating\u201d pain, they also had to figure out a way to pay for everything. They said their insurance doesn\u2019t cover out-of-state care, and the procedure cost $7,800. Add in airline tickets, hotel, other travel expenses, and the cost of bringing Ivy\u2019s remains back to South Carolina and they said the total cost was nearly $15,000 \u2013 money they would not have had to have paid if they\u2019d been able to get the procedure in South Carolina. \n    \n\n            The couple, who had just bought a house, worried about the expenses. Only at the very last minute, just a few days before their trip to Washington, did they find out that several foundations were pitching in to pay for nearly all of the expenses.  \n    \n\n            The Hartles traveled to Washington on September 11, nearly three weeks after they\u2019d made the decision to terminate the pregnancy. It was a three-day procedure to induce and deliver Ivy and afterward, her parents held her tiny body in a blanket with her name embroidered in green thread.   \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a three-day procedure to induce and deliver Ivy in Washington, DC.\n\ncourtesy Jill Hartle\n\n\n\n    \u2018I was unable to protect my family\u2019  \n\n\n            All of this took a terrible physical toll on Jill.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI don\u2019t remember coming home because I was in so much physical pain from giving birth, and I could have avoided all of that by just being at home,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s all of those things that people aren\u2019t thinking about \u2013 of women being on airplanes, having excruciating pain from giving birth, then having to get home.\u201d  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTexas woman almost dies because she couldn't get an abortion  \n\n\n\n\n            It took a terrible psychological toll, too.

So far, they\u2019ve created a short documentary about their experience, reached out to lawmakers, and spoken to the media in an effort to educate about fetal anomalies.  \n    \n\n            They say they want people to know that often families aren\u2019t aware of a severe birth defect until halfway through a pregnancy, and that\u2019s why the decision to terminate isn\u2019t made until that point.  \n    \n\n            \u201cA lot of us have to wait that long to understand exactly what\u2019s going on to make the best decision for our child,\u201d Jill said.  \n    \n\n            They also want lawmakers in conservative areas to know that many Christians, like them, are opposed to strict abortion bans.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIf you come from a place of non-judgment and compassion and you show God\u2019s grace by loving another human no matter the decisions that they make, then that\u2019s true Christianity in my opinion,\u201d Jill said.  \n    \n\n            Stories from families like the Hartles are valuable tools in the fight for abortion rights in states like South Carolina, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster and political strategist.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt is literally the most persuasive scenario that we have in the tough cases,\u201d Lake said.  \n    \n\n            Molly Rivera, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, added that \u201cpeople like Jill and other folks telling stories publicly can be so powerful.\u201d \n    \n\n            The Hartles are working with Planned Parenthood to figure out their next steps for the Ivy Grace Project.  \n    \n\n            In the meantime, they\u2019re dreading the holidays.  \n    \n\n            \u201cThe 25th is Christmas, Jill\u2019s birthday is the 26th, and the due date was the 27th,\u201d Matt said.  \n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN

    \u201cAll I want to do is sleep and wake up, and it be January,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n            But after January, she has a plan.  \n    \n\n            \u201cMy goal is to try to get in front of the state House this January when they reopen their session to explain my story,\u201d she said. \n    \n\n            She said her inspiration will come from the women who\u2019ve reached out to thank her and Matt for telling their story.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIf I can help a woman not feel alienated or feel alone, then that gives me courage to keep going forward,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
