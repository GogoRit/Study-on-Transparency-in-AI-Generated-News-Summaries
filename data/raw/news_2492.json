Bevelyn Beatty and Edmee Chavannes were reportedly approached by police and handcuffed for \u2018violating de Blasio\u2019s social distancing guidelines.\u2019 In other words, they were handcuffed for standing too close together\u2026 in the midst of a mob of protesters who obviously did not care to riot six feet apart.\nOh, but the police didn\u2019t just show up by happenstance. Planned Parenthood called the cops on these two Black women.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have not been so harassed by the police until I started doing this!\u201d\n\u201cThis is a clear statement of their bias now. It\u2019s blatant now,\u201d Beatty told Fox News, noting the crowded Floyd protests. \u201cIt\u2019s really truly biased against Christians, against pro-life abolitionists.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re black women but we do not support Black Lives Matter because they\u2019re hand-in-hand with Planned Parenthood that kills African-American babies,\u201d Beatty told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re fraudulent\u00a0hypocrites\u2026 and I believe all lives matter because God created them. There are thousands of George Floyds that die every day in their mother\u2019s womb and it\u2019s just as injust as when he died at the hands of that police officer.\u201d\n\u201cArrest the abortionists,\u00a0they\u2019re in the building,\u201d Chavannes said. \u201cChurches are closed in New York City but this place is open?\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood is all about posting anti-police content, Black Lives Matter posts, and all kinds of slogans about systemic racism and injustice \u2013 but when it comes to pro-lifers outside their abortion facilities, Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t care what color they are. They\u2019re fine with the police all of a sudden\u2026 as long as the pro-lifers are silenced. A huge THANK YOU to these brave women.\n\n Post Views: 2,399\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
