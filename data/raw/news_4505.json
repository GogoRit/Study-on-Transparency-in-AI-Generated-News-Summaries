Whether it\u2019s ensuring girls have access to school and aren\u2019t forced to marry, preventing domestic violence or getting women into work,\u00a0they\u2019re determined to build a better world where all women have the chance to thrive.Jackie LetaruI\u2019m a feminist, a strong one.As a teacher, Jackie challenges sexism in her classroom. She cultivates a culture where girls know their value and are respected.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRCTwenty-nine-year-old Jackie lives just around the corner from the school where she teaches in Yumbe district, northern Uganda.\u00a0\u201cOne of my responsibilities at the school is being a leader to girls,\u201d she explains, while her children, Jovan, age three, and Jedidah, age seven, play quietly next to her. \u201cIt is so important for both boys and girls to have education. Education is a key to their success.\u201dJackie lives with her children around the corner from the school where she works and is \u201ca leader to girls.\u201dPhoto: EstherMbabazi/IRCJackie has been fighting for girls\u2019 rights in the classroom her entire life. \u201cWhen I was first told I was an activist, I was surprised, then I was really happy that I was doing something someone is recognising.\u201d\u00a0Two years ago, she joined Logoa Women, a Ugandan women\u2019s activism group, to take her campaigning to the next level. The IRC is partnering with Logoa and other activist groups in Uganda to work towards their goals on gender equality.\u00a0We deliver training on topics like sexual harassment and how women can report abuse, while\u00a0providing direct support to women and girls affected by violence.\u00a0Jackie performs plays in the community that help to raise awareness about the issues facing women and girls.Jackie watches the girls play netball after school in Yumbe district, Uganda.Photo: Credit: EstherMbabazi/IRC\u201cI'm a feminist because I feel like everyone deserves their rights. I started by loving myself, I should understand myself, I should like myself,\u201d she reflects.I'm a feminist because I feel like everyone deserves their rights. I started by loving myself, I should understand myself, I should like myself,\" says Jackie.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRC\u201cWe, as human beings, are just like money: When we scramble it and throw it down, it still has value. When you pick it up and stretch it out, you can still take it to the market and buy something. So a human is just like that, if any obstacle comes and squeezes you, you still have that value in you somewhere, somehow.\u201dGrace MuuduruWe can all stand together and do something where the world can recognize that women also exist.Grace Muuduru works for COSMESS, a women\u2019s rights group in northern Uganda, where she helps both refugee and Ugandan women.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRCTwenty-seven-year-old Grace has been standing up for women since she was at school. She remembers confronting boys bullying her friend and telling them: \u2018One day this girl could be President!\u2019Today, she works for COSMESS, a women\u2019s rights group in northern Uganda that helps both refugees and Ugandan women. Uganda currently hosts over 800,000 South Sudanese refugees who have escaped a brutal conflict that\u2019s been waging since 2013.\u00a0The group offers training to enable women to enter professions like carpentry and auto-mechanics.Grace works with refugees like 19-year-old Vivian to help them start their own businesses. Vivian opened her own shop selling crafts and shoes.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRC\u201cAt high school, they say that instead of doing sciences, ladies do arts. People feel that women are not capable of some things. So we always say, we\u2019re equal, girls can do the same as men can. If they\u2019re given the opportunity, women are really the best.\u201d\u00a0COSMESS also runs awareness-raising sessions about sexual harassment. \u201cIt\u2019s a really common thing in our communities,\u201d Grace explains.\u00a0 \u201cAnd you find these women, at times, they don't know that they're being sexually harassed. We tell them the forms of sexual harassment and we have some people in the communities where they can report if something happened to them.\u201dGrace writes her message to the world in the COSMESS office. She\u2019s committed to ensuring that women can live free from sexual harassment and abuse.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRCHer work has not come without criticism. \u201cPeople oppose us a lot. Somebody may come and say \u2018who are you? These are things we started [a] long time [ago]. Do you think you can change the culture?' At times you feel down, but you say no, you have to really stand [up] for your rights.Grace, and her colleague Fatuma Jamila, have been supported by the IRC\u2019s Listen Up program, which aims to amplify the voices of women and girls.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRC\u201cI became an activist because women are really violated. People don\u2019t get to hear their voices. I felt that I should really support them if I can, stand up for them\u2014we can stand all together and do something where the world can recognise that women also exist.\u201dFoni GraceIn years to come, I want women also to be leaders. Women should be given that right to lead. What men can do, women can do too.\u201cIn years to come, I want women also to be leaders. Women should be given that right to lead. What men can do, women can do too.\u201dPhoto: EstherMbabazi/IRCThirty-year-old Foni Grace fled war in South Sudan and came to Uganda in 2016, taking her two daughters with her to live in Bidi Bidi, the second-largest refugee camp in the world. \u201cIn South Sudan, children cannot access school, there\u2019s no proper education, children are killed, women are also killed.\u201dFoni Grace\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Nancy, stands outside their home in Bidi Bidi, the second-largest refugee camp in the world.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRCToday, she\u2019s part of Togoleta, a refugee women\u2019s activist group that provides counselling to refugees in the camp to prevent violence and help women and girls recover from abuse. Evidence shows that when crisis and instability strikes, violence against women and girls spikes, so it is vital that activities to prevent violence and support surviors are provided in settings like Bidi Bidi.Foni Grace is part of Togoleta, a refugee women\u2019s activism group that work together to provide counselling to women affected by violence in the camp.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRC\u201cUgandans and refugees are working together. When we share those ideas, you see the problems women are facing in the refugee camp and the problems women are facing in the host community, they\u2019re all related\u2014so we have to come together and advise each other.\u201d\u201cMy work for women will be permanent, even if I\u2019m in South Sudan, even when I go back, I feel I have to continue with my work in activism. In years to come, I want women also to be leaders. Women should be given that right to lead. What [a] man can do, a woman can do too.\u201dJemimah Sadia \u00a0We call women together to get out of their situations, so they leave their problems behind.Fifty-four-year-old Jemimah, who is also from South Sudan, is the founder of Togoleta. Building up her grass-roots women\u2019s movement in Bidi Bidi has been a huge part of her life since she found safety in Uganda.\u201cWe will go there with a heart of love,\u201d Jemimah says before she begins a counselling session. Foni Grace and her other fellow activists nod in agreement. \u201cWe have to sit with [the women] and hear from them what they want to say, then we shall tell them how they can continue to stay strong.\u201dJemimah and the other Togoleta members sit and counsel Cecilia, a fellow refugee woman in the camp who was facing difficulty. \u201cWe make women strong.\u201d Jemimah says.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRC\u201cThe IRC has trained us to take care of girls forced to marry, especially those who get pregnant. After giving birth, they have to go back to school. We have to take care of these girls.\u201dIn addition to being a full-time activist, Jemimah has her own busines selling cakes to the community in the camp.Photo: EstherMbabazi/IRCAmong many other accomplishments, Togoleta has supported a woman who was suicidal and saved her life. \u201cTogoleta makes women strong: We call women together to get [them] out of their situations, so they leave their problems behind,\u201d Jemimah explains.Video  Women's rights activists in Uganda demand change\nListen UpThe activists who shared their stories are part of the IRC\u2019s Listen Up program, which aims to amplify the voices and power of refugee women and girls. The program\u00a0is grounded in the understanding that women and girls are forceful agents of change who can improve the entire humanitarian system and catalyze institutional reform\u2014if we listen to them.The Listen Up team in Uganda works with activist groups in Bidi Bidi and Yumbe, providing training, funding and support so they can better advocate for the prevention of sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse. The team consults with refugees and the host community to strengthen reporting of cases of violence.Listen Up is funded by the Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and is a Gift of the United States Government.\n\n\n\nExplore related topics:Women and girls\n\n\nCrisis WatchWho We AreWhere We WorkWhat We DoHow To HelpLatestCareersContact UsDonor HelpCode of ConductEthics HotlineOur efficiency87% Program services8% Management and general5% FundraisingDonateJoin our mailing list\n    Get the latest news about the IRC's innovative programs, compelling stories about our clients and how you can make a difference.\n     \n\n  \n  \n          \n        \n                  \n \n    \nSubscribeFollow UsRescue Websites:U.S./GlobalUKGermanySwedenEUKoreaPhone Opt OutRespecting Your PrivacyTerms and ConditionsFraud PreventionInternational Rescue Committee is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.
