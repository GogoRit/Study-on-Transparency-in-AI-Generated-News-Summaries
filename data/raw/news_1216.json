(KOKH) \u2014 The most restrictive abortion ban in the state is expected to pass through the legislature this week.The bill would make abortions illegal from conception, and allows Oklahomans to sue abortion providers.There\u2019s already been a few abortion bans signed into law this session, but lawmakers against the bill said this could be the most extreme ban.While the current law bans abortion after six weeks, this would prevent abortions from the moment an egg is fertilized.\u201cIt outlaws all abortions at any time, and also provides the so called bounty-hunter provision, which allows anyone and everyone to take these matters into their own hands and enforce this law,\u201d Democratic Minority Leader, Rep. Emily Virgin said.RELATED | Gov. Stitt says women have other options besides abortionWhile Democrats against the bill think this will encourage vigilante lawsuits, Rep. Wendi Stearman, the sponsor of the bill, said that shouldn\u2019t be a concern.\u201cThere should be no bounty hunting because we have laws on the books already for stalking and spying,\u201d Rep. Stearman, (R)- Collinsville said. \u201cSo that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201dThe language specifically allows for contraceptives and Plan B, or the morning after pill.What it doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mention though is in vitro fertilization.By preventing abortions from the time of fertilization, Rep. Emily Virgin said this could impact women hoping to start a family with IVF.RELATED | Governor 'optimistic' on Project Ocean and his attempts to land big company\u201cLooking at the language, it\u2019s hard to see how it wouldn\u2019t affect in vitro fertilization because it talks about as soon as the ovum and the sperm meet, and the egg is fertilized, that that means that\u2019s a person,\u201d Rep. Virgin said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with in vitro fertilization, you create embryos.\u201dRep. Stearman said that is not addressed or included in the bill.\u201cThis would be in the case of proving that an abortion has occurred,\u201d Rep. Stearman said. \u201cAnd that would be tough to do in that situation.\u201dSources inside the Capitol said the bill will be heard Thursday.If it passes, it will head to the Governor\u2019s desk.There\u2019s an emergency clause on the bill, so it will go into affect with the Governor\u2019s signature.For more local news delivered straight to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter by clicking here.
