The law would prohibit nearly all abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected and was set to take effect on Jan. 1 until a federal court blocked it. It\u2019s currently under appeal.

Tim Miller, R-Prinsburg, sponsored the bill, which bans abortions once a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d can be detected, although doctors say there is no cardiovascular system or heartbeat that early in a pregnancy and what is being heard is electrical activity. \nThe bill contains language similar to a Texas law that allows people to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d such abortions, rather than having government officials enforce the law. The Minnesota bill would not allow civil actions to be brought by a person who impregnated another person through rape, sexual assault or incest.\nThat has made it difficult for abortion providers to bring legal challenges, although one is pending in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\u200b\u200bMiller has introduced legislation since 2018 that would make abortions after a heartbeat is detected a gross midemeanor. This time, he modeled the bill after the Texas law that has gone into effect, while legal challenges work through the court system.\nWhile Miller knows the bill won\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House, much less be signed by the governor, he wants lawmakers to discuss the issue as Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance.\n\u201cThe point of me presenting this bill is we need to have a conversation of what that fetus is when a heartbeat is present,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that conversation\u2026 I am on the side of defending life and so I\u2019m going to engage in the conversation.\u201d\nHe noted that a Ramsey County lawsuit seeks to eliminate abortion restrictions in Minnesota.\u00a0\nSen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Burnsville, tweeted that it took \u201cexactly one day\u201d for Republicans to introduce an abortion ban, saying, \u201cMake no mistake, reproductive care is under attack in (Minnesota), and the time is now to stand up and fight.\u201d\u00a0\nRep. Tina Liebling, DFL-Rochester, chair of the House Health Finance & Policy Committee, released a statement calling the bill a \u201cTexas-style radical anti-abortion bill\u201d that comes as the U.S. Supreme Court \u201cseems poised to throw out 50 years of settled law that allows the person who is pregnant \u2013 not politicians \u2013 to decide whether to have an abortion.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a warning to Minnesotans of what will happen if Republicans get control of the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office,\u201d Liebling said. \u201cThey will go to extremes to stop pregnant Minnesotans from accessing the full range of pregnancy care, including the right to a safe, convenient abortion.
