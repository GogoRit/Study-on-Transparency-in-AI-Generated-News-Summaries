He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n      \n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago, anti-abortion activists appeared eager to prohibit anyone seeking an abortion in a state where it is banned from traveling to another state where it is legal. Indeed, many lawmakers appeared so eager to enact such travel bans that Justice Brett Kavanaugh, of all people, attempted to cut off these laws before they could be enacted.\n\u201cMay a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion?\u201d Kavanaugh asked in his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization (2022), the decision overruling Roe v. Wade. \u201cIn my view, the answer is no,\u201d Kavanaugh replied to his own question, \u201cbased on the constitutional right to interstate travel.\u201d The Constitution has long been understood to allow US citizens to travel among the states.\nFor the most part, state and local lawmakers have not tested whether Kavanaugh would hold to this view if a travel ban actually became law. But a few jurisdictions in Texas are now breaking with this consensus. As the Washington Post reports, two Texas counties and two Texas cities have passed local ordinances making it illegal to transport someone through one of these counties or cities for the purpose of obtaining an out-of-state abortion.\nNotably, this list of anti-abortion localities includes Mitchell County, Texas, a sparse community of about 9,000 people. This matters because Interstate 20, the route that many people traveling from Dallas to New Mexico to receive an abortion will take, passes through Mitchell County. Several other counties with major highways or airports are also considering similar laws.\nThese ordinances and proposed ordinances largely track model legislation, which anti-abortion activist Mark Lee Dickson shared on Twitter, that is itself modeled after SB 8 \u2014 the statewide anti-abortion law that allows private bounty hunters to sue abortion providers and collect bounties of $10,000 or more.\nIn fairness, Dickson\u2019s model legislation does prohibit such bounty hunter suits from being filed against \u201cthe pregnant woman who seeks to abort her unborn child.\u201d But the legislation would potentially allow abortion funds that help pay for abortion care, or anyone who drives a pregnant patient to an out-of-state abortion clinic, to be sued.\nOrdinarily, Kavanaugh\u2019s preemptive rejection of travel bans would be a clear sign that these laws will not survive judicial review. But, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson (2021), the Supreme Court effectively shut down federal lawsuits challenging unconstitutional laws that are enforced solely by bounty hunters. And Kavanaugh joined the Court\u2019s decision in Jackson.\nThe upshot is that these unconstitutional Texas ordinances may succeed, not because they are lawful but because the Supreme Court has largely immunized them from constitutional review.\nTravel bans are unconstitutional\nCitizens of the United States have a right to travel freely among the states. As the Supreme Court said in Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), \u201cthe nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.\u201d\nIndeed, the Supreme Court held over 150 years ago that states may not impose even fairly insignificant barriers on US citizens who wish to travel outside that state. This issue arose in Crandall v. Nevada (1867), which struck down a Nevada law that imposed a tax of one dollar \u201cupon every person leaving the State by any railroad, stage coach, or other vehicle engaged or employed in the business of transporting passengers for hire.\u201d\nIn striking down this fairly small tax, the Court spoke in sweeping terms about each citizen\u2019s right to travel freely. \u201cWe are all citizens of the United States, and as members of the same community must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States,\u201d the Court declared in Crandall. \nMoreover, the Court also made clear that this rule applies equally to \u201cpersons residing in the State who may wish to get out of it, and upon persons not residing in it who may have occasion to pass through it.\u201d\nAgain, Crandall involved a fairly minor imposition on travelers: a single dollar tax (about $18 in today\u2019s value). If the Constitution does not permit such a small burden to be laid on interstate travelers, it follows that a state or local government may not effectively take someone hostage for months \u2014 potentially for the duration of their pregnancy \u2014 in order to prevent them from leaving the state to obtain an abortion.\nAs the Court explained in Saenz v. Roe (1999), the right to travel has \u201cthree different components\u201d \u2014 the right of citizens to \u201center and to leave another State,\u201d the right to be treated \u201cas a welcome visitor\u201d when visiting another state, and the right to be treated the same way as established residents of a state after moving to that state. Each of these rights flows from a different provision of the Constitution.\nOf those three components, the right to travel out of state to obtain an abortion flows from the right to citizens to \u201center and leave another State,\u201d and the Court indicated in Edwards v. California (1941) that this right is rooted in a doctrine known as the dormant commerce clause. The Constitution gives Congress the power to \u201cregulate commerce ... among the several states,\u201d and the Court has long held that, by vesting authority over multi-state commerce in the national government, the Constitution implicitly prevents states from enacting laws that impose excessive burdens on commerce among the states. \nThat includes laws that burden people\u2019s ability to travel across state lines. As Edwards held, \u201cit is settled beyond question that the transportation of persons is \u2018commerce.\u2019\u201d\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Dickson told the Washington Post that his model ordinance is lawful because it is similar to the federal Mann Act, which makes it illegal to transport \u201cany woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u201d If the Mann Act is constitutional, he argued, so too must a travel ban targeting abortions be constitutional.\nDickson might have a point if Congress enacted a Mann Act-like law that prohibits interstate travel to obtain an abortion. But, again, the Constitution gives Congress, and not state or local governments, exclusive authority over interstate commerce. Neither Texas nor any Texas county may pass a law that targets conduct occurring in New Mexico. Nor may they prevent people in Texas from leaving the state.\nThe fact that travel bans are unconstitutional might not matter to this Supreme Court\nThe Court\u2019s decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson looms over this discussion of travel bans like a plague. Dickson\u2019s model legislation was clearly written with Jackson in mind, as it relies on the sort of private bounty hunters that the Court embraced in Jackson.\nAs a general rule, someone who fears that their rights will be curtailed by an unconstitutional state or local law may obtain a federal court order blocking that law. The Supreme Court held in Ex parte Young (1908) that someone seeking such a court order must sue the specific state official who is tasked with enforcing the unconstitutional law. So, for example, if Texas passed a law ordering the state police to blockade I-20 to prevent anyone from traveling on it to obtain an abortion, a plaintiff who wished to block this law might sue the head of the state\u2019s police force.\nSB 8, the law the Court embraced in Jackson, tried to immunize itself from judicial review by stating that no state official may attempt to enforce it \u2014 only private bounty hunters filing lawsuits could do so. And, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court agreed that this bounty hunter framework immunized the law from federal lawsuits seeking to block it.\nIn fairness, someone who is sued under SB 8 could still allege at their trial that the law is unconstitutional. But SB 8 permits virtually anyone to sue any abortion provider who performs an abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. So anyone accused of violating the law risked being bombarded with so many lawsuits that their legal fees would bankrupt them. \nThat\u2019s why it was so important to block the law before anyone was sued under it, and why the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to immunize SB 8 from federal review was such a harsh blow to abortion rights in Texas.\nMeanwhile, Dickson\u2019s model legislation uses a similar mechanism to evade judicial review. Under that legislation, the ban on traveling through the wrong Texas county to help someone obtain an abortion \u201cshall be enforced exclusively through ... private civil actions.\u201d \nAs a practical matter, it\u2019s unclear if this framework will actually be effective in deterring people from traveling to New Mexico to seek abortions. If a man drives his pregnant girlfriend through Mitchell County on the way to an abortion clinic in New Mexico, how is anyone other than the two of them supposed to know where they are headed?\nBut the law could wind up deterring women in abusive relationships, or other patients whose acquaintances or family members learn that they are seeking an abortion. Indeed, according to the Washington Post, Dickson suggested that \u201ca husband who doesn\u2019t want his wife to get an abortion could threaten to sue the friend who offers to drive her.\u201d\nIf that lawsuit happens, the wife\u2019s friend should prevail \u2014 he can argue at trial that the Mitchell County ordinance violates the constitutional right to travel. But even if this friend does prevail, they will wind up having to hire legal counsel and endure the stress of a lawsuit that never should have been filed in the first place.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
