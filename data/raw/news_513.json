But gender and reproductive rights activists are disappointed that the law still does not recognise abortion as a woman\u2019s choice that can be sought on-demand, as is the practice in 73 countries.These are the key changes that the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, has brought in:The gestation limit for abortions has been raised from the earlier ceiling of 20 weeks to 24 weeks, but only for special categories of pregnant women such as rape or incest survivors. But this termination would need the approval of two registered doctors.All pregnancies up to 20 weeks require one doctor\u2019s approval. The earlier law, the MTP Act 1971, required one doctor\u2019s approval for pregnancies upto 12 weeks and two doctors\u2019 for pregnancies between 12 and 20 weeks. The approval of two doctors is now needed only for the 20-24 timeline reserved for abortion seekers of special categories.Women can now terminate unwanted pregnancies caused by contraceptive failure, regardless of their marital status. Earlier the law specified that only a \u201cmarried woman and her husband\u201d could do this.There is also no upper gestation limit for abortion in case of foetal disability if so decided by a medical board of specialist doctors, which state governments and union territories\u2019 administrations would\u00a0set up.Yet, the law does not grant women complete control over reproductive choices, abortion advocates say.\u201cTo me, the provisions [of MTP Amendment Act 2021] are progressive in a paternalistic, victimhood kind of way,\u201d said Suchitra Dalvie, gynaecologist and coordinator for Asia Safe Abortion Partnership, a pan-Asia network for safe abortion advocacy.Critics of the law also pointed out that it does not take into account the crisis of healthcare caused by the ongoing pandemic. Given this and the chronic shortage of doctors in India, demanding that women seek out the opinion of two practitioners and a medical board for certain kinds of abortions is unfair, they said. Disability advocates have also raised objections that we detail later.Abortion remains stigmatised in India, even within the medical fraternity, as IndiaSpend reported in September 2020. There have been several reports of women being denied abortions on \u201cmoral\u201d grounds by doctors or being asked to bring partners or parents along for the procedure. This is especially the case when the abortion is sought on grounds not related to a woman\u2019s physical health, as specified in the MTP Act, but because it can cause \u201cinjury to her mental health\u201d (also covered by the Act), these reports showed.The law also recognises mental health-related reasons for seeking an abortion that doctors may not support if it violates their personal belief system \u2013 doctors could withhold approval for abortion due to changed psycho-social circumstances that make a pregnancy unwanted, unintended pregnancy, and unwillingness in a young, single woman to have a child.Representational image. Photo credit: ReutersSafe access is criticalIndia\u2019s amended abortion law was passed 50 years after the first law on the subject was brought in, the MTP Act, 1971. The MTP Bill 2020 was passed by the Lok Sabha in March 2020, just before the coronavirus pandemic-led lockdown was announced. A year later, on March 16, it was passed by the upper house of Parliament and got the President\u2019s assent as the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021.The abortion law had been briefly amended in  2002 to allow for the use of the then-new medical abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol.\u201cThere is need for increasing access of women to legal and safe abortion services in order to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity caused by unsafe abortions,\u201d said health minister Harsh Vardhan during the Rajya Sabha debate on March 16.Unsafe abortions are among the most common causes of maternal deaths in India. In 2015, 1.56 crore abortions were accessed annually in India, according to a study in The Lancet. Of these, 78% or 1.23 crore were conducted outside health facilities.More than half or  56% abortions in India are unsafe and 10 Indian women die daily due to unsafe abortion, as per a 2015 report by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare that cites data from research done between 2001 and 2004.Abortion is said to be safe if it is done with a  method recommended by the World Health Organization that is appropriate to the duration of the pregnancy and the training received by the person providing or supporting the abortion. The WHO classifies abortions as safe, less safe, and least safe. The latter two being unsafe.Only 20% of abortions take place in public sector facilities and 52% in private, as per the National Family Health Survey, 2015-\u201916. Further, NFHS 2015-16 showed that \u201conly  53% of abortions were performed by registered medical doctors\u201d. Amee Yajnik, Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha said, \u201cThe rest were done by midwives, auxiliary nurses or dais [traditional birth attendants] as we call them in the villages.\u201d Also, specialists required for the medical boards that are supposed to sanction post-24 week abortions \u2013 gynaecologist, paediatrician, radiologist or sonologist \u2013 are in short supply, she added.Rural India, where 66% of the country\u2019s population resides, reports a 70% shortfall in the number of obstetrician-gynaecologists, according to the 2019-\u201920 Rural Health Statistics Report of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.To deal with the problem of access to healthcare in the pandemic, abortion advocates had sought enhanced self-management of medical abortion through medical abortion pills, perhaps with remote supervision. Even before the pandemic, they had demanded better provision of abortion self-management in the first trimester and that the opinion of only one MTP provider be required instead of two for terminations between 20 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. Other demands included training of more mid-level healthcare staff to provide abortions.Not progressive enough\u201cWith the passage of time and advancement of medical technology for safe abortion, there is scope for increasing the upper gestational limit for terminating pregnancies\u2026,\u201d Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had said in Rajya Sabha.But abortion advocates are disappointed that the amended law still does not give women the right to get an abortion on demand, as we said. \u201cIf they are willing to look at medical technology advancement, they could have also considered [the fact] that women\u2019s agency has changed so much,\u201d said Jasmine George, lawyer and founder of  Hidden Pockets Collective, a young people\u2019s charity that works on the rights-based framework for abortion and adolescent sexuality.As we said, 73 countries make abortion available at the pregnant person\u2019s request, including India\u2019s neighbour Nepal and other Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Of these, 25 countries also require parental or spousal authorisation or notification.\u201cA pregnant woman [in India] cannot go to a certified provider and say that I want you to terminate this pregnancy because that is what I want,\u201d said Anubha Rastogi, a Mumbai lawyer who authored a report on the judiciary\u2019s role in helping women access safe abortions for Pratigya Campaign, a network working for gender equality and safe abortion access. \u201cIf the doctor says no, then that is that.\u201dRastogi points out that Section  312 of the Indian Penal Code that labels \u201ccausing miscarriage\u201d as an offence has not been scrapped yet. The MTP Act is seen as an exception to IPC; that is, abortion is available only under the conditions specified in it.The amended law comes against the backdrop of scores of women approaching the Supreme Court and high courts across the country to secure permission for abortion post 20 weeks upon the discovery of a foetal anomaly, late detection of a pregnancy caused by sexual assault, or changed psycho-social circumstances.Representational image. Photo credit: ReutersMaternal mortalityWithin the women\u2019s rights framework, India\u2019s MTP law falls in the category of laws that allow abortion on \u201cbroad social or economic grounds\u201d, next to the best option of \u201con request\u201d, according to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, a global human rights organisation.Restrictive abortion laws are associated with higher levels of maternal mortality: The average maternal mortality ratio is three times higher in countries with more restrictive abortion laws (223 maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births) compared to countries with less restrictive laws (77 maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births), according to the WHO.Global examples show that easier access to abortion encourages women to seek pregnancy termination in the earlier weeks of gestation, resulting in better-managed abortions. Sweden, for example, has one of the most liberal abortion laws \u2013 it makes MTP available on request up to 18 weeks. Most abortions there are conducted around the 12-week-gestation mark usually through the two-pill combination method that is preferred in first-trimester abortions and whose effect mimics a natural miscarriage.In 1988, Canada became the first country to decriminalise abortion and it has reported a fall in the gestational age at abortion without a rise in the abortion rate. By making abortion a state-funded procedure and allowing telemedicine facility for medical termination through pills, it has managed greater abortion equity across socio-economic and geographical backgrounds.Appeals during lockdownEven during pandemic-induced lockdowns, in four months to August 2020, 112 cases of abortion appeals were heard across 14 high courts in India, according to the report authored by Rastogi for Pratigya. To place this in perspective, over 15 months to August 2020 (including the four months of the lockdown when 112 cases were heard), she found 243 such cases before the high courts \u2013 substantially more in a shorter period than the 175 cases in the 35-month span from June 2016 to April 2019. This indicated a  higher proportion of abortion appeals in courts during the lockdown.\u201cEven within the four months of the lockdown when only urgent matters were getting listed, this was happening,\u201d said Rastogi. The Union government had listed abortion as an essential service three weeks into the lockdown in April 2020 after several reports emerged of women struggling to access reproductive health services.Due to restricted access to contraceptives during the lockdown, at least 1.18 million abortions from unintended pregnancies were predicted by the Foundation for Reproductive Health Services, India. In the first three months of the pandemic, 18.5 lakh women in India could not access abortion services, according to the non-profit IPAS Development Foundation. Several hospitals reported a  higher number of abortions compared to previous years, even as out-patient facilities remained suspended for several months to provide Covid-only services.The increase in abortion seekers accompanied an increase in women sustaining domestic violence during lockdowns.George, whose Hidden Pockets Collective supported women struggling to access reproductive healthcare during pandemic lockdowns, spoke of the problems faced by a 21-year-old, unmarried law college student in Kochi who was nearly five weeks pregnant in March 2020. \u201cShe went to four private hospitals because government hospitals anyway do not provide easy abortion access,\u201d said George. \u201cBut here too they refused to give her medical abortion pills until her parents came in.\u201d Even the older MTP Act \u2013 that was in place when the pandemic struck \u2013 had no requirement for an adult woman to bring anyone along for consent.The hospitals also sought her identity documents for consultation, though it is not required unless one is seeking an ultrasound, said George.\u201cFinally, the fifth hospital provided her medical abortion for Rs 21,000,\u201d said George (a two-pill medical abortion kit is not supposed to cost over  Rs 390). The woman was staying with her parents and was experiencing adverse symptoms of pregnancy. She had to not only hide these symptoms from her parents but also find a way to venture out with her friends or partner \u2013 who had organised the funds \u2013 in search of a hospital. \u201cIt was surprising even during lockdown they (healthcare providers) were playing with a woman\u2019s health,\u201d George said.The pandemic magnified the existing barriers that resource-poor women have been facing, said gynaecologist Dalvie: \u201cThere is no stock of drugs, the doctor is not available, no bus and so on.\u201dDemands for further changes to the abortion law were ridiculed by the Union health minister \u2013 \u201cbeing in some particular ideology, thoda thoda symbolic virodh karna bhi zaruri hai (opposition MPs feel the need to oppose the Bill symbolically)\u201d. The proposed amendments were not passed.\n\nRepresentational image. Photo credit: Fotos GOVBA/Flickr [Licenced under CC BY 2.0]Disability bias, ethicsThe removal of the gestation limit in the case of \u201csubstantial foetal abnormality\u201d and counting \u201cdifferently-abled women\u201d as vulnerable \u2013 both these intents of the amended law encroach on the rights of persons with disability, said activists.\u201cA lot of times, even doctors say that she (a woman with a disability) is not capable of giving birth or she\u2019s not capable of taking care of the child. Because they see women with disabilities as women who need care as opposed to those who can give care,\u201d said Divya Goyal, who is co-authoring a chapter in a book on the hierarchies of disability human rights for Routledge, along with Maitreya Shah, a lawyer, disability rights advocate and director of EnableMe Access. Both are persons with disabilities themselves.The lack of counselling for women carrying disabled foetuses is another concern, said Goyal, the author of the upcoming Routledge research. \u201cWe do not invest a lot in creating social services for families where there are disabled children,\u201d said her co-author Shah. \u201cInstead, we are focusing on preventing the birth of disabled children. If you see the MTP Amendment, whatever debates happened in Parliament, none of them was on disability; no one mentioned it at all.\u201dThe law also makes no mention of providing financial and logistical aid to pregnant women who want to access medical boards. Making a woman who is pregnant with a disabled foetus run to medical boards where doctors and officials will decide for her \u201cis extremely demeaning to her, is an invasion of her privacy, invasion of her choice and also, creating more bureaucratic hurdles than needed at a time when she needs to take that decision\u201d, MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said in parliament, joining eight of her colleagues in calling for the bill to be sent to a select committee for updation. This proposal could not get through and the bill passed the Rajya Sabha without any major amendments.The usage of the term foetal \u201cabnormality\u201d is also derogatory, implying a condition of disability is abnormal, said Rastogi. \u201cInstead, you could use the term foetal anomaly,\u201d she said.There is a unique issue of ethics involved in abortions past the 24-week limit when termination of pregnancy is carried out by inducing labour: The foetus could be born alive, which raises a question: Should it be resuscitated? And if yes, who will take responsibility for the child?In countries where abortion can be accessed beyond 20 weeks, it involves introducing an injectable into the foetal tissue to prevent live births. \u201cThat injection is not a part of how gynaecologists are trained in India because abortions never exceeded 20 weeks,\u201d Dalvie said. \u201cDoctors will bring their own biases, personal moralities, and values and they may refuse it even if it is 20-24 weeks.\u201dAt least two MPs in Rajya Sabha \u2013 Amee Yajnik and Fauzia Khan \u2013 also asked to consider transgender persons\u2019 abortion rights. \u201cThe terminology that it (MTP Act 2021) uses is non-inclusive: only using the term \u201cwoman\u201d especially when we now have the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. You are [the government is] not in harmony with the other laws you yourself have passed,\u201d said Rastogi.Privacy clashesThe MTP Act 2021 also contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s 2017  privacy judgement (Justice KS Puttaswamy versus Union of India and others), which ruled that a woman\u2019s right to make reproductive choices is a dimension of personal liberty as understood under Article 21 of the Constitution. Any law that restricts a person\u2019s privacy must be \u201cjust, reasonable, and fair\u201d, a test that India\u2019s abortion law, if challenged, could fail, activists say.This is because the law does not allow a woman to decide for her own pregnancy but gives her a narrow set of conditions where doctors and medical boards decide for her. A 2016 Bombay High Court judgement in a suo motu public interest litigation on the condition of a prison inmate emphasised the right of a woman to control her body and fertility \u2013 \u201cthe right to autonomy and to decide what to do with their own bodies, including whether or not to get pregnant and stay pregnant\u201d.\u201cThere is a lot of grey area or overlap between MTP and other laws,\u201d said advocate Rastogi. She cited the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. POCSO mandates that if a minor conceives, even through consensual sex (even though POCSO does not recognise consent of a person below 18 years), and wants to abort, the matter has to be reported to the police. The amended MTP law, though, largely guarantees privacy to the parties involved in abortion.Similarly, medical abortion pills are classified as Schedule H drugs for which a pharmacist must maintain a record of sales under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. This violates the confidentiality promised by MTP Act 2021, abortion advocates say.This article first appeared on IndiaSpend, a data-driven and public-interest journalism non-profit.\n\n\n\n      We welcome your comments at\n      letters@scroll.in.\n    \n\n\n        Pregnancy\n      \n\n\n        Abortion\n      \n\n\n        MTP Act\n      \n\n\n        India\n      \n\n\n        Gender\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian women seeing abortions beyond 20 weeks face desperate legal struggles\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven firms that failed drug quality tests gave money to political parties through electoral bonds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the exodus from Bhutan of young people and qualified workers is a worry for India \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did a Union minister say he would apply for Indian citizenship under CAA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectoral bonds: What we know so far, what we will know soon \u2013 and what we may never know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot just electoral bonds, the BJP is biggest beneficiary of all forms of political finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
