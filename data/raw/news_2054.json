Ron DeSantis speaks during a Republican presidential primary debate on Wednesday, September 27, 2023, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Califronia.\n\nMark J. Terrill/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Sen. Tim Scott on Wednesday successfully pinned down Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the first time on whether he would support a 15-week federal abortion ban.\n    \n\n            \u201cYes, I will,\u201d DeSantis replied to Scott in a moment lost in the crosstalk that engulfed the messy Republican primary debate. \n    \n\n            It\u2019s a commitment DeSantis has avoided making since entering the presidential race \u2013 which has at times drawn him sharp criticism from a top anti-abortion group. DeSantis instead has campaigned on the six-week abortion ban he signed in Florida earlier this year while suggesting other states may have different approaches based on their political environments. \n    \n\n            But with his window closing to gain ground in the GOP presidential nominating contest, DeSantis has made abortion a focal point of his efforts to drive a wedge between former President Donald Trump and the conservative base, particularly in Iowa. \n    \n\n            The exchange with Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, came shortly after DeSantis said Trump should be on the debate stage defending his comments that some Republican states have pursued \u201cterrible\u201d restrictions on the procedure. Scott jumped in to press DeSantis, saying, \u201cBut would you support (inaudible) a 15-week limit?\u201d\n    \n\n            Off camera, DeSantis affirmed he would, as one of the moderators asked former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a new question. The little-noticed exchange was first reported by the Daily Signal, a conservative outlet. \n    \n\n            DeSantis signaled a willingness to back a federal ban in a recent interview on Radio Iowa, telling the host: \u201cI\u2019ve said this from the beginning of this, as president, you put pro-life legislation on my desk, I\u2019m going to look favorably and support the legislation.\u201d \n    \n\n            But Wednesday\u2019s response to Scott marked the first time DeSantis weighed in so directly on a 15-week ban.\n    \n\n            As DeSantis doubles-down on anti-abortion policies, Trump has instead said he is willing to compromise with Democrats on abortion to find \u201cpeace on that issue.\u201d Trump has privately blamed the GOP\u2019s recent electoral defeats on the party\u2019s anti-abortion push following the fall of Roe v. Wade. He recently called Florida\u2019s ban \u201ca terrible thing and a terrible mistake,\u201d a remark that DeSantis has seized on as he seeks to win over evangelical and anti-abortion voters in Iowa. \n    \n\n            On the debate stage, DeSantis said: \u201cI reject this idea that pro-lifers are to blame for midterm defeats.\u201d\n    \n\n            Although he has accused Trump of prioritizing politics over the unborn, DeSantis over the years has also carefully navigated the topic, indicating his own political expediency around a sensitive issue. \n    \n\n            For much of his first term as governor, for example, DeSantis declined to push for a crackdown on abortion despite an overwhelming GOP majority in both chambers of his state legislature, leaving in place an existing law that made Florida one of the most permissive states for the procedure in the southeast. \n    \n\n            In 2022, DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban that did not include exceptions for rape and incest. But two months later, as the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, DeSantis was uncharacteristically reserved in his response and declined for months to say whether he would push for more restrictions on abortion as he ran for a second term as Florida governor.\n    \n\n            Just before launching a campaign for president, DeSantis \u2013 in the middle of the night and behind closed doors \u2013 signed a law to ban abortion in Florida after six weeks with limited exceptions for rape and incest. After jumping into the race, he repeatedly declined to back signing similar legislation at the federal level, saying it was up to states to lead.\n    \n\n            His persistent dodging earned a blistering rebuke over the summer from Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n    \n\n            \u201cA pro-life president has a duty to protect the lives of all Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should be the National Defender of Life.\u201d\n    \n\n            DeSantis defended himself from the criticism, telling CNN in New Hampshire: \u201cDifferent groups, you know, are gonna have different agendas, but I can tell you this: Nobody running has actually delivered pro-life protections. I have done that. I\u2019ve stood up. I\u2019ve said that I would stand for life, and we have done that, and we have delivered, and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201d \n    \n\n            In an interview that aired Friday, DeSantis distanced himself slightly from the six-week abortion restriction he signed into law, calling it \u201ca legislative issue.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s a legislative issue. So they have to figure out what they think, and so the legislature identified the moment where there\u2019s a detectable heartbeat as the time where there\u2019s legal protections,\u201d DeSantis said on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d \u201cNow they did provide exceptions for all the difficult cases that you hear about, but basically once there\u2019s a heartbeat, it shouldn\u2019t be used as a form of birth control.\u201d\n    \n\n            Scott has made it a priority to push candidates to back a 15-week abortion ban, telling Fox News last week, \u201cWe have to learn to stand up for our rights and make sure every single child in every single state has the same rights.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cAll the presidential candidates, whether it is Ron, Nikki (Haley), the former president, they should support me with a 15-week limit,\u201d Scott said.\n    \n\n            \u201cRon had months to advocate for a federal limit, yet discouraged efforts to protect life. If you\u2019re going to back down on an issue, this is the one to do it on. Glad Ron is now on board,\u201d Scott communications director Nathan Brand said in a statement Thursday. \n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional
