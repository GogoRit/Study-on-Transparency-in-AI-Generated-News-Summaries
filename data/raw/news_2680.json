Hutson this cycle.\n\u201cThere is bipartisan agreement that this election cycle was one of the most important of our lifetimes, with the potential to impact millions upon millions of present and future lives,\u201d said SFLAction President Kristan Hawkins. \u201cIt is clear that the work SFLAction did this cycle contributed immensely to the most critical victories in the country. State Sen. Hutson\u2019s victory tonight is one example of that. The Pro-Life Generation went on the front lines in this election, to have a voice and a vote for life.\u201d\nIn months leading up to the election, SFLAction led two major student activism weekends in Florida to make voters aware of State Sen. Hutson\u2019s consistently pro-life record and urge them to #VoteProLifeFirst this election cycle.\nIn addition to Florida, SFLAction also had a heavy presence in Montana, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, Washington, Arizona, Texas, and North Carolina.\nMORE ON SFLA/SFLAction IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE:\u00a0Students for Life and Students for Life Action engaged in multiple states through in-person door knocking, calls, texts, and mobilizations on campuses, calling on voters\u00a0to\u00a0#VotePro-LifeFirst\u00a0\u00a0as well reminding people of\u00a0the importance of who gets to pick Supreme Court Justices, given the way in which the human rights issue of our day was hijacked by the high court 50 years ago.\nIn the final stretch, SFLA/SFLAction\u00a0launched a new, 6-figure campaign buy\u00a0in a 48-hour GOTV blitz this Monday and Tuesday designed to rally voters aged 18 to 35 to #VoteProLifeFirst. To accomplish this 48-hour GOTV blitz, SFLAction made more than 1.5 million personal text messages to cell phones, sent nearly 900,000 voicemail messages to land lines as well as launched a five-digit ad buy on social media. Among those contacted in this blitz were 273,000 new voters who were considered swing voters on the life issue as well as more than 1 million pro-life, yet low propensity voters who hadn\u2019t voted early this fall in the following 9 states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nStudents for Life\u2019s GOTV blitz follows up extensive fall grassroots campaign in which SFLA/SFLAction team members and volunteers\u2026\n\nMade more than\u00a0523,022\u00a0phone calls\nContacted more than 1.6 million, primarily youth, voters\nSent more than 2.18 million personal text messages\nKnocked on more than 150,000 doors\n\nThe #VoteProLifeFirst digital media campaign included 85 different image ads and multiple videos reaching voters whose views on abortion vary and were seen more than 8 million times. More than 2.28 million voters engaged with the efforts this fall, including the 107,000 young voters who pledged to vote pro-life first as a result.\nStudents for Life of America\u2019s \u201cSock the Vote\u201d\u00a0campus tours also went to 46 states,\u00a0calling on new voters to prioritize abortion which ends\u00a02,362 lives each day. Students used baby socks as part of the display. This followed a very successful earlier campaign,\u00a0\u201cSock it to Planned Parenthood,\u201d\u00a0during which SFLA held events and traveled across the country with a truck carrying\u00a0328,348 baby socks, representing the number of abortions Planned Parenthood commits each year.\nIn October, SFLA/SFLAction went from Alaska to Florida in a\u00a010-state #Justice4Life tour\u00a0on behalf of now Justice Amy Coney Barrett an extension of the SFLAction\u00a0Activism Weekends\u00a0that included more than 731,000 voters contacted.\u00a0SFLAction conducted similar student trips over the summer, knocking on more than 50,000 doors and making more than 200,000 phone calls to educate voters in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and Kansas before key Republican and Democratic primaries. \u00a0Click here\u00a0to read more about SFLAction\u2019s results in this cycle.
