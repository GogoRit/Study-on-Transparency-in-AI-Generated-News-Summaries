Wade.\nPro-abortion American women vow to deny sex to men: #SexStrike trends on TwitterFormer president of the United States Donald Trump has had a series of contradicting statements throughout his life and political career, including when speaking about pro-choice and women's reproductive rights.His political careerDonald Trump had been campaigning for president for quite some time before actually receiving a plausible Republican party nomination, and when he actually left the right-wing party to join the reform party, he was interviewed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" show, anchor Tim Russert put him in the hot seat of controversial topics. First, he spoke about gay rightsDuring the latter part of the interview which lasted more than 20 minutes, the yet-to-be president was asked about gay rights and if they should be allowed to get married, to which he weaseled away from the question ultimately saying that it was \"too premature for him to comment on that\".Dueling protesters outside US Supreme CourtAPGay people in the military  Furthermore, he was also asked about gays in the military and he continued on the same path and said that \"it would not disturb me but again, I would have to speak to lots of experts in the military but hey, I lived in New York City my whole life and in Manhattan, all my life and my views are a little bit different than if I'd live in Iowa perhaps, but it would not be something that would disturb me\".Later he spoke about abortion rights \"Well, look, I'm - I'm very pro-choice,\" Trump said. \"I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject, but you still - I just believe in choice. Again, it may be a little bit of a New York background, because there is some different attitude in different parts of the country. And, you know, I was raised in New York, and grew up and work and everything else in New York City. But I am strongly for choice and yet I hate the concept of abortion.\"18 years later he changed his views most likely to win votes Then Trump had a radical change to even suggest doctors should be punished for performing aboritons \"The doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,\" Trump said \"The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\"\"My position has not changed,\" he added. \"Like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.\"US News\nUS NewsHow did Donald Trump react to daughter Ivanka Trump's public betrayal?\n\nUS NewsTrump raised $250 million to claim the election; part of the money went to their hotels\n\nUS NewsStephen Colbert's naughty joke about Ivanka Trump's betrayal of father, Donald Trump\nSee links of interest\nLatest Sports News\n\nNFL Scores\n\nSuper Bowl Winners List\n\nNFL Schedule\n\nMLB Scores\n\nSuper Bowl news\n\nNBA Winners List\n\nNFL Standings\n\nMLB Schedule\n\nNFL Teams\n\nNBA Scores\n\nNBA Schedule\n\nNBA Teams\n\nNFL News\n\nFantasy Football\n\nCargando siguiente contenido\n\n\n\nOther Unidad Editorial sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Sports\nNFL Scores\nNFL Schedule\nNFL News\nNBA Scores\nNBA Schedule\nMLB Schedule\n\n\nGlobal Sports\nLive Scores\nSoccer\nBoxing\nF1\nGolf\nOlympic Games\n\n\nLifestyle\nGaming\nTechnology\nUS News\nFashion [ES]\nTranslator\nMARCA TV\n\n\nUnidad Editorial\nUnidad Editorial [ES]\nExpansi\u00f3n [ES]\nEl Mundo [ES]\nCu\u00eddatePlus [ES]\nDiario M\u00e9dico [ES]\nEM America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9  Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n Deportiva, S.L.U.
