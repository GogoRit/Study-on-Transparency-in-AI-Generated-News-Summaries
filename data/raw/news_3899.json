Here's all you need to know from the expert Dr. Ishu Kataria, Mariam Siddiqui from RTI International and Shruti Parikh from Dasra.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementPeer Education: How India is and can be leveraging this approach for sexual and reproductive health Smarica PantNew Delhi,UPDATED: Dec 9, 2020 10:55 ISTYoung people constitute almost 1/4th of the world\u2019s population, and India is currently home to the largest cohort of young people in global history. At 253 million, India\u2019s adolescent population is not only mammoth, but also complex, and grappling with a range of health and developmental challenges. Among these, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) has been recognized as a crucial component for adolescent development, with linkages to education, gender equality, constructive behaviours, and achievement of the sustainable development goals.advertisementIn India in particular, barriers to accessing SRH information, services and products go beyond infrastructure and delivery. They also include societal taboos, stigma, lack of safe spaces, and a resultant dismal level of awareness. India reports ~16M teenage pregnancies annually, and >90% young men and women reported that they were unable to discuss reproductive processes with parents.\nPeer Education: How India is and can be leveraging this approach for sexual and reproductive health\nPeer Education is a solution that shows potential to solve these issues and promote better SRH for adolescents, especially in middle to lower income countries. In addition to civil society organizations\u2019 ongoing efforts, the Indian Government has also committed to strengthening and prioritizing peer education through its Adolescent Reproductive Health Strategy (ARSH) and the subsequent National Adolescent Health Programme, or Rashtriya Kishore Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK).\nThis programme has a vision to increase accessibility and quality of information, counselling and services, to ensure that adolescents are able to realize their full potential by making informed decisions related to their nutrition, mental health, and SRH. In 2017, peer education was included as a component of RKSK.\nThe Peer Education Model of Government of India is one in which young leaders, \u201cSathiyas\u201d, are chosen, trained and supported to lead regular informational sessions for adolescents in their communities. An average of 4 Sathiyas are chosen per village, each leading groups of 15-20 adolescents at a time. This model shows promise due to its ability to empower adolescents to lead their own betterment, create safe friendship networks, and has cascaded reach to families and out-of-school adolescents.As revealed in a recent systematic review, despite wide use of and investment in peer education, the evidence of its effectiveness in advancing SRH is mixed and limited. There is insufficient literature on what the ideal conditions and design for success of peer education interventions should be. In the context of a growing adolescent population and an urgent need to advance their SRH, there is a need to understand these factors and data more comprehensively.The RKSK\u2019s inclusion of peer education is an opportunity to leverage, to solve for pain-points in implementation and invest in better evidence practices. This article is an attempt to explore recent findings and expert recommendations on the same Findings around implementation suggest that while effective in building safe spaces and disseminating information, there are challenges stemming right from recruitment and training of the Sathiyas to the extent of mentoring and support they receive during this process. This was visible through the little-to-no existing evidence to show that awareness, attitudes and knowledge developed through peer education sessions had actually translated to changes in SRH behavior among adolescents. Data also showed that there have been insufficient human and financial resources mobilized, making programs difficult to scale and sustain.\nPeer Education: How India is and can be leveraging this approach for sexual and reproductive health\nAs discussed in a recent webinar, including a mix of perspectives from academicians, nonprofits, philanthropists, government officials and adolescents, there are possible solutions and recommendations to bridge these gaps\n\nadvertisementTrainings for Sathiyas and communities need to be improved and increased \u2013 Peer education is not just the concern of young people and program implementers; it is a model that brings everyone together, including community health workers and local medical professionals. There is a need to ensure that training is equally strong across all stakeholders. This may also entail more frequent and needs-based trainings, as new information and issues arise among adolescents. Further, teaching methods need to be evolved such that they don\u2019t just serve to provide information, but also drive uptake of key healthy behaviors.\n\n\nadvertisement\n\nDelivery of peer education needs to be more inclusive - Nisha Kumari, a Sathiya from Jharkhand, suggests that \u201cAdolescents need more platforms for them to share their thoughts, needs and wants.\u201d We need to include adolescent feedback more proactively, and peer education design needs to include out-of-school adolescents, local and relatable sociocultural context, and local languages in a comprehensive manner. There is also a need for more integration of technology to make peer groups more accessible.\n\n\n\n\nAdequate budget allocation needs to be driven towards peer education \u2013 Keeping the lens of sustainability and retention, there\u2019s a need to improve incentives for Sathiyas to keep them motivated and supported enough to keep playing their integral roles. This could also help improve recruitment processes and reduce backlash from parents towards adolescents enrolling in peer education trainings, allowing for wider outreach.\n\n\nadvertisement\n\nEvidence and monitoring needs to be more robust and outcomes-driven - We need to design and integrate monitoring systems for peer education in adolescent health programmes that focus not just on quality and frequency of information shared, but also measure programme outcomes in the form of on-going corrective actions\n\n\nIf properly tackled, higher quality research and data, stronger implementation planning, and evolved pedagogy could play a catalytic role in strengthening peer education models, and in turn, the standard of adolescent health and wellbeing in India.\n\nRead more| Tips to teach children about financial planningPublished By: Smarica PantPublished On: Dec 9, 2020--- ENDS ---AdvertisementAajtak Campus - Your College Search Partner!\n\nWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso Watch2:18Video: Bengaluru cafe bomb blast caught on cam8:34PM Modi slams Mamata over Sandeshkhali, says Shahjahan arrested after BJP pressure1:27PM launches projects worth Rs 35,700 crore in Dhanbad's Sindri2:44Students caught red-handed while cheating, video goes viral of this UP's exam1:36After Fighter, Article 370 bites the dust in the GulfAdvertisementRead This'Delhi Chalo' march paused for night after day of violence, over 60 injuredWatch: Ashok Chavan\u2019s blooper, Devendra Fadnavis corrects him, bursts of laughter1 dead, 21 injured in Kansas City after shooting during Super Bowl victory rally\u2018Congress doesn\u2019t deserve but we\u2019ll offer 1 seat\u2019: AAP\u2019s take-it-or-leave-itEx-Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan joins BJP, day after quitting CongressAdvertisement            Follow Us On:                                Advertisement  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         PUBLICATIONS  India Today Business Today India Today-Hindi TIME    TELEVISION  India Today TV Aaj Tak  Good News Today    EVENTS  Agenda AajTak India Today Conclave Sahitya AajTak     RADIO  Ishq FM AajTak Radio    GAMING  India Today Gaming  World Esports Cup        USEFUL LINKS  Press Release Sitemap News Newsletter  Privacy Policy Correction Policy LMIL Documents    PRINTING  Thomson Press    WELFARE  Care Today    DISTRIBUTION  Rate Card    SYNDICATIONS  Headlines Today        WEBSITES  India Today India Today Malayalam India Today NE Business Today DailyO AajTak Lallantop Bangla GNTTV iChowk Reader\u2019s Digest Cosmopolitan    EDUCATION  Vasant Valley Best Colleges Best Universities          Download App              ABOUT US CONTACT US TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARCHIVES    Copyright \u00a9 2024 Living Media India Limited.
