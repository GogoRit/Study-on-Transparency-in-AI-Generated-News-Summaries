It was one of nearly two dozen facilities that received state funds in 2022 and 2023 directed at entities that help those experiencing an unintended pregnancy give birth.\n\n(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year after abortion effectively ended in Arkansas, more Arkansans than ever are seeking permanent sterilization, and abortion access groups have seen their costs increase.\nA renewed focus to implement policies experts say would improve maternal health saw mixed results, and Arkansas\u2019 maternal mortality rate continues to be among the worst in the U.S.\nArkansas was one of several states with a \u201ctrigger law\u201d that banned abortion in June 2022 almost immediately following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe only exception to the state\u2019s ban is to save the life of the mother in a \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d Arkansas\u2019 Republican-supermajority Legislature rejected several measures this year to broaden the state\u2019s exceptions to the ban.\nA complete picture of what happened to Arkansas\u2019 maternal health landscape post-Dobbs is still a ways off as health data reporting typically lags by a year or more.\u00a0\nBut health experts and those who work with pregnant Arkansans expressed both reasons for optimism and disappointments from the last 12 months.\n  Dr. Nirvana Manning (Courtesy UAMS)\nMedical professionals and patients had \u201ca lot of uncertainty\u201d in the days and weeks immediately following the Dobbs ruling, said Dr. Nirvana Manning, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a practicing OB/GYN at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.\nWhile there isn\u2019t available statewide data on contraceptive use or sterilization, Manning said UAMS saw significant increases in both reversible and permanent birth control after Dobbs. Furthermore, the number of patients requesting permanent sterilization increased by four to five times, surprising Manning and other clinicians.\n\u201cWe were not necessarily expecting that sort of a response, and in hindsight now, I completely understand it,\u201d she said.\nDemand for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) also spiked after Dobbs, Manning said.\nA new state law that goes into effect Aug. 1 requires Medicaid to reimburse physicians for providing LARC. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families praised Act 581 as a cost-saving measure for both individuals and the state.\nManning agreed, especially since Arkansas has the nation\u2019s highest teen birth rate. According to a new report, Arkansas\u2019s teen birth rate was 27 births per 1,000 teens in 2021, nearly twice the national average. Access to contraception is the primary reason for this discrepancy, according to AACF.\nAdditionally, 30% of teenage pregnancies are the person\u2019s second or third, and Act 581 can \u201cdramatically\u201d lower this statistic, Manning said.\nTo implement this law, health care providers at all 37 Arkansas hospitals that deliver babies must know how to administer LARC and receive Medicaid reimbursement for it, she said.\n\u201c[We should also be] making sure our family practice partners and women\u2019s health advanced practice partners are all very comfortable with counseling the different contraception options and comfortable placing them, should someone in their community want them,\u201d Manning said.\nAbortion access\nOver the last year, groups like the Arkansas Abortion Support Network and Ozark Circle for Choice have shifted their focus to helping Arkansans access out-of-state abortions, which is more expensive.\u00a0\nAASN Executive Director Ali Taylor said the network still operates an abortion fund, but it also partnered with other groups like Midwest Access Coalition. The much larger organization has the capacity and infrastructure to do things like buy a plane ticket for a third party or make hotel reservations that don\u2019t require a credit card, Taylor said. Through their partnership, AASN refers clients to MAC and reimburses them quarterly.\nEchoing history, reliance upon travel rises for abortion care post-Dobbs\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously going to be a few years before we know the full impact, before we really have all the numbers, but starting out as one of the states with one of the highest maternal mortality rates wasn\u2019t a great place to start, and banning abortion certainly isn\u2019t going to help that statistic,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nIn response to the increasing prevalence of crisis pregnancy centers \u201cthat basically exist to talk people out of abortion,\u201d according to Taylor, AASN opened the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind for Arkansas abortion and pregnancy resource center\u201d called the YOU (Your Options Understood) Center last fall.\nLocated in the former Little Rock Family Planning Services building, YOU Center clients can access abortion, parenting or adoption resources, as well as free emergency contraceptives, condoms and pregnancy tests, Taylor said.\n  Arkansas Abortion Support Network is operating its YOU Center in the former Little Rock Family Planning Services building.(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)\nEventually, Taylor said the center hopes to provide sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and establish satellite YOU centers on college campuses across the state.\u00a0\n\u201cArkansans still have options, and I think that there are too many people out there who don\u2019t realize that\u2026It\u2019s not illegal to go out of the state, it\u2019s not illegal to get help to go out of the state, and we\u2019re here to help folks when they need that,\u201d she said.\nTaylor Hern, an organizer with the mutual aid reproductive justice organization Ozark Circle for Choice, said it relies heavily on abortion funds, like AASN.\nThe increased cost of abortion access disproportionately affects low-income Americans who are always going to be shut out of the medical system, even with less-controversial medical care, Hern said.\n\u201cThose gaps have always been there, and the work we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re contributing to is getting harder,\u201d Hern said. \u201cA year out\u2026we\u2019re kind of finding our footing with the new landscape that we\u2019re in, but we are going to stay flexible and we\u2019re going to stay available.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nCrisis pregnancy centers\u00a0\nSince Dobbs, Arkansas Pregnancy Resource Center Executive Director Shelley Lewis said she\u2019s encountered more people concerned they won\u2019t be able to get care for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages.\u00a0\nFollowing the Dobbs decision, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson issued a statement clarifying that Arkansas\u2019 \u201ctrigger law\u201d does not affect ectopic pregnancy treatment.\nFounded in 1977, the nonprofit, faith-based organization provides free services, including pregnancy and STI testing and limited OB ultrasounds, regardless of clients\u2019 insurance or legal status. The center hired a social worker and a mental health professional in the last year.\nLegislation on Arkansas governor\u2019s desk would reboot $1M pregnancy resource center grant fund\n\n\u201cWe saw it being more important post-Dobbs, but knowing that we always wanted to do it all along, we just had a little bit more incentive to do so,\u201d she said.\nBoth part-time positions are supported through a $1 million grant program created by the Arkansas Legislature to help fund crisis pregnancy centers. Arkansas Pregnancy Resource Center received about $50,000, which also supported advertising, Lewis said.\nThe center is located next to Arkansas Abortion Support Network\u2019s YOU Center, and Lewis said she\u2019s thankful to see the direction their neighbors are taking.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we all need to give each other grace and understanding of what women need,\u201d she said. \u201cTrying to point fingers at each other really keeps us from seeing who needs help, and it\u2019s women and families in the area, so we\u2019re committed to working with anyone that wants to help our community regardless of what political beliefs they might have.\u201d\n  The Arkansas Pregnancy Resource Center in west Little Rock is located next door to the Arkansas Abortion Support Network\u2019s YOU Center.(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)\nMedicaid for pregnant and postpartum Arkansans\nAlthough the Dobbs decision shifted state policymakers\u2019 focus toward maternal health, Arkansas remains one of the few states that have not taken advantage of the option to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage.\nExtending postpartum coverage from 60 days to a full year after giving birth would be a boon to maternal health in Arkansas, Manning said.\u00a0\nA bill to create this policy did not advance in the Arkansas Legislature earlier this year.\nLast August, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced plans to seek waivers from federal authorities to expand two existing Medicaid-based initiatives aimed at serving pregnant and postpartum Arkansans, especially in rural areas.\nOne waiver would allow an additional 5,000 Arkansans to receive at-home visits during a high-risk pregnancy via the Department of Human Services\u2019 Life360 program.\u00a0\nThe second would allow Arkansans with incomes up to 214% of the federal poverty level to receive Medicaid coverage for all health care needs for 60 days after giving birth.\nArkansas Legislature saw wide range of maternal and reproductive health legislation in 2023\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the amendment to create Life360 HOMEs as part of the Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME) program in November, DHS spokesman Gavin Lesnick said. DHS has received eight letters of intent for Life360 HOMEs and three applications.\u00a0\nApproval is pending to allow women in Medicaid programs other than ARHOME to participate in Maternal Life360 HOMEs, Lesnick said.\n\u201cWe cover pregnancy in all categories for 60 days and beyond if the beneficiary is eligible,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those pregnant women who are not eligible for another category, full Medicaid coverage is available up to 214% of the federal poverty level until the end of the month 60 days after giving birth.\u201d\u00a0\nMore than half of all Arkansas pregnancies are covered by Medicaid, Manning said. To take advantage of Medicaid coverage for LARC, a postpartum mother must attend a doctor\u2019s appointment before the current 60-day coverage deadline.\nNot all mothers, especially in poor and rural areas, have the support systems to access this care in a timely manner, Manning said.\n\u201cSo many\u2026 are alone in that delivery room or in that postpartum period because the rest of their families have jobs that they need to be at in order to help sustain their families,\u201d she said.\nMaternal mortality\u00a0\nAdditionally, Manning said, extending postpartum Medicaid coverage would also help address postpartum health complications that contribute to maternal mortality, especially since most complications and deaths occur at least 42 days postpartum.\nArkansas has the nation\u2019s highest maternal mortality rate and the third highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement which launched a project last week to raise awareness about the issue.\nArkansas Surgeon General Dr. Kay Chandler, a gynecologist, told lawmakers during a committee meeting Tuesday that one of her goals is to address maternal mortality in the state and that she\u2019s met with members of the state\u2019s maternal mortality review committee.\t\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Arkansas became the 48th state to join the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), which creates \u201cpatient safety bundles,\u201d or maternal health care plans and best practices, that state health systems distribute to providers.\nManning said having this information is crucial to providing care in \u201ca stressful, high-acuity situation.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially important in places like rural communities that may see these situations very infrequently,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call these \u2018never events,\u2019 but they occur, and if they only occur once every two years, that staff is not well-versed in how to take care of that maternal emergency.\u201d\nUAMS offers the option of terminating a pregnancy only \u201cin cases of severe maternal morbidity,\u201d and those severe cases are usually \u201cclear-cut,\u201d Manning said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to let a mom\u2019s health get compromised in a waiting game,\u201d she said.\nDoctors, patients, risk managers and hospital attorneys must be fully informed of what\u2019s happening in an emergency situation to ensure both compliance with state law and proper health care for the patient, Manning said.\n\u201cIt takes a high level of health literacy to understand where your risks are, and unfortunately we live in a largely rural state where health literacy is difficult,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\nXA year without abortion in Arkansas: more sterilizations and continued struggles in maternal health\nby Tess Vrbin, Arkansas Advocate June 26, 2023\nA year without abortion in Arkansas: more sterilizations and continued struggles in maternal health\nby Tess Vrbin, Arkansas Advocate June 26, 2023\n A year after abortion effectively ended in Arkansas, more Arkansans than ever are seeking permanent sterilization, and abortion access groups have seen their costs increase.\nA renewed focus to implement policies experts say would improve maternal health saw mixed results, and Arkansas\u2019 maternal mortality rate continues to be among the worst in the U.S.\nArkansas was one of several states with a \u201ctrigger law\u201d that banned abortion in June 2022 almost immediately following the Dobbs v.
