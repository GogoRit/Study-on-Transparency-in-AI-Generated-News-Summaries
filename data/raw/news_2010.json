(AP) \u2014 Abortions would be almost entirely banned after about six weeks of pregnancy under a bill debated early into Wednesday morning by the South Carolina House in a development that follows months of Republicans in the chamber insisting instead on a near-total ban that the state Senate recently rejected.However, a final vote would have to wait until later in the day after the House moved to reconvene at 10 a.m. while the computer system rebooted. The proposed ban brings the two GOP-dominated chambers close to resolving a disagreement that epitomizes the intra-Republican debates unfolding nationwide how far to restrict access since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year.\u201cIt became like we were playing with live ammunition,\u201d said South Carolina Republican Sen. Tom Davis, who helped block the near-total ban but supports other limits. \u201cIt was like this is for real now and everything that we debate and pass is going to be law.\u201d\n\nThe end of federal abortion protections has forced politicians to go beyond bumper sticker slogans and acknowledge the nuances in public opinion, said Alesha Doan, a University of Kansas professor who studies policy and gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conflict within the Republican Party arises from officials\u2019 attempts to delineate their positions on an issue where they don\u2019t align with most Americans, she said.\u201cOnce you get what you want, the real work begins,\u201d Doan said. \u201cWhat are the on-the-ground implications for pregnant people\u2019s healthcare? What are the legal implications, the public health implications, the political implications?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservatives in other states also charged forward with restrictions on Tuesday.The North Carolina General Assembly overrode the Democratic governor\u2019s veto on a 12-week abortion ban that Republicans quickly advanced after securing veto-proof majorities in both chambers.\n\nMeanwhile, Nebraska lawmakers pushed a 12-week ban after a more stringent proposal recently failed. The state Legislature mustered just enough votes to fold the limits into another bill banning gender-affirming healthcare for minors.But the impasse in South Carolina had persisted since last fall\u2019s special session when neither chamber budged from their respective near-total and roughly six-week bans.South Carolina Republican Sen. Larry Grooms said the majority party\u2019s \u201ctroubles\u201d began then when some House lawmakers \u201cwanted to be more pro-life\u201d by demanding a near-total ban that lacked the necessary support in the Senate.\u201cFor those folks, the politics were more important than the policy,\u201d said Grooms, whose biography lists awards from anti-abortion and conservative Christian groups.The stalemate continued even after the state Supreme Court struck down a previous law banning abortions once cardiac activity is detected.That January decision left abortion legal through 22 weeks of pregnancy, and Republicans have since been rankled by state health department data showing a sharp increase in abortions.The measure still under debate Wednesday would ban abortions when an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, around six weeks and before most women know they are pregnant. It includes exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies, the patient\u2019s life and health, and rape or incest through 12 weeks.\n\nSenators believe that several tweaks and a new court makeup will allow the measure to withstand anticipated legal challenges.Opponents say a ban around six weeks is essentially an outright abortion ban. South Carolinians oppose such restrictions \u201cbecause it pushes health care further out of reach for the vulnerable, and makes pregnancy more dangerous for everyone,\u201d Ann Warner, the CEO of Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network, said last week in written testimony.The bill will need to clear the Senate again before reaching the governor, who has indicated he would sign the measure. The House has already added changes to mandate child support starting at conception and require that a judge sign-off on any minor\u2019s request for an abortion.\n\nDebate stretched over 12 hours past 1 a.m. Wednesday even after Republicans invoked rules limiting debate. Democrats slowed the process by speaking for all three allotted minutes on each of their hundreds of amendments and forcing other procedural votes.\u201cWe are going to make it hurt if they\u2019re going to force this on us,\u201d Democratic Rep. Beth Bernstein said Tuesday morning, flanked by dozens of supporters with signs reading \u201cBANS OFF OUR BODIES.\u201dAgain, Democrats spoke until time expired. Again, Democratic hands flew up to call for a vote. Again, the amendments got tossed.They reminded colleagues of the state\u2019s rising infant and maternal mortality rates that are even worse for Black patients. They noted the gender disparities in state government. They advocated for Medicaid expansion.\n\nAn often indifferent scene otherwise unfolded inside the chamber. Several lawmakers tuned into a livestreamed budget conference committee in the afternoon. Seltzer cans and coffee cups piled up. Word games and online poker flashed across tablets.The debate kicked off a special session called by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster. Lawmakers receive extra pay for each day they convene \u2014 a cost totaling $60,000 on Tuesday alone, according to Republican Rep. Weston Newton.That figure drew Democratic criticism of wasted taxpayer money. Republicans countered that \u201cprotecting life\u201d is a priceless endeavor.The long grind marked one of the only tools for House Democrats whose superminority status gives them little power. Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter repeatedly urged abortion rights supporters to challenge Republican officeholders next election.\u201cIf you want to see something done about men and women who are in this chamber who think you as a woman don\u2019t have sense enough to say what you want to do with your body, then get busy,\u201d she said.___Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
