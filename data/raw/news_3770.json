The Child-Parent Security Act (CPSA) was tacked on to a budget plan rushed through in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide paid sick leave for New York State, which has been hit hardest in the US, in an apparent attempt to prevent the surrogacy bill from being rejected a second time.\nNew York state legislators abandoned the CPSA last year after Gloria Steinem wrote an open letter to Gov. Cuomo, outlining the health risks and ethical concerns posed by the industry. She argued:\n\u201cAny legislation that legalizes and allows profiteering from body invasion \u2014 for instance, becoming an organ donor, an egg donor, or a surrogate womb for impregnation and nine months of pregnancy \u2014 must have many more safeguards than this legislation does. For all the years from menstruation until the end of fertility, it could turn the bodies of disenfranchised women, both U.S. citizens and legal and undocumented immigrants, into profit centers.\u201d\nIn addition, over one hundred New York-based women\u2019s rights campaigners signed a letter expressing their opposition to the CPSA last May, including Taina Bien-Aim\u00e9, executive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women.According to Bien-Aim\u00e9:\n\u201cBoth commercial surrogacy and prostitution are industry-driven \u2014 one by gestational surrogacy companies, and the other by a multi billion-dollar sex trade and its lobby. Both thrive on the vulnerabilities of disenfranchised people, especially women of colour. Both turn their profits on growing demand for women\u2019s bodies as commodities, and both kick open a wide door for sex and reproductive trafficking.\u201d\nLast year, state assemblywoman Deborah Glick, who became the first openly gay member of the legislature in 1991, told the New York Times that surrogacy is not centred on LGBT rights. \u201cI\u2019m not certain that, considering the money involved, that this is an issue for the broader LGBT community\u2026 It is pregnancy for a fee, and I find that commodification of women troubling.\u201d\nThough New York is only one of three US states that had not yet legalized commercial surrogacy, local legislation previously allowed for what is termed Compassionate Surrogacy, wherein a willing mother may volunteer to birth and give her infant to an intended family. Also protected under New York law was the ability for a mother to keep the child she delivers should she have a change of heart. The CPSA has now removed this right: \u201cThe law will make it clear that donors do not have parental rights or obligations and that those rights and obligations reside with the intended parents.\u201d\nReferring to women as \u201cgestational carriers,\u201d the bill provides no protection against the trafficking and exploitation of marginalized women over state lines. In order to be considered a \u201cgestational carrier,\u201d one must only have resided in New York for 90 days. Background checks are not required, meaning that anyone could potentially traffic women from any country into New York as a \u201cgestational carrier.\u201d\nHowever, the CPSA was drafted with at least a few good intentions. For instance, the bill specifically allows the mother to make her own decisions about her health, which had not been a right previously protected under other surrogacy contracts globally. It has been standard procedure in multiple countries where commercial surrogacy is practiced, as in India, to allow clinics and intended parents to monitor a woman\u2019s diet and exercise and to deny her pay for breach of contract should she be deemed negligent with her health. In this regard, the senators responsible for drafting the bill no doubt feel they are progressive, and possibly \u201ccompassionate\u201d themselves. Yet it is not immediately clear why a state where non-profit surrogacy is already legal would seek to advance the commercialization of womb rental. That surrogacy has primarily been framed as a fight for LGBT rights rather than an issue impacting women\u2019s rights is similarly baffling.\nIndeed, New York state Senator Brad Hoylman, one of the key supporters of the CPSA, is a gay man who purchased his two daughters through a \u201cgestational carrier.\u201d He also sponsored a bill aiming to legalize the sale of breast milk in order to create a breast milk industry, and advocates for the legalization of sex trafficking.\nWriting for Buzzfeed, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared:\n\u201cBy banning gestational surrogacy, we are saying to the LGBTQ community and those who struggle with infertility: You can\u2019t have a child in your own state.\u201d\nCuomo\u2019s statement is not entirely accurate, and appears deliberately misleading. Gestational surrogacy refers specifically to transferring a fertilized embryo into a woman\u2019s body to which she has no genetic connection. Surrogacy itself is not banned in New York \u2014 it is commercial surrogacy, along with gestational surrogacy, that are currently banned. It is legal for a woman to volunteer to act as a birth mother for another couple using IVF, or through natural conception, if she is not financially compensated.\nGestational surrogacy potentially involves the use of two women\u2019s bodies: the egg donor, who is administered powerful hormones to put her body into a temporary state of menopause in order to better harvest her eggs, and a second woman to accept the fertilized embryo transplant and carry the fetus. The only reason intended parents would need to travel out-of-state would pertain to situations involving embryo transplantation, or if no women are willing to act as a \u201cgestational carrier\u201d without economic coercion.\nCuomo, along with supporters of the surrogacy industry, are attempting to portray the issue as an advancement of LGBT rights. Following Taiwan\u2019s 2018 decision to legalize gay marriage, US surrogacy corporations flooded into the country. New York-based campaign group Men Having Babies (MHB) held their first conference in Taipei in 2019 to promote the rental of US women\u2019s wombs by Chinese men. MHB has been actively organizing and campaigning to change international surrogacy laws. In 2019, for instance, the American-based organization held yet another conference in Belgium, asserting that gay men have a right to pay to use women\u2019s bodies to reproduce for them.\nRon Poole-Dayan, founder and executive director at MHB, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation:\n\u201cWe have been witnessing over the last three years, a growing interest from Asia \u2014 mostly Chinese \u2014 intended parents coming to the United States for surrogacy. People are starting to realize\u2026 the fact that they\u2019re gay doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not going to be able to have a full life including starting a family and having children.\u201d\nSurrogacy is a women\u2019s rights issue, and not a human rights issue for homosexual men. This view removes women from the centre of the debate, reframing male entitlement to women\u2019s reproductive function as a pitiable cause to elicit sympathy from would-be progressives. The majority of lesbian couples do not have a pressing need to rent a woman\u2019s body. Even infertile couples have other options, such as IVF, though drugs involved in this type of treatment may increase a woman\u2019s risk of contracting fibromyalgia, ovarian cancer, or a fatal condition known as ovarian hyperstimulation (OHSS). The decision to take these risks is presumably motivated by the woman\u2019s own desire to have a child, rather than by economic coercion to produce a child for someone else (though coercion from a male partner to undergo IVF is not unheard of). Therefore, it is rather obvious that the commercial womb-rental industry confers the greatest benefit to same-sex attracted men, or infertile women, neither of whom undergo the myriad of health risks involved for women who give birth via surrogacy contracts.\nThough the CPSA was supported by Democrats and championed by media and politicians as protecting the rights of the LGBT community by supporting their \u201cright\u201d to a family, the CPSA was based on the same principles used by conservatives to control women\u2019s reproductive capacity: namely, that the right to a child carrying one\u2019s own DNA (also known as paternity certainty) is a higher priority than the freedom, health, and lives of women.\nEasier access to ethical adoption and addressing discrimination against same-sex couples is an issue of LGB rights; surrogacy is fundamentally concerned with female bodies, and no one, regardless of their orientation, has the right to pay for the use of a woman\u2019s body. It is a disservice to women and the LGB community alike to continue to frame the ability to rent women\u2019s bodies as a right \u2014 one that is inextricably linked to same-sex orientation. Bills that seek to regulate the industry often reveal their homophobia by excluding sperm donation, which benefits lesbian couples, or by also banning adoption for gay couples. Women must demand that this issue focus on the rights of women, or we will continue to have our rights legally bound to men\u2019s sexual rights.\nBut, perhaps to obscure this reality, the language of the CPSA went to great lengths to erase biological sex. A significant number of edits were made by Democratic lawmakers wherein \u201cmother\u201d was crossed out and replaced with \u201cgestational carrier,\u201d or \u201cperson who gave birth.\u201d Such terminology explicitly mirrors the way conservative anti-choice advocates view women, referring to women as \u201chost bodies,\u201d for example. In this case, \u201cgestational carrier\u201d is used to refer to the woman whose body is being used to gestate a fertilized embryo that does not carry her DNA, though \u201chandmaid\u201d might be a more appropriate term.\nSimilarly, many instances of the term \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201cman,\u201d and \u201cpaternity\u201d have been removed and replaced:\n\u201cA [woman] genetic surrogate agrees either to be inseminated with the sperm of a [man] person who is not her [husband] spouse or to be impregnated with an embryo that is the product of [an] the genetic surrogate\u2019s ovum fertilized with the sperm of a [man] person who is not her [husband] spouse.\u201d\nLanguage is being deliberately obfuscated to cover up what this issue is really about: fundamentally, legalizing commercial surrogacy would secure male entitlement to paternity certainty \u2014 so a man can be assured the child is his genetic descendant. This is not a new concept \u2014 rather it is the basis of patriarchy. For centuries, men have subjugated women in order to secure their paternity.\nAt Fair Observer, Dianne Post explains:\n\u201cThe birth mother is not in the place of another; she is the mother. That was the law in every country in the world until now. We always knew who the mother was \u2014 she was the one who gave birth. That is the first definition of a mother. We weren\u2019t so sure about the father, which is why women\u2019s freedoms have been curtailed so men could be assured of their lineage. Now, with DNA, we can be scientifically certain of the father. So the first \u2018success\u2019 of the surrogacy movement was to change the definition of the mother and remove the woman who gave birth from the frame. By applying the word \u2018surrogate\u2019 to the wrong person, it depresses the position of the birth mother but does not elevate the position of the other woman. Instead, the position of the sperm donor, or the father, is elevated as the only person with rights.\u201d\nIn reality, a surrogate is someone other than the birth mother who raises a child; this means that commercial surrogacy refers to the birth mother as the improper parent, while conferring authority and legitimacy to the male parent or intended parents. In this way, the true aim of the industry reveals itself: the commodification of the female body for the extraction of reproductive labour, in order to protect paternity certainty and replicate the male\u2019s genetic material for him.\nThis is especially troubling given that there are no official records kept regarding how many women die in the surrogacy industry. In January, Michelle Reaves died due to complications from a surrogacy birth. Reaves succumbed to a condition known as an amniotic fluid embolism. According to a statement from the Center for Bioethics and Culture (CBC):\n\u201cRecent studies have shown that surrogate pregnancies are different and are high-risk. Studies show that women pregnant with donor eggs (as in gestational surrogacy) have a more than three-fold risk of developing pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia.\u201d\nAll surrogate pregnancies are medically classified as \u201chigh-risk\u201d due to the use of hormones involved, and even egg donation confers risks of developing endometriosis, infertility, or the fatal condition of OHSS.\nBy passing the CPSA quietly and attaching it to a budget intended to help those suffering financial repercussions as a result of a global pandemic, New York lawmakers are sending a clear signal that they are deliberately ignoring women\u2019s opposition to the surrogacy industry, and that they value profit and male entitlement to use female bodies over women\u2019s safety and health. Surrogacy is a predatory, profit-driven industry \u2014 whether appealing to women\u2019s kindness through terms like \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201caltruism,\u201d or exploiting marginalized women in economic need, it turns both women\u2019s bodies and children into a commodity to satisfy the desires of the wealthy for a child that carries their genetic material.\n \nEnjoy fiercely independent, women-led media?
