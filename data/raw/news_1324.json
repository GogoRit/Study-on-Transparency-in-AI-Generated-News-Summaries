In at least two cases, cancer patients have been blocked from receiving treatment until their pregnancies were terminated \u2014 and getting an abortion required them to leave the state.\nThe cases underscore how abortion bans \u2014 even those with exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person \u2014 have upended patients\u2019 lives and limited doctors\u2019 abilities to provide essential medical treatments.\u00a0\nAfter Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, Ohio banned abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, a law that was blocked by courts on September 14. That abortion ban has an exception for saving the life of the pregnant person. And though the law does not criminalize pregnant people, medical providers can face a year in prison for providing abortions past six weeks, along with additional fines.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is currently available up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Ohio while the law is blocked. It\u2019s not clear when it will take effect again.\nBut, the affidavits show, in the two and a half months that the state\u2019s six-week ban was enforced, the law had drastic consequences.\nThe Ohio affidavits \u2014 part of a case challenging the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s six-week ban \u2014 illustrate a much broader phenomenon, said Leilah Zahedi-Spung, a maternal fetal medicine physician in Tennessee, where abortions are banned entirely. In many states that are enforcing abortion bans, she said, physicians are navigating the same conundrum, and the risk of being jailed is likely deterring them from offering abortions to patients who would need them to start chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is typically not advised for people in their first trimester of pregnancy, since it can harm fetal development or even increase the risk of a miscarriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Education Department reinforces Title IX protections for abortion and pregnancy\n                \n\n\n\n                    Label change for mifepristone could reduce barriers to care for miscarriages, advocates say in petition to FDA\n                \n\n\n\n                    70% of Americans don\u2019t trust politicians to make abortion policy, 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll finds\n                \n\n\n\n\nSince Roe was overturned, doctors have attested that language around medical exceptions to abortion bans is vague and confusing. Many clinicians have reported that they do not feel safe providing an abortion \u2014 even if it is the correct and appropriate form of care \u2014 until the patient\u2019s condition has progressed to the point where they could die imminently.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody that would feel comfortable treating a pregnant patient with cancer because I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re nearly dead enough,\u201d Zahedi-Spung said. \u201cThe threshold that I am holding in order to provide abortion care is basically almost dead to try to avoid being arrested and jailed.\u201d\nIn one Ohio case, described in an affidavit by Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Medical Director Sharon Liner, a 25-year-old woman with cancer was already undergoing chemotherapy before she learned she was pregnant. When she discovered her pregnancy, doctors told her she was unable to continue receiving her cancer treatment while pregnant. And at eight weeks pregnant, she could not legally obtain an abortion in Ohio.\nThe woman\u2019s doctor, Liner said in the affidavit, did not feel comfortable providing paperwork indicating that she medically qualified for an abortion, like many physicians who are nervous about the hefty criminal penalties possible if one is found to have provided an abortion. The woman had to travel out of state to terminate her pregnancy. Only upon returning could she continue her delayed chemotherapy.\n\u201cThe past two months have been horrendous for our patients,\u201d Liner said in the affidavit.\nAn employee at the Women\u2019s Med Center of Dayton described a similar case. A 37-year-old woman came for an abortion June 27 \u2014 three days after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe. The patient had stage three melanoma and had been told she needed an abortion before she could continue receiving cancer treatment, per a submitted affidavit by Aeran Trick, operations manager at the clinic.\u00a0\nBecause her pregnancy was past six weeks, the woman could not receive an abortion in Ohio.\n\u201cUpon learning that she would need to travel out of state to have her abortion, the patient broke down and cried inconsolably, despite the attempts of multiple staff, including myself, to comfort her,\u201d Trick said in the affidavit.\u00a0\nOhio abortion providers have challenged the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in state court, arguing that the state constitution\u2019s privacy protections include a right to an abortion. In agreement, a judge in Hamilton County has blocked the six-week ban while this case goes through the state courts \u2014 meaning that abortions are currently available up to 20 weeks pregnancy in Ohio.\u00a0\nBeyond issues with cancer treatments, Ohio abortion providers testified to hearing patients discuss suicide if they could not receive an abortion. One also said she would consider drinking bleach to end her pregnancy; another asked how much vitamin C she had to ingest to induce an abortion \u2014 both practices that would seriously endanger the patients. None of the providers who testified in these affidavits were available for comment.\u00a0\nResearch shows that women are more likely to seek health care when they become pregnant. That means patients may not even learn they have cancer until they come in for their first prenatal visit.\nThose are often emotionally fraught conversations, Zahedi-Spung said, particularly for patients who intended to become pregnant and did not know about their cancer. If the disease is still in its early stages, some may attempt to surgically remove it, then wait for the pregnancy to reach its second trimester. If needed, they can begin chemotherapy at that point,\u00a0hoping that the cancer has not progressed too far in the meanwhile.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

There are even further complications there since chemotherapy can damage someone\u2019s fertility.\u00a0\nIn those cases, telling patients that they cannot receive an abortion in state becomes even more difficult.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful for patients,\u201d Zahedi-Spung said. \u201cAnd then you have to say, \u2018By the way, the state of Tennessee doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re dying enough, so for you to get the care you need now that\u00a0 you\u2019ve made this tough decision, you have to go to an abortion clinic out of state.\u201d\nIn Tennessee, patients who seek abortions are largely traveling to clinics in North Carolina, South Carolina and Illinois, where there are often weeks-long wait lists for an appointment. In some states, such as New Mexico, wait times are as long as four to six weeks.\nThat delay in getting an abortion has other consequences. It means a more advanced pregnancy that will cost more to terminate.
