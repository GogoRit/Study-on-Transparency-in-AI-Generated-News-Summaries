But now, callers get just a recorded voicemail message:\n\u201cIn light of the Supreme Court decision and the uncertainty around Texas law, we are forced to pause funding at this time,\u201d the recording says. \u201cWe are working diligently with our lawyers and national partners to get through this crisis.\u201d\nAs one of two full-time staffers at the Frontera Fund, Cathy Torres has been fielding these calls for years. Now, each missed call breaks her heart a little more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you why it\u2019s still on my phone, because there\u2019s nothing I can do for them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to remove it. It\u2019s like a breakup.\u201d\nFrontera Fund is part of a coalition of abortion funds that for years have helped Texans pay for abortions, both in Texas and out of state. These small, scrappy nonprofits have seen the demand for their services grow in recent years, always in lockstep with the state Legislature\u2019s ever-tightening hold over abortion access.\nBut after last Friday\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, abortion funds\u2019 work came to a screeching halt.\nThe groups changed their outgoing voicemail messages, updated their websites and deployed social media posts, all with a similar message: Due to the uncertainty surrounding Texas abortion laws, the state\u2019s abortion funds had stopped funding abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Torres said. \u201cEven though we knew it was coming and knew what it was going to be, it\u2019s more painful than I could even tell you.\u201d\nNothing in Texas\u2019 tangled web of anti-abortion laws \u2014 including laws from before 1973 and a \u201ctrigger law\u201d passed last year \u2014 explicitly outlaws their work paying for Texans to access abortions outside the state.\nBut the laws don\u2019t specifically allow it either, and Texas\u2019 anti-abortion advocates have made it clear they\u2019re eagerly awaiting the chance to test these laws \u2014 and their criminal penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade removed the decadeslong legal protection afforded to abortion providers, leaving their fates in the hands of local elected prosecutors and their interpretation of confusing state laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith abortion soon to be entirely inaccessible in Texas, abortion funds will become a more critical resource for Texans who need help leaving the state \u2014 and a more prominent target for anti-abortion advocates trying to stop them.\nStaff at these abortion funds don\u2019t believe their assistance to patients seeking abortions outside the state is illegal, and they also aren\u2019t willing to take the risk to find out.\n\u201cWe need to keep ourselves and our communities safe,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful in so many ways, but we know that our safety comes first.\u201d\nLegal landscape\nLast week\u2019s Supreme Court decision gave Texas\u2019 Republican elected officials a victory their party has been working toward for 50 years: the chance to set their own laws banning abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose same elected officials promptly plunged the state into a chaotic morass of conflicting laws that confounded lawyers, experts and abortion advocates alike.\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling to even understand what the laws are and what this means for us because it\u2019s all written so vaguely,\u201d Torres said. \u201cAnd of course, that\u2019s on purpose.\u201d\nIn 2021, the Texas Legislature passed a \u201ctrigger law\u201d that will make performing an abortion a second-degree felony punishable by up to life in prison. That law goes into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court opinion becomes official, which will take at least another 25 days.\nHowever, Attorney General Ken Paxton said in an advisory Friday that some prosecutors may immediately pursue criminal prosecutions based on violations of Texas abortion laws predating Roe v. Wade that the Legislature never repealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough these statutes were unenforceable while Roe was on the books, they are still Texas law,\u201d Paxton wrote. \u201cUnder these pre-Roe statutes, abortion providers could be criminally liable for providing abortions starting today.\u201d\nThese pre-Roe statutes carry less significant penalties \u2014 two to five years in jail, compared to five years to life \u2014 but are much broader, penalizing not only someone who performs an abortion, but anyone who \u201cfurnished the means\u201d for one.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n Pandemonium, then silence: Inside a Texas abortion clinic after the fall of Roe \n\n\n\n\n        \n        June 25, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nFear of criminal charges under those pre-Roe statutes prompted abortion clinics to immediately stop performing abortions on Friday. Texas abortion funds also stopped paying for abortions, citing legal confusion over whether such activity would violate the statutes.\nCourts have now begun what could be a long and bitter process of sorting out which Texas laws \u2014 the old pre-Roe criminal laws, the six-week ban enforced through civil lawsuits or the looming criminal \u201ctrigger\u201d ban \u2014 will take precedent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, a Harris County district judge ruled that the pre-Roe abortion ban \u201cis repealed and may not be enforced consistent with the due process guaranteed by the Texas constitution.\u201d Some clinics involved in that legal challenge said they would immediately resume abortion procedures; Paxton said he would immediately appeal.\nThis ruling sets an important precedent for other legal challenges but applies only to the clinics named in the lawsuit and does not directly protect abortion funds. And the abortion funds are worried about something far more potentially damaging than a civil suit \u2014 a test case in criminal court.\n\u201cThe threat of felony prosecution is a real thing,\u201d said Elizabeth Myers, a partner at the law firm Thompson Coburn who represents abortion funds. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for anyone to take on the threat of criminal prosecution in order to test these theories because the harm inflicted by the criminal justice system is immediate.\u201d\nThe consensus among legal experts is that it would be difficult to win a case against an abortion fund that paid for out-of-state care. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh tried to forestall the idea of interstate charges in a concurring opinion to Friday\u2019s ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMay a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion?\u201d Kavanaugh asked. \u201cIn my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel.\u201d\nBut his opinion did not address the thornier question of paying for someone else to travel out of state to obtain an abortion, and it doesn\u2019t mean a prosecutor won\u2019t try to bring charges against an abortion fund.\n\u201cA lot of this is just fear of overzealous and rogue prosecutors in the state of Texas, which is a valid fear,\u201d said J. Alexander Lawrence, a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster LLP who has represented abortion clinics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern that some prosecutor who wants to over-read these laws will go after individuals who help women \u2026 leave the state.\u201d\nAnd legal experts say abortion funds are wise to be cautious right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPart of the difference in thinking about legal risk is a question of who you are,\u201d said Elizabeth Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cPeople who are high profile or organizations that are high profile will have concerns that enterprising anti-choice prosecutors might bring criminal charges against them.\u201d\nPrevious legal challenges\nThe advocates who run the Texas Equal Access Fund don\u2019t have to speculate about whether they will be targeted by the anti-abortion movement.\nThe North Texas abortion fund has been identified as a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d in local abortion ban ordinances and received cease-and-desist letters from an anti-abortion lawmaker. In February, it was one of two abortion funds named in a legal petition alleging that it had \u201caided and abetted\u201d in prohibited abortions.\nThrough all that, they just kept funding, confident that they could beat back any legal challenges in court. But that all changed on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard that we were gonna have to pause funding, I cried,\u201d said communications director Denise Rodriguez. \u201cBecause I knew what that impact was going to have on people, just because of how extreme these folks are trying to be when it comes to trying to stop people from accessing abortions.\u201d\nTexas\u2019 abortion funds exist because the state does not make abortion easily accessible and affordable, Rodriguez said.\n\u201cWe believe that abortion is a fundamental part of health care and that government should cover it, like all other health care,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut if the government isn\u2019t going to do it, we will do it.\u201d\nThese small nonprofit organizations rely on donations and occasional grant funding to maintain their shoestring staff, who are responsible for organizing volunteers, fundraising, advertising their services and coordinating abortions in Texas and surrounding states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLilith Fund, the oldest abortion fund in Texas, was founded in 2001, and its ranks have only grown since, helping mostly low-income Texans access abortions.\nBut now, these organizations, which are primarily led and staffed by people of color, are trying to figure out what risks they\u2019re willing to take as they balance the need to help pay for abortion care out of state and the very real threat of criminal charges that didn\u2019t exist a week ago.\n\u201cWe have talked about it and we are talking about it,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut we are also aware that we have a very racist criminal justice system [and] we can\u2019t ignore that.\u201d\nAnd anti-abortion advocates are only ramping up their efforts to criminalize abortion in the wake of Friday\u2019s ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a press release Tuesday, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life claimed they called three abortion clinics on Monday to ask whether the clinics were still providing abortions; according to audio recordings provided to The Texas Tribune, two of the clinics agreed to schedule appointments for the callers.\nAn employee affiliated with one of the clinics told the Tribune that they canceled all appointments on Friday, only taking phone calls, and remained closed until Tuesday, when they began to offer only ultrasound services, not abortion procedures. The other two clinics did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\nTexas Right to Life sent the information to the district attorneys in Harris and Dallas counties, where the clinics are located, pressing them to bring criminal charges.\nProsecutors in some Texas counties have said they don\u2019t intend to bring abortion-related charges. Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot has said he will not takes these cases, while Kim Ogg, Harris County\u2019s district attorney, told the Houston Chronicle she would decide on a case-by-case basis.\nState Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, has said he will introduce legislation that will allow prosecutors in other jurisdictions to bring abortion-related charges if the local prosecutor declines to. Cain did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\nHe has previously said he will try to target abortion funds as well as businesses that pay for their employees to leave the state to seek legal abortions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no federal constitutional right to pay for a woman to leave the state to kill a baby,\u201d Cain wrote on Twitter on Monday.\nOther states\u00a0\nSince Texas banned abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy last September, abortion funds have seen the demand for their services grow exponentially.\nThey\u2019ve helped Texans get abortions in Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico and states even farther afield. In 2021, the Texas Equal Access Fund alone served 1,400 clients who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford an abortion.\nBut still, the cases that stick with them, fund staff say, are those that they weren\u2019t able to help: clients who couldn\u2019t get the time off of work, couldn\u2019t find someone to watch their kids or couldn\u2019t leave the state due to their immigration status.\nAdd to the list all those clients that they\u2019re currently not able to serve while the new legal battles play out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be optimistic right now,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut I think that abortion funds are scrappy. We\u2019ve been able to handle a lot up to now, and we\u2019re lucky to have a strong network across the country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Middleton, president of Cobalt, a reproductive rights organization that runs the Cobalt Colorado fund, said she believes her organization can provide assistance to Texans and others in states with restrictive abortion laws to come to Colorado for abortions.\n\u201cEveryone is still unclear about the law and how it impacts people outside of Texas,\u201d she said, but \u201cit\u2019s our belief that we will fund anyone who needs care from anywhere.\u201d\nAfter Texas banned abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, Cobalt Colorado provided assistance directly to Texans who needed to leave the state.\n\u201cWe will continue to provide support to anyone in Texas who is looking for help,\u201d she said.\nJoan Lamunyon Sanford, executive director of New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, which runs an abortion fund in New Mexico, said the organization likely would begin providing transportation from Texas to New Mexico, rather than helping Texas patients once they arrive.\n\u201cWe recognize that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to do,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Texas abortion funds are trying to find other ways to help. They\u2019re energized by the sudden attention on abortion rights and are trying to mobilize that protest energy into meaningful political advocacy.\nAnd they\u2019re awaiting the day when they get the green light from their lawyers to start funding abortions again.\n\u201cI would do anything, anything to be able to fund more abortions, even just for a couple more weeks,\u201d Frontera Fund\u2019s Torres said.\nBut it\u2019s unclear when that will happen and what it would take to give these funds confidence that they\u2019re not going to face legal liability for their work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple question,\u201d said Seth Chandler, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center. \u201cThe activism over abortion and the end of Roe v. Wade has thrown us into a new legal terrain where we don\u2019t have a lot of landmarks.\u201d \nReporter Jolie McCullough contributed to this story. \nDisclosure: University of Texas at Austin and University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
