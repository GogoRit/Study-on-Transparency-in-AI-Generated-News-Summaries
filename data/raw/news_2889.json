It contains graphic descriptions that sensitive readers may find offensive.\u00a0\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Pro-life advocates continue to call for an investigation into the deaths of five aborted babies whose bodies were recently obtained by pro-life activists Lauren Handy and Terrisa Bukovinac.\u00a0\nThe women, who are with the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising (PAUU) group, say that a Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services driver gave them one box, containing the remains of 115 aborted babies, which he alleged came from the waste left outside the Washington Surgi-Clinic in the District of Columbia. Dr. Cesare Santangelo, a known late-term abortionist, appears to be the only doctor licensed at the clinic. Live Action produced property records that show an LLC with his name as the owner of the facility. The activists are especially concerned because five of the babies appeared to be close to full term. The pro-lifers and some experts suspect that they may have been born alive and left to die, with one having injuries that suggest it was the victim of an illegal partial-birth abortion.\nThe activists also seek investigation into possible criminal actions undertaken by the late-term abortionist who killed the unborn children.\nIn addition to demanding an investigation from the Department of Justice, the FBI and D.C. officials into whether Santangelo is violating federal law based on the remains of these five babies, pro-lifers have pointed to past revelations about Santangelo, including a 2011 malpractice lawsuit over the death of a woman who went to his abortion business and his admission on camera from a 2012 Live Action investigation that he would leave a baby born alive to die.\n\u00a0\nThe Live Action Investigation\nHandy told the Register that one of the \u201cmotivating factors\u201d for her to join the pro-life movement full time in 2013 was \u201cseeing the Live Action undercover videos at his [Santangelo\u2019s] abortion facility.\u201d In a recorded conversation with an undercover pro-life activist who was 24-weeks pregnant in November 2012, Santangelo said when asked about the possibility of the baby surviving, \u201cI cut the umbilical cord first, wait for the baby to expire, and then we do it that way. ... Hopefully the fetus will expire first; then we do the pregnancy termination that way.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen pressed about what would happen if the baby was born alive, Santangelo told the investigator that \u201clegally we would be obligated to help it to survive. But you know it probably wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s all in how vigorously you do things to help a fetus survive at this point.\u201d The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, passed in 2002, clarifies that infants born alive after abortion are \u201cpersons\u201d under federal law, thus requiring lifesaving care.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went on to say that if the woman \u201cdelivered before we got to the termination part of the procedure here, then we would do things \u2014 we would \u2014 we would not help it. We wouldn\u2019t intubate, let\u2019s say.\u201d He even contrasted their approach with a hospital\u2019s, saying, \u201cIf you were in a hospital in Virginia, let\u2019s say, and you went into labor, and you went to the hospital, and then they saw you deliver, they would do everything possible to help that fetus survive.\u201d\u00a0\nHe continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients that on the second day of the laminaria, they got some contractions and they panicked, and they were in Virginia at the hospital, and they went to the hospital because they had some pain. Instead of calling me, you know, and just went to the hospital and the hospital helped them to deliver, which was the stupidest thing they could have done.\u201d\u00a0\nLila Rose, president and founder of Live Action, told the Register that it has been nearly a decade since that video and that investigative work was done, and \u201cwe know that these abortionists are operating in our communities, and there is little to no enforcement of existing laws.\u201d\nShortly after the release of the video in 2013, Santangelo told The Washington Post that he stood by what he said in the recording, adding that he would call 911. \u201cWhat I said is, basically, I wouldn\u2019t do anything extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would call EMS. We would call 911. But I wouldn\u2019t do intubation or anything. ... You let nature take its course.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMalpractice Lawsuit and Complaints\u00a0\nIn addition to Santangelo\u2019s statement that he would \u201clet nature take its course\u201d for babies born alive in his facility, which advertises abortions \u201cup to 27-plus weeks of pregnancy,\u201d there was a malpractice lawsuit that alleged that, in 2010, a patient he treated died because he, among other things, failed to call 911 in a timely manner.\nHandy told the Register that she found records while working with Operation Rescue in 2018 revealing that Santangelo faced a wrongful-death lawsuit from the family of Rebecca Carey Charland, who died following a dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedure to remove the body of her unborn child after a miscarriage in her second trimester.\u00a0\nIn the documents from the case, which appears to have been settled out of court in 2012, Charland\u2019s family argued that Santangelo failed to advise her that, \u201cgiven her medical history, including antiphospholipid syndrome, use of Lovenex and aspirin, and the fetal demise had occurred 2+ weeks prior, that it would be safer for her to undergo the procedure in a hospital setting.\u201d The lawsuit noted that Santangelo \u201cdid not have any hospital privileges and could not perform the D&E in a hospital setting.\u201d According to the document, Santangelo \u201cfailed to perform appropriate resuscitation efforts\u201d and \u201cfailed to timely call 911.\u201d\u00a0\nHandy said that knowing about Charland\u2019s death was part of what made her decide to do a \u201crescue\u201d on Oct. 22, 2020, where she and eight other pro-life activists blocked access to the Washington Surgi-Clinic. As a result of that action, on March 30, they were indicted on federal civil-rights conspiracy and Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act offenses for allegedly \u201cusing a physical obstruction to injure, intimidate and interfere with the clinic\u2019s employees and a patient, because they were providing or obtaining reproductive health services.\u201d She faces up to 11 years in prison if convicted.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to a 2018 Freedom of Information Act request from Operation Rescue, a D.C. Department of Health review revealed a 2013 complaint against Santangelo from a department head at George Washington Hospital of \u201cbad outcomes related to abortions.\u201d The peer review concluded that \u201chis complication rate is lower than standard\u201d and said he was \u201cthe \u2018go-to\u2019 referral for these kind of high-risk cases.\u201d It did recommend, however, that he \u201cconsider conducting terminations with ultrasound guidance to reduce risk of uterine perforation\u201d and \u201censure that pre-consent and consent-to-surgery forms are uniform and do not have any differences, thereby preventing miscommunication.\u201d\u00a0\nThe peer review also assessed and took no action on a 2010 complaint from a hospital in Spotsylvania, Virginia, of a \u201cbotched abortion.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPartial-Birth Abortion?\nBukovinac told the Register that when she and Handy went to the Washington Surgi-Clinic on March 25, they saw the Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services truck, and she told the driver that there were \u201cdead babies\u201d in the box. After Handy said they would ensure \u201cthey get a burial and a funeral,\u201d she said the driver gave them the box. Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services denies transporting fetal remains and has no explanation for the box with their labels containing the remains.\nThey opened the box at Handy\u2019s apartment and found the remains of 110 first trimester babies and later arranged a funeral Mass and burial for them. Bukovinac said they opened a larger container and found the remains of a \u201cbeautiful baby boy\u201d who \u201clooked like a literal, full-term baby.\u201d \u00a0She remarked, \u201cWe really thought we were prepared for this, but it was just the worst thing we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Rose said that in the case of the little boy, \u201cbased on testimony we\u2019ve heard from other later abortion clinics, I think it is certainly a strong possibility that this little boy was born alive and was dumped in a bucket of some sort of solution where they would store his body, and basically he was drowned.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Action released images of the baby boy and some of the other four, nearly-full-term babies found in the box. One \u201cpro-choice\u201d OB-GYN, Dr. Forrest Smith, who says he has performed more than 50,000 abortions, told Live Action that the remains of a baby girl whose skull appeared to be crushed could be the victim of a partial-birth abortion.\u00a0\nPro-life Dr. Kathi Aultman, a board-certified OB-GYN who performed abortions prior to becoming pro-life, told Live Action that \u201cthere appears to be an incision at the base of the skull, and the head has been decompressed by removing the brain. This is consistent with an Intact D&E [dilation and evacuation] or D&X [dilation and extraction]. If the baby was alive at the start of this procedure, it would be considered a partial-birth abortion and would be illegal.\u201d\nThe 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Act prohibits \u201cany physician or other individual from knowingly performing a partial-birth abortion, except when necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.\u201d A \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d is \u201can abortion in which the person performing the abortion: 1) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the mother\u2019s body, or, in the case of a breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the mother\u2019s body; and 2) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.\u201d\nBukovinac described two of the babies, a boy and a girl, who \u201cwere also very late term, but had been just brutally dismembered.\u201d She couldn\u2019t \u201cimagine the strength needed to rip up fully formed bones, especially if it\u2019s true that Santangelo is not using Digoxin, then these babies were definitely big enough to fight back.\u201d Digoxin is a feticide used to ensure the demise of an unborn baby prior to an abortion.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRose commented that \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that Santangelo used feticide; in fact, he has said that they don\u2019t use feticide when we\u2019ve had some investigative work on him done, and so that means these children were likely torn limb from torso while they were alive.\u201d\nThe final baby they found \u201cwas completely in the amniotic sac,\u201d Bukovinac said. \u201cYou can see this beautiful foot and head \u2014 and clearly very late term.\u201d Rose said, for this baby, he or she \u201cwas likely born alive because if he doesn\u2019t use the feticide, that child would have just been born alive, and then he would have left him or her to die.\u201d\nAnother reason there are concerns about the children being born alive, Handy said, is that, \u201coftentimes, the abortionist will cut the umbilical cord, and then the child will die that way,\u201d but she \u201cheld each of those children, and there were no interruptions with the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord was attached to the child and attached to the placenta.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Late-Term Abortionists\nRose said Santangelo\u2019s case is \u201cvery much like what happened in Philadelphia with Kermit Gosnell for three decades. He killed a woman. He operated by committing infanticide, killing nearly full-term infants, just like Santangelo, and he got away with it for three decades.\u201d\u00a0\nNurse Julie Wilkinson, a pro-life advocate who worked for late-term abortionist Warren Hern in Colorado in the 1980s, told the Register that sometimes he would \u201cdeliver the baby intact, but most times he would end up dismembering and, for their sakes, one hopes that they would die before that happened,\u201d but she said there were times when the baby didn\u2019t die before that, and she knew because one of her jobs at the facility was to \u201clisten for fetal heart tones if they were still alive.\u201d\nWilkinson expressed surprise that the bodies in D.C. had been obtained by pro-lifers, saying Hern was \u201cvery paranoid even then about body parts, and he was extremely careful about where things went, not because he cared about the babies, because he didn\u2019t want somebody finding it.\u201d Hern, 83, still performs abortions in Boulder, Colorado. Wilkinson said that, like many late-term abortionists, he had some disturbing beliefs, pointing to his 2018 paper \u201cWhy Are There So Many of Us?\u201d where he wrote, \u201cthe human species is an example of a malignant ecotumor, an uncontrolled proliferation of a single species that threatens the existence of other species\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe human population is a planetary cancer.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to the images of the babies who died at the D.C. abortion facility, Wilkinson said that while people may find them disturbing, for some people, \u201cuntil they see the picture, they don\u2019t really believe it. This has been going on for a long time, and so if this is what it took to get people to wake up, then that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \nabortion\nhuman remains\nlive action\nlila rose\nlauretta brown\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-Lifers Press Case Against Calif.
