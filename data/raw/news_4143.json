At one point, her colleague was given a real baby to hold. \u201cShe was in the hands of pros,\u201d Wepukhulu said.\nWepukhulu knows this playbook well. She experienced it herself when she attended a different crisis pregnancy center, also posing as a young pregnant woman. She too was handed a baby to hold, though that time it was a silicon doll.\n\u201cI bawled inside the counselor\u2019s room because it was just so strong\u2026 the way she moralized these things,\u201d she said.\nWepukhulu, a feminist, atheist, and sexual and reproductive health activist as well as a journalist, is no easy target for this kind of messaging. But she says the centers \u2013 which do not just oppose abortion, a procedure that is largely illegal in Uganda anyway, but also discourage women and girls from using contraception \u2013 use highly sophisticated tactics to break a young woman\u2019s resolve.\nThose tactics can be traced all the way back to a US Christian charity that exports its anti-abortion messaging worldwide.\nUncovering a Global Network\nWepukhulu was one of a team of undercover journalists at openDemocracy \u2013 an independent, nonprofit news website \u2013 who went into crisis pregnancy centers in 18 countries to find out more about how they treated women with unwanted pregnancies.\nEditors of the Tracking the Backlash project, which follows efforts to scale back women\u2019s and LGBTIQ rights worldwide, assembled the team from its global network of staff journalists and freelancers.\nAll of the reporters presented at the centers as a similar character: a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who did not know much about abortion.\nTheir team found a global network of misinformation on abortion that stretches from Mexico to Ukraine, Ecuador to South Africa, according to the project. All of the centers openDemocracy investigated are affiliated with a US-based anti-abortion organization.\nThe team at openDemocracy, which is funded through philanthropic foundations, editorial partnerships, and reader donations, calls it the \u201clargest ever international journalistic investigation into reproductive rights issues\u201d \u2013 carried out by a global team of female investigative reporters.\nAll of the reporters presented at the centers as a similar character: a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who did not know much about abortion. Certain journalists tweaked this profile to better fit their local context. In Ukraine, Tetiana Kozak rang a crisis pregnancy center posing as a young woman who had been internally displaced by the conflict in the country\u2019s east. She said she had been raped.\nKozak reported being told, incorrectly, that abortion increased the risk of cancer and that she would \u201cnever be the same\u201d if she terminated her pregnancy. Reporters heard remarkably similar misinformation in many other countries.\nOne reporter took the organization\u2019s online training course to work in a crisis pregnancy center. She reports being trained to provide the same misinformation to women seeking abortions \u2013 and says she was told at one point that terminating a pregnancy could lead a woman\u2019s partner to \u201cexperience homosexuality.\u201d\nFollowing the Money\n\nThe project began as a follow-the-money exercise during the 2019 European elections, according to Claire Provost, editor of Tracking the Backlash and the site\u2019s 50.50 vertical, which covers gender and sexuality topics. It was then that millions of dollars from right-wing Christian organizations in the United States flowed into Europe to fund far-right parties.\nPicking up on this investigation, the Tracking the Backlash team used ProPublica\u2019s Nonprofit Explorer to analyze 10 years\u2019 worth of 990 US tax forms to identify the anti-abortion group\u2019s affiliate organizations in five countries \u2013 Italy, Ukraine, Spain, Mexico, and Croatia.\nReporters then got in contact with centers in those countries, either by phone or in person, posing as young women seeking help with unwanted pregnancies. This is when the claims of abortion causing cancer, the dangers of \u201cpost-abortion syndrome,\u201d and other types of misinformation first became apparent, they report.\nProvost says the undercover aspect of the project was vital to replicate the experience many women have when faced with an unwanted pregnancy, which inevitably starts by turning to Google. Many of the centers, particularly in Latin America, advertise online as pro-choice groups or even abortion providers \u2013 one center in Costa Rica used the URL iwanttogetanabortioncr.com. This means a woman who researches her options could easily end up at one of the US group\u2019s affiliated centers.\n\u201cWe wanted to know what a woman would be told if she followed that very natural path,\u201d Provost said.\nThe investigation was due to stop after five countries, says Nandini Archer, assistant editor at 50.50, who worked on developing and implementing the methodology. But when they began to collate the results and saw the same pattern emerging across such different countries, they realized they should scale up into Africa and further into Latin America and Europe to see if the misinformation scaled too. It did.\nCoordinating reporters in multiple languages across 18 countries was a formidable task. To guarantee consistency in reporting in each country, and to be able to demonstrate consistency in findings, editors created a form where reporters could enter the responses they were given at the crisis pregnancy centers.\nEach reporter had a dedicated point person among openDemocracy\u2019s staff with whom they could check in during reporting to discuss findings and assess safety. All of the reporters were given briefing documents containing groundwork for the investigation and some attended webinars with sexual and reproductive health experts who explained how crisis pregnancy centers operated.\nBefore the undercover work, there was a desk research component of the reporting which covered how the centers portrayed themselves online, how they reached women with unwanted pregnancies, and what the local laws were around false advertising and health misinformation.\nAfter visiting the centers, the reporters\u2019 responses in the forms allowed editors to input responses into a spreadsheet and follow the patterns of misinformation across all 18 countries, tracking where women were told that abortion could cause cancer, where they were told they needed a partner\u2019s permission to end a pregnancy, and so on.\nAs well as these more common claims, other, more bizarre, advice popped up in multiple locations. \u201cIn Uganda and South Africa, reporters say they were told \u2018You could be killing the future president by having an abortion,\u2019\u201d Archer said.\nA clinic in Uganda, where reporters were told that by going through with an abortion they could be killing the future president. Courtesy: openDemocracy\nIn response to the investigation, the US-based anti-abortion group told openDemocracy it stood by its training resources for crisis pregnancy centers. \u201cDifferent countries have their cultures and varied ways of communicating, the fact remains that abortion carries risks to women,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nA Global Impact\nAfter validating the responses with recordings from inside the centers, they compiled the results into a series of stories that appeared not just on openDemocracy\u2019s site, but also via media partners in the countries where the reporting was carried out, including the Daily Maverick in South Africa and El Diario in Spain.\nGovernment response in some quarters has been swift, with officials in Ecuador, Costa Rica, Uganda, and Europe expressing concern about the findings. In Uganda, the reproductive health commissioner condemned the activities at the crisis pregnancy centers uncovered by Wepukhulu and her colleagues.\nWepukhulu says she\u2019s hopeful their work will demonstrate the problems with an abstinence-based approach to sexual health. \u201cWe want to have teenage pregnancy rates like those in Scandinavian countries, but we are applying the same methods that the Bible Belt in the US is applying, and the results speak for themselves,\u201d she said.\nAuthorities in Ecuador and Costa Rica have said they will investigate openDemocracy\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, members of the European Parliament have demanded the European Commission take action against the centers \u2013 but progress on this front has been slowed by the coronavirus pandemic that swept many countries shortly after the investigation was released.\n\u201cWe want to have teenage pregnancy rates like those in Scandinavian countries, but we are applying the same methods that the Bible Belt in the US is applying, and the results speak for themselves.\u201d \u2014 Investigative journalist Khatondi Soita Wepukhulu\nStill, Provost says there are parallels between what they uncovered and the current responses to COVID-19 in many countries.\n\u201cAt its heart, this was an investigation into health-related misinformation, which is a massive topic of concern right now,\u201d she said.\nA Feminist Investigation\nThe openDemocracy project is unusual in that it is explicitly billed as a \u201cfeminist investigation,\u201d carried out by women at every level from on-the-ground reporting to planning, coordination, and packaging their findings.\n\u201cWomen were leading it, women were carrying it out, and women\u2019s rights were at the forefront of this,\u201d Archer said.\nLike a climate change investigation that does not promote false balance between scientists and climate deniers, Provost and Archer say running a feminist investigation meant that they did not need to interrogate whether terminating a pregnancy was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d: women\u2019s right to bodily autonomy was taken as a given.\n\u201cA key premise of our project is that women\u2019s and LGBT rights are human rights,\u201d Provost said. \u201cWe investigate these issues not as political footballs \u2013 though we do investigate their politicization \u2013 but we treat them as rights.\u201d\n\u201cWomen were leading it, women were carrying it out, and women\u2019s rights were at the forefront of this.\u201d \u2014 Nandini Archer, editor\nAnd while Provost says the team is proud of their investigation and what it revealed about how US anti-abortion groups are affecting women\u2019s lives around the world in a coordinated manner, she doesn\u2019t think they should have had to do it in the first place.\n\u201cSomeone should have done this before us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis topic was crying out for a cross-border investigation, and if women\u2019s rights had been seen as human rights, treated seriously by more investigative teams, and been on more investigative agendas, this story would have been done already.\u201d\n\nMegan Clement is a journalist and editor specializing in gender, human rights, international development, and social policy.

It did.</p><p>Coordinating reporters in multiple languages across 18 countries was a formidable task. To guarantee consistency in reporting in each country, and to be able to demonstrate consistency in findings, editors created a form where reporters could enter the responses they were given at the crisis pregnancy centers.</p><p>Each reporter had a dedicated point person among openDemocracy&rsquo;s staff with whom they could check in during reporting to discuss findings and assess safety. All of the reporters were given briefing documents containing groundwork for the investigation and some attended webinars with sexual and reproductive health experts who explained how crisis pregnancy centers operated.</p><p>Before the undercover work, there was a desk research component of the reporting which covered how the centers portrayed themselves online, how they reached women with unwanted pregnancies, and what the local laws were around false advertising and health misinformation.</p><p>After visiting the centers, the reporters&rsquo; responses in the forms allowed editors to input responses into a spreadsheet and follow the patterns of misinformation across all 18 countries, tracking where women were told that abortion could cause cancer, where they were told they needed a partner&rsquo;s permission to end a pregnancy, and so on.</p><p>As well as these more common claims, other, more bizarre, advice popped up in multiple locations. &ldquo;In Uganda and South Africa, reporters say they were told &lsquo;You could be killing the future president by having an abortion,&rsquo;&rdquo; Archer said.</p><p>In response to the investigation, the US-based anti-abortion group told openDemocracy it stood by its training resources for crisis pregnancy centers. &ldquo;Different countries have their cultures and varied ways of communicating, the fact remains that abortion carries risks to women,&rdquo; a spokesperson said.</p><h4><strong>A Global Impact</strong></h4><p>After validating the responses with recordings from inside the centers, they compiled the results into a series of stories that appeared not just on <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/global-anti-abortion-misinformation/\">openDemocracy&rsquo;s site</a>, but also via media partners in the countries where the reporting was carried out, including the <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-02-11-government-vows-to-act-against-us-linked-anti-abortion-clinics/\">Daily Maverick</a> in South Africa and <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/centros-antiabortistas-ofrecen-informacion-embarazadas_0_994250989.html\">El Diario</a> in Spain.</p><p>Government response in some quarters has been swift, with officials in Ecuador, Costa Rica, Uganda, and Europe expressing concern about the findings. In Uganda, the reproductive health commissioner <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/top-ugandan-health-official-condemns-us-linked-crisis-centres-for-opposing-contraception-for-pregnant-teens/\">condemned</a> the activities at the crisis pregnancy centers uncovered by Wepukhulu and her colleagues.</p><p>Wepukhulu says she&rsquo;s hopeful their work will demonstrate the problems with an abstinence-based approach to sexual health. &ldquo;We want to have teenage pregnancy rates like those in Scandinavian countries, but we are applying the same methods that the Bible Belt in the US is applying, and the results speak for themselves,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Authorities in Ecuador and Costa Rica have said they will <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/ecuador-and-costa-rica-promise-to-probe-us-backed-crisis-pregnancy-centres/\">investigate</a> openDemocracy&rsquo;s findings. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/european-lawmakers-demand-action-anti-abortion-misinformation/\">members of the European Parliament have demanded</a> the European Commission take action against the centers &ndash; but progress on this front has been slowed by the coronavirus pandemic that swept many countries shortly after the investigation was released.</p><aside class=\"module align-right half type-pull-quote\">&ldquo;We want to have teenage pregnancy rates like those in Scandinavian countries, but we are applying the same methods that the Bible Belt in the US is applying, and the results speak for themselves.\" -- Investigative journalist Khatondi Soita Wepukhulu</aside><p>Still, Provost says there are parallels between what they uncovered and the current responses to COVID-19 in many countries.</p><p>&ldquo;At its heart, this was an investigation into health-related misinformation, which is a massive topic of concern right now,&rdquo; she said.</p><h4><strong>A Feminist Investigation</strong></h4><p>The openDemocracy project is unusual in that it is explicitly billed as a &ldquo;feminist investigation,&rdquo; carried out by women at every level from on-the-ground reporting to planning, coordination, and packaging their findings.</p><p>&ldquo;Women were leading it, women were carrying it out, and women's rights were at the forefront of this,&rdquo; Archer said.</p><p>Like a climate change investigation that does not promote false balance between scientists and climate deniers, Provost and Archer say running a feminist investigation meant that they did not need to interrogate whether terminating a pregnancy was &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;: women&rsquo;s right to bodily autonomy was taken as a given.</p><p>&ldquo;A key premise of our project is that women's and LGBT rights are human rights,&rdquo; Provost said. &ldquo;We investigate these issues not as political footballs &ndash; though we do investigate their politicization &ndash; but we treat them as rights.&rdquo;</p><aside class=\"module align-right half type-pull-quote\">&ldquo;Women were leading it, women were carrying it out, and women's rights were at the forefront of this.\" -- Nandini Archer, editor</aside><p>And while Provost says the team is proud of their investigation and what it revealed about how US anti-abortion groups are affecting women&rsquo;s lives around the world in a coordinated manner, she doesn&rsquo;t think they should have had to do it in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone should have done this before us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This topic was crying out for a cross-border investigation, and if women&rsquo;s rights had been seen as human rights, treated seriously by more investigative teams, and been on more investigative agendas, this story would have been done already.&rdquo;</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/megan-clement-e1572966866703.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-187479 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/megan-clement-e1572966866703-140x140.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\"></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/megclement\"><strong><em>Megan Clement</em></strong></a><em> is a journalist and editor specializing in gender, human rights, international development, and social policy.
