Eric Gay/The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\u00a0Stateline\u00a0coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions.\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A lawsuit in Texas asserting that the state\u2019s abortion ban imperils women by dissuading doctors from ending dangerous pregnancies could provide a template for similar challenges across the country.\nTexas is one of 14 states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The Texas ban includes an exception that allows physicians to end a pregnancy if it could result in the death of the woman or a \u201csubstantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\nBut the plaintiffs in the case, more than a dozen Texas women, argue that doctors and hospitals denied them necessary care because the providers were afraid to run afoul of the law. Those who violate the ban could face up to 99 years in prison, a $100,000 fine and loss of their medical license.\nEven before the Texas case was filed in March, the same issues were surfacing in other abortion-ban states, generating national attention and intense interest among elected officials in Washington, D.C. Attorneys for the Texas plaintiffs predict that similar suits will be filed in other states.\nNicolas Kabat, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, the New York-based advocacy group that filed the Texas suit, said \u201cthe problem is widespread across states that ban abortion.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re being contacted by dozens of women telling us similar stories,\u201d Kabat told Stateline, saying \u201cwe\u2019re really only scratching the surface here.\u201d\nPositive polling, past successes don\u2019t guarantee victory for abortion rights at the ballot box\n\nCiting press accounts, the plaintiffs\u2019 petition points to about two dozen women in 11 states outside Texas who have had experiences like those of the Texas women: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important lawsuit and it has implications not only in Texas but in other states that have denied people the right to safe abortion health care,\u201d said former Texas Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis,\u00a0a senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes\u00a0who gained national attention a decade ago for her filibuster against a polarizing anti-abortion rights bill.\nAttorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights are asking Travis County District Judge Jessica Mangrum to grant a temporary injunction and craft a new exception to Texas\u2019 abortion ban that gives physicians and hospitals more latitude to provide pregnancy care and perform abortions.\nBut lawyers for the Texas attorney general\u2019s office, representing the state, depict the suit as a \u201cbald attempt\u201d to usurp state authority over abortion policy.\nMangrum, elected as a Democrat,\u00a0presided over two days of arguments and testimony in mid-July.\u00a0She told lawyers at the end of the hearing that it will likely be several weeks before she returns a ruling.\nFirst State Law to Criminalize Abortion \u2018Trafficking\u2019 May Inspire Others\n\nAt last month\u2019s hearing, the plaintiffs recounted their anguishing personal ordeals after they were refused abortions. Amanda Zurawski of Austin, the lead plaintiff, nearly died after she was refused an abortion after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy.\nZurawski and her husband, Josh, had already picked the name for their unborn daughter \u2014 Willow \u2014 and were planning a baby shower when they received the devastating news that they would lose their first child before birth.\u00a0Amanda, 36, was diagnosed with a weakening of cervical tissue and told that Willow would not survive. But doctors initially refused to perform an abortion, she said, because they could detect fetal cardiac activity.\nSeveral days later, she developed sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection, and spent three days in intensive care, struggling to survive.\nZurawski told Stateline in a phone interview that \u201chundreds\u201d of people have reached out to her via social media to share similar stories and offer support. After the hearing last month, Zurawski said, she heard from \u201ctons and tons and tons of people \u2026 just an outpouring of support, people wanting to get involved, wanting to help.\u201d\nOther plaintiffs told similarly harrowing stories at the hearing. Taylor Edwards, also from Austin, said she learned when she was 17 weeks pregnant that her daughter had a fatal condition called encephalocele, a protrusion of the brain through an opening in the skull, and would die at or before birth. She had to leave Texas to get an abortion.\nLauren Hall, who lives near Dallas, discovered that her unborn child had anencephaly, a serious birth defect that prevents the fetus from developing parts of the brain and skull. Hall\u2019s obstetrician refused to perform an abortion and was afraid to refer her to an abortion provider in another state. Hall eventually got an abortion at a clinic near Seattle.\nStudies conducted by abortion rights university research groups suggest that abortion bans are dissuading doctors in many states from providing care they would otherwise provide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly important lawsuit and it has implications not only in Texas but in other states that have denied people the right to safe abortion health care.\n\n\n\u2013 Former Texas Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis\n\n\nA total of 50 anonymous surveys from health care providers in states with abortion restrictions detailed\u00a0\u201ccases of care that deviated from the usual standard due to new laws restricting abortion,\u201d according to a study jointly conducted by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas\u00a0at Austin and Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\u201cIn several cases, patients experienced preventable complications \u2026 because clinicians reported their \u2018hands were tied,\u2019 making it impossible for them to provide treatment sooner,\u201d according to the study.\nBut anti-abortion rights advocates, including some physicians, dispute the contention that Texas\u2019 medical exception is too vague to give doctors the confidence to perform necessary procedures. The language of the exception, they say, clearly gives doctors the leeway to use their medical judgment and to intervene in an emergency.\nThey say they have sympathy for the plaintiffs but support the state\u2019s contention that it would be inappropriate for Mangrum or any other judge to rewrite the abortion ban exception, since that would usurp a legislative function.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to have the judiciary write the law, which is not appropriate,\u201d said Dr. Ingrid Skop, a San Antonio OB-GYN who testified for the state at last month\u2019s hearing.\u00a0\u201cThe current state law clearly allows a doctor to use his reasonable medical judgment to determine when to intervene in a medical emergency to protect a woman\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a problem with the way the law is worded,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThe problem is that the doctors have become confused, and they become frightened.\u00a0In many cases, they have not been given guidance by medical\u00a0societies\u00a0or by their hospitals, and they often have been slow in offering interventions.\u201d\nJoe Pojman, founder and executive director of the Texas Alliance for Life, one of the state\u2019s leading anti-abortion rights groups, also defended the medical exception. \u201cThe law is already clear,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cJudges are supposed to interpret the law,\u00a0not rewrite the law.\u201d\nActivists Aim for Supreme Court With Local Abortion Bans in Blue States\n\nThe suit names the state of Texas, the Texas Medical Board and Board Executive Director Stephen Brint Carlton as defendants.\u00a0Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, is also a defendant, though he is currently suspended pending a state Senate trial on impeachment charges alleging bribery and other wrongdoing.\nLawyers for the attorney general\u2019s office, who could not be reached for comment,\u00a0are asking the court to dismiss the suit. In a rebuttal petition, they accuse the plaintiffs of staging \u201csplashy news conferences and media tours\u201d to get a favorable court ruling \u201cafter failing to convince the Legislature to adopt their preferred version of the medical exception.\u201d\nA proposed court order by the plaintiffs asks the court to give physicians discretion to use \u201cgood faith judgment\u201d in providing abortion care to someone with\u00a0unsafe pregnancy complications or instances in which a fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy or live after birth.\nBut attorneys for the state say the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed exception \u201cwould, by design, swallow the rule,\u201d permitting abortions \u201cfor pregnant females with medical conditions ranging from a headache to feelings of depression.\u201d\nAmanda Zurawski said she\u2019s always supported abortion rights but that her personal experience molded her into an impassioned advocate of the right to an abortion.\u00a0She and her husband, she said,\u00a0\u201cnever wanted to be the poster family for this cause,\u201d but now they\u2019re in the fight wholeheartedly.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be at home with my newborn right now. That\u2019s the life that I was envisioning. I would rather be on maternity leave with my daughter, not having to fight this fight,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut, you know, I think it\u2019s really been empowering for me.\u00a0And it\u2019s actually been quite healing to have a cause and a purpose to put behind our loss and our grief.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLawsuit over Texas abortion ban could be a model in other states\nby David Montgomery, Stateline August 1, 2023\nLawsuit over Texas abortion ban could be a model in other states\nby David Montgomery, Stateline August 1, 2023\n Read more\u00a0Stateline\u00a0coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions.\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A lawsuit in Texas asserting that the state\u2019s abortion ban imperils women by dissuading doctors from ending dangerous pregnancies could provide a template for similar challenges across the country.\nTexas is one of 14 states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v.
