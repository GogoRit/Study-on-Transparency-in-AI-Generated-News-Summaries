(AP) \u2014 Planned Parenthood announced Thursday that it will resume offering abortions in Wisconsin next week after a judge ruled that an 1849 law that seemingly banned the procedure actually didn\u2019t apply to abortions.\nThe resumption of abortions Monday at clinics in Milwaukee and Madison comes as the lawsuit challenging the state law continues in county court. It is expected to eventually reach the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which flipped to liberal control on Aug. 1.\nREAD MORE: Texas sues Planned Parenthood for millions in Medicaid payments\nAbortion clinics across the state stopped offering abortions following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Until then, Wisconsin\u2019s decades-old statutes \u2014 interpreted to outlaw abortion in all cases except to save a mother\u2019s life \u2014 were effectively nullified by the 1973 Roe ruling providing a right to abortion nationwide.\nCurrently, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy -\u2013 with limited exceptions \u2014 in 14 states. Bans are being enforced in two more when cardiac activity can be detected, generally around six weeks into pregnancy and often before women know they\u2019re pregnant. Judges have put enforcement of restrictions on hold in at least four additional states.\nA divided federal government has ensured that there won\u2019t be a nationwide ban or legalization immediately, and most states with liberal governments have taken steps to try to protect abortion access.\nMost of Wisconsin\u2019s closest neighboring states \u2014 Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan \u2014 have maintained that abortion is generally legal up to at least 24 weeks of pregnancy. Indiana\u2019s near-total ban on abortion took effect in August. In Iowa, abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy as a court challenge continues against the state\u2019s new measure banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\nDemocrats in Wisconsin, including Gov. Tony Evers, used abortion access as a central focus of their reelection victories in 2022. State Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz, whose win in April gave liberals the majority for the first time in 15 years, ran as a supporter of abortion rights.\nEvers hailed Planned Parenthood\u2019s decision to resume abortions.\n\u201cThis is critically important news for Wisconsin women and patients across our state who, for a year now, have been unable to access the healthcare they need when and where they need it,\u201d he said in a statement.\nAbortions were available at three Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe. A spokesperson said staffing levels allow for two clinics to do so now but the organization hopes to return to its former availability.\nJulaine Appling, president of the anti-abortion group Wisconsin Family Action, called the move \u201caudacious\u201d and said the state ban remains in effect.\n\u201cNo court has ruled that it is not enforceable,\u201d Appling said. \u201cIt is still illegal in most instances for anyone to do an abortion in Wisconsin. So what the governor and Planned Parenthood are doing is promoting an illegal activity. Unfortunately, this illegal activity is life taking because it\u2019s the intentional killing of an unborn child.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Missouri Planned Parenthood sues state AG over transgender care investigation\nDemocratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit in Dane County days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, seeking to repeal the ban.\nKaul argues that the ban is too old to enforce and that a 1985 law that permits abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Three doctors later joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, saying they fear being prosecuted for performing abortions.\nDane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled in June that Wisconsin\u2019s 173-year-old abortion ban outlaws killing fetuses but doesn\u2019t apply to consensual medical abortions. Her ruling, a victory for those fighting the ban, said that the legal language in the 1849 law doesn\u2019t use the term \u201cabortion\u201d so it only prohibits attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child.\n\u201cWith the recent confirmation from the Court that there is not an enforceable abortion ban in Wisconsin, our staff can now provide the full scope of sexual and reproductive health care to anyone in Wisconsin who needs it, no matter what,\u201d Tanya Atkinson, president of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said in a statement Thursday.\nPlanned Parenthood clinics in Illinois, where abortion has remained widely available, have seen a seven-fold increase of patients from neighboring Wisconsin since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 abortion ruling, according to Planned Parenthood of Illinois.\n\u201cMore access to care benefits everyone,\u201d said PPIL president and CEO Jennifer Welch in a press release Thursday.\nAlison Dreith, director of strategic partnerships for the Midwest Access Coalition, said the organization assisted 134 people from Wisconsin last year and 81 so far this year who needed assistance accessing abortions away from their home state \u2014 trailing only Indiana among upper Midwest states.\nREAD MORE:\u2018Our act of defiance\u2019: Why Planned Parenthood is launching its 1st mobile clinic\n\u201cI\u2019m elated for what this is going to mean for people living in Wisconsin and for the abortion safety net as a whole,\u201d Dreith said.\nWisconsin Democratic Senate Minority Leader Melissa Agard echoed comments of other Democrats who praised the decision, but said \u201cwe have an awful lot of work to do here in Wisconsin to ensure that a woman\u2019s right to choose is protected and codified in perpetuity.\u201d\nAssociated Press writers Harm Venhuizen, Sara Burnett, Geoff Mulvihill, Claire Savage and Kathleen Foody contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Pro-abortion demonstrators gather at the State Capitol to mark the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that had established a right to abortion until it was overturned last year, in Madison, Wisconsin, U.S. on January 22, 2023.
