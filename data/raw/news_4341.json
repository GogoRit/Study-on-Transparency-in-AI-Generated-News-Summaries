In Trump\u2019s first week in office, he issued the policy and ordered its largest expansion ever, extending its reach to all US global health funding. Under previous Republican administrations, it was only applied to a sliver of this US funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        HRW Comment Regarding FAR Case 2018-002\n      \n\n\n\nBut these restrictions didn\u2019t apply initially to government contracts, which account for approximately forty percent of US global health spending. Now, the Trump administration is attempting to rush through last-minute regulatory changes that would extend the restrictions to contracts as well. Unlike policy set by executive order, these regulatory changes would be much more difficult for Biden to revoke. \u00a0\nHuman Rights Watch has submitted a formal comment in opposition to the new proposed regulation and detailed the ways in which the global gag rule \u2013 and the proposed expansion of its implementation \u2013 undermine human rights, including the rights to health, life, information, and freedom of expression.\nThis initiative is just one part of a broad set of Trump administration policies that have undermined and threatened sexual and reproductive rights. Under Trump, the US Department of State has stripped mention of sexual and reproductive rights, including maternal mortality, from its annual reports on human rights around the world. Last year, the US threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on sexual violence because it mentioned reproductive health services. It cut funding to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and is actively and desperately trying to gain support from other countries on a declaration against abortion.\nEnough is enough. Regardless of whether the Trump administration succeeds in this last attack on sexual and reproductive rights,\u00a0 Biden should immediately issue an executive order when he takes office to revoke the global gag rule. He should also work with Congress to pass legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule in all its forms. The Biden administration and Members of Congress should make clear through words and actions that sexual and reproductive rights are human rights and a key priority for the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUS Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nSexual and Reproductive Health Women's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Biden Should Reinstate Landmine Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nUS: President Should Set a Human Rights Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 2006\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nSwept Under the Rug\n\n\nAbuses against Domestic Workers Around the World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 19, 2001\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nHuman Rights in Saudi Arabia: A Deafening Silence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Biden Should Reinstate Landmine Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nUS: President Should Set a Human Rights Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIsrael Not Complying with World Court Order in Genocide Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
