There must be something wrong with us, the taunt goes, if the rest of the civilised world has abortion and we do not. That\u2019s the gist of it. What if, in fact, it\u2019s the other way around? I actually like to think that, for once, we got it right.\u00a0\nPerhaps we can attribute any tiny residue of compassion and respect remaining in our society to our pro-life stance. When it comes to the crunch, most of us, liberal or conservative, Nationalist or Labourite or neither, all seem to balk at the idea of abortion.\nTwo recent quasi-identical news items in Times of Malta and l-Orizzont claimed that a UK organisation, the Abortion Support Network, has had an increase in requests from Maltese women unable to travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nOne assumes that the women were referred to the organisation by a local body, but none is mentioned, perhaps because such referral is illegal? The husband of Lara Dimitrijevic is quoted, but otherwise no local feminist groups or individuals voice an opinion, so the article must simply have appeared on the desks of the newspapers in question. Dimitrijevic herself is not quoted at all.\u00a0 Perhaps she was busy.\nThe Abortion Support Network says the increase in requests from Malta was due to two factors.\u00a0\nOne was the suspension of flights, since people who planned to go away for an abortion were unable to do so. In such cases, the representative said, women become frantic and might seek an unsafe alternative.\nThe case of the Irish woman who tried to commit suicide because she was prevented from going to the UK to abort was cited by Dimitrijevic.\u00a0\nNow perhaps wealthy women in Malta will know what it\u2019s like for everyone else who can\u2019t just hop on a plane, he added.\nSo, the coronavirus, of all things, is being used to justify abortion.\u00a0\nIn addition to the suspension of flights, another ill-effect of the lockdown is that women in abusive relationships are forced to spend more time with their partners, and are more likely to have an unwanted pregnancy, and consequently want an abortion. This is presented as a given.\nSo the evil of the coronavirus and the evil of domestic violence are to be remedied, the article implies, by a third evil, the evil of abortion.\nAbortion is inherently anti-feminist, because instead of celebrating maternity it relegates it to secondary status\nThe Abortion Support Network cannot be expected to care about women trapped in abusive relationships. Presumably they get paid for their services and, for them, it stops there. Cynical, but true. What about us though?\nFor those of us who care the slightest bit about women\u2019s well-being, surely what should worry us most is the level of domestic violence in our midst.\nWhy are women still having to stay in toxic relationships, risking their lives and those of their children? How can we tolerate, even feed, this macho culture?\nI write close to the anniversary of the death of Sylvia King, a woman killed in cold blood because she defended her friend against a husband\u2019s brutality. A short paragraph announced a Mass in memory of an unsung heroine whose name speaks to me of solidarity, selflessness, love, bravery and so much more.\u00a0\nThe way she died, burnt alive in a car, is too similar for us not to think of another martyr, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who died because she told the truth about government corruption, defending not just one person but a whole nation.\nBoth deaths are a chilling reminder that some people will not tolerate women who take a stand. Many women face the stark choice \u2013 your acquiescence or your life.\nAbortion is presented as a woman\u2019s choice to do what she wants with her own body.\u00a0 Yet, a woman who is living in fear for her very existence is unlikely to have the luxury of even the most basic choices.\u00a0\nIn a situation of abuse, how freely would such a choice be made? What if she doesn\u2019t want an abortion and is forced to have one? Is that OK, because the choice is to abort?\nAnd in the unlikely event that she is able to choose freely, how could self-inflicted physical violence heal mental scars from physical violence inflicted by someone else?\u00a0\nThe damage to her integrity can only be worsened by surgical intervention that strikes at the very heart of her being, of her identity as a woman.\nI am unapologetically anti-abortion, believing it to be intrinsically wrong and against the principle of the right to life, an overriding principle superior to all other rights.\nI also believe that it is inherently anti-feminist, because instead of celebrating maternity it relegates it to secondary status. Of course, this is a minority view in most of the rest of the world but most of them don\u2019t remember a time when abortion wasn\u2019t available. How would they know?\nIf only true solidarity existed. The likes of Sylvia King are few and far between, but her heroism stands out in stark contrast with the fake compassion of the Abortion Support Network. All our intelligence and energy should be focussed on making sure that no woman should ever feel afraid in her own home.\nThe combination of our macho culture with the growing phenomena of white slavery and the exploitation of women in brothels and domestic service, now with a recession looming, is toxic.\nI urge organisations such as Women for Women to focus their good intentions and their energy on the real threats that women face.\nMary Camilleri, teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up to our free newsletters\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\nGet the best updates straight to your inbox:\n\n\n\nDaily newsletter (the day\u2019s top headlines, sent every\nmorning)\n\n\n\nFrom the editors (a curated selection of stories, sent\nevery Saturday)\n\n\nPlease select at least one mailing list.\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.
