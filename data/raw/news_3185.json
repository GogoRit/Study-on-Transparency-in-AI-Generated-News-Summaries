(photo: Courtesy photo / Jonah McKeown/CNA)\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nNews\nJanuary 19, 2022\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case which observers believe could present a significant challenge to Roe v. Wade, the court\u2019s 1973 decision which legalized abortion nationwide.\u00a0\nBut even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, abortions will almost certainly continue in the U.S. \u2014 at least in certain states.\u00a0\nWhile the nation awaits the court\u2019s ruling\u2014 which could come at any time until roughly the end of June\u2014 numerous states are taking legislative action to codify abortion rights, while other states are doing the opposite, creating a potential patchwork of abortion laws throughout the country.\nWhat are the trends? Which states are moving in a pro-life direction, and which in a pro-choice direction? The easiest way to consume this data is by way of the following map. Take a look and see where your home state falls.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMore detailed information on each state, and links to coverage by CNA and other outlets, is listed below.\u00a0\nInformation is up-to-date as of Jan. 19, 2022.\u00a0\nAlabama\nAlabama has a \u201ctrigger law\u201d that would ban almost all abortions if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, as well as a total ban passed in 2019, which is currently blocked in court.\u00a0\nA group of 23 Republican lawmakers have prefiled a bill (HB 23) that would implement a Texas-style heartbeat abortion ban, enforced by private lawsuits.\nAlaska\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alaska State Supreme Court found a \u201cright to abortion\u201d in 1997. Alaska law requires the \u201cinformed consent\u201d of a patient before they have an abortion, meaning that their doctor must discuss with them the physical and emotional risks involved in abortion before they obtain one. Both pro-life and pro-choice advocates in Alaska has discussed the possibility of asking voters in Nov. 2022 to call a constitutional convention, which only happens once every 10 years.\nArizona\nArizona has a ban on abortion that predates Roe v. Wade and is currently unenforceable. Arizona also has laws that prohibit abortions done solely because of a nonlethal genetic abnormality, such as Down syndrome. The state also prohibits race and sex-selective abortions.\nArkansas\nTrigger law, 20-week ban.\u00a0\nCalifornia\nAbortion rights enshrined in law since 1969. California has a parental consent law for minors seeking abortions on the books, but the law is permanently enjoined by court order, meaning minors in California can seek abortions without their parents\u2019 knowledge or permission. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a pair of bills Sept. 22 that relate to privacy surrounding abortion.\u00a0\nSenate Bill 245, introduced in 2022 by Sen. Lena Gonzalez (D-Long Beach), would put an end to out-of-pocket costs paid by those seeking abortions. The state already requires abortions to be covered by health insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nColorado\nNo gestational limit- voters rejected a proposed 22-week limit in 2020.\u00a0\nThe Reproductive Health Equity Act is set to be introduced in the Colorado General Assembly in 2022. Its sponsors say the act will ensure every individual has the fundamental right to choose or refuse contraception; every individual who becomes pregnant has a fundamental right to choose to continue a pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion; and a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights under the laws of Colorado.\nConnecticut\nAbortion protected under state law.\nDelaware\nAbortion protected under state law.\nFlorida\nLawmakers in Florida have introduced a 15-week abortion ban for the state, which is currently unenforceable due to Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\nThe pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List praised the effort and urged the bill\u2019s passage.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWe urge the Florida Legislature to swiftly pass and send to Governor DeSantis\u2019s desk this groundbreaking pro-life legislation that would finally end brutal late-term abortions in the Sunshine State,\u201d said Sue Liebel, SBA List State Policy Director, on Jan. 11.\u00a0\n\u201cAbortions after 15 weeks are gruesome and inhumane for unborn children and increasingly dangerous for the mother with every passing week.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to SBA, Florida has the third highest number of late term abortions among states that report them.\u00a0\nGeorgia\nHeartbeat ban. Pro-life lawmakers in Georgia are preparing to introduce legislation to prevent the abortion pill from being prescribed through telemedicine and prevent it from being delivered by mail.\nHawaii\nAbortion protected under state law.\nIdaho\nTrigger law; heartbeat law. A conservative policy group in the state has said that passing a Texas-style heartbeat ban is part of their 2022 agenda.\nIllinois\n\n\n\n\n\nRight to abortion is enshrined in state law. The state also recently repealed its requirement that parents be notified about abortions.\nIndiana\n22-week ban, abortion pill reversal notification law (blocked)\nIowa\nHeartbeat ban (unenforceable); State Supreme Court has found a \u201cright to abortion.\u201d\nKansas\nAbortion is allowed under a state Supreme Court ruling; in Aug. 2022, Kansans will vote on an amendment to the state's constitution to exclude a \u201cright to abortion\u201d and reserve the right to regulate abortion in the state to the legislature.\nKentucky\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger law, heartbeat bill. Rep. Nancy Tate, R-Brandenburg, has plans to file a bill banning the receipt of abortion pills by mail.\nLouisiana\nTrigger law, State constitution excludes right to abortion, heartbeat ban\nMaine\nAbortion protected under state law.\nMaryland\nAbortion protected under state law since 1992. Montgomery County Del. Ariana Kelly (D), a former executive director at NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland, has said that she will be introducing legislation to expand abortion access in the state.\nMassachusetts\nState Supreme Court has found a \u201cright to abortion.\u201d A bill currently in the state's Joint Committee on Public Health would force public universities to provide medication abortion services at student health centers.\nMichigan\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion advocacy groups in Michigan have launched a ballot initiative to override a state abortion ban\u2014 which is currently unenforced\u2014 by way of a constitutional amendment. The state\u2019s Catholic Conference said the effort shows the power of the abortion industry in influencing state policy.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan are two of the organizations sponsoring the ballot drive. Organizers of the ballot initiative need about 425,000 valid voter signatures to put it before the electorate in November, the AP reports.\u00a0\nMichigan is one of several states with an abortion law on the books which is currently unenforceable due to Roe v. Wade. A 1931 Michigan state law makes it a felony for anyone to provide an abortion unless \u201cnecessary to preserve the life of such woman.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMore than anything, women considering an abortion deserve support, love, and compassion. For decades, abortion has been touted as the only option, harmless and easy, yet we know this is a lie. Abortion hurts women,\u201d Rebecca Mastee, Policy Advocate for the Michigan Catholic Conference, said Jan. 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s news that some are looking to enshrine abortion in the state constitution is a sad commentary on the outsized and harmful role the abortion industry plays in our politics and our society. We look forward to standing with women through a potential statewide ballot campaign to promote a culture of life and good health for both moms and unborn children.\u201d\nMinnesota\nState Supreme Court has found a \u201cright to abortion.\u201d\nMississippi\nPre-Roe ban, Trigger law, dilation and evacuation abortion ban, heartbeat law. Mississippi's 15-week ban is currently being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMissouri\nTrigger law, Eight-week ban (currently blocked by courts).\u00a0\nHouse Bill 1854, introduced Jan. 2022, would defund Planned Parenthood.

Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, in 2022 introduced a Texas-style heartbeat ban.\nMontana\nState Supreme Court has found a \u201cright to abortion.\u201d Abortion restricted after viability; other restrictions, such as requirement that only doctors perform abortions, are enjoined by court order.\u00a0\nNebraska\nSix-week ban currently under consideration. State also has dilation and evacuation abortion ban. Six week abortion ban has been introduced.\u00a0\nNevada\nRight to abortion enshrined in state law since 1990.\u00a0\nNew Hampshire\nNew 24-week limit took effect in 2022. For this year, legislation has been introduced to repeal the state's 24-week limit and ultrasound mandate; a bill to protect the conscience rights of healthcare workers who object to abortion, sterilization, or artificial contraception; a bill to allow biological father to seek a court injunction to stop a mother having an abortion; and a heartbeat ban.\nNew Jersey\nBill S49/A6260, which was introduced Jan. 6, codifies a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to contraception, the right to terminate a pregnancy, and the right to carry a pregnancy to term.\u201d\u00a0\nA \u201cright to abortion\u201d already existed in New Jersey because of state Supreme Court rulings. Proponents of the bill say the legislation is necessary to protect abortion in the state if Roe v. Wade were overturned.\u00a0\nThe bill passed by both houses of the New Jersey state legislature the afternoon of Jan. 10 was vigorously opposed by the state\u2019s Catholic conference. Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill into law Jan. 13.\u00a0\nNew Mexico\n1969 abortion ban repealed in 2021.\nNew York\nThe 2019 Reproductive Health Act eliminated restrictions on abortion until the moment of birth in cases deemed necessary for the mother\u2019s \u201clife and health.\u201d\nNorth Carolina\n20-week ban.
