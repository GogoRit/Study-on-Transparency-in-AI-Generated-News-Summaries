Wade in an unprecedented attack on women\u2019s rights and reproductive freedom. But this fight isn\u2019t just taking place at the Supreme Court. The ACLU is prepared for this moment, and will continue fighting in courts and legislatures, in the streets, and at the ballot box \u2014 and you can join us. Here are six ways you can take action.\n\n\n\n1. Take the Pledge\n\n\nNo matter where you live, you can join the fight and support our partners fighting for abortion rights. A good place to start? Take the pledge to show your support.\n\n\n\n2. Share Your Story\n\n\nAbortion access changes lives for the better. If you have had an abortion, supported loved ones seeking an abortion, faced obstacles to accessing care, or have had other experiences related to abortion access, share your story to show why abortion is an essential right.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Share Your Abortion Story            \n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\n\n3.

Talk to Friends and Family\n\n\nAbortion is likely to come up in conversations about the news \u2014 including among friends and family over the dinner table. Check out our handy guide for quick, crucial facts on abortion to equip you when discussing this essential right.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Your Mini Guide to Discussing Abortion Rights at the Dinner Table | News & Commentary            \n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0\t\n\n\n5. Vote Like Your Rights Depend On It\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Gwen Schroeder\n\n\n\n\nAs we head into midterm elections and prepare for the 2024 national election, we must center abortion in the public debate for all elected officials and support candidates who unequivocally support abortion rights. Ask your elected officials and local candidates where they stand on reproductive rights, demand commitments to protecting abortion access, and spread the word to other voters.\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0\t\n\n\n6. Donate\n\n\nAcross the country, abortion funds are helping people access care by providing financial assistance to patients in need. You can help expand the impact by donating to an abortion fund today. \nFor more information on how to get support when seeking an abortion, check out the National Network of Abortion Funds.\nYou can also donate to help the ACLU continue fighting for reproductive freedom. Together, we will work toward a better future \u2014 one in which everyone is free to make decisions about their own lives and futures.\n\n \nHow the ACLU is Fighting Back\n\n\nIn courthouses and state legislatures across the country, the ACLU is challenging abortion restrictions and promoting abortion access in close collaboration with local providers and our partners. Our advocacy efforts have helped pass legislation protecting or expanding abortion access in states including Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Allison Shelley\n\n\n\n\nAfter years of advocacy, we won a federal lawsuit challenging a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule that required patients seeking mifepristone, a safe drug used for abortion, to pick up the pill in-person at a medical facility. The FDA has permanently repealed the in-person dispensing requirement since that victory, expanding essential access to abortion in states across the country. We\u2019ve already shown we can win, and our strategies continue to evolve along with the fight for bodily autonomy.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a brazen attack on our fundamental rights, but the ACLU will never stop defending the right to decide when and whether to have a child, and to ensure that everyone who decides to have an abortion can access the care and support they need. We\u2019ve been working for abortion access since before Roe v. Wade was decided, and we are committed to using the full force of the organization to keep up the fight for as long as it takes.\n*By texting FIGHTBACK to 826-23 you are agreeing to receive phone calls and texts (including automated recurring text messages) from the ACLU and its state affiliates at the contacts provided.
