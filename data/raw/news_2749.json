Students for Life Group Formally Labeled as \u201cHate Group\u201d is Now RecognizedKristi Hamrick - 26 Oct 2020University President Overrides Student Government label of \u201cHate Group\u201d for Students for Life Club; Says Group \u201cfully recognized student organization\u201d\nUniversity of Northern Iowa\u00a0President Mark Nook says\u00a0that denying the Pro-Life SFLA club registration on campus would have denied\u00a0\u201cthem their right to free speech and assembly guaranteed to them by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCEDAR FALLS, IA (10-26-20) \u2013\u00a0Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins applauded\u00a0the decision\u00a0released today from the University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook to allow a pro-life club on campus after student organizations blocked the effort by saying that fellow students wanted to start a \u201chate group.\u201d \u201cViewpoint discrimination is both unconstitutional and undemocratic, as the free marketplace of idea is designed to allow for citizens to share their views. For the Pro-Life Generation, a conversation on the human rights issue of our day \u2013 abortion \u2013 is demanded of all those who care about how our society has devalued life based on location. Whether in the womb, at the border, or in any city in America, preborn life matters and deserves legal protection,\u201d said Hawkins.\nEarlier this month, the\u00a0NISG (Northern Iowa Student Government)\u00a0rejected the request\u00a0for approval of a UNI Students for Life\u00a0group after a long and charged discussion in which the members attacked the views of fellow pro-life students, and this week the student body\u2019s Supreme Court joined in that effort to block the pro-life group.\nUniversity of Northern Iowa student leader Sophia Schuster has been advocating for a\u00a0Students for Life\u00a0club this school year and, with the help of Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys, appealed the NISG\u2019s decision to the school\u2019s Supreme Court this week, which ruled against the pro-life students.\n\u201cI\u00a0was\u00a0shocked by how\u00a0the student government allowed their emotions\u00a0and personal opinions to influence their decision,\u201d said Schuster when the club was denied status on campus. \u201cStudents for Life met all of requirements for being approved set forth by UNI, but they completely ignored that fact. I think they have overstepped their role and tried to use their power to silence us just because they disagree. This is a direct attack on free speech and of due process of law and an example of abandoning standards that they claim to hold.\u201d\nSchuster noted that during the hearing before the student Supreme Court, the NISG plead\u00a0guilty\u00a0to not having a legitimate case against the SFL group, however, the school\u2019s Supreme Court did not do their job of protecting \u201cminority viewpoints.\u201d Instead, they added a new rationalization for the NISG decision that was not a part of their original decision. The\u00a0student Supreme Court\u00a0rejected the appeal stating that the new group was not being formed \u201cin good faith\u201d or with \u201ca lawful purpose.\u201d\nSarah Minnich, SFLA\u2019s\u00a0Regional\u00a0Coordinator who was assisting Schuster in starting the\u00a0Students for Life\u00a0group stated, \u201cStudent government and student organizations are meant to assist students in promoting change and ideas and to shape their character as leaders. It is difficult enough to go beyond classwork and be involved in civil dialogue on campus. The decision of the NISG and the Supreme Court, demonstrates that they put their ideological affiliations above fellow students and at the cost of productive dialogue on campus. In addition, the SFL group was forming to promote the dignity of the preborn and aid pregnant and parenting students on campus which should qualify as a \u2018good faith\u2019 reason to start any club. Their decision is unacceptable and should be overturned by the university\u2019s president.\u201d\nFor more on SFLA\u2019s efforts to fight for a pro-life club at UNI, click here\u00a0and\u00a0here.\nFor interviews, e-mail Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].\n###\nStudents for Life of America\u00a0(SFLA)\u00a0is the nation\u2019s largest, pro-life, youth organization.
