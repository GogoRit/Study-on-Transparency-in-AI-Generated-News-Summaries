Sue Glick (R-LaGrange) will be the bill's author. She emphasized it will not affect access to contraception or the morning after pill, also known as Plan B.\n\r\n\t\u201cThis bill does not affect treatment of miscarriages, treatment of ectopic pregnancies,\" Glick said. \"It does not affect in vitro fertilization procedures.\u201d\n\r\n\tBut people in states with bans similar to Indiana\u2019s proposal have had trouble accessing life-saving medications and treatments that are sometimes used for abortion.\n\r\n\tSenate Democratic Leader Greg Taylor (D-Indianapolis) said this is a step back for Indiana.\n\r\n\t\u201cJust watch when people get a hold of this piece of legislation and find out that we have an outright ban on abortion in Indiana,\" Taylor said. \"It\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\r\n\tThere are no criminal penalties in the bill imposed on anyone seeking an abortion. And Bray said the only criminal penalties imposed on a doctor who performs a banned abortion are the ones in current law.\n\r\n\tThe first public hearing on the bill is Monday.\n\r\n\tRepublicans also want to couple their abortion ban with legislation that will spend more money for pregnant people, children, and parents.\n\r\n\tThe Senate's proposed measure,\u00a0SB 2 (ss), would create a new Hoosier Families First Fund and put $45 million in it.\n\r\n\tBray said that money will be used for organizations that provides services and support to pregnant Hoosiers.\n\r\n\t\u201cAccess to contraception and pregnancy planning, including the removal of barriers where we can to long acting, reversible contraception \u2013 in particular, when the new mother leaves the hospital, so she doesn\u2019t get pregnant again shortly thereafter,\u201d Bray said.\n\r\n\tBray said the money will also be used to support greater access to child care, low-income families with children under the age of 4 and support for foster and adoptive care. The bill would also increase Indiana\u2019s adoption tax credit to $10,000 per child, up from $1,000.\n\nREAD MORE: Researchers release 'Hoosier Abortion Access Study' ahead of expected passage of Indiana restrictions\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation and sign up for the Indiana Two-Way.

That measure would cost $78 million.\n\r\n\t$20 million of that would go towards tax exemptions and credits. The House GOP plan would increase the exemption amount for every child claimed as a dependent, add an additional tax exemption for every adopted child and increase, to $3,000, the state's adoption tax credit.\n\r\n\tThe House bill also eliminates the sales tax on diapers, something Democrats have long pushed for \u2013 only to be rejected repeatedly by Republicans.\n\r\n\tThe measure's additional $58 million would be directed to boost existing programs, including child care vouchers, nurse-family partnerships and the state's safety PIN grant fund, which aims to reduce infant mortality.\n\r\n\tThe House bill also expands services covered under Indiana Medicaid and Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 coverage, including donated breast milk, prenatal screenings and the costs of labor and delivery.\n\r\n\tIn a statement, House Speaker Todd Huston (R-Fishers) said his caucus shares the Senate's goals.\n\r\n\t\"Increasing protections for Indiana's unborn while also stepping up our investment in wraparound services to better support new and expectant moms, and babies,\" Huston said.\n\r\n\tHouse Democratic Floor Leader Cherrish Pryor (D-Indianapolis), however, called the abortion ban \"fundamentally cruel\" and \"not rooted in actual science.\"\n\r\n\t\"Protecting the life of the mother without guaranteeing the right to an abortion if a woman\u2019s health is in danger is not legislation that values life,\" Pryor said in a statement. \"Women should not have to wait to be on the brink of death to have access to a safe, routine health care procedure.\"\n\r\n\tThe measure appeared to align with the expectations set out\u00a0Wednesday by Indiana Right To Life, one of the state's most influential anti-abortion groups. But in a statement issued late Wednesday night by the organization, CEO Mike Fichter called the measure a \"weak and troubling bill.\" Fichter said he was particularly troubled by the legislation's lack of enforcement provisions.\n\r\n\t\"As the bill reads now, the 8,000-plus abortions that take place annually in Indiana would continue unabated in counties like Marion County where the prosecutor has\u00a0already stated\u00a0he will not enforce the law,\" Fichter said.\n\r\n\tPlanned Parenthood Alliance Advocates Indiana State Director LaKimba DeSadier said the Senate abortion ban \"confirms our greatest fears.\"\n\r\n\t\"It\u2019s time the Indiana State Legislature started listening \u2013 our futures and our lives are literally on the line,\" DeSadier said. \"We will do everything we can to stop these attacks on reproductive freedom.\"\n\r\n\tRallies by both abortion rights and anti-abortion groups are expected at the Statehouse Monday.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the statement made by Indiana Right to Life late Wednesday.\n\nContact reporter Brandon at\u00a0bsmith@ipbs.org\u00a0or follow him on Twitter at\u00a0@brandonjsmith5.\nSupport independent journalism today.
