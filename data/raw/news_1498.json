Gretchen Whitmer addresses supporters before signing legislation to repeal the 1931 abortion ban on Wednesday, April 5, 2023, in Birmingham.\n\nCarlos Osorio/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Michigan\u2019s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday signed a repeal of the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, which the Democratically controlled state legislature had passed last month. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d the Democratic governor, who campaigned on protecting abortion rights last fall, said in a statement on Twitter. \n    \n\n            The ban\u2019s repeal came a day after a major victory for abortion rights advocates in neighboring Wisconsin, where liberals won control of the state Supreme Court, which is expected to decide a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban. In the wake of last summer\u2019s US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, protecting abortion rights has proven to be a galvanizing force for Democrats and independents, which helped power the Democratic majorities that made the Michigan repeal possible.\n    \n\n            Democrats control both chambers in the Michigan legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion for the first time in four decades after last fall\u2019s midterms, when voters also voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. \n    \n\n            Michigan\u2019s state Senate majority immediately prioritized repealing the abortion ban \u2013 which prohibited the procedure even in cases of rape and incest, except to preserve the woman\u2019s life, and had remained on the state\u2019s books even after the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court ruling.\n    \n\n            The state Senate passed the repeal last month in a 20-18 vote along party lines after earlier passing the state House.\n    \n\n            \u201cFinally ending this draconian abortion ban was made possible by our Democratic victories in the state legislature last year,\u201d interim Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Heather Williams said in a statement. \u201cThis is another crystal-clear proof point that Democratic legislatures are critical for protecting and expanding abortion rights.\u201d \n    \n\n            Abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America also thanked Whitmer for signing the repeal, calling the ban a \u201cmalignant threat to the health and well-being of Michiganders.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cToday is a crucial step in the fight for freedom and abortion access for Michiganders today, tomorrow, and for generations to come,\u201d NARAL President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement.\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Shania Shelton and Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
