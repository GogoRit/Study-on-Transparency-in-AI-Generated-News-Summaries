Proposed Initiative 120 gathered enough sufficient signatures needed to be placed on the ballot. Voters will decide its future.\nDue-Date Too-Late campaign organizers submitted 137,624 signatures on March 4. They needed 124,632 valid signatures.\n\n(credit: CBS)\nThe Secretary of State's office notes an initial submission of signatures only returned 114,647 valid signatures - short of the required 124,632. After an order from a district court, the proponents were able to obtain an extension to secure additional signatures.\n\"That cure period to reach sufficiency began on May 15 and ended at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 29, at which time an additional 48,689 signatures were submitted,\" the office stated in a news release on Monday.\nIf Initiative 120 is approved, it would make performing an abortion after 22 weeks gestational age a class one misdemeanor unless a doctor determined the procedure was necessary to save the life of the mother.\n\n\nColorado is one of the only states in the country that allows abortions at any point in a pregnancy for any reason, but polls show even most pro-choice Coloradans want limits.\nLine-By-Line Verification Summary:\nTotal number of qualified signatures lines 137,624\nTotal number of entries accepted (valid) 114,647\nTotal number of entries rejected (invalid) 22,977\nTotal number of valid signatures required for placement on ballot 124,632\nCure review:\nTotal number of qualified signature lines 48,689\nTotal number of entries accepted (valid) 38,557\nTotal number of entries rejected (invalid) 10,132\nTotal number of valid signatures from original submission 114,647\nTotal number of valid signatures 153,204\nLINKS: Statement Of Insufficiency | Statement of Sufficiency\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mother sues Adams 12 School District\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Meet Leo, the law enforcement puppy building bridges with older adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Team evaluates damage to Interstate 76 bridge northeast of Denver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I-76 closed north of Denver metro area after equipment falls off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man, woman found dead in Denver hotel converted to homeless shelter\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst published on June 8, 2020 / 8:39 PM MDT\n\n\n\u00a9 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
