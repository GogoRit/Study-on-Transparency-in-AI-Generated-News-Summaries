Erica Thomas speaks during a protest against recently passed abortion ban bills at the Georgia State Capitol building, on May 21, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. The Georgia \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill would ban abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Alabama abortion law, signed by Gov. Kay Ivey last week, includes no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, outlawing all abortions except when necessary to prevent serious health problems for the woman. Though women are exempt from criminal and civil liability, the new law punishes doctors for performing an abortion, making the procedure a Class A felony punishable by up to 99 years in prison.

Christian \u00b7\nUpdated November 4, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker has had enough of male legislators telling women what they can and cannot do with their body. Last week, Congresswoman Rolanda Hollis introduced a measure that would give men an opportunity to see what it feels like.\nThe bill, sponsored by Hollis, would require that all men get a vasectomy after they turn 50, or after they have their third child, whichever one comes first.  \u201cIt always takes two to tango,\u201d Hollis told AL.com. \u201cWe can\u2019t put all the responsibility on women. Men need to be responsible also.\u201d If passed, the bill would require that men also pay for their vasectomy out-of-pocket.\nIn a tweet, Rep. Hollis said that the vasectomy bill will \u201chelp with the reproductive system,\u201d adding that it would \u201cneutralize the abortion ban bill\u201d and help prevent pregnancies as well as abortions of unwanted children. The Alabama lawmaker believes that the measure will help men and women become more accountable as it pertains to reproduction.\n\nVasectomy Bill HB 238The Vasectomy bill is to help with the reproductive system. This is to neutralize the abortion ban bill. The responsibility is not always on the women. It takes 2 to tangle. This will help prevent pregnancy as well as abortion of unwanted children. This\u2014 Rep. Rolanda Hollis (@RepHollis) February 14, 2020\n\nThough the bill has no real chance of passing in a Republican-controlled state government, it did get the attention of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. On Sunday he retweeted a story about Hollis\u2019 bill proposal and added, \u201cYikes. A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything . . . literally!\u201d\nIn 2013, Cruz urged the Senate to pass a 20-week abortion bill that would make it illegal for women to terminate a pregnancy after the first 20 weeks of gestation. He has also been an outspoken supporter for overturning Roe v. Wade.\nRolanda Hollis Twitter\nLast year the state of Alabama passed the most restrictive abortion bill in the country, giving no leniency for cases of incest or rape.\u00a0 A federal judge on blocked the near-total ban from taking effect, allowing the procedure to remain legal and available while the case makes its way through the courts.\n\n\nTOPICS:\u00a0  Abortion alabama abortion ban Alabama Abortion Law Rolanda Hollis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
