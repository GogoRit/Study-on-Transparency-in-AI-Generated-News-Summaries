Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court sent shockwaves throughout the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and on Nov. 8, voters are poised to rattle aftershocks with their ballots.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nFive states will have abortion-related questions on their ballots for the Nov. 8 General Election\n\nCalifornia, Michigan and Vermont all have constitutional amendments on the ballot to protect the right to abortion in those states\n\nKentucky has a proposed constitutional amendment to restrict the right to abortion; Montana, which has a constitutional right to abortion, has a referendum that may squeeze medical providers accused of \"intentionally letting infants die\"\n\nIn August, Kansans overwhelmingly defeated a state constitutional amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion outright\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 California, Michigan, Vermont, Kentucky and Montana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have posed the future of abortion to their constituents in the upcoming midterm election.\u00a0\nCalifornia, Michigan and Vermont have proposed constitutional amendments that would offer an affirmative right to abortion and reproductive freedom.\u00a0\nBy contrast, Kentucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s measure, if approved, would assert that there is no constitutional right to abortion in the Bluegrass State. Montana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s measure asks voters to state that infants \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn alive at any state of development\u00e2\u0080\u009d require doctors attempt lifesaving medical care \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a simple statement that all but ensures a ban on most forms of surgical abortion.\nBut it all starts with Kansas, the Republican-leaning state that shocked the nation earlier this year when voters overwhelmingly beat back a referendum aimed at opening the door to a statewide abortion ban.\nKansas: A bellwether for 'red states'?\nOn Aug. 2, Kansas became the first state to have the right to abortion up for debate on a statewide ballot since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\nAnd with an 18-point margin representing 165,000 votes, Kansans slammed a state constitutional amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion outright.\nKansas, a one-time abortion safe haven in the midwest, became the canary in the coal mine in the battle for abortion rights, when the GOP-led state legislature sought to add its anti-abortion amendment to the state constitution.\nIn Kansas, the number registered Republican voters greatly outnumber both Democratic and unaffiliated registration, indicating that the amendment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat came as a result of many coalitions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 progressive and conservative alike \u00e2\u0080\u0094 working together.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Joe Biden said in a statement soon after the election results were clear.\nThe question in the aftermath was, was their effort replicable in other states? Organizers said yes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the focus on coalition-building can be done anywhere.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a village, and by building community power, we have a path forward. But it has to come from us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d organizer Alejandro Rangel-Lopez told Spectrum News in August.\nCalifornia\nCalifornia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution already provides a right to privacy, which the state Supreme Court has ruled covers the right to reproductive choices, which includes both abortion and contraception \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a similar principle as the original U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade.\nHowever, Proposition 1 would amend California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution to explicitly state that people have the fundamental right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, and whether or not to use contraceptives.\u00a0\nIt also wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing abortion law, which states that abortion is legal until the fetus is viable to survive outside the womb, around 24 to 26 weeks, or between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.\nThe proposition is broadly expected to succeed. According to a September Public Policy Institute of California poll, 69% of likely voters support Prop. 1. But even if it failed, abortion and contraception rights would still exist under existing state laws.\nCalifornia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governor, Gavin Newsom, has bought ads in anti-abortion states to spread the idea that his state is an abortion sanctuary for people who need reproductive health care.\u00a0\nThis proposition wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rather, it would affirm that California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status as a beacon of abortion rights on the West Coast.\nMichigan\nMichigan has had four constitutions throughout its history as a state \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00a0three more than most states. The latest, which was approved and ratified by voters in 1963, charges Michiganders to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook forward\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009csafeguard present and newly emergency liberties,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than clinging to the past, wrote the Michigan state judge who ruled the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1931 ban on abortion as unconstitutional.\u00a0\nMichigan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Proposal 3 would live up to that ideal, amending the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution to establish the individual right to reproductive freedom, including the right for decisions about pregnancy and abortion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 essentially, proponents argue, it would restore rights granted to Michiganders in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\u00a0\nThe state legislature would still be allowed to regulate abortion after a fetus reaches viability \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that same 24-to-26 week stage of pregnancy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though medically-necessary abortions may not be prohibited under the amendment.\nShould the amendment fail, the future of abortion would fall onto the 1931 law that made abortion a felony in Michigan. Though the law is currently enjoined and unenforcible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and abortion was already allowed under a separate injunction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an appeal is possible.\nIn the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion, Judge Elizabeth Gleicher wrote that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 91-year-old abortion ban \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot only compels motherhood and its attendant responsibilities; it wipes away the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to make the plans she considers most beneficial for the futures of her existing or desired children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe law is facially unconstitutional because its enforcement would deprive pregnant women of their right to bodily integrity and autonomy, and the equal protection of the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gleicher later adds.\nOpponents to the proposed amendment argue that it is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical proposal\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would invalidate all previous abortion laws.\nSupporters say that the amendment is a common-sense solution that ensures women have access to necessary health care, and protects doctors from going to prison for providing medical care.\nRegardless, polls suggest that voters are likely to support the amendment. A Sept. 7 WDIV/Detroit News/Glengariff Group poll indicates that 60.3% of voters would support an amendment that would guarantee abortion rights.\nVermont\nIn 2019, the Vermont State Legislature codified an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental right to reproductive freedom, explicitly protecting the freedom to choose to use or refuse contraception, and to carry a pregnancy to term, to give birth to a child, or to have an abortion.\nOn Election Day, voters have the opportunity to take it one step further by amending the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution to state that \u00e2\u0080\u009can individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own life course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Proposal 5, if approved, would also add that the right to reproductive autonomy \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling state interest achieved by the least restrictive means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nVermont is fairly loyal to progressive politics, with a supermajority Democratic legislature, bolstered by a scattered few members of the Vermont Progressive Party in each chamber. Of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the home of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent who prominently competed for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. Polling, unsurprisingly, indicates widespread support for Proposal 5 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a WCAX/University of New Hampshire poll indicates that 75% of respondents are supportive of the amendment.\nEven Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican, has spoken in favor of the amendment in an interview with WAMC.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the end of the day, the fundamental rights and liberties of all women will be defended, protected and preserved here in Vermont,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scott said.\nKentucky\nWhile the voters of three states are considering codifying the right to abortion in their constitutions, Kentucky is going the other direction. Constitutional Amendment 2, which was referred to the ballot by the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conservative General Assembly, seeks to add one sentence to the Kentucky Constitution: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo protect human life, nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAbortion has been outlawed in Kentucky since Roe was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, courtesy of a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrigger\u00e2\u0080\u009d ban. That ban is one of the most limiting in the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 abortion is outlawed in nearly all cases, including if the fetus has developed serious birth defects, if the pregnancy was the result of rape, or if the pregnancy is detrimental to the birthing parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health. The only exception is if staying pregnant could cause the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\nEssentially, the amendment would ensure that no judicial body \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the Kentucky Supreme Court or state judges \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can interpret the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution as protecting the right to abortion.\nThe state has a slight Republican registration advantage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 1.6 million Democrats to 1.62 million Republicans as of Oct. 17, according to the State Board of Elections. However, though its politics are decidedly conservative, Project Kentucky Access (a lead opponent to the amendment) has raised more than $1.2 million as of its most recent election finance statement, and more than $2.6 million this year, spending just over $2 million. Meanwhile, Yes For Life, a PAC that stands as a chief proponent for the amendment, has raised $158,710 over the last monthly period, and $507,157 over the last year, spending about $83,000.\nHow Kentuckians vote in November might have a tremendous effect on both its residents seeking abortions and its neighbors; since Roe was overturned, abortion clinics in Ohio have seen increased traffic from nearby states, including Kentucky.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Kentucky lost their access in April, that was the first test, the pilot run, so to speak, of how services might look post-Dobbs. There was panic. There were patients very concerned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio administrator Vanessa Hinsdale told Spectrum News in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Dobbs happened, the amount of people that were yelling their frustrations of this law was at a thunderous rate that we have never experienced\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the change that we need to keep giving the states the ability to give access back to the patient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMontana\nWhile Kentucky is looking to ensure that there is no Constitutional protection for abortion, the State Legislature of Montana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which already has an adjudicated constitutional right to abortion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is taking a roundabout way to squeeze medical providers.\nThe Montana Supreme Court decided in 1999, in the opinion deciding Armstrong v. State, that abortion access is protected by the state constitution, in accordance with Montanans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 constitutional right to privacy.\nLegislative Referendum 131, which was referred to the ballot along party lines by the Montana Legislature, asks voters to agree, yes or no, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfants born alive including infants born alive after an abortion, are legal persons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding that health care providers are obligated to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake necessary actions to preserve the life of a born-alive infant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLR-131 defines a \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn-alive infant\u00e2\u0080\u009d as one who breathes, has a beating heart, or definite movement of involuntary muscles after being born or extracted from the birthing parent, as through natural or induced labor, cesarean section, induced abortion, or other methods. It also states that infants born during an attempted abortion are \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn-alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nProviders found guilty under the act would face a fine up to $50,000, 20 years of imprisonment, or both. It also includes a mandatory reporting statute, requiring a health care provider, employee or volunteer of any facility or clinic to report failed compliance with the legislation.\nA proponent of LR-131, Republican state Rep. Matt Regier, said that the bill is about \u00e2\u0080\u009cmedical providers intentionally letting infants die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOpponents of the referendum argue that the law would force health care providers to take a newborn away from their family, even in cases where required life-saving measures would be futile and painful. They argue that families want to spend time with their newborn, especially in those last minutes of life.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a 19- or 20-week delivery, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in good conscience go and do chest compressions and resuscitate a baby like that. That is cruel and unusual punishment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Lauren Wilson,\u00a0president of the Montana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics,\u00a0recently told the Flathead Beacon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctors would be in a hard place because none of us want to do that, especially over a family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objections. None of us want to go to jail, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly where this legislation is putting us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            CERTIFICATIONS\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
