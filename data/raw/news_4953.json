Wade decision\u2019s 49th anniversary, and speakers at the March for Life Utah event were hopeful the decision would be overturned by the Supreme Court before its 50th. Just months earlier, the court refused to block a Texas law that bans a majority of abortions in the state, and the justices will soon decide on a case over abortion restrictions in Missouri \u2014 which could overturn the decision.(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune)  Hundreds of anti-abortion activists rally at Pro-Life Utah's March for Life at the Utah Capitol on Saturday, in conjunction with the national March for Life in D.C., Jan. 22, 2022.<>Utah is one of more than 20 states that\u2019s passed a \u2018trigger law,\u2019 which would immediately ban virtually all elective abortions if the decision is overturned.\u201cPro-Life Utah and our allies have worked hard over the years to lay a foundation for a post-Roe country and state,\u201d said Pro-Life Utah president Mary Taylor. \u201cSo is our work complete? Unfortunately, no. In fact, we need all hands on deck more than ever now if we want to ensure an abortion-free state.\u201d(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune)   Utah legislators l-r Rep. Kera Birkeland, R-Morgan, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Riverton, Rep. Cheryl Acton, R-West Jordan, Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield and Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan were among the hundreds attending Saturday's March for Life at the Utah Capitol, in conjunction with the national March for Life in D.C., Jan. 22, 2022. \r\rTaylor hinted that Rep. Kera Birkeland, R-Morgan, would be proposing legislation to make some \u201csimple changes\u201d to \u201cprotect women and save the lives of unborn babies.\u201d She urged attendees to call their representatives and ask them to support Birkeland\u2019s legislation and said only a \u201csmall number\u201d of state legislators are willing to take on pro-life legislation.She also asked attendees to donate to Pro-Life Utah, since they anticipate an even greater need for services next year, like the organization\u2019s mobile clinic for pregnant women.\u201cEvery single child\u2019s life is invaluable \u2014 but this work is not easy, and it\u2019s not cheap,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cPlease join us to find out how you can play a role in this important work.
