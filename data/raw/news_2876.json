We open this new week on the podcast addressing one of the many questions we have not addressed directly \u2014 embryo adoption. There are several versions of the question. I\u2019ll put them all on the table, Pastor John. \nA listener named Sveta writes in. \u201cHello, Pastor John. I have a follow-up question to APJ 1165. What do you think about so-called \u2018snowflake adoptions,\u2019 in which a frozen embryo, left over from another family\u2019s IVF process, is implanted into a woman to give this child a chance at life?\u201d Laura, a listener, wants to know if there\u2019s \u201ca moral difference between adopting the orphaned-born versus adopting the orphaned-unborn?\u201d Likewise, Audrey asks if embryo adoption should be considered something that Christians value \u201cas much as after-birth adoptions?\u201d\nIn fact, several listeners have asked, in essence, Are frozen embryos as much orphans to concern the church as living, breathing orphans? And this is a very real question for one couple: \u201cHello, Pastor John. My name is Carien, from Australia. I recently read some articles about considering embryo adoption to help those babies live their God-given life with a loving family. My husband and I are considering this option. We lost our only child in 2019 and we feel ready to love a child again. But my husband is subfertile and the normal adoption process in Australia is long and expensive. But my question is, How could I be sure that adopting an embryo is what God intended for us? We want a child. But does embryo adoption allow us to \u2018play God\u2019 and choose parenthood? Maybe God made my husband subfertile for a reason. I guess I just want to make sure that this is God\u2019s will and not our will here.\n\u201cAlso, another concerning fact about embryo adoption is that the clinic transfers all the donor\u2019s embryos to the recipient. What if the donor has three frozen embryos and we can only afford to grow one baby? Then it does not help the other two frozen babies left, as one will have to decide to keep them frozen or destroy them. Maybe we are overthinking this process, but we want to do what is right in God\u2019s eyes.\u201d\nThere are so many angles from which we could come at this question. I hope the angle that I take will prove helpful in the end, even though it\u2019s somewhat indirect concerning the question of God\u2019s will for this couple\u2019s life. I assume what they are asking is not that I tell them whether to adopt a frozen child, but whether there is anything in God\u2019s word, God\u2019s revealed will, that would make such an adoption sinful.\nUpstream and Downstream\nNow, the angle I want to take is to make the observation that when we have a tragic situation, we who are Christians should feel a desire to take action to mitigate the tragedy in two ways. One way is that we should be thinking about how to get at the causes of the tragedy upstream, so to speak, from the actual tragedy, and do what we can to hinder the tragedy from becoming worse by dealing with those causes.\nThe other way we should be thinking is how to mitigate the tragedy, not just by looking upstream to its causes, but by looking at the tragedy as it is right now and downstream to its effects. We should be moved to take action so as to make the present situation and the future situation less destructive and heartbreaking than it is.\nTragedy of Frozen Children\nNow, I think the existence of 750,000 frozen children in America, and 120,000 in Australia, is a tragedy. God\u2019s revealed will in his word for the conception and pregnancy and birth and rearing of children is not that it be done in such a way that results in hundreds of thousands of eventually abandoned children. This means that, upstream from the tragedy mingled into whatever sorrowful situations may motivate in vitro fertilization \u2014 which results in so many extra conceived children outside the womb \u2014 there are sinful desires and practices. They\u2019re mingled in.\n\n\u201cI think the existence of 750,000 frozen children in America, and 120,000 in Australia, is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nNobody forced this tragedy on anyone. It\u2019s not like the result of a hurricane or a pandemic that leaves orphans. These hundreds of thousands of orphans are not owing to the death of their parents. Choices are being made that result in this heartbreaking reality of hundreds of thousands of unwanted children. Some Christians should devote energy to looking upstream and trying to reverse the causes of this tragedy.\nFor example, Germany has a law that says only three embryos can be created in one in vitro fertilization cycle, and they must all be transferred into the mother\u2019s womb. This, in effect, prevents the tragic situation of thousands of frozen children accumulating and eventually being unwanted. Some Christians should be looking upstream to work for those kinds of preventions.\nI think Jennifer Lahl, the president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture Network, is a person like that. She relentlessly tries to draw our attention to the moral problems that multiply when we take the processes of conception and pregnancy into our own hands outside the womb. For all the joy that may come for some couples, we need to be aware of the legal tangles and the personal tragedies that also result.\nAdopting with Eyes Wide Open\nSo, I think one of the first things that Carien and her husband need to come to terms with is that they are dealing with a tragic situation with some innocent and some sinful causes. It\u2019s not a neutral situation. If they move forward with adoption of one of these frozen children \u2014 and frankly, I hope they do \u2014 I think it will spare them future pangs of conscience if they do it with eyes wide open.\nSomeone will accuse them of participating in a system that is shot through with processes and procedures and priorities that are unwise and sometimes sinful. Others will point out that children created in this way will face many difficult and troubling realities as they come to know and understand their conception stories. I think Carien and her husband need to be ready, just for their own conscience, to respond to such concerns with wisdom in patience.\nThat\u2019s why I introduced the second way of approaching a tragedy like this \u2014 not just looking upstream for ways to prevent it, but looking at it for what it is and asking how we might mitigate, at least in a small way, the tragedy right in front of us. And one strategy of taking that approach is the strategy of adoption.\nI know two couples who have embraced this way of life, and I admire them for it. They are not naive, and they are moved both by their principled opposition to the destruction of these frozen children and by their loving longing to have some of these children in their own family. \nRisk Is Right\nI wrote a little book one time called Risk is Right. I didn\u2019t mean that anybody should jump off a cliff thinking an angel would catch them, but I did mean that for the sake of love, and for the glory of God, and for the peace of conscience, it is right to look all of the possible future heartache and pain in the face that may come with such an adoption, and then to act like Esther did.\nFor the sake of saving her Jewish kinsmen, she approached the king, which was illegal, and the only way she would survive this disobedience was if he graciously lifted his scepter. She asked her family and her friends to fast and pray for her, which is what we should do when we adopt children, and then she said, \u201cIf I perish, I perish\u201d (Esther 4:16). That\u2019s the kind of risk I think glorifies God.\n\n\u201cWe embrace the ambiguities of this fallen, tragic world, and we do our best to act in love.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t trying to make a name for herself. She wasn\u2019t trying to be a hero. She was trying to save people who were going to perish if she couldn\u2019t change the king\u2019s mind. And so it is with thousands of these frozen children. They\u2019re going to be disposed of sooner or later if they\u2019re not adopted. \nIt is a wonderful thing to be a Christian and to know that Christ died for our sins so that even if we are not completely sure about all our motives and all our tactical efforts to be loving, and even if we\u2019re not sure that we have all the wisdom we need, we can be sure of this: the record of our debts is nailed to the cross. With that assurance, we embrace the ambiguities of this fallen, tragic world, and we do our best to act in love.\nI do not doubt that God will guide Carien and her husband in the path of love and meet every need that they have for the next fifty years, according to his riches in glory, and according to his promise.\n\n\nJohn Piper (@JohnPiper) is founder and teacher of desiringGod.org and chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary.
