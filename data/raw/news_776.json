So she decided to push her small West Texas town a step forward.\nTo do her part, Adams began leaving free emergency contraception kits neatly packed in white plastic bags in the bathroom of her coffeehouse, Tumbleweed + Sage.\nThe kits \u2014 which retail for up to $60 \u2014 go quick, Adams said. The first 50 were gone within a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t charge people or ask questions, we don\u2019t take names, we don\u2019t even know who grabs them,\u201d Adams said.\nWith the steady flow of caffeine and Plan B available at Tumbleweed + Sage, Adams has drawn the ire of protesters from the area\u2019s anti-abortion movement to her shop. Some in this Lubbock suburb of about 5,100 have even reported her shop to the Wolfforth Police Department for giving away the emergency contraceptive pills.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n Not 1925: Texas\u2019 law banning abortion dates to before the Civil War \n\n\n\n\n        \n        Aug. 17, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nThe clash between the coffee shop owner and abortion opponents is the latest salvo in a long debate in the region.\nLast May, Lubbock became the biggest city in Texas \u2014 and the only one with an abortion provider \u2014 to ban the practice within city limits. Months later, Texas lawmakers passed a law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lubbock area was \u2014 and is \u2014 a harbinger in the debate over reproductive rights. And the new epicenter might just be Tumbleweed + Sage. With abortion outlawed in the Lone Star State, the fight in large part is turning to contraception. The fault lines are familiar: Abortion-rights activists are pushing multiple forms of contraception, including Plan B. Abortion opponents are lobbying for additional bans on the medicine.\nLubbock led the way in curtailing abortions\u00a0\u00a0\nGetting access to abortion has rarely been easy in Lubbock, and the nationwide debate has played out here in remarkable ways.\nPlanned Parenthood reopened its clinic in late 2020, after closing in 2013 due to another Texas law blocking abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The facility, which is still open and offering other services, is tucked away near a residential area at the end of the city\u2019s medical district. At its peak, it saw patients from rural areas all over West Texas, the Texas Panhandle and New Mexico.\n\u201cWe saw people from all over, which really stresses how important the service was here and how needed it is,\u201d said Angela Martinez, manager of the Lubbock clinic. \u201cThen the sanctuary city vote happened and we had to go back to offering referrals and sending people out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heated debate for Lubbock to become a \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d started as Planned Parenthood prepared to reopen its clinic.\nIn September 2020, state lawmakers representing Lubbock pushed city officials to create the measure.\nTwo months later, the City Council heard nearly six hours of public comments before unanimously voting to reject the sanctuary city ordinance. Most members of the council said that while they opposed abortion, they had concerns about the enforcement and constitutionality of the ordinance.\nThen, more than 4,500 Lubbock voters signed a petition to force a special election on the issue. Churches in the area were vocal supporters of the ordinance and encouraged their congregations to vote in support of it. \u201cVote for Life\u201d signs dotted the city on the eve of the special election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          A banner supporting a proposed city ordinance that would ban abortions inside Lubbock city limits hangs from Southcrest Baptist Church on April 27, 2021. Voters approved the measure.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the ordinance passed on May 1, 2021, by 62%, with just a quarter of registered voters \u2014 34,260 \u2014 participating.\nThe Sunday after the vote, local pastors declared it a victory.\nThe ordinance empowered private residents to bring lawsuits against anyone who was \u201caiding and abetting\u201d someone getting an abortion. The ordinance went into effect two weeks before state lawmakers passed a similar statewide law, known as Senate Bill 8, which effectively banned abortions statewide after six weeks of pregnancy.\nPlanned Parenthood provided abortion services to the Lubbock region for just two months before it had to stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think people were stunned because they had no idea the hurdles they had to go through next,\u201d Martinez said.\nPlanned Parenthood challenged the ordinance in a lawsuit but dropped the case eight months later, saying \u201cit is clear we cannot depend on the courts to protect our constitutional rights.\u201d\nTerisa Clark is part of the leadership team at Project Destiny, the organization that spearheaded the Lubbock ordinance. According to the group, a section in the ordinance makes an exception if a pregnant person\u2019s life is at risk, but Clark said that other than that, the group wants abortion to be unthinkable. While there have been a lot of victories, it is still working to push for more abortion bans.\n\u201cWe will continue to do everything we can to make sure that abortion is illegal, as much as we can influence that and the people in each community and each day can influence that,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither side is backing down\nLubbock\u2019s Planned Parenthood is still open and provides women\u2019s health services, but not abortions. Among those services is \u201cempowerment kits,\u201d which include emergency contraception, pregnancy tests and condoms. Also included: a voter registration card and information on Senate Bill 8.\nWomen who go to Planned Parenthood are still occasionally confronted by protesters, serving as a reminder that the clinic is not welcome by some in conservative Lubbock.\n\u201cIf Planned Parenthood can figure it out and be supportive of women\u2019s health and caring for women without abortion services, then that\u2019s better,\u201d Clark said. \u201cMy suspicion is if they exist in a city, they\u2019re probably only there to refer to the other states where they can perform abortions.\u201d\nAdams, the suburban coffee shop owner, faced those anti-abortion protesters when she visited the clinic for a pregnancy test last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were just there to hoot and holler, to make me feel ashamed in some way,\u201d Adams recalled. \u201cThey still made me feel sick to my stomach. I just thought, \u201cWhy are these people like this in Lubbock of all places?\u201d\nDespite the string of victories stretching from the voter-approved ban, the Lubbock anti-abortion movement is not finished. In fact, the changes in the state and by the U.S. Supreme Court over the last year have only invigorated people, Clark said.\n\u201cThe fight for life is not over, and probably never will be over, to be honest,\u201d she said.\nMartinez said Planned Parenthood still has a lot of people reaching out to it every day for various resources, so the clinic will stay in Lubbock to offer support to the people in the region who need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are needs that need to be met in Lubbock,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cSo us being here is really important to the community, and I know we\u2019re needed. I don\u2019t see us going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          First: Destiny Adams stores Plan B kits in the restroom of her Tumbleweed + Sage Coffeehouse in Wolfforth. Last: Adams keeps a display of the kits in her shop.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nA new fight after Supreme Court decision\u00a0\u00a0\nAmong the new fronts in the battle over reproduction rights is contraception, including Plan B \u2014 an emergency contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy but does not cause abortions. And abortion-rights activists have stepped up their effort to increase access to such pills that can prevent pregnancy.\nAdams joined the fight after a friend asked her to work with Jane\u2019s Due Process, a Texas-based nonprofit that helps teens access abortions and reproductive health care.\nWhen Adams posted on TikTok for the first time that she would be distributing emergency contraception kits, the video garnered attention overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy morning, protesters gathered outside the shop holding graphic photos of aborted fetuses.\nAt one point, she extended a symbolic olive branch, taking cold water to them in the 100-degree weather. But she said they were rude and she regretted it afterwards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic because my baby gets to see them now, out of the womb, yelling at us as we walk into our coffee shop,\u201d Adams said.\nThe kits made by Jane\u2019s Due Process and distributed at Adams\u2019 coffee shop include two pills, since the amount taken depends on the weight of the person taking it, two packs of condoms, a pregnancy test and a booklet of information containing resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than $100 worth of products in the kits, and they are possible through $17.7 million in funding for Texas from the federal Title X Family Planning Program.\nWhat Adams is doing is legal. Emergency contraception is sold over the counter in stores such as Walgreens and CVS, and it does not require a doctor\u2019s prescription or parental consent to people over 17 years old. Despite this, the Wolfforth Police Department has been called several times about the kits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          West Texans for Life members Linda Brown and Dianne Peden protest outside of the Tumbleweed + Sage Coffeehouse in Wolfforth.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have received many calls and emails questioning the legality of this practice,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the legality of the practice is not a simple question to answer. We have been researching the matter and have reached out to many state and local officials for help in determining the lawfulness of the issue.\u201d\nAdams expected the response and has even told her supporters to not send negative comments to the police because \u201cthey\u2019re just doing their job.\u201d The intimidation hasn\u2019t scared her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for all the attacks, there has been community support.\n\u201cWe saw grandmas talking to their granddaughters about the kits, we saw college-aged women, women my age and young mothers,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe people that have come and asked for them seemed like they truly needed them.\u201d\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
