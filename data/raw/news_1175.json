    "text": "Undue Burden | FiveThirtyEightPUBLISHED Mar. 7, 2022, at 6:00 AMUndue BurdenHow abortion restrictions have become obstacles for women across the U.S.By Anna Wiederkehr and Amelia Thomson-DeVeauxIllustrations by Nicole RifkinAbortion is a constitutional right \u2014 at least for now. But for many women, it\u2019s a right that comes with an asterisk.Under current law, states can\u2019t ban abortion until after a fetus reaches viability, which usually happens around 23 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. Some states don\u2019t have limits on when abortions can happen, but most do \u2014 which means women have anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to make their decision and get the procedure.Those restrictions don\u2019t always seem especially burdensome, at least on their own. An ultrasound, a waiting period, a few hundred dollars \u2014 what\u2019s the big deal? But when we talked to women about what their abortions were like, they told us that in real life the restrictions pile on top of each other. They add up in a way that\u2019s expensive, bureaucratic, confusing and exhausting.Even in states like California, where there are few formal state restrictions, access to abortion can feel threadbare and fragile. And this is what abortion looks like while it\u2019s still a constitutional right. All of these burdens could quickly morph and multiply if the Supreme Court upholds Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortion after 15 weeks later this year.Trigger banLaw designed to quickly ban abortion if Roe is overturnedPre-viability BanLaw prohibiting abortion before 24 weeks of pregnancy Four states (FL, MA, NV and PA) ban abortion at 24 weeks; 20 states ban abortion at fetal viability. Data on abortion restrictions is from a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of Guttmacher Institute data, as of Sept. 1, 2021. Data on trigger and pre-viability bans is from the Guttmacher Institute, as of Oct. 28, 2021.Sources: Guttmacher Institute, KFF\u201cIt makes me feel like even in places like California, we\u2019re feeling confident and preaching to the choir about how abortion should be legal, but nobody thinks about what it means for abortion to be accessible \u2014 the human component of how this process actually feels.\u2013Emily, CaliforniaFour weeks or much moreThe amount of time a woman has to get an abortion depends a lot on when she finds out she\u2019s pregnant. And this is where the math starts to get complicated. Because it\u2019s very difficult to figure out exactly when conception happened, doctors count the weeks of pregnancy from the first day of a woman\u2019s last menstrual period \u2014 which is to say, at least a week and a half before she actually became pregnant.Using this unintuitive calculation, the earliest a woman can find out she\u2019s pregnant is about four weeks into her pregnancy. That\u2019s happening more and more, thanks to highly sensitive pregnancy tests. But for lots of reasons, most women don\u2019t find out they\u2019re pregnant until they\u2019re further along \u2014 particularly if their cycle isn\u2019t regular, they don\u2019t have any pregnancy symptoms or they\u2019ve never been pregnant before. Researchers have found, too, that the later a woman finds out she\u2019s pregnant, the later she tends to have an abortion. Based on a survey of 956 women who sought an abortion at one of 30 facilities in the U.S. between 2008 and 2010.Source: ContraceptionBut knowing how far along the pregnancy is doesn\u2019t matter just because of state-imposed limits. It also affects pretty much everything else about the process, including what kind of abortion a woman can get. A Guttmacher Institute report published last month estimated that more than half (54 percent) of abortions in 2020 happened using medication, up from 39 percent in 2017. Abortion pills are often cheaper and easier to get than surgical abortions since clinics can offer them even if they\u2019re not a surgical facility. But medication abortions are available up to only 10 weeks of pregnancy.\u201cI was probably eight weeks along when I found out. I had a little bit of nausea, morning sickness, but other than that, I didn\u2019t really have any symptoms. I hid it for a few weeks and then I realized, OK, I have to do something. \u2026 By that point, a surgical abortion was my only choice. I couldn\u2019t take the pill.\u2013Heather, OhioAbortion is currently legal until at least 22 weeks of pregnancy in almost all states \u2014 and some states have no limits on when it can be obtained \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean every clinic offers abortion up till that point. Medical experts told us that as the second trimester progresses, abortion procedures get more complicated and fewer providers offer them. (Abortions after 21 weeks of pregnancy are extremely rare, and only a small fraction of abortion providers perform them.) Practically speaking, that means that abortion access is even more limited in some places. Mississippi\u2019s lone abortion clinic, for example, offers abortions up to only 16 weeks, even though the state allows abortion until 20 weeks (at least for now). This is an issue even in liberal states. According to our analysis of clinic websites, a sizable chunk of California\u2019s clinics offer only medication abortion, which means they can\u2019t serve women who are past 10 weeks of pregnancy. And other California clinics perform surgical abortions only through the end of the first trimester.100 abortion clinics or just oneThe pink lines on a positive pregnancy test look the same whether it\u2019s sitting on a bathroom counter in Jackson, Mississippi, or Los Angeles. But for the woman who took that test, where she lives will determine whether she has lots of options for where to get an abortion, or just a few.The vast majority of abortions happen in freestanding clinics scattered across the country. But those clinics aren\u2019t spread out evenly \u2014 a national map looks like someone lobbed a handful of dots at each of the coasts, sprinkled a few more in the middle of the country, then called it a day.According to a dataset of abortion providers compiled by Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who studies reproductive policy, about one-third of the country\u2019s abortion providers are in New York and California alone. Other states have fewer abortion clinics, particularly in the Midwest and South, which means that  travel times are often much longer. It also means that clinics outside of cities are often serving a much larger population, which can mean longer wait times for appointments. On the West Coast, where abortion clinics are relatively plentiful, that means travel distances can be long for women who live in rural areas. And in the heart of the country, abortion clinics are even more scarce, leading to longer travel times and longer waits.Swipe to see more of the map \u2192 Travel time is measured by the driving time between the population centroid of each county and the geographic coordinates of the nearest abortion provider, calculated under normal traffic conditions. Congestion is measured by the \u201caverage service population,\u201d which is the average number of women of childbearing age per abortion facility in a set of counties that share a common nearest destination county or commuting zone to obtain an abortion. Abortion provider data as of June 2021.Source: Caitlin Myers\u201cI Googled around, searched for Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics. There was an abortion clinic in Wichita, but I don\u2019t think they had any appointments available, so Planned Parenthood was the best option. It was about four and a half, five hours from me. \u2026 I missed class, left early in the morning to drive halfway across the entire state. A whole day out of my life just to get an abortion.\u2013Kaila, KansasStill, in states with dozens of providers, figuring out where to get an abortion can be hard. Searching around online, it can be difficult to tell whether you\u2019ve landed on a clinic that actually offers abortions or a crisis pregnancy center that tries to convince women to choose another path. Even trusted doctors may not be much help. Chances are, a woman\u2019s own OB-GYN won\u2019t offer an abortion. At Catholic hospitals, which make up a significant share of American health care providers, doctors are prohibited from providing abortions. Some Catholic hospitals also bar their doctors from referring women seeking abortions to clinics that perform the procedure.Getting through to a clinic \u2014 and making an appointment \u2014 can also be a challenge. That\u2019s another factor that varies widely from region to region. Following Texas\u2019s six-week abortion ban, clinics in states adjacent to Texas have seen wait times skyrocket, commonly exceeding two weeks. But simply residing in a state with few or no abortion restrictions doesn\u2019t mean a woman can get an appointment right away. Some women who had abortions in bluer states, like California, told us they had to wait a week or more for an appointment. And when we checked appointment availability at 58 abortion providers across California, we found that wait times were all over the place. Some waits were as little as a day in big cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco, but others were up to two weeks in less urban areas, especially rural northern and central California. That might not sound like a noteworthy delay, but when you\u2019re pregnant and don\u2019t want to be, an extra week can feel like a lifetime.\u201cWhen I finally found an abortion clinic near me, I had to keep calling\u2026 I kept pushing repeat over and over again. And even then, my appointment was 10 days out\u2026 That\u2019s when it clicked for me \u2014 that even though I live in California, where abortion\u2019s legal, there\u2019s a difference between legality and permissibility. Whether you\u2019re theoretically allowed to get it and whether you actually can.\u2013Emily, CaliforniaAsking a judge\u2019s permissionMost women who get abortions get to choose who they tell about the procedure, even if that means telling no one at all. But that\u2019s not the case for girls under the age of 18. Most states require some level of parental involvement in a minor\u2019s decision to get an abortion. That could mean  notifying at least one parent, requiring one parent to give consent, requiring  both parents to give consent, or requiring  parental notification and consent.CO DEGAIAILMDMNMTNHSDWVAL ARAZIDINKYLAMAMIMONCNEOHPARISCTNWIKS MSNDFL OKTXUTVAWY Data as of Feb. 1, 2022.Source: Guttmacher InstituteSome states have limited exceptions, allowing minors to bypass these rules if it\u2019s a medical emergency or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. But for the most part, minors who want to avoid involving their parents have to get a judge\u2019s permission to get an abortion instead. And getting a judge to sign off, a process known as \u201cjudicial bypass,\u201d can sometimes take weeks. Research has found that even in restrictive states like Texas, most judicial bypass requests are eventually approved \u2014 but not always.\u201cFor my meeting with the judge, I had to memorize every single step of the procedure. \u2026 It meant memorizing all the tools that were needed and what was going into my body and how my abortion worked. I had to acknowledge that abortion could cause death, \u2026 that the person who got me pregnant would pay child support and that adoption is an option. It was like cramming for a test, the scariest possible test. Talking about it still makes me shake four years later.\u2013Anna, TexasAnywhere from $500 to more than $1,000Most women who get abortions are lower-income. Figuring out how to pay for the procedure is often the biggest challenge they face, too, as federal funds can\u2019t be used for abortion except in limited circumstances, which has made it challenging to cover abortion under Medicaid. Some states use their own Medicaid funds to cover abortion, but most don\u2019t.Other states have made it practically impossible to avoid paying out of pocket for an abortion. They restrict abortion coverage either in health insurance plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, in insurance plans for public employees or in private insurance plans written in the state. In a handful of states, such as California and Illinois, private insurance is required to cover abortion \u2014 but patients with high-deductible plans sometimes end up paying out-of-pocket anyway. Of the states that restrict abortion coverage in health insurance plans, many limit coverage to pregnancies that endanger the life of the woman, resulted from rape or incest or have a fetal abnormality. Data as of Feb. 1, 2022.Source: Guttmacher Institute\u201c[A clinic employee] literally came and told me that my insurance didn\u2019t go through while I was talking to the doctor. \u2026 They said, \u201cDon\u2019t give her the medication. We don\u2019t take that insurance.\u201d So I had to make a phone call on the spot to come up with the $700 for the pills. At that point, it was about two weeks since I had found out I was pregnant, and I did not want to delay this any more. \u2026 Luckily, I was able to make the call. It was embarrassing and really demoralizing.\u2013Larada, CaliforniaThe out-of-pocket cost of an abortion can vary a lot. A California agency recently reviewed abortion costs and found that patients in the state paid an average of $306 for a medication abortion and $887 for a surgical abortion. And in 2014, a study conducted at 30 clinics across the country found that when insurance or Medicaid didn\u2019t pay for an abortion, the median cost was $575. That varied a lot, though, depending on the stage of pregnancy at which the woman was trying to get an abortion. A first-trimester abortion, for instance, could cost less than $500, but a second-trimester abortion could cost almost twice as much.And to someone already struggling to make ends meet, even the less expensive procedures aren\u2019t cheap. In the study, more than half of the women who paid out-of-pocket were handing over more than one-third of their monthly income when factoring in the cost of travel and the procedure. Some women delay bills or avoid buying groceries to cover the cost.\u201cWe had a remaining balance of almost $500, which was really stressful because I didn\u2019t have the money and I couldn\u2019t ask my mom. It was like, Oh shit, we went through this whole process and maybe we can\u2019t even pay for it. So my partner\u2019s mom talked to his dad and told him what was going on, and he paid the rest. It saved us. And I felt so guilty because I knew that was almost one-third of their rent.\u2013Veronika, TexasMany women turn to family members or abortion funds to pay for the procedure and cover related costs, like travel. But the process of cobbling the funds together takes time, and there\u2019s a catch-22 for lower-income women: The longer it takes to get the money together, the more expensive the procedure will be. A 2014 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that two-thirds of women who were near the gestational limit of the clinic where they ultimately received an abortion said that travel and procedure costs delayed getting their abortion, compared with 37 percent of women who had an abortion in the first trimester. \u00a0Source: American Journal of Public HealthAsking family members for help isn\u2019t always an easy option, either. Many women told us they didn\u2019t want to talk to people who were close to them about their abortion, fearing they\u2019d be judged or criticized. For some, that meant making a vulnerable request of people they didn\u2019t know well.\u201cInsurance did not cover a thing. [The abortion] was between $700 and $800. That\u2019s a lot of money when you\u2019re low-income. We had to pay it all out of pocket, and if it wasn\u2019t for the grandma of the guy who got me pregnant, I might have a kid right now, honestly. She paid for half of it.\u2013Heather, OhioProtesters and restrictions at the clinicIn some states, arriving at the abortion clinic is just the beginning of a several-day ordeal \u2014 starting with navigating the protesters who gather outside abortion providers, hoping to convince women not to go through with the procedure. Several women told us that simply walking into the clinic was a more jarring experience than they\u2019d been expecting.\u201cThere was a young girl outside of the clinic, and she was holding rosary beads and just looking at the people who were going in and out. I remember looking at her and thinking, You have no idea, you just don\u2019t understand my situation. Before I got pregnant, I had always been pro-choice \u2026 but I didn\u2019t think I would have an abortion. It made me realize that in this situation you don\u2019t know what you would do. But there are so many people hating you for your decision.\u2013MJ, TexasOnce inside the clinic, though, restrictions can start to envelop the patient \u2014 adding time, expense and sometimes confusion. According to an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, a majority of states (33) require some form of pre-abortion counseling, which often includes scary and medically inaccurate information, such as telling women that abortion is linked to breast cancer or infertility. (Neither of which is true.) Half of states (26) impose a waiting period between when a woman receives the counseling and when she can have an abortion. And in 13 states, the counseling has to be conducted in-person before the waiting period begins, which means the woman must make at least two trips to the clinic. In most states with a waiting period, the waiting period is 24 hours, but two states have a 48-hour waiting period and six states require women to wait 72 hours. These mandatory waiting periods may require a woman to make two trips to the health care provider if the state requires the woman to receive in-person counseling and then wait a set amount of time until the abortion appointment. Data as of Feb. 1, 2022.Source: Guttmacher InstituteThe visits add up. A study conducted in 2019 in Mississippi, which has a 24-hour waiting period, found that almost half (43 percent) of patients traveled more than 50 miles one way to get to the clinic, and 57 percent had to miss work. Some women we spoke with had to return to the clinic three or four times \u2014 not just for the counseling and the abortion procedure itself, but also for follow-up visits and ultrasounds.In 17 states, an ultrasound is required, even though that\u2019s not considered medically necessary for a first-trimester abortion. Often, the ultrasounds are pretty uncomfortable, too; several of the women we spoke with had a vaginal ultrasound, rather than the abdominal ultrasound they were expecting. In six states, the provider has to display and describe the ultrasound image. And in eight states, the provider has to offer the woman an opportunity to view the image. In New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oklahoma, the abortion provider is not required to offer the woman an opportunity to see the ultrasound image. Data as of Feb. 1, 2022.Source: Guttmacher Institute\u201cThey brought me to a room, and I got a sonogram. It was vaginal, which was more invasive than I was expecting. At some point, they were like, \u201cThe state requires us to show the screen to you, but you don\u2019t have to look. \u2026 We have to tell you the size \u2014 it\u2019s the size of a blueberry.\u201d \u2026 Every little burden, every little inconvenience \u2014 it felt intentional. Like someone had known what they were doing \u2026 and they wanted me to feel shame.\u2013Cali, WisconsinFor many women, the time it takes to navigate state-imposed restrictions isn\u2019t just an annoyance. It means more days off work, more hours of lost pay, more childcare gaps to fill, more gas to buy. In some states where doctors are required to give abortion pills in person, it can take three visits to get a medication abortion \u2014 one for mandatory in-person counseling, another to take the pill, a third to make sure that the pregnancy is gone.All of these barriers are psychologically and physically taxing. Women told us they felt like they were being punished. They felt like they must have done something wrong. They felt alone.\u201cWith the repeated visits, having to wait more than a week from when I knew to when I could actually make the appointment, \u2026 it honestly felt personally hurtful because all of these steps are due to people\u2019s opinion of what you\u2019re doing. \u2026 It\u2019s not that I think I should be ashamed of this, but that\u2019s the constant communication throughout the process. The reason I\u2019m supposed to have the ultrasound and get counseling is because everyone thinks this should weigh on you so heavily that you\u2019ll realize what you\u2019re doing is wrong. \u2026 I have to act like it\u2019s something shameful, and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s something shameful. That\u2019s where the guilt starts.\u2013Stella, MississippiIn states like California, where access to abortion has relatively few legal restrictions, some women were still surprised by how difficult it was to get an appointment and pay for the procedure. In our review of appointment availability at 58 clinics in California, we found that at 21 percent of abortion providers, the soonest available slot was a week or more away. Twelve percent of the providers said their soonest available appointment was 10 days or more in the future. And while abortion is covered by Medicaid in the state, which means the procedure could cost nothing for some women, high deductibles can leave women with private insurance footing the entire bill. Several of the women we spoke with told us that they realized for the first time that the South isn\u2019t the only place where it can be hard to get an abortion.\u201cIn California, it\u2019s supposed to be easy to get an abortion. But for me, it wasn\u2019t easy. Even though \u2026 I was doing everything I could to get it done, it felt like the world was telling me no.\u2013Jessy, CaliforniaThe Supreme Court may soon dismantle constitutional protections for abortion. But in practice, this right has already been hollowed out in much of the country. States with more restrictions have spent decades trying to make it as difficult as possible to get an abortion, and they\u2019ve been successful. Even outside of those states, though, having an abortion is often complicated, expensive and hard to talk about \u2014 a secret that some women hold onto for years, never telling more than a few people. To those women, abortion didn\u2019t really feel like a right \u2014 unless a right is something you have to struggle at every step to exercise.Some names have been changed to protect people\u2019s identities.Additional research by Jean Yi.
