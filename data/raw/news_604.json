Submitted / Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\nJeremy Fugleberg\n\nJanuary 28, 2021 at 2:25 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Share\n    \n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n SIOUX FALLS, S.D. \u2014 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, an ardent abortion foe, is proposing a legislative ban on abortions based in a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome.  \n While the proposal fit with Noem's view of abortions, and is likely to further burnish her credentials in conservative circles, a Forum News Service analysis indicates a lack of data, and uncertain testing, makes it very hard to say how the ban would affect state residents. \n Still, Noem is pressing on with the legislation, which would implement a class 6 criminal penalty \u2014 up to 2 years in prison and a $4,000 fine \u2014 if a doctor were knowingly perform an abortion due to Down syndrome diagnosis. \n \"At times people have said we don\u2019t need this bill that I introduced this week, and I would disagree with that because we do have the ability to test for Down syndrome after 10 weeks of pregnancy, and again at 15 weeks there is another test that is available,\" Noem said in a Thursday, Jan. 28 press conference.  \n But a deeper look at the timing of Down syndrome testing and abortion availability in South Dakota paints a more complex picture of the rationale behind Noem's proposed bill, now designated \n    \n      House Bill 1110\n    \n       and awaiting action in the House State Affairs Committee. \n\n\nTiming, testing make for small window\n\n\n \n The window for this ban to matter is a very small one \u2014 a couple of weeks at most. \n South Dakota bans abortions after a pregnancy is 20 weeks along. The Planned Parenthood medical center in Sioux Falls, the only place to get an elective abortion in the state, only provide abortions up to 13 weeks and 6 days. \n The earliest Down syndrome tests, and also the least accurate, can be taken at 10 weeks, with other more accurate testing in later weeks available but irrelevant due to limitations in South Dakota on access to elective abortions. And, testing for Down syndrome is not routine, according to Sioux Falls-based heath system Sanford Health.  \n \"There are several tests that can be done at different points in pregnancy. The earliest test is available at 10 weeks gestation, but most of our patients do not screen for Down syndrome,\" said Erika Batcheller, Sanford Health spokesperson, in an emailed statement. \n The vast majority of abortion procedures are conducted early in a pregnancy, before a Down syndrome test is even available. according to annual abortion reports produced by the South Dakota Department of Health.  \n In 2019, \n    \n      the more recent year such a report is available\n    \n      , more than half of abortions performed in South Dakota \u2014 54.2% \u2014 took place by the end of gestational week eight. If you include abortions performed in weeks nine and 10 (the very earliest a Down syndrome test is conducted), that percentages jumps to 77.4%, more than three out of four abortions performed in the state.  \n There were 414 abortions conducted in South Dakota in 2019. Only seven took place with the knowledge of \"a fetal abnormality present at the time of the abortion,\" according to the state's latest \n    \n      annual abortion report.\n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not any of our business to decide these decisions for women,\" said Kristin Hayward, manager of advocacy and development for Planned Parenthood in South Dakota. \"When it\u2019s all said and done, this is about trying to create a reason, trying to create a ban to make it more difficult, when there\u2019s already an undue burden on the women of South Dakota to obtain an abortion.\u201d \n\n\nNo contact with support group\n\n\n \n Noem made her Down syndrome legislation a signature proposal by including it in her State of the State address on Jan. 12. But she previewed it earlier that day, not via in-state media, but in a \n    \n      morning \"Fox & Friends'\" interview on Fox News\n    \n      .  \n In a live shot from the governor's mansion in Pierre, she appeared with Rachel Campos-Duffy, a Fox News contributor, and former Republican Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. The couple's daughter, Valentina, has Down syndrome.  \n \"At this time especially, we're living in a time where so many people are being censored,\" Campos-Duffy said. \"Gov. Kristi Noem is giving a voice to a group of people who don't have a voice, who don't have a lobby, who don't have anyone to fight for them other than their moms and a good leader like Gov. Noem.\" \n Not involved in Noem's legislation was \n    \n      New Directions Down Syndrome Association\n    \n      , perhaps the largest Down syndrome family support group in South Dakota, with about 2,000 families in its organization.  \n Contacted by Forum News Service, its leadership declined to take a position on the legislation due to the wide range of views among its membership. But its board indicated they would like to be involved with any actions or policies affecting those with Down syndrome.  \n \"While we\u2019ve not been in communication with Gov. Noem\u2019s office in the drafting of this bill, we\u2019re encouraged by her support of individuals with Down syndrome, and look forward to learning more about any further policies or actions she may have in mind to support these members of our community at birth and throughout their lives,\" said New Directions' board in a statement. \n Brandon Tilus, the board's president, described how the group makes and distributes education packets through local hospitals to help parents who have just received a Down syndrome diagnosis. \n  \"That\u2019s the part, if you don\u2019t have someone in your ear and helping to balance those fears with the joys, and the way that life is going to change over time, it can be really difficult,\" he said.   \n The packets include myth-busting information about the genetic disorder and contact details to reach out for support at what could be a critical decision point, Tilus said. \n  \" Even within our membership, there\u2019s probably members who wish we advocated more strongly to have a baby than we already do. I\u2019m sure there are members who feel that way. And I\u2019m sure there are other members in our community who feel that even the question of it is preposterous,\" he said. \"We have to balance that in our materials, too.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Share\n    \n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Tags\n          \n\n\n\nTags\n\nGOVERNMENT AND POLITICSSOUTH DAKOTAGOVERNMENT AND POLITICSKRISTI NOEM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                By\n                Jeremy Fugleberg\n\n\n                Jeremy Fugleberg is editor of The Vault, Forum Communications Co.'s home for Midwest history, mysteries, crime and culture.
