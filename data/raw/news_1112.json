But some say their faith supports the right to choose Melody SchreiberThu 2 Jun 2022 13.42 BSTFirst published on Thu 2 Jun 2022 10.00 BSTShareMisha Sanders was starting over. She had just left an abusive relationship, and she was in her first semester of seminary, all while caring for her child, a teenager with a pressing health problem.That\u2019s when she found out she was pregnant. Sanders took misoprostol and mifepristone, the two drugs known collectively as the abortion pill, to end the pregnancy.The decision, she says, was deeply entwined with her religious beliefs, which include respecting full bodily autonomy and caring for other people \u2013 core beliefs of Unitarian Universalism, which she practices.\u201cThe only decision that I could make, as a loving mother, was to focus on mothering this child that I brought into the world and terminating this new pregnancy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt was absolutely the right decision.\u201dBut Sanders now lives in Georgia, which could pass restrictions on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy if Roe v Wade is overturned in the coming weeks.Reproductive rights are under threat in the US as states implement harsher restrictions and the supreme court weighs a case that is widely expected to reverse the constitutional right to abortion.But while religious arguments around the issue are commonly associated with the anti-abortion movement, abortion restrictions can violate the right to religious liberty, faith leaders and legal experts say. And some organizations are already gearing up for possible legal challenges to looming abortion bans.Religious liberty for people of all faiths is protected under the US constitution, state constitutions and federal statutes.In Judaism, abortion is usually seen as permissible and even required in cases where the patient\u2019s life is at risk. In Islam, scholars contend that abortion is allowed for the first 120 days, after which it\u2019s seen as a civil \u2013 not a criminal \u2013 issue, and it\u2019s permitted at any time when the health of the mother is in danger. Other believers, including within Christianity, focus on the sacredness of the individual or the family to make such decisions, rather than prosecutors or lawmakers.View image in fullscreenRabbi Stephen Einstein of Congregation B\u2019nai Tzedek in Fountain Valley, California, and the Rev Sarah Halverson-Cano of Irvine United Congregational church at a rally supporting abortion access on 3 May. Photograph: Felicity Figueroa/APPersonal beliefs can even contravene the dictums of established religions; for instance, Catholics for Choice believe they have a religious duty to protect reproductive health despite the Catholic church\u2019s stance against abortion.Nearly half of Protestants and 56% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in some or all cases, according to a Pew Research survey published in May. More than half of Muslims, 82% of Buddhists and 83% of Jews believe the same, according to a different Pew study from 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a member of an organized religion,\u201d said Katherine Franke, a professor of law at Columbia University and the faculty director of the Law, Rights, and Religion Project. \u201cYour religious beliefs could be your own idiosyncratic beliefs. They have to just be religious to you.\u201dWith abortion bans, some clergy object to what they see as a \u201cChristian theocratic imposition on entire swaths of our country\u201d, as Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, scholar-in-residence at the National Council of Jewish Women, put it.\u201cThere are very serious religious liberty questions here,\u201d Ruttenberg said. \u201cIf you ban abortion, when my religious tradition tells me that I am a) permitted and b) possibly required to access abortion care, you are limiting my free exercise of religion.\u201dThe same questions arise in other faiths.\u201cIn the Muslim tradition, scholars from the medieval time had taken the position that until a fetus is ensouled, it is not a life,\u201d said Abed Awad, a lawyer and commentator on Islamic law.\u201cA Muslim woman living in Texas, or living in Alabama, who has a sincerely and genuinely held religious belief that in her tradition, she can terminate her pregnancy and it is not a violation of her religious requirements or theology up to 120 days, is going to be prevented from exercising her religious right to control her reproductive health,\u201d Awad continued.The first amendment has two components to protecting religious rights: first, the state can\u2019t substantially burden the free exercise of religion, and second, the establishment clause prohibits the government from endorsing some forms of religion and condemning others, or embracing faith-based perspectives on public policy.For example, if states adopt laws on fetal personhood, which would recognize fertilized eggs as people, those laws could violate the establishment clause, because such a view hews closely to Catholicism but not to other religious beliefs on ensoulment and personhood.Legal challenges on the basis of religious liberty could be \u201cthe next stage of reproductive rights\u201d, Awad said, and the National Council of Jewish Women is exploring the possibility of such a challenge, Ruttenberg said.\u201cOur tradition not only permits us to access abortion but also commands us to pursue justice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe, as a religious minority with a long and complicated history, know all too well that the separation of church and state is one of the great gifts that our constitution offers. And it is critical that it be taken seriously.\u201dThere is precedent for people with sincerely held religious beliefs fighting against criminal charges for actions that violate the law.Scott Warren, a humanitarian aid worker for No More Deaths, successfully argued that his work helping migrants crossing the US-Mexico border was in line with his religious beliefs about helping others, and he was acquitted of federal charges in 2019.Religious leaders or adherents may feel compelled by their beliefs to provide care, funds, transportation, housing or counseling around abortion, Franke said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a stretch to see the work that they do in this area as part of a ministry.\u201dSanders, who is now a minister, feels compelled by her beliefs to support access to reproductive healthcare, and she\u2019s now preparing to offer support however she can. \u201cI have a spare room, and I\u2019m in the middle of sprucing it up right now with exactly that in mind.\u201dSanders is particularly concerned about the ways restrictions on reproductive rights and trans rights are growing and intersecting. \u201cIt\u2019s so terrifying,\u201d she said. She believes it is \u201can egregious sin\u201d to cause harm to someone by denying them healthcare or human rights.\u201cWe, as Unitarian Universalists, believe fully that all human beings should have bodily autonomy, and anything that happens in or to my body should be my choice,\u201d she said.\u201cTo me, the law of the land and [religious] law are two separate and distinct things. It\u2019s great when they overlap. And when they don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to choose morality over the law every time. And for me, that includes helping people in whatever way I can, for whatever reason they are seeking abortion.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionReligionReproductive rightsRoe v WadefeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
