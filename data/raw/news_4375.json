thoroughfare in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday.Show Caption of ExpandBy Storm GiffordPUBLISHED: November 28, 2020 at 6:24 p.m. | UPDATED: November 29, 2020 at 1:18 a.m.Abortion-rights activists in Poland were protesting yet again on Saturday.\nFor the sixth consecutive week in the central European nation, demonstrators marched in Warsaw, Krakow and Gdansk, demanding an easing of restrictive abortion laws as well as criticizing law enforcement officials of using excessive force and shooting pepper spray at peaceful protesters, reported The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\u201cWe have a right to protest!\u201d chanted demonstrators.\nWarsaw cops blocked protesters from marching through the capital city\u2019s streets, erecting barricades which the demonstrators sought to bypass.\n\nA mother with two teen girls held a sign in Warsaw which read, \u201cI am here for my daughters.\u201d\n\nPolice intervene after protesters block a major thoroughfare in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday.\nOfficers claimed that the protest was illegal due to being an unregistered event and in violation of COVID-19 social-distancing restrictions. \n\n\nBut Warsaw demonstrators who amassed on a major street to impede traffic, shouted, \u201cWe are sorry for the inconvenience, we have a government to overthrow!\u201d\nCops deployed tear gas on Barbara Nowacka, a lawmaker intervening \u201cin defense of peacefully protesting women,\u201d claimed party leader Borys Budka. \n\n\nMany protesters toted signs with a silhouette image of a suffragette with a red lightning bolt and the words \u201cStrajk Kobiet\u201d \u2014 Women\u2019s Strike.\nWomen\u2019s rights activists have called on authorities to formally change the name of a downtown Warsaw square to Women\u2019s Rights Roundabout.\n\u201cFacing a near total ban on abortion, people in Poland have mobilized impressively,\u201d explained Nils Mulzieks, the European director at Amnesty International, earlier this month. \u201cHowever, not content with violating their reproductive rights, authorities have used this opportunity to also crack down on their right to peacefully protest.\u201d\n\nPolice use tear gas against opposition lawmaker, Barbara Nowacka, as protesters block a major thoroughfare in Warsaw on Saturday.\nProtests began on Oct. 22, the same day the Polish constitutional court ruled on an abortion ban of fetuses with congenital defects, even when the fetus is expected to die.\nPoland\u2019s 1993 abortion law allowed the procedure only in cases of fetal defects, incest, rape or risk to a mother\u2019s health.\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMore in World News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWorld
