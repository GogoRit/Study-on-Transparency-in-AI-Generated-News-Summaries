(Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite confusion and hesitancy among health care providers, Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban will not take effect until the state Supreme Court certifies its June ruling.\nIndiana Supreme Court justices tossed out a wide-ranging preliminary injunction in late June when they largely upheld the state\u2019s abortion ban on constitutional liberty grounds.\u00a0\nBut until the high court certifies its decision, an injunction remains in place \u2014 blocking the new law from taking effect.\u00a0\nAt earliest, decisions can be certified 30 days after a ruling is issued. Because the June 30 ruling was not certified by Monday, it will not take effect on Tuesday.\nFor now, that leaves in place the state\u2019s previous abortion law, which allows abortions up to 20 weeks.\n\u201cFrom a legal perspective, we\u2019re still in limbo, just waiting for the case to be sent back, and for some clarity,\u201d said Gavin Rose, a senior attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana.\u00a0\n\u201cBut from a practical perspective \u2026 I certainly know that the nature of medical practice is such that they need some definiteness about when they can provide services, because they obviously schedule more than five minutes out,\u201d Rose continued. \u201cCertainly, my assumption is that they are preparing to wind things down.\u201d\nIndiana abortion clinics said they\u2019ll stop offering abortions when the ban takes effect but continue to support patients with information about out-of-state clinics.\nThe ACLU of Indiana additionally filed for a rehearing on Monday, pushing back the date of certification even farther.\nIn their latest filing, ACLU attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to put a short pause on its decision while a trial court determines whether there are people who have a constitutional right to obtain an abortion to protect their health who are not protected under the current language laid out in the near-total abortion ban.\u00a0\nThe ACLU requested for the Supreme Court to allow the earlier preliminary injunction to remain in effect while the trial court resolves the matter.\nStory continues below.\nPetition for Rehearing - Appelle\n\u00a0\nKathryn Dolan, a spokesperson for the Indiana Supreme Court, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that if a party seeks rehearing, certification will not happen until after the court \u201cconsiders the matter and issues a decision on whether to grant or deny the rehearing petition, thus considering the case or disposing of the rehearing petition.\u201d\nA narrower injunction is also still in place in a second lawsuit using the state\u2019s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to argue that the abortion ban infringes on the religious beliefs of plaintiffs of multiple faiths.\u00a0\nThat injunction only applies to the plaintiffs in that case, however.\nLingering questions in ongoing legal challenges\nAttorneys challenging the state\u2019s abortion ban on religious freedom grounds asked the trial court to dispel confusion in that case by explicitly stating a preliminary injunction extends to all members of the class-action suit.\nThe narrow injunction grants a temporary religious exemption from the state\u2019s abortion ban. But it\u2019s been mired in confusion about who it protects.\nThat\u2019s because the case initially involved only a handful of plaintiffs, and a judge granted the injunction before the case was certified as a class-action suit.\nThe ACLU last month asked the Marion Superior Court to clarify that the preliminary injunction \u2014 in its view \u2014 applies to the full class of plaintiffs. The organization also asked the court to clarify that the injunction protects entities, such as a hospital, performing abortions for class members.\nThe trial court still has not issued any such clarification, however.\nA hearing before the Indiana Court of Appeals on the preliminary injunction in the religious freedom case was also pushed back to Dec. 6.\nChanges under the ban\nWhen the law starts being enforced, Indiana will join more than a dozen states with abortion bans.\nThe Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly advanced the abortion-restricting measure during a heated, two-week special session that concluded in August 2022.\nIndiana governor signs near-total abortion ban\n\nThat made Indiana the first state in the nation to approve such legislation since the high court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe ban outlaws all abortions except in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly and cases of serious health risk to the mother. One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime.\u00a0\nRape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also strips abortion clinics of their state medical licenses, and provides that only hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers can provide abortions.\nUnder the law, surgical abortions can only be done in hospitals or standalone ambulatory surgical centers owned by a hospital.\nExisting Indiana law makes it a felony for a doctor to perform an illegal abortion, and under the newly-enacted legislation, most abortions will be illegal. There are no criminal penalties for women who seek abortions.\nThe final language of the ban states explicitly that it does not apply to in vitro fertilization, miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. The ban also will not limit access to the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill or any forms of contraception.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood said it plans to keep its four Indiana clinics that offer abortions open and provide sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment alongside contraception and cancer screenings, which it says comprise the bulk of its services.\nIndiana University Health, the state\u2019s largest hospital system, said it has advisory teams available for physician consultations on whether patients meet the legal requirements for abortions.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIndiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban isn\u2019t going back into effect \u2014 yet\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle August 1, 2023\nIndiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban isn\u2019t going back into effect \u2014 yet\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle August 1, 2023\n Despite confusion and hesitancy among health care providers, Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban will not take effect until the state Supreme Court certifies its June ruling.\nIndiana Supreme Court justices tossed out a wide-ranging preliminary injunction in late June when they largely upheld the state\u2019s abortion ban on constitutional liberty grounds.\u00a0\nBut until the high court certifies its decision, an injunction remains in place \u2014 blocking the new law from taking effect.\u00a0\nAt earliest, decisions can be certified 30 days after a ruling is issued.
