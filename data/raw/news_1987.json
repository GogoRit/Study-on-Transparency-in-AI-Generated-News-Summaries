(AP) \u2014 In front of an exuberant crowd, North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor vetoed legislation Saturday that would have banned nearly all abortions in his state after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Abortion-rights activists and voters watched on a plaza in the capital of Raleigh as Gov. Roy Cooper affixed his veto stamp to the bill in an unconventionally public display. The veto launches a major test for leaders of the GOP-controlled General Assembly to attempt an override vote after they recently gained veto-proof majorities in both chambers. The bill was the Republican response to last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to kick it into an even higher gear when that veto stamp comes down,\u201d Cooper told the crowd. \u201cIf just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women\u2019s reproductive health, we can stop this ban.\u201d\n\nAndrea Long, a 42-year-old mother of three from Cary, said she was honored be part of the \u201celectric\u201d crowd on what she called a \u201chistoric day for freedom\u201d in North Carolina. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop crying tears of joy seeing the governor hold up the veto stamp, but I know it\u2019s an uphill battle to keep this momentum going,\u201d Long said. In a statement provided late Saturday through Cooper\u2019s office, State Capitol Police Deputy Chief Terry Green said the crowd estimate was over 2,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Burns bruises NC State into the NCAA Tournament, and March Madness will be his next big chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad news for the bubble: NC State and Oregon swipe bids as wild tournament results continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s March Madness and more people than ever can legally bet on basketball games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooper, a strong abortion-rights supporter, had until Sunday night to act on the measure that tightens current state law, which bans most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The legislation passed along party lines last week in the House and Senate. Override voting could begin next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooper spent this week on the road talking about the bill\u2019s lesser-known details and urging residents to apply pressure upon key Republican lawmakers who were hesitant about further restrictions during their campaigns for office last year.\n\nRepublicans have pitched the measure as a middle-ground change to state abortion laws developed after months of private negotiations between House and Senate GOP members. It adds exceptions to the 12-week ban, extending the limit through 20 weeks for rape and incest and through 24 weeks for \u201clife-limiting\u201d fetal anomalies.Senate leader Phil Berger accused Cooper on Saturday of \u201cfeeding the public lies\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d members of his party to block the legislation. \u201cI look forward to promptly overriding his veto,\u201d he said in a statement.Cooper has said repeatedly the details contained in the 47-page bill show that the measure isn\u2019t a reasonable compromise and would instead greatly erode reproductive rights. He cites new obstacles for women to obtain abortions \u2014 such as requiring multiple in-person visits, additional paperwork to prove a patient has given their informed consent to an abortion and increased regulation of clinics providing the procedure.Cooper and allies have said those changes in practice will shut down clinics that cannot afford major upgrades mandated by new licensing standards and make it nearly impossible for women who live in rural areas or work long hours to access abortion services.\n\nCompared to recent actions by Republican-controlled legislatures elsewhere, the broad prohibition after 12 weeks can be viewed as less onerous to those in other states where the procedure has been banned almost completely. But abortion-rights activists have argued that it\u2019s more restrictive than meets the eye and will have far-reaching consequences. Since Roe was overturned, many patients traveling from more restrictive states have become dependent on North Carolina as a locale for abortions later in pregnancy.Republicans call the legislation pro-family and pro-child, pointing to at least $160 million in spending contained within for maternal health services, foster and adoption care, contraceptive access and paid leave for teachers and state employees after the birth of a child.Cooper has called out four GOP legislators \u2014 three House members and one senator \u2014 whom he said told voters last year that they would protect abortion access. Abortion-rights activists passed out fliers in the crowd Saturday with their names and office phone numbers. Anti-abortion groups criticized Cooper\u2019s cross-state campaign to sway one or more Republicans. \n\n\u201cThe way he\u2019s been showing up in their districts and harassing their constituents, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Wes Bryant, one of about 60 anti-abortion protesters gathered across the street from Cooper\u2019s rally for a prayer event.One of the House members Cooper singled out is Rep. Tricia Cotham, of Mecklenburg County, who voted for the bill mere weeks after she switched from the Democratic Party to the GOP. The move gave Republicans a veto-proof supermajority if all of their legislators are present and voting.\n\nCotham has spoken out for abortion rights in the past and even earlier this year co-sponsored a bill to codify abortion protections into state law. Rep. Ted Davis of Wilmington \u2014 another targeted legislator \u2014 was the only Republican absent from last week\u2019s initial House vote. The Senate margin already became veto-proof after GOP gains last November.Davis said last fall that he supported \u201cwhat the law is in North Carolina right now,\u201d which was a 20-week limit. Davis has declined to comment on the bill, but House Speaker Tim Moore said recently that Davis is a \u201cyes\u201d vote for an override. Like Berger, Moore accused Cooper of spreading misinformation about the bill \u201cto frighten voters\u201d and predicted a swift override in his chamber.___Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
