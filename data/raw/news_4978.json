WadeJun 24, 2022\n\n\n\n(Anchorage, AK) \u2013 Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy issued the following statement after today\u2019s decision by the United States Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cI like many Alaskans, am pro life. I also recognize that many Alaskans are pro choice. The recent decision by the Supreme Court returns the issue of abortion back to the states.\nI believe this presents an opportunity for the people of Alaska, not a handful of elected officials or appointed judges,\u00a0to decide the future of abortion in Alaska.\nI will therefore be introducing a resolution for a proposed constitutional amendment to the legislature in the next session to answer the question whether abortion shall, or not be a constitutionally protected right.\nI have always had faith in the people of Alaska to make the right decision when it comes to our constitution and protecting our fundamental rights and this issue is no different. My position on this issue\u00a0\u00a0has been made clear. Alaskans should have the opportunity to make their position clear as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent News\n\n\nGovernor Dunleavy has ordered that Alaska and the United States flags fly at half-staff in honor of Former Alaska State Senator Patrick M.
