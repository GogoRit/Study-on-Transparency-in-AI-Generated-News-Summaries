Additionally, expectant mothers would be offered an opportunity to see and hear an ultrasound of their child in the womb.\nThe new laws also banned risky late-term abortions in the sixth month of pregnancy and beyond, protecting women from a procedure that not only ends the life of the child, but can also have severe physical and psychological consequences for the mother.\nFurthermore, the new set of laws protected Montana\u2019s citizens, preventing them from being forced to pay for elective abortions.\nMontana\u2019s lawmakers recognized that the state has a duty to protect pregnant women from unnecessary medical risk and ensure that they are fully informed before they make life-ending and life-altering decisions.\nLeaders understood that many women can feel pressured into choosing abortion. They may not fully understand what the procedure entails. They may be completely unaware of the developmental stage of their unborn child. And they may think they have no other options. By making an irreversible, uniformed choice, they could be subjecting themselves to a lifetime of guilt and regret.\n\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood of Montana v. State of Montana\nAfter the new laws were passed in 2021, Planned Parenthood of Montana sued to block their implementation. Despite calling itself an organization dedicated to women\u2019s \u201chealth,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Montana is fighting these commonsense protections, several of which are already in place in many states. Just two years ago, in fact, Planned Parenthood  dropped a case in Arizona\u00a0that challenged similar health and safety protections in that state.\nIf Montana\u2019s laws are struck down, the only beneficiaries will be those who profit from abortion. Recently, Planned Parenthood of Montana claimed to have performed nearly 1,200 abortions a year. These new laws protect women and unborn babies, and only abortionists benefit when expectant mothers receive substandard care.\n\u00a0\nWhat's at stake?\nAll patients, including pregnant mothers, deserve the best care possible. That includes having all the information about their condition and the risks of any potential procedures offered by a physician.\n\u201cWomen in Montana deserve protections for their health and safety, and full information about any medical procedure. This is no less true for a woman who seeks out an abortion,\u201d  said ADF Senior Counsel Denise Harle, director of the ADF Center for Life.\n\u00a0\nCase timeline\n\nApril 2021: Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed into law four bills protecting the health and safety of women considering abortion.\nAugust 2021: Planned Parenthood of Montana filed suit to block implementation of the new laws.\nOctober 2021: A trial court  issued a preliminary injunction\u00a0in favor of Planned Parenthood of Montana.\nJanuary 2022: The Montana Attorney General, with Alliance Defense Freedom attorneys serving as co-counsel,  filed a brief\u00a0asking the Montana Supreme Court to deny Planned Parenthood\u2019s request to block enforcement of the laws.\n\n\u00a0\nThe bottom line\nPregnant women deserve health and safety. They don\u2019t forfeit that protection when they consider having an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Alliance Defending Freedom\n    \n\nADF team members contributed to the writing and publication of this article.\n\n\n\n        View Profile \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
