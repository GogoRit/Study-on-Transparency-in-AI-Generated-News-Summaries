The state association was founded in 1973, the same year the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Roe v. Wade ruling upholding a woman's right to abortion.\"I consider it one of the most important\u00a0issues that\u2019s been around since 1973,\" Montgomery said in a 2019 interview. \"Who we put in office can make a big difference in the ultimate\u00a0outcome. That\u2019s why we have a Kentucky Right to Life political action committee.\"While anti-abortion\u00a0bills have been contested\u00a0by supporters of abortion rights, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood, they have found support among lawmakers who oppose abortion.Sen. Whitney Westerfield, a Hopkinsville Republican who has sponsored some of the bills, praised Montgomery for her work.\"She's been a warrior for the cause of protecting unborn lives here in Kentucky,\" Westerfield said. \"I'm grateful to call her a friend. She'll be missed.\"Westerfield noted Montgomery also has received national recognition for her work.She has represented Kentucky on the board of the national Right to Life Committee since 1978, the news release said.

As we continue fighting for those who are unable to fight for themselves, I\u2019m grateful Kentucky has Margie to champion our cause,\" he said. \"It\u2019s an honor to join all those who celebrate her golden anniversary of advocacy. Elaine and I congratulate her on this milestone and wish her the best.\u201dMore headlines:Trump wants to 'go big' with stimulus, but McConnell prefers cheaper planThe Kentucky association did not announce who would replace Montgomery, but Diana Maldonado, its\u00a0president, praised Montgomery for her leadership and for her\u00a0\"life's work\" with Right to Life.\"As we move forward, we are grateful for her, her dedication, and her leadership,\" Maldonado\u00a0said in the news release.Montgomery, in the 2019 interview, said she was pleased that the number of abortions has declined in recent years\u00a0overall but said her association still has much work to do.\"We want to\u00a0wipe it out as much as we can and protect mothers and women from the effects of abortion,\" she said.Kentucky's legislature,\u00a0controlled by Republicans, has enacted an increasing number of anti-abortion measures in recent years though some\u00a0have been struck down by the federal courts as unconstitutional. In April, Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat who supports abortion rights, vetoed a measure\u00a0passed in the 2020 legislature that, among other provisions,\u00a0would shift more power to Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, to regulate abortion clinics in Kentucky.Reach Deborah Yetter at dyetter@courier-journal.com or 502-582-4228.
