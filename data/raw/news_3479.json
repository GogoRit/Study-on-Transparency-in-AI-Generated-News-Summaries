For Christians who believe human life begins at conception, losing a baby even early in pregnancy is a singular kind of grief. There are ministries for families suffering miscarriages, and many churches hold funerals or memorial services for babies who have died before they were born.\nBut pregnancy losses aren\u2019t merely a spiritual matter. They also have a clinical term: abortion. Miscarriages are described in medical language as \u201cspontaneous abortions.\u201d\nThat can lead to confusion as Americans debate abortion policy after a leaked draft opinion from the US Supreme Court signaled the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade. Outside of a medical context, \u201cabortion\u201d is used colloquially to describe \u201celective abortion,\u201d or the intentional killing of a healthy and growing preborn child.\nIn the aftermath of the leaked opinion, some abortion advocates have suggested that new abortion restrictions enacted could endanger health care for pregnant women. They worry that pregnancies that end through miscarriages or as a result of ectopic pregnancies will be wrapped into the new state laws.\nBut many Christian ob-gyns, including those at major antiabortion institutions, such as the Charlotte Lozier Institute and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) say restrictions on elective abortions have nothing to do with miscarriage care.\n\nThere are roughly 50,000 practicing ob-gyns in the United States. Less than a quarter of them perform abortions currently. On the other hand, treating both ectopic pregnancies and early miscarriages is a routine, though tragic, part of their practice, according to Dr. Donna Harrison, a Christian ob-gyn and CEO of AAPLOG.\nBoth Harrison and Dr. Ingrid Skop, also a Christian ob-gyn and the director of medical affairs at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, said abortion restrictions would have no effect on ectopic pregnancy removal or miscarriage care because those situations are different, both medically and morally, from elective abortion.Ectopic Pregnancy Care vs. Elective Abortion\nBut confusion persists. A few years ago, the Ohio state legislature considered a bill to prohibit health insurance companies from covering abortions. The bill never passed, but its sponsor, Republican Rep. John Becker (who no longer holds state office), suggested during a hearing that in cases of ectopic pregnancies, doctors should simply \u201cremove that embryo from the fallopian tube and reinsert it into the uterus.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not medically possible.\nRepresentative Becker\u2019s gaffe naturally made headlines. So did an Oklahoma Republican lawmaker during hearings for an abortion ban under consideration in that state last month. Senator Warren Hamilton suggested that including exceptions to the ban for \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d such as ectopic pregnancies could violate the spirit of \u201cjustice for all.\u201d\nMany states have enacted or are considering laws to prohibit abortion earlier in pregnancy than was previously thought to be legal under Roe. Most explicitly include provisions allowing for exceptions for medical emergencies, which would include ectopic pregnancies. But the evident confusion about ectopic pregnancies and abortion more generally has muddied the waters that pro-life advocates are trying now to navigate.\nDr. Skop said the confusion in terms\u2014between using \u201cabortion\u201d to describe the medical procedure after a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy versus using it to describe an elective abortion\u2014exists only in the public\u2019s imagination and not in medical practice.\n\u201cEven the most pro-life obstetrician will care for a woman with an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d she said. In fact, existing laws already protect women in such a situation from being denied care. \u201cThat is medical malpractice,\u201d Skop said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\nHarrison said that in about 5 percent of ectopic pregnancy cases, the baby\u2019s heartbeat is detectable even at the time of removal. Nevertheless, the baby has no chance of survival and could cause the mother\u2019s death if it is not removed.\nHarrison, who trained at a Catholic hospital and later worked at a Catholic medical practice, said she\u2019s never seen or heard of a single patient turned away from care for an ectopic pregnancy.\nHarrison and Skop said the critical difference between ectopic pregnancy removal and elective abortions is the medical intent of the procedures\u2014and the standards by which they are deemed successful.\u201cA \u2018failed\u2019 abortion is when the child fails to die,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThe purpose of an elective abortion is to produce a dead baby. In treating an ectopic pregnancy\u2026we can separate the mom and the baby so that the mom lives. Even though we know that the baby is going to die, our intent is to save the life of the mom. Our intent is not to produce a dead baby,\u201d she said.\nBefore treatment for an ectopic pregnancy can begin, however, ob-gyns must first diagnose it. That requires a scan, which isn\u2019t possible unless doctors see their patients in person. That\u2019s why Harrison, Skop, and many other antiabortion advocates oppose the newly relaxed rules surrounding what\u2019s known as the \u201cabortion pill.\u201d\nMiscarriage Care vs. Elective Abortion\nSkop said there are three common clinical responses to a miscarriage, depending on multiple medical factors. Some women can wait and allow their bodies to naturally expel the baby. Others will require surgery. And some can take medication to induce labor.\nOne medication commonly used in this situation is misoprostol, which is also the second drug prescribed as part of the two-drug regimen commonly referred to as the \u201cabortion pill.\u201d When doctors prescribe an abortion pill regimen to women seeking an elective abortion, they first prescribe mifepristone (also known as Mifeprex), which starves the growing baby of the progesterone her mother\u2019s body makes to feed her. Misoprostol is then taken hours or days later to induce labor.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) temporarily relaxed the rules governing the prescribing of the abortion pill regimen by allowing doctors to prescribe the pills via telemedicine without having examined a woman in person first. A few months ago, the FDA made that change permanent.\nThe problem, said Harrison, is that without an in-person visit, abortionists can\u2019t determine the age of a women\u2019s pregnancy, which affects the safety of the drug. Neither can they determine whether that pregnancy might be ectopic.\n\u201cThe symptoms of a rupturing ectopic pregnancy\u2026bleeding, pain, those are the same symptoms as a Mifeprex abortion,\u201d Harrison said. The FDA reports that at least two women have died after their ectopic pregnancy ruptured following the abortion pill regimen.So far, 19 states have enacted further restrictions on the abortion pill regimen. Some require doctors to see patients in person before prescribing the pills. Others have banned outright sending the pills by mail.\nSkop said the inherent risks of Mifeprex, including hemorrhage, make it subject to an FDA protocol called the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Doctors who want to prescribe Mifeprex, like any other drugs under this classification, have to undergo training and qualify for a specific certification. Skop said those FDA-imposed hurdles cost both time and money. As a result, she opted not to register to prescribe the drugs in her private practice.\n\u201cWe have many other interventions\u201d for women who are suffering a miscarriage, she said.\n\nStill, there has been some media coverage suggesting that pro-life pressure, not FDA regulations, have kept providers from prescribing the abortion pills, even in cases of miscarriage.\nHarrison said it is not clear whether taking the first pill, Mifeprex\u2014which starves the baby of progesterone\u2014in addition to the misoprostol offers any clinical advantage in a miscarriage.\n\u201cThere are a couple of studies where they found that the Mifeprex makes the woman\u2019s womb a little more sensitive to the second drug,\u201d Harrison said. But a known side effect of Mifeprex is increased bleeding, and Harrison said that danger outweighs any potential benefit in treating miscarriage.\nUltimately, Harrison said, restricting abortion\u2014including the prescribing of the abortion pill regimen for an elective abortion\u2014would have no legal impact on a doctor\u2019s ability to prescribe the drugs to treat miscarriage.\n\u201cThat\u2019s like saying, \u2018If you say that we\u2019re not going to have surgical abortion, then you cannot use a curette for anything else,\u2019\u201d Harrison said, referring to a metal instrument commonly used in surgeries and dentistry. \u201cThey\u2019re not restricting the use of Mifeprex and misoprostol. What they\u2019re restricting is doing an act, either with surgery or medication, with the primary purpose of killing the baby.\u201d\nEctopic pregnancy, miscarriage, and abortion do have three things in common: a woman, a baby, and a death. Harrison, Skop, and scores of other pro-life ob-gyns and activists believe that to intentionally cause the death of a woman\u2019s baby serves neither the baby nor the woman.But\u2014in keeping with the Christian ethic of treating the sick and vulnerable with care and dignity\u2014they also believe that a woman facing the natural death of her baby needs compassionate and careful medical care. They insist that care will continue even under legal restrictions on elective abortion.\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionMedicine and HealthPregnancyRoe v.
