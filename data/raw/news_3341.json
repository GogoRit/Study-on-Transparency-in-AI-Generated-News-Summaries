We\u2019ve been doing\u00a0the work behind the scenes, learning as much as we can about the issues and what the solutions are.\"I think people recognize that. So you\u2019re seeing momentum and we\u2019re seeing a payoff for really hard work. And we\u2019re just really excited about where it\u2019s going.\"Right to Life announced its decision less than three hours before a Republican gubernatorial debate on Mackinac Island at the Detroit Regional Chamber's Mackinac Policy Conference.Anna Visser, director of communications and education for Right to Life of Michigan, said the board of the organization's political action committee decided to support Dixon on Wednesday night.

Bill Huizenga, R-Holland, and Lisa McClain, R-Bruce Township.Like other Republicans vying for their party's nomination, Dixon also has been seeking former President Donald Trump's endorsement.
