    "description": "The world in which adolescents live has changed dramatically in the last 25 years and so have attitudes towards their sexual and reproductive health and rights. A new supplement in the Journal of Adolescent Health celebrates gains, confronts barriers, and makes recommendations for countries and key stakeholders to build on progress in the critical decade ahead.Developed by technical teams at WHO and UNFPA, the four published articles were co-authored by adolescents from six regions using a framework for meaningful engagement.Positive trends in adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights In 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) announced the arrival of adolescent sexuality and adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) on the global agenda. The world has gained an additional 163 million adolescents since then. There are now 1.2 billion young people aged 10-19 with diverse interests, needs, and concerns. Progress across gender and geography is strikingly unequal but shifting health and social changes reveal positive trends for many of them. Adolescent pregnancy has declined in almost all countries, with adolescent girls more likely to delay their first sexual experience and use contraceptives when they become sexually active. Child marriage has also fallen. In the years since ICPD, much-needed data on female genital mutilation (FGM) have emerged and shown the beginning of a decline in this human rights violation: from 35% in 2003 to 25% in 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa, and from 92% to 74% in Northern Africa.Inequalities across geography and gender In spite of greater public knowledge about needs and barriers to sexual and reproductive health and well-being, adolescents still risk falling into policy and service delivery gaps.Adolescents are the only age group in which HIV-related deaths are not decreasing. Ovarian and breast cancers have increased for adolescent girls aged 15-19, as has testicular cancer among adolescent boys in the Americas. The world still expects adolescents to adhere to specific gender norms. The supplement notes that girls are often taught to be \u2018modest and polite\u2019, whereas boys are considered \u2018brave and independent\u2019. These assumptions intersect with other inequalities and take a dangerous toll on sexual and reproductive rights: an alarming number of adolescent girls report that their first sexual experience was coerced, forced, or violent. A time-bound opportunityAdolescence is a dynamic stage of human development, biologically and socially distinct from other age groups. Adolescents have a right to make decisions governing their bodies and to access services that support those rights \u2013 and for the first time ever, the international agenda is paying attention. This supplement puts forward a vision for all adolescents to achieve and exercise their full potential. It identifies five areas for strategic action: political and social support; funding; policies and programmes; data and evidence and scale up with quality and equity.Applying a \u2018youth lens\u2019 to global trends of the last 25 years makes clear the importance of delivering the unfinished agenda of the ICPD Programme of Action. Protecting and promoting adolescent health unlocks a triple benefit: improved health and well-being now, in their future lives and for the future generations. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals absolutely requires the realization of adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights.\u00a0",

A new supplement in the\u00a0Journal of Adolescent Health\u00a0celebrates gains, confronts barriers, and identifies key areas of action for countries and key stakeholders to build on progress in the critical decade ahead.The four published articles were developed by technical teams at WHO and UNFPA, along with governments, academia, civil society, and funding organizations. They were co-authored by young people from six regions around the world. Some positive trends in adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights In 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) announced the arrival of adolescent sexuality and adolescent sexual and reproductive health on the global agenda. An additional 163 million adolescents (aged 10-19) have come of age since then. There are now 1.2 billion adolescents in the world, with diverse interests, needs, and concerns. Many of them are benefiting from shifting development, health, and social trends. There have been concrete improvements in some aspects of adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights. Many adolescents initiate sexual activity later than adolescents in the past. They less likely to have sex with a partner who they are not married to or living with and more likely to use condoms when they are sexually active.Girls are less likely to be married and to have children before age 18, more likely to use contraception and to obtain maternal health care. They are less likely to experience female genital mutilation, internationally recognised as a human rights violation. Slow progress for adolescents on other key issuesIn spite of greater awareness of the sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents, some key issues have not improved. In many contexts, menstruation is still seen as a taboo topic. Adolescents are the only age group in which HIV-related deaths are not decreasing and from the limited data available, their levels of other sexually transmitted infections are high and growing. An unacceptably high proportion of adolescent girls have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence. There is still a lack of good data on levels of unsafe abortion among adolescents, and the risk of mortality and morbidity resulting from it.When it comes to gender, adolescents are still expected to conform to specific gender norms. The supplement notes that girls are taught to be \u2018modest and polite\u2019, whereas boys are encouraged to be \u2018brave and independent\u2019. These expectations can worsen other inequalities such as those related to poverty, education and employment, and contribute to differences in adolescent health and well-being along gender lines. For example, while boys are more likely to experience injuries and to use tobacco and alcohol, girls are more likely to experience intimate partner violence. A time-bound opportunityProgress over the last 25 years has strengthened the position of adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights on global, regional and national agendas. There is more investment and a growing evidence-base, with committed advocacy movements and strong governmental responses in a small but increasing number of countries. This presents new opportunities for all adolescents to achieve and exercise their full potential.Looking forward, the supplement\u00a0lays out specific considerations for delivering a comprehensive package of sexual and reproductive health interventions to adolescents. It also proposes specific actions in relation to five strategic areas: political and social support, funding, laws and policies, data and evidence, and the implementation of programmes at scale with quality and equity. Adolescents have a right to make decisions governing their bodies and to access services that support those rights \u2013 and more so than ever before, the international agenda is paying attention.\n\n\n\nFact sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent pregnancy\n2 June 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale genital mutilation\n5 February 2024\n\n\n\n\nFeature stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting adolescents with HPV vaccine\n5 September 2018\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Youth Day\n\n\n12 August 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\nEastern Mediterranean\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\nWestern Pacific\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\nCyber security\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nPermissions and licensing\n\n\nPreventing sexual exploitation\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nReport misconduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\nPrivacy policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\u00a9\n\n2024\n\nWHO\n\n                       \n"
