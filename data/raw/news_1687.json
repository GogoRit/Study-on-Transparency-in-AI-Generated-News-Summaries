Wade nullified that request and no actual harm to providers had yet happened.\u00a0\nPassed by the Republican-majority legislature two years ago and signed by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, the law threatened doctors and others who helped finance an abortion with revoked licenses and criminal penalties if they knew the reason for the abortion was because of a genetic abnormality and it isn\u2019t a medical emergency. Doctors faced a class 6 felony and others who helped finance it could have been charged with a class 3 felony.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nThe law was ultimately blocked the same year it was passed under the auspices of the constitutional right to an abortion, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that right last year and also allowed the 2021 ban itself to go into effect. Because the genetic abnormality ban included a provision that explicitly stated it didn\u2019t supersede the 1864 near-total ban Arizona was under at the time, its reimplementation then was a moot point.\u00a0\nOver the summer, pro-abortion groups including the National Council of Jewish Women Arizona and local abortion providers sought a renewed injunction to block the genetic abnormality ban again. They argued that the law was unconstitutionally vague and threatened real harm to doctors across the Grand Canyon State.\nCivia Tamarkin, president of the National Council of Jewish Women Arizona, told the Arizona Mirror that the argument from then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who defended the ban, was insufficient and left doctors open to criminal charges even if a patient didn\u2019t tell them the reason they were seeking an abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cBrnovich\u2019s office basically argued in court: \u2018Don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we also have mandatory sonograms in this state. A provider could look at the sonogram, blood tests and other preliminary medical procedures and, obviously, be able to deduce the reason.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat did the judge say?\nRayes wasn\u2019t convinced. He noted that the harm warned by abortion advocates hasn\u2019t occurred \u2014 effectively disqualifying that argument. No provider has yet had the genetic abnormality law used against them, and theoretical harm isn\u2019t something that can be ruled on. A claim brought because a law is vague, he added, is only valid if the law in question trespasses on a constitutional right, and the Dobbs ruling from the high court means that the constitutional right to receive or perform an abortion no longer exists.\u00a0\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 ability to provide (abortion) care without undue state interference is a battle fought and lost in Dobbs,\u201d Rayes wrote.\u00a0\nAnother argument that the provisions in the law \u2014 dubbed the \u201cReason Regulations\u201d \u2014 chilled the free speech of doctors by preventing them from counseling patients for fear of being found in violation of the ban was also dismissed.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing in the Reason Regulations penalizes Plaintiffs for their counseling or related speech,\u201d Rayes said. \u201cThe Reason Regulations operate only when Plaintiffs take the additional step of performing, or soliciting or accepting money to finance, an abortion knowing that the patient seeks (it) because of the presence or presumed presence of a fetal genetic abnormality\u2026all of which is conduct not speech.\u201d\nWhat does the future look like?\u00a0\nTamarkin said her group is taking stock of their options, and may explore using a different approach to challenge the ban. She noted that, as a Jewish organization, one path may be to use the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Judaism supports the termination of a pregnancy if a woman\u2019s well-being is at stake. Tamarkin added that the ban may conflict with the current law of the land, which allows elective abortions up to the 15 week mark.\u00a0\n\u201cAbortion is legal up until 15 weeks \u2014 except now (not) for reason of genetic anomalies,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an inconsistency, and the laws are not harmonious.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear if this argument would work, as the law includes a provision that details it doesn\u2019t repeal any other laws regulating abortion that came before it \u2014 a caveat that was the subject of much confusion and litigation as state leaders vied over enforcing it or the 1864 near-total ban.\u00a0\nWhile current Attorney General Kris Mayes has vowed not to defend any abortion bans her predecessor did, and campaigned on a promise to protect reproductive rights, Tamarkin still worries that future efforts to strike the genetic-abnormality ban from the books could face opposition from other anti-abortion groups.\u00a0\n\u201cIf the current attorney general does not defend the state\u2019s (previous) position, I suspect that there will be interested parties who might,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nOn Friday, Planned Parenthood of Arizona, which runs four of the state\u2019s nine abortion clinics, announced it intended to present Gov. Katie Hobbs with a list of suggested executive orders the organization would like her to issue. Among them is one to provide civil and criminal legal protections for patients, medical personnel and others who assist with abortion care. Such an order could potentially preempt any consequences from the genetic abnormality ban, if it\u2019s enforced in the future.\u00a0\nThe organization\u2019s CEO, Brittany Fonteno, lamented Rayes\u2019 ruling and said access to abortion care should be free of outside interference.\u00a0\n\u201c(This is) a devastating, harmful ban that is designed to keep people from making their own decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cPoliticians should never have a hand in creating people\u2019s families. These sacred and personal decisions really should remain between a provider and their patient.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXFederal judge allows Arizona to implement genetic-abnormality abortion ban\nby Gloria Rebecca Gomez, Arizona Mirror January 20, 2023\nFederal judge allows Arizona to implement genetic-abnormality abortion ban\nby Gloria Rebecca Gomez, Arizona Mirror January 20, 2023\n A ruling Thursday from a federal judge that reinstates an abortion ban from 2021 has once again complicated the legal landscape for providers in Arizona.\u00a0\nU.S. District Court Judge Douglas Rayes refused to block a law that prohibits doctors from performing abortions due to the fetus\u2019 genetic abnormality, saying that the overturning of Roe v.
