She modeled her approach after that of Thurgood Marshall on race discrimination, planning for a series of cases at the Supreme Court, each precedent paving the way for the next that would further expand rights and protections. In 1993, she joined the court as an associate justice, and over the decades became a cultural icon beloved for her vision and passion in defending the rights of women.\u00a0Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn in 1933 to Jewish parents with roots in Eastern Europe. Her mother Celia, who died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school, instilled in her a sense of independence and a love of learning. She went on to Cornell University, where at 17, she met her future husband, Martin Ginsburg. They married after graduation, and soon had a daughter, Jane.\u00a0Ginsburg attended Harvard Law School, where women were barred from living in the dorms and from using certain campus facilities. When the dean hosted a dinner for the first-year women, Ginsburg recalled, \u201cHe asked each of us to stand up and tell him what we were doing taking a seat that could be occupied by a man.\u201d\nDiscrimination dogged her early career. After transferring to Columbia Law School, she graduated first in her class, but she had trouble getting a job. She later accepted a position teaching civil procedure at Rutgers Law School, where her employers informed her that she would be paid less than her male colleagues because she had a husband who earned a good income. She and other female professors filed a federal class-action discrimination case against the university, and won. For fear of demotion, she hid her pregnancy with her son, James, until after her contract renewal. Simply living her personal and professional life at a time of openly discriminatory policies for women had positioned her to fight.\nIn the late 1960s, Ginsburg began volunteering for the ACLU, and soon wrote a brief in the case Reed v. Reed. Sally Reed had separated from her husband, and when their son died, both parents sought to be appointed the executor of his estate. Idaho law automatically appointed the father because he was a man. Ginsburg named as co-authors on the brief two women lawyers whose ideas had helped build her arguments: Dorothy Kenyon, an early advocate for women\u2019s rights, and Pauli Murray, a brilliant African American activist who had pioneered the argument for applying the 14th Amendment to women\u2019s rights. In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled for Sally Reed, the first time it would strike down a law for treating men and women differently. The court ruled that giving a mandatory preference to one sex is \u201cthe very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d In an ACLU memo, Ginsburg called the victory \u201ca small, guarded step.\u201d\nIn 1972, Ginsburg joined the ACLU as the founding director of the new Women\u2019s Rights Project. That same year, she also accepted a job as the first female tenured law professor at Columbia. \u00a0\u00a0In the early \u201870s, gender discrimination affected most aspects of life. The Women\u2019s Rights Project tallied hundreds of federal laws that discriminated on the basis of sex \u2014 in education, employment, reproductive rights mortgages, credit cards, loans, house rentals, prison, and the military. Most legal scholars believed the law should treat women differently, to protect them. For instance, some laws prevented female employees from lifting more than 15 pounds, or working at night. Some lawyers were beginning to take on cases of sex discrimination, often to help a specific woman, not necessarily with a view toward changing the law on gender equality. Ginsburg wanted to do just that.\nIn 1973, Ginsburg took on another Supreme Court case. Sharron Frontiero was an Air Force officer whose husband, Joseph, had been denied the housing and medical benefits that female spouses of male Air Force officers received automatically.\nIn writing both muscular and spare, Ginsburg expanded the scope of her brief to encompass the history of women\u2019s subjugation, with references to Alexis de Tocqueville and Alfred Lord Tennyson, and pared down the language to a precise and devastating argument. \u201cThat\u2019s when it dawned on me how brilliant she is,\u201d said Brenda Feigen, then co-directing the Women\u2019s Rights Project with Ginsburg. \u201cShe was at her most creative and profound,\u201d she said. \u201cShe told the story of sex discrimination \u2014 how it had been and how it had to end.\u201d\nIt was in Frontiero that Ginsburg gave her first oral argument before the Supreme Court. \u201cI knew that I was speaking to men who didn\u2019t think there was any such thing as gender-based discrimination and my job was to tell them it really exists,\u201d she has said. To make the point to the nine men who were sitting on the bench, she quoted the nineteenth-century women\u2019s-rights advocate Sarah Grimk\u00e8: \u201cI ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.\u201d She apparently succeeded. Feigen, who was by Ginsburg\u2019s side in the court, recalled, \u201cThere was not a single question from any of the justices. They must have been transfixed.\u201d\u00a0Ginsburg\u2019s team won the case. Yet they did not convince a majority of the justices that sex discrimination should be treated exactly like racial discrimination. \u201cMy expectation, to be candid, was that I would repeat that kind of argument, maybe half a dozen times. I didn\u2019t expect it to happen in one fell swoop,\u201d Ginsburg later said.\u00a0While at the ACLU, Ginsburg played a role in 34 Supreme Court cases, and won five of the six cases she argued before the court \u2014 Frontiero, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, Califano v. Goldfarb, Duren v. Missouri, and Edwards v. Healy. Many of her cases involved sex discrimination against men, which she felt might rouse more sympathy among the male justices, and show that discrimination hurts everyone.\nGinsburg sometimes said that one of her favorite cases involved a man whose wife died in childbirth, leaving him alone to care for their newborn son. Stephen Wiesenfeld\u2019s wife had been the primary breadwinner, and upon her death, he went to the local Social Security office to inquire about survivors\u2019 benefits for a parent and learned that he didn\u2019t qualify because he was a man. Ginsburg convinced the Supreme Court that the section of the Social Security Act that denied fathers benefits because of their sex was unconstitutional. She won a unanimous decision.\u00a0\u201cRuth was careful to build brick upon brick,\u201d said Aryeh Neier, then executive director of the ACLU. \u201cShe wanted to create a stable structure. She wasn\u2019t interested in reaching for the roof right away. In my tenure at the ACLU, this was the most clearly planned litigation strategy.\u201d\u00a0Ginsburg\u2019s legacy would be felt at the ACLU long after her departure in 1980 to become a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals.\u00a0President Clinton nominated Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1993. She was introduced at her confirmation hearing by Eleanor Holmes Norton, Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from Washington D.C., who had served as the assistant legal director at the ACLU. \u201cWhen Ruth Ginsburg founded the ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project, today\u2019s axiom that the 14th Amendment applies to women was not axiomatic at all,\u201d she said. \u201cJudge Ginsburg has spent her life making things how they ought to be. Using her gifted mind, honed by indefatigably hard work, she has used the law, always carefully, always defensibly, for all of those left at the margins, for want of a lawyer or a judge with the brilliance and commitment to pull them mainstream. As a lawyer, she was an activist intellectual who brought grace to both roles.\u201d\u00a0The last to testify at her confirmation hearing was Stephen Wiesenfeld, the widower for whom Ginsburg won Social Security benefits some 20 years earlier when she was at the ACLU. He described his experience of being a newly-widowed father struggling to raise his son without his wife\u2019s Social Security benefits and how Ginsburg \u201csaw immediately the gains, the consequences, and the long range effects and the logistics of revising this inequity in the Social Security system.\u201d\u00a0Sen. Joe Biden, then the Chairman of the U.S Senate Committee on the Judiciary, thanked Wiesenfeld for his testimony and added, \u201cI shared a similar fate that you did in 1972 and raised two children with a professional wife who had passed away, and it is amazing how much has changed.\u201d\nGinsburg was confirmed to the court in a vote of 96 to 3.\u00a0On the court, Ginsburg continued her efforts to push for full gender equality under the 14th Amendment. In 1996, she wrote the decision in United States v. Virginia, which struck down the male-only admission policy at the Virginia Military Institute and established a new standard of review for sex discrimination cases.\u00a0Over time, as the court became more conservative, Ginsburg also became more pointed in her dissents.\u00a0In 2006, the court ruled against Lilly Ledbetter, who had been paid less than male colleagues in comparable jobs at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. In a rare move, Ginsburg, then the sole woman justice on the court, read her blistering dissent aloud from the bench. \u201cThe court does not comprehend\u2026the insidious way that women can be victims to discrimination,\u201d she accused. \u201cThe ball is in Congress\u2019 court.\u201d A few years later, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law.\u00a0Then in 2013, the court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \u201cRace-based voting discrimination still exists,\u201d she rebuked her colleagues, again reading her dissent. Dismantling the act, she said later, was \u201clike throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d\u00a0In a country hungry for integrity and for leadership fighting the erosion of civil rights, a new generation of young women branded Ginsburg \u201cThe Notorious RBG\u201d on social media, and showed their esteem for her in unexpected ways. Children dressed up as Ginsburg for Halloween, her face appeared on tattoos, pillows, and shower curtains, and her story was told in a documentary and a feature film, multiple biographies, and several children\u2019s books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About the Issues on This Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Civil Liberties                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                News & Commentary                            \n\n \n\n\n\n                                News & Commentary                            \nDespair and Resignation Are Not A Strategy: How to Fight Back In A Second Trump Term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                News & Commentary                            \n\n \n\n\n\n                                News & Commentary                            \nChallenging the Racist Death Penalty in North Carolina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                News & Commentary                            \n\n \n\n\n\n                                News & Commentary                            \nLooking to the Future: 2024 at the ACLU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nACLU Kids Tell Us How We Can Do Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
