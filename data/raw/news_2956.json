Wade. She is the first Black female nominee for the office.In a press release, Democrats for Life said Flowers sought the group\u2019s endorsement by filling out a standard form on the group\u2019s website. They claimed that Flowers changed her views on abortion from what she initially presented.Flowers said Democrats for Life was aware of her stance from the beginning.\u201cI\u2019ve always stated that women have the right to do they want to do health-wise for their own bodies,\u201d Flowers said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cPeople just took that out to left field, but I\u2019ve always been pro-choice.\u201dAccording to their website, Democrats for Life states that they believe \u201claws should prosecute doctors and clinics who profit from abortion\u201d and call for Democrats to \u201cpass laws protecting pre-born life.\u201d\u201cMs. Flowers sought DFLA endorsement for her gubernatorial race by posing as a pro-life Democrat,\u201d wrote director Kristen Day in a statement. \u201cThe organization spent significant time and resources working to further her campaign. We were profoundly shocked when she started issuing confusing statements and ultimately changed her position to pro-choice.\u201dFlowers\u2019 social media and platform doesn\u2019t specifically mention abortion, but her interview responses have been generally favorable of abortion remaining legal in the state.Flowers told AL.com in June that she believes abortion should be legal for safety reasons, though she did add that she would like to see counseling for patients considering pregnancy termination.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to ban abortion, but abortions need to be done safely,\u201d Flowers said during the interview. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sway them, I\u2019m not trying to change their minds, but just giving them information and informed choices so that they can make a real choice.\u201dAccording to the most recent data from the Public Religion Research Institute, 42% of Alabamians surveyed believe that abortion should be legal in some or all cases, with 52% saying it should be illegal. When it comes to candidates and voting, 22% said it was non-negotiable that the candidate share their views on abortion. Contrastingly, 28% said it wasn\u2019t a major issue that would change their vote, while the 45% majority said it was one of many important issues.Day wrote that the \u201clack of courage and integrity by the candidate only harms the Alabama Democratic party\u201d and will negatively impact the party\u2019s ability to win seats.Flowers will face Republican incumbent Gov. Kay Ivey in Nov. A recent poll from Morning Consult showed that 62% of registered voters surveyed in Alabama approved of Ivey\u2019s performance.Alabama\u2019s highest office has remained solidly Republican since 2003. Pew Research Center reported that 50% of Alabamians consider themselves conservative, while 29% say they\u2019re moderate.\u201cIn a year where Republicans are heavily favored, a moderate position of a meaningful safe, legal and rare position with expanded support for pregnant women would have gained traction with the Alabama electorate,\u201d said Rev. Harriet Bradley, director of African American outreach for Democrats for Life. \u201cOverall this push for radical abortion values indicates a lack of seriousness for Democrats in this red state.\u201dDemocrats for Life America could not be reached for additional comment.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
