But it\u2019s also a moment the movement has long prepared for. This summer, the Supreme Court ruled on two cases involving access to reproductive services. The first, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, addressed a Louisiana law that required admitting privileges at nearby hospitals for doctors performing abortions. The court found this requirement unconstitutional, allowing the three abortion providers currently in operation in the state to remain open. The second case, Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, involved an executive order by the Trump administration allowing employers to deny contraception coverage to employees on religious or moral grounds. In this case, the court ruled in favor of the administration, resulting in as many as 126,000 workers losing their contraceptive coverage.[1]\nThese cases represent two strategies used today by the anti-abortion movement. June Medical Services illustrates what is commonly referred to as the women-centered strategy, in which abortion restrictions are discussed as necessary for protecting women\u2019s health and wellbeing.[2] This putatively women-centered legislation, adopted around the nation, tends to involve additional requirements for both patients and providers. For patients, this has resulted in required wait times and ultrasounds, mandatory in-person counseling, as well as requiring abortion providers to distribute medically inaccurate information, such as claiming a link between abortion and breast cancer, or abortion reversal.[3] For providers, legislation typically consists of excessive and unnecessary regulation of staff and physical clinics that are similar to the standards expected at ambulatory surgical centers (where procedures tend to have much higher risk) and facility requirements regarding the size and width of the rooms and corridors.[4] \n\n\n\nThis putatively women-centered legislation, adopted around the nation, tends to involve additional requirements for both patients and\u00a0providers.\n\n\n\n\nLittle Sisters of the Poor exemplified another anti-abortion strategy: limiting reproductive healthcare access through protections for third-party actors, such as employers, insurance companies, and taxpayers.[5] The most common types of third-party legislation restrict the use of taxpayer money to fund abortion services, or expands health professionals\u2019 right to refuse participation in activities that violate their religious or moral beliefs (such as a pharmacist who refuses to sell emergency contraception).[6] \nA third strategy used by the movement\u2014and the one most commonly recognized by the general public\u2014is the fetus-centered approach. This strategy is based on the claim that the fetus, from the moment of conception, is a human being deserving equal protection under the law. While the fetus or \u201cunborn child\u201d is often the most prominent focus of the anti-abortion movement, until now, the most effective arguments have been the need to protect women\u2019s and third-party actors\u2019\u00a0rights.\nThe Incremental\u00a0Approach\nIn the wake of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling, Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion organizations and supporters had a singular goal: to convince the general public and lawmakers of the need to eliminate the practice of abortion and protect \u201cunborn children.\u201d However, despite a modest increase in membership and outreach capabilities in the 1980s, the movement failed to secure any large-scale policy changes.[7] In the 1990s, in an attempt to expand its base of support beyond the evangelical or Christian Right, movement leaders adopted a new message: that their goal wasn\u2019t only protecting fetuses, but also women, business owners, and taxpayers.[8] \nThis strategy emerged after market research sponsored by the National Right to Life Committee (NLRC), which found that the public believed the movement fails to care for women\u2019s health and wellbeing, identifying this as the primary deficiency of the movement.[9] The fetus-centered strategy thus seemed to prevent the movement from addressing the issue of women\u2019s right to choose. John Willke, then-president of the NRLC,[10] recognized that this was a significant failure, since, \u201cwhile three-fourths or more of the people in the United States now admitted this [fetus] was a child who was killed, two-thirds of the same people felt that it was all right to give the woman the right to kill.\u201d[11] The anti-abortion movement, therefore, appeared to be indifferent\u2014even apathetic and uncaring\u2014to women, particularly those in difficult or painful\u00a0situations. \n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling, Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion organizations and supporters had a singular goal: to convince the general public and lawmakers of the need to eliminate the practice of abortion and protect \u201cunborn children.\u201d\n\n\n\nTweet this\n\n\nThe anti-abortion movement responded by adopting a new approach, emphasizing the fetus as well as the woman, branding their new strategy \u201cLove Them Both.\u201d An early boost for the new strategy came with the 1992 SCOTUS decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, which ruled that almost all of Pennsylvania\u2019s 1982 law centered on protecting women was constitutional. Ever since, the anti-abortion movement has promoted the \u201cmutual benefits\u201d[12] argument, redefining itself as a movement working with the same sense of compassion and caring toward the mother as the fetus. And the approach both helped rebrand the movement and led to concrete policy\u00a0change.\nBoth the women-centered and third-party actors\u2019 strategies\u2014promoted by major organizations like National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and Americans United for Life (AUL)\u2014have adopted an incremental approach to slowly restrict abortion access, emphasizing women\u2019s health and safety as well as protecting the freedom of taxpayers and employers, while downplaying theological and religious\u00a0motivations. \nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and the Alliance Defending Freedom, for example, have represented a considerable number of anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) that have challenged city ordinances requiring greater transparency and accountability about their purpose and motivations.[13] In a case involving a CPC in Baltimore, Maryland, an anti-abortion organization sued the city over a law requiring pregnancy clinics that don\u2019t offer or refer women to abortion services to post signs disclosing that fact in their waiting rooms. While the court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it violates free speech, anti-abortion organizations framed the verdict as a win for women\u2019s rights and wellbeing. Right after winning the case, Carol Clews, the executive director of the\u00a0CPC that sued the city, stated, \u201cwe are committed to serving women in need in a way that respects their choices, comforts them in a difficult time and is in line with our mission.\u201d[14]\nOver the last couple of years, state-level anti-abortion legislation has been promoted through model bills created by organizations like AUL.[15] From 2010 to 2018, more than 400 abortion-related bills that were written by special-interest groups were introduced in 41 states, and 69 of them passed into law.[16] The model legislation variously include laws preventing drug-induced abortion,[17] restrictions on taxpayer funding for abortions,[18] and excessive reporting requirements for abortion providers, which experts fear are meant to intimidate providers and patients.[19] Model anti-abortion legislation has also been used in drafting many \u201cconscience\u201d clauses, which establish legal protections for health professionals who refuse to participate in abortion or related services on the basis of religion or moral grounds.[20] \nThe women-centered and third-party strategies have been effective in expanding the anti-abortion movement beyond its more traditional, religious base. Additionally, these strategies have also been the main\u2014and sometimes only\u2014successful method to secure anti-abortion policy. Since 1973, the anti-abortion movement and its supporters have worked to introduce approximately 1,480 bills in Congress aimed at restricting access to reproductive services. About 42 percent focus on the fetus, including attempts to establish legal personhood or restrictions on abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected. The remainder either focus on the rights of third-party interests (35 percent), or are framed as protecting women from harm during an abortion procedure (22 percent), including restrictions on patients and abortion facilities. \n\n\n\n\nThe women-centered and third-party strategies have been effective in expanding the anti-abortion movement beyond its more traditional, religious base. Additionally, these strategies have also been the main\u2014and sometimes only\u2014successful method to secure anti-abortion\u00a0policy.\n\n\n\n\nBut most of these legislative attempts failed; only 111 federal laws currently restrict access to abortion services. Among these laws, the majority focuses on third-party interests, with 107 restricting the use of taxpayer funds to pay for reproductive services. Of the other four, three are framed around protecting the fetus, such as the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, which defines a \u201cperson\u201d as any infant born alive at \u201cany stage of development\u201d and was supported unanimously by the Senate.[21]\nThe anti-abortion movement has proven much more successful in securing legislation at the state level. Since 1973, states passed just under 1,200 laws restricting access to reproductive services. Of these laws, 52 percent are women-centered legislation, 20 percent are fetus-centered and 29 percent are third-party protections (primarily restricting taxpayer money from funding abortion services). Throughout the years, the proportion of these three different types of state laws has remained relatively\u00a0stable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nData collected and compiled by the authors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first look, it seems that the women-centered and fetus-centered strategies are much more successful at the state level than in Congress. In practice, however, many of the laws, particularly those that are fetus-centered, have failed to deliver lasting success for the movement. Many have been immediately blocked by courts as unconstitutional, including laws that ban abortion before viability, which prevent abortion after a heartbeat is detected, and \u201ctrigger laws,\u201d which are meant to go into effect in the event Roe is overturned.[22] Some women-centered legislation, such as Louisiana\u2019s recently overturned law regarding admitting privileges, was also blocked by the courts, although not as often as fetus-centered laws.[23]\u00a0\nIn light of this data, it\u2019s clear that the most effective strategy for limiting access to reproductive services has been legislation that focuses either on women or third-party actors. Over the last few years, however, more radical elements of the movement have been gaining support and traction in the broader political sphere. This drive towards larger, more dramatic attempts to overturn Roe v. Wade has been largely influenced by the Trump administration and its rhetoric, as well as recent changes to the Supreme Court makeup. The second of Trump\u2019s appointees, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is considered particularly driven by ideology and has been classified as the second-most conservative Justice, establishing a solidly conservative majority on the Court.[24] Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation in 2018 has led supporters to presume that the moment for major changes to abortion law is finally possible. The rapid confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court provokes concern regarding abortion-related cases currently before the court. Additionally, given the torrent of state-level anti-abortion bills following Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment, the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Justice Barrett may elicit further legislation in this vein among the\u00a0states.\n\n\n\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s confirmation in 2018 has led supporters to presume that the moment for major changes to abortion law is finally possible.\n\n\n\nTweet this\n\n\n\u201cBring this bill to a vote before the roses and babies\u00a0die\u201d\nThe fetus-centered approach has had lasting traction among more radical elements of the anti-abortion movement. However, recent changes in the political environment have helped stimulate considerable anti-abortion grassroots energy and activism. As a result of these political changes, in the last three years there has been a significant increase in the number of states\u2019 attempts to legislate a complete ban on abortion.[25] \u00a0 \nData source: Guttmacher State Legislation Tracker, https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy.One effort to ban abortion entirely\u2014or almost entirely\u2014are bills commonly referred to as \u201cheartbeat bans.\u201d This type of legislation would ban abortion before viability and after a fetal heartbeat has been detected. Janet Porter, who previously was the legislative director at Ohio Right to Life founded the more extremist, anti-LGBTQ organization Faith2Action, has been lobbying in Ohio since 2011 for the passage of a heartbeat ban.[26] The heartbeat bill\u2014a piece of model legislation created by Porter\u2014prohibits abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy. For years, the bill\u2019s radical nature led most legislators to reject it, as did Porter\u2019s intense and over-the-top lobbying style, which included having children distribute teddy bears with audible \u201cheartbeats\u201d to all Ohio state representatives, as well as delivering 2,000 roses to lawmakers along with notes reading, \u201cBring this bill to a vote before the roses and babies die.\u201d[27] During legislative hearings in 2011, Porter even brought two pregnant women before a public hearing, so a projection of their ultrasounds could serve as their fetuses \u201ctestifying\u201d before the committee.[28] \nPorter\u2019s actions generated considerable ire among most lawmakers and frustration for the larger, more mainstream national anti-abortion organizations, many of which saw her advocacy efforts as ineffective at best, and a \u201cdangerous gamble\u201d or harmful to the cause at worst. In an interview with Vox, Steven Aden, AUL\u2019s general counsel, said, \u201cWe think these kinds of early-gestation bans have been proven to be ineffective. There are more effective ways to express the state\u2019s interest in protecting human life and women considering abortion.\u201d [29]\nSimilar tensions between larger, mainstream organizations, and this emergent radical wing of the anti-abortion movement have appeared in other states. When Tennessee\u2019s legislature debated a heartbeat ban, SB 1236, which had an amendment that would declare abortions performed after the detection of fetal heartbeat a Class C felony,[30] NRLC General Counsel James Bopp called the bill\u2019s language\u00a0\u201cirrational.\u201d \n\u201cIn developing legislation we have to live in the real world\u2026We have precedent that we cannot avoid with a clever legal argument,\u201d[31] Bopp testified to the state\u2019s Senate Judiciary\u00a0Committee. \nA local newspaper further quoted Bopp noting, with respect to SB 1236, \u201cIt makes us look foolish, and I don\u2019t want to look foolish.\u201d[32]\u00a0 \nEven Tennessee Right to Life, AUL, and the state\u2019s Catholic bishops opposed the bill. When the bill moved into the General Assembly for a vote, a joint statement from the leaders of the Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville dioceses declared, \u201cWhile we wholeheartedly support the intention of the \u2018Heartbeat Bill\u2019 being considered by the Tennessee legislature, we must also be prudent in how we combat the pro-abortion evil that dwells in our state.\u201d[33] They also noted the potentially high cost for the state, given the legal fights that would result if the bill passed. The state attorney general also questioned an earlier version of the same bill, HB 1189, which passed in 2017, describing it as \u201cconstitutionally suspect\u201d and unlikely to survive the inevitable and drawn-out court battles sure to follow.[34] \nYet, despite the opposition of these larger anti-abortion organizations, a few months later HB 108[35] sailed through the state\u2019s lower house, with one legislator dismissing the cost of court challenges by declaring, \u201cwe owe it our taxpayers to use every available resource to save babies\u2019 lives.\u201d[36] The same happened in Ohio. In every state legislative session, the \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d was introduced, and it finally passed into law in 2019.[37] As of September 2020, there are three states with attempted bans on abortion at conception, seven states with attempted bans at six weeks from last menstrual period (LMP), one state with an attempted ban at eight weeks LMP, and one with an attempted ban at 12 weeks LMP. However, all of them have been blocked, either permanently or temporarily, by court orders.[38] This success of the anti-abortion movement is attributed to lawmakers responding to efforts to loosen abortion restrictions in other states, as well as changes in the Supreme Court, and the goal to force it to consider a ban on abortions.[39]\n\n\n\n\nThis success of the anti-abortion movement is attributed to lawmakers responding to efforts to loosen abortion restrictions in other states, as well as changes in the Supreme Court, and the goal to force it to consider a ban on abortions.\n\n\n\nTweet this\n\n\nThe recent increase in fetus-centered legislation\u2014including heartbeat bans and other pre-viability restrictions\u2014is largely the result of growing restlessness among some in the anti-abortion movement, frustrated by the failure of the incremental approach to stop abortion altogether or deter women from obtaining abortions. Ultrasound requirements, for example, were predicated on the assumption that once a pregnant person views their \u201cunborn child,\u201d they would see its humanity and choose not to abort. Instead, research has clearly demonstrated that while ultrasound requirements impose burdens on patients, it rarely changes their minds.[40] \nBut changes in SCOTUS\u2014particularly the appointment of Trump\u2019s nominee Amy Coney Barrett, which is expected to result in the most conservative court in decades\u2014has led to growing demands for bigger, broader change in abortion policy. They\u2019ve also been encouraged by Trump, who has also fueled radical anti-abortion forces by making false accusations, such as his claims that U.S. doctors are \u201cexecuting\u201d babies after birth.[41] These trends are reinforcing the most radical parts of the anti-abortion movement and will result\u2014even before overturning Roe\u2014in severely limited access to reproductive services in the United\u00a0States. \nBeyond Roe\nUntil recently, the anti-abortion movement has worked steadily to expand their base of support through arguments that seem better aligned with voters who are less religious and less conservative than the movement\u2019s traditional religious base. This approach corresponds with the fact that most Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and therefore reject most fetus-centered arguments.[42]\nPolitical changes, however\u2014at the Supreme Court as well as other federal and state-level court systems\u2014have created new and surprising opportunities. The Trump administration, in concert with Republican Senate leadership, prioritized judicial appointments, establishing a political reality that will be governed by increasingly social-conservative justices. Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) further requested that veteran federal judges consider early retirement, so that they might be replaced by younger conservative stalwarts while Republicans still control the Senate. According to his spokesman David Popp, McConnell\u2019s mantra during 2020 was: \u201cleave no vacancy behind.\u201d[43] McConnell\u2019s socially-conservative judicial nominees were both an average of 10 years younger than Obama\u2019s nominees and were more socially-conservative than nominees from previous Republican presidents in the past.[44] Some of the judges appointed by Trump have, in particular, a track record of restricting reproductive rights, and many hold views that are considered hostile to reproductive rights. This has created a court system that\u2014regardless of the transition of power in the Senate and White House\u2014will make it increasingly difficult to protect access to reproductive\u00a0rights. \n\n\n\n\nSome of the judges appointed by Trump have, in particular, a track record of restricting reproductive rights, and many hold views that are considered hostile to reproductive rights. This has created a court system that\u2014regardless of the transition of power in the Senate and White House\u2014will make it increasingly difficult to protect access to reproductive\u00a0rights. \n\n\n\n\nThe anti-abortion movement is already preparing for a future when it won\u2019t need to rely on the \u201cchipping away\u201d strategy of imposing small, incremental barriers to abortion access. Their success is all but guaranteed, even without the reversal of Roe. \nIn this new reality, pro-choice advocates must develop a new strategy of their own to ensure continued access to reproductive services. First, it\u2019s incumbent upon pro-choice groups to be aggressively involved in voter turnout initiatives, including diligent work to register, inform, and promote turnout in ensuing elections. Second, the pro-choice movement must focus on educating and promoting awareness of the current anti-abortion movement and its most recent policy gains, including how even some anti-abortion advocates fear they are going too far. This new threat highlights the need for pro-choice organizations that can swiftly adapt their messaging, and engage in purposeful networking among longstanding, national pro-choice organizations and their grassroots\u00a0alliances. \nPublic opinion on the legality of abortion has remained static over the decades, with minor fluctuations from the mid-1970s to the present day.[45] Thus, shifts in abortion-related policy clearly illustrates changes in messaging, and responsiveness to deviations in the broader political environment. The anti-abortion movement has found significant success following an evolving set of strategies, and awareness of the current political moment. Pro-choice organizations must do the same, acting proactively rather than simply reacting, and leading from the heart rather than the\u00a0head. \n\n\n\n\n Endnotes\n[1]Dahlia Lithwick, \u201cThe Supreme Court Sidelines Women in Favor of Religious Bosses,\u201d Slate, July 8, 2020, https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/supreme-court-sidelines-women-little-sisters-of-the-poor-v-pennsylvania.html; Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v.
