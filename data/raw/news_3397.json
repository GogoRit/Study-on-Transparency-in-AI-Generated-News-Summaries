The President of Guatemala had the courage to stand for life and honor God\u2019s creation.\nPresident Giammattei\u2019s is a doctor. He knows firsthand that life begins from the moment of conception, and therefore, every human life has to be protected without regard to his or her condition. The protection of the unborn has been part of his policy from the first day he took office.\nPresident Giammattei also recognized the need to strengthen the traditional family unit consisting of mothers and fathers and their children. For it is the family unit that protects and nourishes children who are the future of our societies.\nIn this day and time, having national policies that protect the unborn are not popular. To be pro-life means to be rejected and marginalized by the international elites and countries, including the U.S. For example, after President Giammattei announced in December 2021 his intentions of proclaiming Guatemala the pro-life capital of the Americas, the U.S. government did not invite President Giammattei to the Summit for Democracy.\nUndeterred by the international bullying, President Giammattei moved forward with his pro-life policies. He has the support of his people and religious leaders from different faiths.\nWe applaud President Giammattei\u2019s courage to stand for his national law and his people without fearing the threats of governments or international institutions that deny the sanctity of life and fail to recognize and promote the family\u2019s vital role in life and the development of every human being. \u00a0\nThe defense of national sovereignty (our own or that of another country), the sanctity of life, and family are among CWA\u2019s core values. Therefore, we will continue to stand with Guatemala to defend their right to live by their laws without any interference. We will work to stop the bullying by our country\u2019s current administration against countries that stand for life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweets by CWforA  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT \n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE DO\nCAREERS\nCWA INTERNSHIPS\nCONTACT CWA\n \n\nWHAT WE DO\nCAREERS\nCWA INTERNSHIPS\nCONTACT CWA\n \n\n\n\n\nTRENDING ISSUES \n\n\n\n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\nSO YOU THINK YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?\nSTANDING WITH FEMALE ATHLETES\nPROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN\n \n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\nSO YOU THINK YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?\nSTANDING WITH FEMALE ATHLETES\nPROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES    \n\n\n\n\nELECTION RESOURCES\nCWA ACADEMY FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES\nCWA PUBLICATIONS\nSTORE\n \n\nELECTION RESOURCES\nCWA ACADEMY FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES\nCWA PUBLICATIONS\nSTORE\n \n\n\n\n\nMEDIA \n\n\n\n\nPenny Nance\nPRESS RELEASES\nPODCASTS\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\n \n\nPenny Nance\nPRESS RELEASES\nPODCASTS\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\n \n\n\n\n\nGRASSROOTS ENGAGEMENT \n\n\n\n\nCONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA\nWOMEN FOR AMERICA INFLUENCERS\nYOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA\n \n\nCONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA\nWOMEN FOR AMERICA INFLUENCERS\nYOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDONATE \n\n\n\n\nDONATE TODAY\nDEBORAH\u2019S ARMY\nLEGACY GIVING\n \n\nDONATE TODAY\nDEBORAH\u2019S ARMY\nLEGACY GIVING\n \n\n\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 CWALAC.
