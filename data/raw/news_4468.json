(He orders a juice at that happy hour)\u00a0\nJohn isn\u2019t a real person, and his diligence does not represent reality. Almeling created the hypothetical aspiring dad to illustrate a point: Men today know very little about their reproductive health, including how their decisions and environment can affect the condition of their sperm, which, in turn, can impact their children\u2019s wellbeing.\u00a0\nHer book, published by the\u00a0University of California Press, explains why. She traces how the medical profession has historically paid little attention to men's reproductive health and discusses the implications of this gap for men, women, and society.\u00a0\nAlmeling, an associate professor of sociology, public health, and medicine, recently spoke to YaleNews about her research. The interview was condensed and edited.\u00a0\nWhat sparked your interest in researching the missing science of men\u2019s reproductive health?\u00a0\nI wanted to understand why we pay so little attention to men\u2019s reproductive health relative to women\u2019s and how that disparity affects everything from health care to gender norms and reproductive politics. In researching the book, I started with the history of medicine to figure out why we have two large specialties devoted to women\u2019s reproductive health \u2014 obstetrics and gynecology \u2014 with no truly comparable specialty focused solely on men\u2019s reproductive health. Then I created a 50-year sample of scientific studies and media reports to pinpoint if and when researchers and journalists focused on how men\u2019s health matters for reproductive outcomes. For the last part of the book, I turned to men from the general public, interviewing them about how they think about their role in reproduction.\u00a0\nWhy is this issue important?\nRecent research shows that a man\u2019s health\u00a0before\u00a0conception can damage sperm in such a way that it can affect his children\u2019s health. This includes the father\u2019s own age, his behavior \u2014 alcohol and drug use, smoking \u2014 as well as his exposure to chemicals at home, work, and in the environment. There is increasing evidence that damaged sperm can affect pregnancy outcomes, from miscarriage and birth weight to birth defects and childhood illnesses.\nIt\u2019s important to pay more attention to men\u2019s reproductive health because it has the potential to improve men\u2019s lives and the lives of their children.Yet, this message has not made its way to the broader public. So I think it\u2019s important to pay more attention to men\u2019s reproductive health because it has the potential to improve men\u2019s lives and the lives of their children. I also want to call attention to these issues so that scientists and clinicians make it a point to include men in their research on reproductive outcomes. If they continue to concentrate solely on women\u2019s health and women\u2019s behaviors, then we are missing some unknown amount of reproductive risk associated with men\u2019s bodies. And on a broader level, reproduction has long been portrayed as a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue.\u201d Adding a discussion about the significance of men\u2019s reproductive health might shift some of our most contentious debates around reproductive politics.\u00a0\nHow did the medical profession come to largely ignore men\u2019s reproductive health?\nThe answer to that question stretches back to the 19th century when medicine became a formal profession and began the process of specialization. The American Medical Association was founded in 1847, and specialties soon followed, including obstetrics and gynecology. So it was fairly early on that women\u2019s reproductive bodies were cordoned off as a separate realm of medical knowledge.\u00a0\nThe first chapter in the book tells a forgotten history of an attempt in the 1880s to launch a parallel specialty for men\u2019s reproduction called \u201candrology.\u201d The founders were ridiculed at medical conferences, mostly because men\u2019s reproductive health at the time was dominated by highly stigmatized sexually transmitted diseases, and they quickly gave up their efforts to focus attention on the male reproductive body. I argue that we\u2019re still living with the consequences today.\u00a0\nWhat are some of those consequences?\nFor one, we still don\u2019t have a male birth control pill. Men\u2019s contraceptive options have not really changed since the late 19th century. They have condoms and vasectomies, and that\u2019s all. In contrast, the early emergence of obstetrics and gynecology generated robust research agendas around women and reproduction all through the 20th\u00a0century. As a result, there are numerous interventions and technologies for women\u2019s contraception, women\u2019s infertility, pregnancy, and birth.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat are some of the gaps in knowledge\u00a0as a result of this lack of emphasis on male reproductive health?\nOne of the most important knowledge gaps is among the general public. Doctors don\u2019t talk to men about reproduction, and there are no public health campaigns about the significance of sperm health. The effects of this inattention became clear when I interviewed 40 men about reproduction and sperm. They had not heard that their age and health can affect sperm and, in turn, their children\u2019s health. Most didn\u2019t know that sperm takes two to three months to grow in the male body, which is the key window before conception when their behaviors and exposures probably matter most. They didn\u2019t know that\u00a0with every passing year, older men are more likely to develop new mutations in their sperm, which have been linked to an increased risk of autism and schizophrenia in their children. In fact, most of the men I spoke with said the last time they heard anything about their own reproductive systems was in high school.\u00a0\nMost of the men I spoke with said the last time they heard anything about their own reproductive systems was in high school.I think it\u2019s important for men to learn this new information about how their health matters for reproduction, but I don\u2019t want to take the anxiety and stress that women feel about every bite they eat and every breath they take during pregnancy and just spread it around. I believe the \u201cnewness\u201d of men\u2019s reproductive health offers us a chance to recalibrate public health messaging around reproduction. In addition to emphasizing that\u00a0both\u00a0women\u2019s and men\u2019s age and health matters, we can also move away from stigmatizing and blaming individuals for reproductive outcomes.\u00a0COVID-19 is providing us with a deadly reminder that any one person\u2019s health is not solely a matter of their individual choices. It is also shaped profoundly by structural and environmental conditions, including rampant racism and deep economic inequalities.\nWhat would you recommend as next steps?\u00a0\nFocusing attention on men\u2019s reproductive health can happen in a number of ways. Health care providers can disrupt the implicit association of reproductive health with women\u2019s health by offering patients information about the importance of sperm health. Biomedical researchers can work to identify the precise levels of risk posed by men\u2019s age, behaviors, and exposures. Federal health agencies and professional medical associations can develop materials to educate the public about how men\u2019s health can affect children\u2019s health. Those who engineer fertility apps could add notices about the significance of men\u2019s health for reproductive outcomes. And high school teachers responsible for health classes or sex education can incorporate this information into the curriculum.\nOn a societal level, we should be making structural investments in health by ensuring that all individuals have access to high-quality and affordable health care, and that there are sidewalks and green spaces and good food to eat in neighborhoods that are safe. Health also requires tackling environmental pollution, making sure the air we all breathe and the water we all drink is clean. These measures would improve the health of\u00a0all\u00a0bodies, whether they are reproducing or not.\u00a0\nIt is not possible to reduce reproductive risk to zero. But paying more attention to men\u2019s reproductive health has the potential to improve life for this generation and for generations to come.\u00a0\nRelatedVideo: Rene Almeling on the attitude gap between sperm and egg donorsSocial Sciences\nShare this with Facebook\nShare this with X\nShare this with LinkedIn\nShare this with Email\nPrint this\n\nMedia ContactBess Connolly : elizabeth.connolly@yale.edu,  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\nWhy is fentanyl driving overdose deaths? \nUnderstanding the wiring of the human genome \nConnecticut Supreme Court sides with Yale law clinic in police records case \nStewart draws on days in Parliament, and Afghan villages, in new Yale role \n\nShow More Articles \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Archives\nContact Us\nFor the Media\nIt\u2019s Your Yale\nApply to Yale\nGive to Yale\n \n\n\n\n\n\nManaged by the \u00a0Office of Public Affairs & Communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9\n2024\nYale University \u00b7 All rights reserved \u00b7 \nPrivacy policy  \u00b7 \nAccessibility at Yale\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYouTube\nRSS Feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYale on Instagram \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
