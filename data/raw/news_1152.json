Idaho\u2019s Senate approved a bill to block the procedure after six weeks, modeled after Texas\u2019 law. Georgia\u2019s Senate advanced legislation that prohibits using telemedicine for abortion medication. And in Kentucky, the state House voted to pass new restrictions on abortion providers that, if enacted, could effectively shut down clinics in the state.\u00a0\nLegislatures around the country are voting on a variety of abortion restrictions, many of them not in line with the protections that have existed since Roe v. Wade was decided 49 years ago. They\u2019re doing so with an eye on the Supreme Court, set to rule in a case that is widely expected to give more power to states to add limits to the availability of abortion. The bills vary, with differences in the time limits and measures they address. It is part of an effort to ensure that states have laws on the books that restrict abortion in as many ways as possible \u2014 so that they are prepared no matter what ruling comes down, likely this summer.\n\u201cStates are really thinking seriously about \u2018What do we want to have in effect this summer?\u2019 and \u2018What do we really need?\u2019\u201d said Katie Glenn, government affairs counsel for Americans United for Life, a lobbying organization that opposes abortion. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing more divergent bills.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe divergence in part reflects state differences in terms of what restrictions are politically feasible. But it is also a product of the uncertainty around how the court will rule in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health, a case examining whether Mississippi can ban abortions after 15 weeks. Some legal observers and state lawmakers expect the court to allow 15-week abortion bans, but not total prohibitions. Others are expecting total bans will be allowed and preparing accordingly. Lawmakers are pushing other kinds of restrictions, too \u2014\u00a0on where and how abortions are performed, for instance \u2014\u00a0setting the stage to winnow access, no matter what the Supreme Court says.\nA group of people protest against Florida State Senator Ileana Garcia and her support for a proposed state ban on abortions after 15 weeks in Miami January 2022.\n (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\u201cYou see states announcing their intention to pass restrictive laws and maybe go further in banning abortion,\u201d said Rachel Rebouche, the interim dean of Temple University\u2019s Beasley School of Law and an expert in reproductive health law. \u201cStates are really \u2014 for political reasons and probably also reasons grounded in sincerely held beliefs \u2014 trying to stake a claim.\u201d\nMany Republican state legislators are working with an eye to November\u2019s midterms, or even upcoming party primaries. They want to pass those laws now, so that they can spend the fall campaigning for reelection, rather than in the legislature. Glenn of Americans United for Life also said the restrictions give conservative lawmakers something to run on as they try to appeal to a base that strongly opposes abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re always thinking about enacting good policy and keeping an eye on knowing they\u2019re going to be running for office. We see different things in election years and non-election years,\u201d Glenn said.\nMany also don\u2019t want to wait for the Supreme Court to act, said Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University who focuses on reproductive health policy.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s to make clear to the base where the appetites are. But it also has a practical effect. It may be the case you will shut down abortion down in March,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a true believer, that would be the obvious thing to do.\u201d\nOften new restrictions are quickly challenged by providers and blocked by courts. In many states, it\u2019s unclear what immediate effect the laws have and what would happen to them if Roe is overturned or weakened. State attorneys general may have to go back to the courts and ask that unenforced laws be activated. And differences in state law and state constitutions may limit how far some individual legislatures can go.\u00a0\nBut the uncertainty hasn\u2019t stopped bills from moving through.\nAnti-abortion protesters stand outside the House of Representatives chamber of the Oklahoma Capitol in February 2022.\n (Alonzo Adams/AP)\nBeyond Florida, whose bill would take effect July 1, West Virginia and Arizona are both pushing 15-week abortions bans through the legislature. Both of those bills have been heard so far by one legislative chamber, and appear on track to pass and then take effect this summer, though they may be quickly blocked.\u00a0\nSome of the states passing new legislation also have stricter abortion limits that have been previously blocked by courts. Currently, 16 states either have abortion bans on the books that predate Roe v. Wade or have passed legislation that could ban the procedure if Roe v. Wade is overturned \u2014 a so-called \u201ctrigger law.\u201d Five, including West Virginia, have amended their constitutions to clarify that they do not specifically protect abortion rights. Kentucky voters will consider such an amendment this November, and Kansans will vote on one in August.\u00a0\nSome states are moving to enact trigger bans before the Supreme Court rules. Wyoming\u2019s House of Representatives passed its own trigger bill Wednesday. Abortion rights organizers in Ohio expect the legislature to act on similar legislation this session.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More abortion coverage from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Idaho is the second state to ban abortion after six weeks\n                \n\n\n\n                    The 19th Explains: 15-week abortion bans may become law in three states. What does that mean?\n                \n\n\n\n                    Collins, Murkowski introduce alternative Senate bill to codify abortion rights\n                \n\n\n\n\nAnd some are targeting medication abortion, a two-pill regimen that can be used to terminate a first-trimester pregnancy and is now the most common method used in the United States. Part of its rising popularity is due to a spring 2020 move from the federal Food & Drug Administration, which allowed it to be delivered by telemedicine. The pregnant person consults with a health care provider over the phone or the internet, and pills are mailed to them. If clinics close, more people could turn to medication abortion, especially if they do not have to travel to a health care facility.\nComing into this year, 19 states already had laws prohibiting virtual care for medication abortion. South Dakota\u2019s legislature has just passed a bill that would do the same \u2014 codifying an executive order previously introduced by Gov. Kristi Noem \u2014 but the bill will not take effect until a federal court reverses a decision blocking Noem\u2019s previous order. Georgia\u2019s Senate has approved a similar bill to prohibit telemedicine for medication abortion that has yet to be voted on by the state House.\u00a0\n\u201cAll the stuff on telemedicine and medication abortion is basically to to get out in front of Dobbs, in case the court leaves any daylight for the prospect of abortion,\u201d Murray said. \u201cTelemedicine would be the obvious place where demand would be shifted if clinics close. I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a lot of interesting in limiting medication abortion.\u201d\nAnti-abortion activists protest outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Washington, D.C. in January 2022.\n (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nKentucky\u2019s new bill also would impose new limits on medication abortion. But the part with the most potential impact would require abortion clinics to dispose of fetal tissue in a manner that providers say would be too expensive for them to sustain and would force them to shut down. Since access is already precarious \u2014 only two clinics provide abortions in the entire state \u2014 this could effectively end abortion access in the state even before the Dobbs ruling.\u00a0\nBecause Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court has previously interpreted its constitution as guaranteeing the right to an abortion, a legal challenge could be successful if the new abortion bill, House Bill 3, is passed, said Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky state director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Indiana and Kentucky. But between the impending Dobbs ruling and the state\u2019s proposed constitutional amendment, it\u2019s unclear what protections will remain. And once clinics are forced to shut down, it is often difficult to reopen.\u00a0\nWhile many states introduced Texas-inspired abortion bans at the beginning of the year, few have moved. Texas enforces its bans via civil lawsuits, empowering private citizens to sue anyone who has helped \u201caid or abet\u201d the provision of an abortion after six weeks. Lawmakers in Oklahoma and Idaho are so far the only ones to have even given their Texas-style bans a hearing, let alone a vote.\u00a0 Florida was among the first states to see such a bill endorsed, before its legislative leadership opted for a 15-week ban instead.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

I think this is a little bit too quick,\u201d said Jim Patrick, a Republican state senator in Idaho, during the chamber\u2019s debate of their abortion restriction, which passed Thursday.\nPolling suggests that majorities across all political parties disapprove of the Texas law\u2019s reliance on civil lawsuits to enforce an abortion ban. And in many states, lawmakers are counting on a ruling that does not need to rely on private lawsuits, an enforcement mechanism that was designed to evade being stopped by courts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cEven in Texas, that is not a forever solution,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cI think it\u2019s seen as kind of a temporary tool. There are other states that are like, \u2018Let\u2019s wait and see what happens. We\u2019ll maybe have a better law [already] on the books.\u2019\u201d\nAmericans United for Life\u00a0 is currently working to identify laws that were previously passed and then blocked by the courts but that could be newly enforced after the court\u2019s ruling, which is expected to come down this summer. Those could include near or total bans, or limitations that make it harder for clinics to provide abortions. The organization is also consulting with Republican attorneys general across the country about how to respond if Roe is overturned or weakened.\u00a0\nPeople demonstrate during an anti-abortions rights rally in Dallas, Texas in January 2022.\n (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re looking at closely. You don\u2019t need to pass new laws if you have old laws that aren\u2019t enforced,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThey may need updates, but that\u2019s a good starting point.\u201d\nDepending on t how the court rules, any opening for abortion rights could result in years of litigation, as providers try to figure out what services remain protected. The \u201cdevil is in the details,\u201d Murray said.\nCurrently, abortion clinics too are consulting with lawyers to see if and how they may be able to challenge any new abortion restrictions that take effect this summer or later. But the reigning uncertainty over how the court will rule means it\u2019s not clear what claims clinics will have to file suit.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking with our lawyers about what different strategies might be depending on the decision,\u201d said Jen Moore Conrow, who heads Preterm, an Ohio-based abortion clinic. \u201cWe can scenario plan all we want and we won\u2019t know until the decision.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nState lawmakers prepare for a future without Roe v.
