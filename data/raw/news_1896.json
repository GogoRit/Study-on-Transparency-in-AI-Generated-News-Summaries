(AP) \u2014 The North Dakota Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a state abortion ban will remain blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds.The ban was designed to take effect once the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But a district judge had put it on hold this summer while the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic (RRWC) pursued a lawsuit arguing the state constitution protected a right to an abortion.\u201cWhile the regulation of abortion is within the authority of the legislature under the North Dakota Constitution, RRWC has demonstrated likely success on the merits that there is a fundamental right to an abortion in the limited instances of life-saving and health-preserving circumstances, and the statute is not narrowly tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny,\u201d Chief Justice Jon J. Jensen wrote in the ruling.The law \u2014 one of many abortion-restricting measures passed by state legislatures in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Roe \u2014 includes exceptions to save the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest. Otherwise, a doctor who performs an abortion would face a felony charge, which abortion rights supporters say could stop doctors from performing abortions even if the mother\u2019s health is at risk.\n\nThe Red River Women\u2019s Clinic \u2014 the state\u2019s only abortion clinic \u2014 shut its doors this summer and moved operations a short distance from Fargo to Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion remains legal. But the clinic\u2019s owner is still pursuing the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleted emails of late North Dakota attorney general recovered amid investigation of ex-lawmaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor declines charges for deleting the emails of the late North Dakota Attorney General\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic utilities regulator joins race for North Dakota\u2019s single U.S. House seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe court made the right decision and sided with the people of North Dakota today,\u201d clinic director Tammi Kromenaker said in a statement. \u201cThose seeking abortion care know what\u2019s best for themselves and their families and should be able to access such essential services if and when they need it. While I\u2019m heartbroken that we have been forced to close our doors here in Fargo, we will continue to serve the region at our new clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Attorney General Drew Wrigley was critical of the ruling. He said in a statement that the state Supreme Court chose \u201ca path of its very own, by holding there is now also an un-defined \u2018health\u2019 exception to abortion regulation.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOur Supreme Court did this without explicit support from our state Constitution, and without support from legislative enactments in our history of abortion regulation. In so doing, North Dakota\u2019s Supreme Court appears to have taken on the role of a legislative body, a role our constitution does not afford them.\u201dWrigley noted that state lawmakers are working on legislation \u201cthat recrafts North Dakota\u2019s abortion laws, and they will now have the opportunity to enact the will of North Dakotans, aware of the latest North Dakota Supreme Court pronouncement.\u201dHe had argued the ban should be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds, saying Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick erred by granting the injunction. Romanick has said that the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic had a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d of succeeding in its lawsuit, but also said there\u2019s no \u201cclear and obvious answer\u201d on whether the state constitution conveys a right to abortion.\n\nAttorneys for the clinic had argued that Romanick\u2019s decision to block the ban was proper.When Romanick blocked the law from taking effect, he acknowledged that the clinic had moved but noted that doctors and hospitals would still be affected by the statute.Since the U.S. Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade, the ruling that protected the right to abortion for nearly five decades, abortion restrictions have been up to states and the landscape has shifted quickly.Thirteen states are now enforcing bans on abortion at any point in pregnancy and one more \u2014 Georgia \u2014 bans it once cardiac activity can be detected, or at about six weeks\u2019 gestation.Getting abortions has become increasingly difficult for women who live in states with bans, in some cases resulting in increased medical complications and in others forcing residents to travel for hours or even days to reach a facility that can provide abortions legally.\n\nCourts have put on hold enforcement of abortion bans or deep restrictions in Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming. Idaho courts have forced the state to allow abortions during medical emergencies.___MacPherson is a former Associated Press writer. Ahmed reported from Minneapolis.
