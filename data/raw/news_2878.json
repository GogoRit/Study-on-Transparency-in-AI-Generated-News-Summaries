It would have to\u00a0pass three readings to be enacted.\u00a0But it would not have specific legal implications, as Greenville County Council does not have the power to ban abortions, according to Greenville County Attorney Mark Tollison.Tzouvelekas said he understands that\u00a0would have to come from a level beyond the county.\"What I want to do at a county level is make\u00a0sure we're doing everything to protect life,\" he said.The ordinance urges the South Carolina General Assembly to pass the \"Equal Protection for Unborn Babies Act,\" or legislation S.988, which focuses on criminalizing abortion. Unlike the state's Fetal Heartbeat Act, which was blocked by a federal court and faces ongoing legal wrangling, the Equal Protection for Unborn Babies Act does not allow rape or incest as a reason for performing an abortion.Dive deeper:More on proposed SC abortion banRead more:Election reform, tax cuts and abortion law make the rounds of the SC CapitolWhat is the fetal heartbeat bill?:South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed the Fetal Heartbeat Bill. Here's what's next.Greenville County Democratic Party Chair Amanda McDougald Scott said she was confused by the county's proposed ordinance. She said it reads more like a values statement than an ordinance to implement law.\"My question is how is this going to be carried out,\" McDougald Scott said. \"Even if it is a value statement, if it's law, it can be interpreted by different people how they want.\"McDougald Scott said\u00a0it's possible the ordinance could be interpreted as a way to prohibit access to abortions, which would break federal law under Roe v. Wade, which ruled the U.S. Constitution protects a pregnant woman's right to have an abortion without government restriction.\u00a0Past Greenville County lawsuit:Greenville County settles lawsuit over invalid road fees as refund discussion lingers\"Why would you set us up for another expensive court case?\" McDougald Scott asked. \"I get that the most staunch Republicans and Greenville County Republicans want to overturn Roe v. Wade, but this is a waste of time, effort and taxpayer money.\"If (Greenville County Council is)\u00a0really dedicated to life and the quality of life, maybe they could better spend their time on the things that are actually going to help people, like investment in\u00a0transportation, affordable housing, childcare.\"Local activist Tikeeta Wallace, the sole speaker during the public-comment session of County Council's meeting Tuesday night, spoke against the ordinance.\u201cThis is a very hard issue, and it hits everybody a different way,\" Wallace said. \"Instead of thinking of children who aren\u2019t even conceived yet, we should think about the children who are here.\"The proposed ordinance\u00a0makes reference to the U.S. Supreme Court decision Poelker v. Doe, which found\u00a0\u201cthe Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth.\"\"The Greenville County Council desires to express its deep conviction that all human beings through all stages of life, from conception to natural death, should be afforded protection from acts of cruelty and that they should be treated humanely, with dignity, and opportunity,\" the ordinance reads.The ordinance also directs the council to provide greater awareness to \"compassionate\" programs and facilities\u00a0available for pregnant women and families.Read the full ordinance at greenvillecounty.org:Genna Contino covers Greenville County and housing for The Greenville News.\u00a0Contact Genna at gcontino@gannett.com or on Twitter @GennaContino.
