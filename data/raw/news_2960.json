He confirmed that the vigils were, in fact, peaceful and lawful\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, Stephen Donnelly knows this, and he is choosing to ignore the advice of Gardai to do the bidding of campaign groups and to punch down at pro-life activists who he knows are breaking no laws\u201d, she said.\n\u201cIn fact, the Garda Commissioner also stated that if any laws were to be broken existing laws were sufficient to deal with that\u201d.\nThe Irish Government\u2019s position differs to that of the UK Government\u2019s which maintains that there are sufficient laws already in place to protect women seeking an abortion from harassment and intimidation.\nFollowing the unveiling of the Irish Government\u2019s proposals, David Quinn, Director of the Iona Institute, a Christian advocacy group, questioned the constitutionality of the Government\u2019s controversial plans.\u00a0\nHe told Catholic News Agency on August 9: \u201cAssuming the law goes through, it will be one of the most restrictive in the whole of Europe because other countries have more respect for the right to protest and consider laws like this to be disproportionate. We already have laws in Ireland against intimidation or harassment and our Garda Commissioner has said so in the context of calls for these buffer zones. But the Government is pressing on anyway, egged on by most opposition parties and pro-abortion lobby groups.\n\u201cIreland has gone from being an extremely pro-life country to the opposite end of the spectrum in just a few short years. Banning even pro-life prayer vigils within 100m of places that conduct or facilitate abortion shows how badly we have changed. If the law is as restrictive as promised, it may actually be unconstitutional. The president has the power to refer it to the Supreme Court when it is ready for him to sign in the months to come and he ought do so'.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, solicitor and prominent pro-life campaigner, Cora Sherlock said that the proposal should concern everyone, whatever their views on abortion. She said: \u201cThis proposal sets a very worrying precedent, and it should be of concern regardless of your view on abortion. The right to freedom of expression, movement and peaceful assembly and freedom to protest have always been held very highly in Ireland and given high priority in the Irish Constitution. Proposed legislation that would infringe on this should ring alarm bells for everyone.\nAn August 4 statement from the pro-life group, Right to Life, said that although the Irish Government has yet to decide on the extent of prison time or penalties for those peacefully offering alternatives to abortion, a pro-abortion campaign group, Together for Safety, had drafted a previous version of the bill that demanded a a jail sentence of six months or a \u20ac3,000 fine ($3,070).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nprolife, \nAbortion in Ireland, \nAbortion in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadeleine is the former associate editor of the Catholic Herald.
