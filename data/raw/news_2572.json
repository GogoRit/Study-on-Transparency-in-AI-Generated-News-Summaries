Wade,\u00a0later revealed as Norma McCorvey, lied when she said she\u2019d become pro-life in 1995. She disclosed on her deathbed that she\u2019d accepted money from anti-abortion activist groups to renounce her pro-choice position.\nCalling herself \u201cthe big fish,\u201d McCorvey explained that she never actually turned her back on abortion but claimed she had because she was being paid,\u00a0according to multiple\u00a0news reports.\n\u201cI think it was a mutual thing,\u201d she told the documentarian about her relationship to pro-life groups, in February 2017. \u201cI took their money and they put me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d say. I did it well, too. I am a good actress. Of course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d The film, which will air on FX, is titled \u201cAKA Jane Roe.\u201d\n \n \n\nOperation Save America, an anti-abortion group first known as Operation Rescue then Operation Save America, denied McCorvey was paid by them. But Troy Newman, the group\u2019s president, told CNN that the group would sometimes pay McCorvey honorariums of $500-$1,000 for speaking engagements.\nEvangelical minister Rob Schenck\u2014who had his own come-to-Jesus moment in the documentary\u2014said McCorvey was \u201ccoached in what to say,\u201d\u00a0CNN reported. Schenck said he had actually cut McCorvey checks \u201cand signed them and made them out to Norma.\u201d He also said he was aware of other pro-life groups paying her too.\n\u201cWhat we did with Norma was highly unethical,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jig is up.\u201d\n \n \n\nIn 1969, when McCorvey was 21 and pregnant with her third child in Texas, she joined the lawsuit that became known as\u00a0Roe.\u00a0The case would solidify access to abortion in the U.S. As\u00a0Roe\u00a0made its way through the legal system over four years, McCorvey gave birth and put her child up for adoption, never receiving the abortion she wanted in the first place.\nWhen McCorvey joined Operation Rescue in 1995, she was enthusiastically welcomed by the pro-life movement.\n\u201cThe heart of the person who most symbolized abortion in this country has been touched and captured, if you will,\u201d Bill Price, the president of Texans United for Life, an anti-abortion group,\u00a0told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0that year. \u201cIf you can change the mind of Jane Roe on this issue, there\u2019s hope that anyone\u2019s mind can be changed.\u201d\n \n \n\nBut, as McCorvey revealed in 2017, her conversion as a born-again Christian was just a ruse to make money\u2014although her pro-life position powerfully undermined the pro-choice movement regardless.\n\u201cIt was a cultural coup for the right when McCorvey publicly turned against legal abortion,\u201d columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote in\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0today, calling the confession a \u201cbombshell.\u201d \u201cJane Roe rejecting\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0was something abortion opponents could throw in the faces of pro-choice activists.\u201d\nBut the bomb has sputtered and fizzled with the revelations of the new documentary. McCorvey admitted in the film: \u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion, that\u2019s no skin off my ass. That\u2019s why they call it choice,\u201d\u00a0according to Reuters.\n \n \n\nIn 2005, Jane Fonda, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem founded the Women\u2019s Media Center (WMC), a progressive, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization working to raise the visibility, viability and decision-making power of women and girls in media and, thereby, ensuring that their stories get told and their voices are heard.
