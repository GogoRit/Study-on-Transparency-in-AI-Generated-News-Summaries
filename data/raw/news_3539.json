Santiago/Getty Images\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMayra Flores thought the full moon, which looked red as it passed through the Earth\u2019s shadow in the early hours of Election Day, was a good sign.\nThe Latina Republican who declared she was \u201ctaking Jesus to the halls of Congress\u201d when she won a special election in South Texas in 2021, hoped and prayed for \u201ca red wave\u201d to carry her to reelection on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe moon controls the tide,\u201d Flores tweeted. \u201cBring on the red wave!\u201d\nBut as votes were counted late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, it became clear the moon meant nothing. Flores, a conservative with a lot of evangelical support in the Rio Grande Valley, lost by about 11,000 votes. She blamed her defeat on the people who didn\u2019t vote.\n\u201cRepublicans and Independents stayed home,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cDO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RESULTS IF YOU DID NOT DO YOUR PART!\u201d\nVotes were still being counted Wednesday morning, but Republicans looked like they were going to win a slim majority of congressional races, taking control of the House away from Democrats. They were not on track to win the sweeping victory that so many had hoped for.\nThe rapid rise of food and fuel costs was the top issue for voters, according to CNN\u2019s nationwide exit polls. Three out of four people casting a ballot said they were unhappy with the economy. Roughly two-thirds said gas prices were causing them hardship.\nSeventy percent of the voters who said inflation was their top issue voted Republican.\nRoughly a quarter of the electorate identified as white evangelical or born-again Christian, according to the exit poll. The vast majority of them voted for Republican candidates, but CNN did not share data on the concerns or issues motivating the bloc.\nThe second most important issue for voters was abortion. But only 16 percent told pollsters they were \u201centhusiastic\u201d about the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June. Nearly 40 percent told pollsters they were angry about the Dobbs decision.\nThe majority (76%) of voters who listed abortion as their top priority voted for Democrats.\nPro-life poll watchers were disappointed in the results of several ballot initiatives across the country. Voters in Vermont, California, and Michigan enshrined the right to abortion in their state constitutions with ballot initiatives.\nThe vote was close in Michigan, where the state\u2019s 1.8 million Catholics were urged to oppose the measure and the Christian Reformed Church called all believers \u201cto a ringing testimony against the evils of abortion.\u201d The amendment ultimately passed, however, with more than 55 percent of voters in favor.In Kentucky, where abortion is currently banned, voters rejected an amendment that would have made that part of the constitution, becoming the second conservative state to defeat a pro-life ballot initiative after Kansas.\n\u201cI'm disappointed in Kentucky,\u201d David O\u2019Bryan, a 73-year-old pro-life advocate in Louisville, told the Courier-Journal. \u201cPeople misunderstood the amendment, what it means to Kentucky and what it means for Right to Life and pro life issues.\u201d\nLila Grace Rose, president of the pro-life group Live Action, tweeted that the results \u201cshow the need to redouble our efforts of education & persuasion on the value of human life\u201d and the \u201cneed to 10X pro-life marketing resources to beat the incessant lies.\u201d\nAn incredible amount of money was raised and spent in this election. The Associated Press reported the midterms cost roughly $16.7 billion, nearly double the amount seen in nonpresidential elections a decade ago.\n\nThe largest single donor was George Soros, the liberal billionaire who is often at the center of antisemitic conspiracy theories. Most of the top donors this election, however, gave to conservative candidates and causes. Shipping goods magnate Richard Uihlein gave $80.7 million; hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, $68.5 million; banking heir Timothy Mellon, $40 million; and tech investor Peter Thiel, $32.6 million. But the results, for conservatives, were mixed.\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, said the abortion-rights ballot victories convinced her that going forward, the pro-life movement needs to focus on the fight at the federal level.\n\u201cLike other injustices our nation faced in our past,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, \u201csome states will just refuse to acknowledge human rights and progress.\u201d\nSeveral races became proxy battles over abortion. Montana saw an unprecedented amount of spending in one nonpartisan judicial race as activists and outside groups claimed one state supreme court judge could \u201csave abortion in Montana.\u201d With about 74 percent of the vote counted by the end of Tuesday, the pro-choice candidate had a 17,000-vote lead.In North Carolina, Democratic governor Roy Cooper claimed victory when Republicans failed to win enough seats in the state legislature to overturn his promised veto of any ban on abortion. The state saw a dramatic increase in abortions in the months after Dobbs was decided, with as many as 75 percent of patients at one Planned Parenthood clinic coming from outside of North Carolina.\n\u201cNorth Carolinians voted for balance and progress,\u201d the governor tweeted.\nControl of the Senate was up in the air Wednesday morning, with races in Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia too close to call.\n\nThe Georgia race may not be decided when the counting is complete, since rules there say the winner must have more than 50 percent of the vote. Incumbent Raphael Warnock, a Black Baptist minister, claimed 49.4 percent on Wednesday morning but couldn\u2019t quite wrest the majority from his scandal-plagued Republican opponent Herschel Walker and a Libertarian who grabbed about 2 percent.\nSome Republicans won handily, though. J. D. Vance, author of the best-selling Hillbilly Elegy and a popular speaker at the National Conservative conference, was able to declare victory with 53 percent of the vote about an hour after polls closed.\nTexas governor Greg Abbott never appeared seriously threatened by Democratic challenger Beto O\u2019Rouke and won reelection to a third term. Florida governor Ron DeSantis\u2014who ran an ad saying God needed him to \u201ctake the arrows and stand firm in the wake of unrelenting attacks\u201d and save people\u2019s jobs, livelihoods, liberty, and happiness\u2014cruised to victory with nearly 60 percent support from voters.\nAbbott and DeSantis have both been touted as potential Republican presidential candidates in 2024, possibly even challenging former president Donald Trump in the primary. Trump, who campaigned for a number of candidates in the midterms, has teased the imminent announcement of his 2024 election bid.\nSome of Trump\u2019s key supporters who falsely claimed he won the 2020 election lost their own races yesterday, however. Secretary of state candidates who promoted baseless conspiracies about rigged elections lost in Arizona and Michigan. Representative Lauren Boebert, a Republican who has been one of Trump\u2019s most strident supporters, was unexpectedly trailing a few points in the vote count in Colorado.Democrats seemed to benefit from emphasizing concerns about the state of democracy and the message that \u201cdemocracy is on the ballot.\u201d Nearly 7 out of 10 voters said they agreed that democracy in the US is under threat. Those voters were a few points more likely to vote Democratic.\nThat may have made the difference in the Grand Rapids area, where Democrat Hillary Scholten won Michigan\u2019s 3rd congressional district by about 9 points. Last election, Scholten, a Christian Reformed Church deacon and former Department of Justice attorney, lost to Republican Peter Meijer by 6 points.\nThen Meijer voted to impeach Trump following the January 6 riot at the US Capitol and lost the next Republican primary to a Trump-endorsed challenger. The Democratic Party spent $425,000 in ads raising the profile of Meijer\u2019s more extreme opponent, hoping he would be easier for Scholten to beat.\nThe gamble apparently paid off.\nBut Scholten, a pro-choice Christian, said she hoped her victory would help move the country away from extremism and increasing partisan polarization.\n\u201cThis campaign has, and continues to build, something new here in West Michigan,\u201d she said. \u201cA new political home for people on the right, the left, the center, who are tired of politics as usual, who are ready to cast aside the old frame of division, \u2018us versus them,\u2019 and join hands together for a better, brighter West Michigan for all of us.\u201d\nShe will join a closely divided Congress debating economics, abortion, and the next two years of president Joe Biden\u2019s agenda in January.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionDemocratic PartyDonald TrumpEconomicsElections - Campaign 2022Joe BidenRepublican Party\n\nPosted by:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Silliman\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@DanielsillimanNovember 9, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead These NextRelated\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEvangelical Trump Supporters and Critics on Repeat for 2024\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWith Nikki Haley out after Super Tuesday, \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d are once again disappointed with the choices for president.\r\n\t\t\nHarvest Prude\nTrending\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter 140 Years, Alliance University Will Close\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFormerly Nyack College, the school was in bad financial shape for several years.
