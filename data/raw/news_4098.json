The injunction will allow health-care providers throughout the U.S. to mail or otherwise deliver abortion pills to patients while the public-health emergency persists.\nThe Associated Press reports that U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang wrote in his decision that the law\u2019s \u201cin-person requirements\u201d for patients seeking the pills pose a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d that is likely unconstitutional given the social-distancing mandates of the ongoing crisis. \u201cBy causing certain patients to decide between forgoing or substantially delaying abortion care, or risking exposure to COVID-19 for themselves, their children, and family members, the In-Person Requirement presents a serious burden to many abortion patients,\u201d wrote Chuang, who emphasized that the limited time frame in which a medicated abortion is possible also factored into his judgment. (The pill can typically be taken up to 11 weeks after the first day of your last period, according to Planned Parenthood.) He also noted in the decision that federal regulators have waived the in-person requirement for many other drugs \u201cfor the specific purpose of protecting public health.\u201d\nThe challenge to the FDA rule began in may May, when the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration for its in-person requirement to obtain abortion pills, arguing it violated a patient\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The lawsuit asserted that mifepristone is the only medication out of 20,000 FDA-regulated drugs that patients must obtain in person at a health facility. The lawsuit also pointed out that the FDA\u2019s exceptional restriction on the drug has had \u201cparticularly severe implications for low-income people and people of color, who comprise a disproportionate share of impacted patients and who are already suffering and dying from COVID-19 at substantially higher rates.\u201d\nAbout 4 million women in the U.S. have used mifepristone in combination with misoprostol to bring about a medicated abortion. This method accounted for 39 percent of all abortions in the country in 2017, according to the lawsuit.\nSkye Perryman, chief legal officer of the ACOG, said that Monday\u2019s ruling \u201crecognizes the hardship and undue burden that many women have faced obtaining essential health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStay in touch.\nGet the Cut newsletter delivered daily\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n          Privacy Policy and\n          Terms of Service apply.\n        \nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nabortion\n\n\nreproductive rights\n\n\ncovid-19\n\n\npower\n\n\nhealth\n\n\nfederal court\n\n\nmaryland\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nThe Abortion Pill Is Now Available by Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Cut Shop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40 Best Sneakers for Women in Every Single Style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m on the Hunt for the Best Sunscreens Without a White Cast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 Best Luxury Candles That Double As Great Gifts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Rose Hanbury and Why Can\u2019t Kate Middleton Escape Her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Kate Middleton Really Go Grocery Shopping This Weekend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle Thinks Her New Brand\u2019s Name Is Perfect, Thank You\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Cheat Sheet for the World Figure Skating Championships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadame Clairevoyant: Horoscopes for the Week of March 17\u201323\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Rose Hanbury and Why Can\u2019t Kate Middleton Escape Her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Kate Middleton Really Go Grocery Shopping This Weekend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018All That Money Can Only Give You a Chance, Not a Guarantee\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Cheat Sheet for the World Figure Skating Championships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle Thinks Her New Brand\u2019s Name Is Perfect, Thank You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe city politic\n\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njd vance\n\nJ.D.
