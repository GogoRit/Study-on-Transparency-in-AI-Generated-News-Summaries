They were arrested and held for about an hour before returning to the scene to condemn the city for its response to their protest.\u201cThis is government censorship,\u201d Caporaletti said through a bullhorn, with a Planned Parenthood sign behind her and a \u201cBlack Pre-Born Lives Matter\u201d poster between her and a small crowd.Representatives of Students for Life of America said they plan to sue D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on the grounds that the police action violated their First Amendment rights.The mayor\u2019s office did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Tulsa allowed a Black Lives Matter message to remain \u2014 until a pro-police group asked for its own street paintingThe arrest provides a window into ongoing controversy surrounding the painting of slogans on streets. Ever since Bowser commissioned the painting of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on 16th Street NW near the White House in June, activists across the country have demanded the right to paint their own messages. City officials have conceded in some cases, allowing protesters in the District, for example, to paint \u201cDefund the police\u201d next to Bowser\u2019s original declaration. But in other cities, including Tulsa, officials have ordered street paintings erased after opposing parties fought to make their mark.AdvertisementIt is illegal for people to write or mark on any public or private property without a permit. The District\u2019s Department of Transportation, which issues permits, did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Representatives of the group led by the Students for Life of America and the Frederick Douglass Foundation said they received a D.C. police permit to hold an event and were told by an officer that he would not prevent them from writing on the asphalt.The officer allegedly asked the activists to use tempera paint, Whittington said.D.C. police declined to comment on the allegations but said they \u201cdid not issue a permit to put a message on the street,\u201d as those permits are issued through the D.C. Department of Transportation.The group said it also sent a letter to Bowser requesting permission to paint on the street, writing, \u201cHaving opened the streets of your city for public expression, Students for Life of America requests the opportunity to add our voices to those concerned about how people of color are treated in America.\u201dAdvertisementThe mayor did not respond to the letter, according to Kristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for the group.Share this articleShareOn Saturday, calls to \u201cabolish abortion\u201d and \u201cdefund Planned Parenthood\u201d continued long after the early-morning arrests. The group gathered at Frederick Douglass Court to pray for Black mothers and their \u201cpre-born children\u201d  before marching along Fourth Street NE to the Planned Parenthood building, where they held letter posters that together spelled out \u201cBlack Pre-Born Lives Matter.\u201dCherilyn Holloway, the founder of Pro-Black Pro-Life, gripped a bullhorn and urged listeners before her and on Facebook Live to consider how racism extends beyond pregnancy.\u201cI would talk to my other Black friends who stand for racial justice, and I would talk about the abortion rate in the Black community .\u2009.\u2009. and they would look back at me and they would say, \u2018Well, what about when they are out of the womb?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I knew I could not be the only one who cared about both.\u201dAdvertisementHolloway said that she cares most about support systems for low-income people and outlawing abortion, but that the nation\u2019s racial reckoning has made her feel more isolated in her beliefs.\u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement has reinforced that for me, pro-life messaging has been really polarizing,\u201d she said.Michele Hendrickson, the eastern regional director of Students for Life of America, said the antiabortion movement has been fighting racism for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s just we are finally being heard,\u201d she said.For Kendra Evans, a 39-year-old from Capitol Heights, Md., the event Saturday touched on two issues that had shaped her life: Blackness and abortion in the United States.As she marched up the paved hill and neared the gray building, where she believes generations of Black children have been killed, she recalled her own two abortions.Advertisement\u201cThere is more pressure as a Black person to survive,\u201d Evans said, explaining that the unique hardships that come with being Black made her feel that she had little choice but to have abortions. Fighting for racial justice and staunchly opposing abortion, she said, should go hand in hand.As she rounded a corner, beginning her first march this year for Black lives, the Rev. Dean Nelson, the president and chief executive of the Frederick Douglass Foundation, clapped at her and shouted, \u201cFrederick Douglass would be proud of you.\u201d\nShare CommentsSign upTOP STORIESD.C. regionLocal news, weather, sports, events, restaurants and moreThe schedule and the injury report do Wizards no favors vs. CelticsIn T.J.
