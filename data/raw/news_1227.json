Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, that\u2019s already passed the Senate.\u00a0\nThe bill, as amended, includes prison time and fines penalties for abortion providers, should the U.S. Supreme Court allow Louisiana to enact an abortion ban. Unlike its original version though, it explicitly exempts pregnant females who undergo abortions from criminal charges. It also includes language meant to exempt birth control and fertility treatments from being outlawed.\u00a0\nUnder the amended bill, abortion providers could face between one and 10 years in prison and a fine between $10,000 and $100,000 for performing an abortion on a person who is less than 15 weeks pregnant.

Several sat in the House chamber balcony, shouting support for McCormick and accusing other Republican lawmakers of \u201clying\u201d throughout the debate over the legislation. \n\nThe Capitol was also briefly evacuated, when the building\u2019s security was alerted to a suspicious, and ultimately nonthreatening, package near the Senate chamber.\u00a0\nEmotions surrounding McCormick\u2019s bill were unusually high, given the revelation last week that the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to allow state abortion bans to go into place later this year.

It would have criminalized the behavior of both abortion providers and abortion-seeking patients and declared both federal laws and court rulings \u201cvoid.\u201d \n\nIt also called for the removal of state judges who enforced federal laws, a provision lawmakers told McCormick would cause the bill to be thrown out by courts immediately.\u00a0\n\u201cThis bill will not prevent a single abortion from occurring, not a one,\u201d said Rep.
