Wade and left the question of\u00a0abortion rights up to the states\u00a0has produced ballot questions in a handful of states this fall.\nWATCH: The End of Roe: A PBS NewsHour Special Report\nThree states are asking voters some variation of whether they want to establish a right to abortion, while a single state is asking if its constitution should be changed to say there is no such right to abortion or for government funding.\nKansas voters resoundingly rejected\u00a0a ballot measure that would have permitted lawmakers to tighten abortion laws or outlaw the procedure outright in August \u2014 the first such test since the high court\u2019s ruling.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what voters will be deciding when voting concludes Nov. 8:\nWhat questions are on the ballot and where?\nCalifornia,\u00a0Michigan\u00a0and\u00a0Vermont\u00a0are all considering questions that would amend their state constitutions to establish some form of a right to abortion.\nKentucky\u00a0is asking voters whether to amend the state constitution to say it doesn\u2019t protect the right to an abortion.\nMontana\u00a0is asking voters whether to require medical care and treatment for infants born alive after an attempted abortion.\nWhy these questions and why now?\nThe ballot measures come in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June that the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t confer a right to abortion and \u201cthe authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d\nVermont Gov. Phil, Scott suggested\u00a0in a statement this summer\u00a0that the question had taken on new urgency since the court\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cIt is more important than ever to make sure the women in our state have the right to make their own decisions about their health, bodies, and their futures,\u201d he said.\nKentucky has moved to tighten restrictions to abortion since the GOP took control of the Legislature in 2016, and Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed the legislation referring the question to voters before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling this summer overturning Roe vs. Wade.\nKentucky\u2019s Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case over the state\u2019s near total abortion ban after the November election, but has kept that\u00a0prohibition in effect\u00a0while the case is pending.\nAbortion is currently legal in Vermont, with no limit on when during a pregnancy it can be carried out. California and Michigan permit abortions before viability, usually defined as around 24 weeks. Montana restricts abortions after viability as well, but a court has put a hold on a measure that would bar the procedure after 20 weeks pending litigation.\nWhat is the status of abortion in the states currently?\nState legislatures and courts have\u00a0shifted the status\u00a0of abortion laws across the United States.\nBans are in place at all states of pregnancy in a dozen states.\nWATCH: Conservative states continue to restrict abortion following overturn of Roe v. Wade\nIn Wisconsin, clinics have stopped providing abortions though there\u2019s dispute over whether a ban is in effect.\nIn Georgia, abortion is banned at the detection of cardiac activity \u2014 generally around six weeks and before women often know they\u2019re pregnant.\nSeven states, including the District of Columbia, don\u2019t restrict abortion by gestational range at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights activists carry signs during a 2022 Women's March with the theme \u201cWe Demand Our Rights\u201d in anticipation of the upcoming U.S. midterm elections on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. Oct. 8, 2022.
