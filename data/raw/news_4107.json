That decision could cost those who use contraception hundreds of dollars per year in out-of-pocket costs alone.\u00a0The case stems from a 2018 rule issued by the Trump Administration that expanded the types of employers who could opt out of the provision in the Affordable Care Act mandating that preventive health services, including birth control pills, rings, intrauterine devices, etc., be covered by most insurance plans\u00a0at no additional cost. Now, any employer, including some publicly-traded companies, can choose to drop contraceptive coverage if they have a religious or moral objection.In 2013 \u2014 the first year the mandate was in effect for many health plans \u2014 women saved an estimated $1.4 billion on birth control pills alone, according to a study from Health Affairs.The SCOTUS ruling could result in up to 126,000 women losing contraceptive coverage, costing $584 each annually, according to estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services. That said, the cost of birth control varies greatly depending on the type, with longer lasting, more effective varieties like IUDs costing significantly more upfront than other types, like the pill. The Health Affairs' study found that women saved, on average, $254.91 per year on the pill after the ACA's mandate went into effect.That cost barrier could make contraception unaffordable for many, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research organization.\u00a0\"Numerous studies have demonstrated that even seemingly small cost-sharing requirements can dramatically reduce preventive health care use, particularly among lower-income Americans,\" writes\u00a0Adam Sonfield, Guttmacher's associate director of policy analysis.VIDEO14:0114:01How Louisiana became a battleground for Roe v. WadeMarkets and Politics Digital Original VideoIn fact, co-pays as low as $6 prevented some women from obtaining birth control before the ACA, according to the National Women's Law Center\u00a0(NWLC), while one in three Latina and four in 10 Black women of reproductive age say they cannot afford to pay more than $10 for contraception.\u00a0Women were more likely to forego the more expensive, more effective birth control forms like IUDs, according to Health Affairs. And women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will be disproportionately impacted by the ruling, according to Health Affairs.\u00a0At the same time, women who have access to legal contraception beginning at ages 18 to 21 earn an estimated 5% more per hour and 11% more per year by the time they're 40 than those who do not have access to birth control,\u00a0a\u00a02019 report\u00a0from the Institute for Women's Policy Research found.\u00a0Contraceptive access has also been found to\u00a0increase women's college enrollment\u00a0by up to 20%; the substantial increase in women's labor force participation\u00a0between 1970 and 1990 was largely due to the pill.\"Access to contraception has life-long economic benefits: enabling women to complete high school and higher levels of education, improving their earnings and labor force participation, and securing their economic independence,\" the NWLC wrote in its amicus brief.Don't miss:\u00a0Birth control access has contributed to women's wage increases, says new studyAbortion, equal pay, family leave: Here are all the women's rights policies proposed by 2020 candidates so farCheck out:\u00a0The best credit cards of 2020 could earn you over $1,000 in 5 yearsVIDEO8:2908:29How a 25-year-old making $210,000 a year in New York City spends her moneyMillennial MoneyStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.
