It is a story that is so much better than anything we ever could have scripted,\" Cameron, a guest speaker at the event, said.\"The makers of Fireproof, Courageous, and War Room and I have teamed up to bring this film that highlights the value and preciousness of life in the womb and the beauty of adoption, explaining how one life can impact so many,\" he continued.Cameron, who serves as the film's executive producer and plays the role of an adoptive father, shared with the thousands of pro-lifers in attendance why protecting life and adoption means so much to him.\"This issue of life is very personal for me,\" he explained. \"My wife is an adopted child. Chelsea was one doctor appointment away from not existing.\"\"Our first four children are also adopted, and if my wife, Chelsea, had not been born, our two natural-born children would not exist either,\" he added. \"So my six children and my wife are here as a result of loving, compassionate and courageous people like you who are marching today at the March for Life.\"Alex Kendrick also spoke on the film last April in a post on Instagram.\"It's been 14 years since we shot the movie Fireproof. We're excited to be working with Kirk Cameron again on this new feature!\" he wrote at the time.\nIn a recent interview with\u00a0The Christian Post, Cameron explained how Lifemark came about.\"Someone sent me a brief documentary of a true story that was so inspiring and meant so much to me personally that I decided to turn it into a feature film,\" the actor shared.\"I wanted to illustrate the value of every life and all of its potential and also to show the beauty of adoption and demonstrate how even one person's life can powerfully impact so many others,\" he added.Related:Thousands Gather in D.C. for 49th Annual March For LifePhoto courtesy: \u00a9Getty Images/Paras Griffin/StringerVideo courtesy: \u00a9EWTNMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer and content creator.
