The bill is awaiting the signature of Gov. Kevin Stitt, who has vowed to sign any anti-abortion legislation sent to his desk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no denying: This is a very dark day, and unfortunately, dark days are ahead,\u201d Rabia Muqaddam, senior legal counsel with the Center for Reproductive Rights, said on a press call.\nThe latest attack on abortion in Oklahoma comes on the heels of Politico\u2019s publication of a leaked draft\u00a0Supreme Court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito in a pending Mississippi case that would topple the constitutional right to abortion first acknowledged in Roe v. Wade. The final opinion in that case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, is expected late next month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Oklahoma ban is modeled after the notorious Texas Senate Bill 8, which banned abortion after six weeks, long before many people even know they\u2019re pregnant. Texas lawmakers sought to shield their law from court challenges by outsourcing its enforcement to private individuals as opposed to a state actor like the attorney general. The law allows literally anyone to bring a private civil suit against any health care provider they believe may have violated the ban or person they believe may have aided or abetted a patient seeking an abortion after six weeks. That could include a friend or family member who lends a patient money or drives them to a clinic.\u00a0S.B. 8 also allows individuals to sue those who \u201cintend\u201d to take action that might violate the law.\nAlthough S.B. 8 is blatantly unconstitutional under current law, which protects the right to abortion up until fetal viability, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene, allowing Texas\u2019s ban to take effect last fall. The court\u2019s decision to look the other way has unmoored states from adhering to the rule of law, prompting a host of copycat legislation, including Oklahoma\u2019s latest and most extreme House Bill 4327.\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma\u2019s ban goes further than Texas\u2019s. Not only does it outlaw all abortion, but it also attempts to strip Oklahoma\u2019s state courts from any jurisdiction to consider whether the law violates state constitutional protections. That\u2019s important because the state\u2019s constitution has been interpreted as granting wide privacy protections, and state courts have repeatedly blocked various abortion restrictions from taking effect.\nThe bill also contains an emergency clause that would allow it to take effect immediately, which would deliver a crushing blow to abortion access across the region. When S.B. 8 took effect last September, Texas patients flooded into Oklahoma and the surrounding states in search of care. That in turn has displaced home-state patients, delayed appointments, and forced more people to seek care farther from home. If Oklahoma lawmakers are successful in shutting down access altogether \u2014 even if only temporarily \u2014 the consequences will reverberate across the region\u2019s increasingly stretched network of providers.\n\u201cOur government is not interested in keeping us safe or healthy. They are interested in surveilling and criminalizing our communities.\u201d\nOklahoma lawmakers have long pushed the envelope in their efforts to legislate abortion out of existence. Just this year, they\u2019ve passed three separate bans on abortion. In addition to H.B. 4327, lawmakers passed a ban in April that would criminalize abortion and subject providers to prison time. That measure, slated to take effect in August, contains an exception in the case of a medical emergency, defined in part as \u201ca condition which cannot be remedied by delivery of the child.\u201d Weeks later, lawmakers passed a six-week copycat ban, Senate Bill 1503, which also strips state courts of jurisdiction to consider legal challenges. The ban includes an exception for a medical emergency, but none for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. (The newest ban, H.B. 4327, does include a rape or incest exception, but only if the assault has been reported to police.) Stitt readily signed the first two bills into law. The six-week ban took effect May 3.\nDuring the April signing ceremony for the criminalization bill, Stitt was asked what Oklahoma could do to \u201cdeal with\u201d all the Texans coming to the state in search of care. \u201cYou mean have Highway Patrol arrest the Texans that come across our border?\u201d he joked as laughter broke out in the room. \u201cThis bill will take care of that. We certainly don\u2019t want Texans coming up to Oklahoma.\u201d\nDr. Iman Alsaden, medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which provides abortion services in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas, was anything but amused during the call after H.B. 4327 passed. \u201cThe fact that Oklahoma politicians are proud of passing today\u2019s total abortion ban is an embarrassment to our state,\u201d she said. \u201cToday\u2019s actions make clear that our government is not interested in keeping us safe or healthy. They are interested in surveilling and criminalizing our communities.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no aspect of what is happening with these abortion bans in Oklahoma that is normal. It is truly insane.\u201d\nOklahoma\u2019s passage of multiple bans has created confusion. In addition to the three passed this year, the state already had a trigger law on the books that would ban abortion if Roe is overturned. Two additional bans were passed in 2021, both of which are currently in litigation. The Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to block the six-week copycat law from taking immediate effect in May, but that measure is also the subject of pending litigation in the lower courts. When H.B. 4327 is signed, Muqaddam said, it will be added to the growing pile of legal challenges.\n\u201cThe Oklahoma Legislature \u2026 repeatedly enacts overlapping laws in an insane way that makes no sense,\u201d Muqaddam said. \u201cThere is no aspect of what is happening with these abortion bans in Oklahoma that is normal. It is truly insane.\u201d\nWhich of Oklahoma\u2019s bans might be the controlling law should the U.S. Supreme Court strike down Roe as expected remains to be seen. The situation has also confused patients, who have been calling clinics wondering if abortion is still legal. \u201cIt is,\u201d said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, \u201cbut it has never been more in danger.\u201d Still, providers and advocates said they will continue to do everything possible to help patients navigate their way to care.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no rhyme or reason\u201d to how Oklahoma is proceeding, Muqaddam said, \u201cother than a radical attempt to just confuse people, create chaos, and wreak as much havoc as they can possibly do on people who are seeking abortion and the providers who provide it.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jordan Smith          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      jordan.smith@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @chronic_jordan                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Abortion Activists Need to Win Back the Culture Before We Can Win Back the Court      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Overturning Roe v.
