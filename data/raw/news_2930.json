Make sure to catch the full show on EWTN TV at 10pmET.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI believe in having the courage to let the unborn be born.\u201d So said University of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh, who made headlines last month with a pro-life speech he gave July 17, serving as keynote speaker at Plymouth Right to Life\u2019s \u201cWe Were Made to Be Courageous\u201d event in Michigan.\nThe Catholic Big Ten coach gave a speech at the dinner and auction in which he explained his pro-life convictions. Afterward, a question-and-answer session further shed light on his beliefs \u2014 to the dismay of abortion supporters and to the applause of his local bishop and others.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an onstage exchange with Father John Riccardo, the founder of ACTS XXIX, an organization that supports Catholic clergy, Harbaugh offered to care for a baby if his players or children could not care for a child: \u201cI treat my players just like I do my own kids. I don\u2019t treat my own kids any different than my own players. So the message is the same \u2026 that I want to see them have the baby. And after the end of that term, when the baby\u2019s born, if they still don\u2019t feel like they are in a position to take care of the baby, give it to me.\u201d\n\u201cI love life, believe in having a loving care and respect for both life and death,\u201d Harbaugh said at the beginning of his address. \u00a0\n\u201cMy faith and my science are what drive these beliefs in me,\u201d said Harbaugh, quoting Jeremiah 1:5-6, \u201c\u2018Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Ah, sovereign Lord, I said, I do not know how to speak. I am only a child.\u2019 Science tells us there is new life at conception; there is new DNA, not the same as any other, including the mother and the father.\u201d\nServing as head coach of the Wolverines since 2015, Harbaugh acknowledged that the abortion issue is controversial and told the audience he respects the many passionate opinions that the subject elicits. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPassion can make the process messy, but when combined with respect, it ultimately produces the best outcomes. \u2026 I have faith in the American people to ultimately develop the right policies and laws that support all the lives involved,\u201d he said adding that \u201cwhile I advocate for pro-life laws from our government, I advocate just as aggressively for laws and government and private programs that will support the vulnerable mother, families, children, orphans and foster children.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cI have living proof in my family, my children, and the many thousands that I have coached, that the unborn become amazing gifts from God who make the world a much better place. To me, the right choice is to have the courage to let the unborn be born.\u201d\nHis speech took an experiential focus. He spoke of his first \u201chorrific\u201d memory as a young child of hearing about past societies that abandoned unwanted babies to die in the elements. He then recalled another childhood memory of hearing a local news report about a baby abandoned in a dumpster. And then, finally, he reminisced of first hearing about the reality of legalized abortion in the United States through the Roe v. Wade decision.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I was 10 years old, we were now living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and that was 1973,\u201d he said. \u201cI can remember thinking vividly about it and thinking about it in my room \u2026, \u2018That\u2019s no different. That\u2019s no different than the baby in the dumpster. That\u2019s no different than barbaric societies of the past who would kill their babies.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I remember sitting up in that room, and I was thinking, \u2018I could take that baby. I could use some of my lawn-mowing money. I could use my snow-shoveling money. I could feed that baby. It could stay right up here in this room with [my brother] John and me. And that baby would have some fun sometimes; sometimes it would have some fun.\u2019 And to this day, it, still to me, remains the most horrifying, horrific thing imaginable: that any society would not take care of their young, would not let the unborn be born, would kill their babies.\u201d\nFollowing the speech, the conversation between the coach and Father Riccardo, a priest of the Archdiocese of Detroit, captured headlines in particular.\n\u201cSo, Jim \u2026 say you get a guy in college who\u2019s playing for you, which is an all-too-real scenario \u2026 his girlfriend is pregnant, and he\u2019s thinking of an abortion. And he comes to you \u2026 what kind of advice do you give him? What do you say to guys when they come to you?\u201d the priest asked.\n\u201cSo I treat my players just like I do my own kids. I don\u2019t treat my own kids any different than my own players. So the message is the same. For my daughters, I\u2019ve told them that if they do become pregnant, that I want to see them have the baby. And after the end of that term, when the baby\u2019s born, if they still don\u2019t feel like they are in a position to take care of the baby, give it to me,\u201d the coach said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI say the same thing to our female employees at Michigan, \u2018After your term, if you don\u2019t want the baby \u2026 I\u2019ll take it; we have got a big house. Give us that baby. We\u2019ll make a few additions onto it as well.\u2019 And then to my boys or my players, same message: that I want them to be a loving supporter. Nobody gets pregnant without the man, as well. It\u2019s been too long that we\u2019ve made this just the woman\u2019s responsibility. We have to do more as men, not less, and encourage them to be a loving father for the family that they\u2019ve started. And I\u2019ve told them straight up, too, \u2018When the baby comes and you can\u2019t take care of it, she can\u2019t take it, you can\u2019t do a baby \u2026 give it to me and us, my family.\u2019 So that\u2019s what I would tell our family, whether it\u2019s anybody in our family or our family on the football team.\u201d\nHarbaugh continued to explain how he wants to stand up for those he cares about \u2014 including the littlest \u2014 in light of faith. \u201cI want to be on your side. I want to be on God\u2019s side. I want to be on the side of those unborn children.\u201d\nThe priest also asked him, in reference to the pro-life movement, \u201cWhat can we do collectively? How can we make an impact?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFirst, to recognize that millions of women will feel hopeless during this time. And the Church and us will need to have compassion, not a voice of condemnation,\u201d the coach said. \u201cMy heart goes out to women who have gone through unplanned pregnancies, and we need to train men to lovingly own responsibility for families they create. We need to be active in adoption and foster care. We need to continue to support ministries, who rescue women who are victims of abuse. And we need to pass laws to support these initiatives. Our talent, our resources, put those into action \u2026 we have a chance to vote in November. I mean, that\u2019s the least amount of effort it would possibly take to do anything. And then let\u2019s step it up from there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of evening, Father Riccardo pressed Harbaugh further, with one last question: \u201cYou have this unique opportunity to coach and to form young men \u2026 is there something you might say in a very special way to fathers?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve done that tonight. I think we\u2019ve probably spoken to the fathers, to the men, right? I mean, that you have a family, started a family: You know what that\u2019s about. Whether they\u2019re football players that are on your team, whether they\u2019re children that are in your home and these children have these big, wide, open hearts that this world loves to step all over: Who\u2019s going to stand guard? Who\u2019s going to protect them? You are, I am, the fathers are going to protect them and need to protect them. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been called to do, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been called to do by God. That is your God-given responsibility.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \njim harbaugh\npro-life\nuniversity of michigan\newtn pro-life weekly\n\n\n\n\nAmy Smith Amy Smith is a Register senior editor who edits features for the \u201cCulture of Life\u201d section.
