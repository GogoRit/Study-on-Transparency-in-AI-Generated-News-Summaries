Russo. On a 5-4 split, the Court struck down a Louisiana statute that required any doctor performing an abortion at a clinic to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, a rule that would have effectively reduced the number of clinics in the state to one. As the historian of reproductive rights Caroline Hymel noted in 2018, this law\u2019s passage, \u201ccoincided with the onset of the so-called \u2018culture wars\u2019 and the rise of the Christian Right, a loose alliance between conservative evangelicals and Catholics.\u201d\nIn reaching the conclusion that this law is unconstitutional, the majority, which featured a \u201cswing vote\u201d from Chief Justice John Roberts, left the essential reasoning of Roe v. Wade (1973) untouched. The Roe Court famously concluded that a woman\u2019s decision to end a pre-viability pregnancy is protected by the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which states that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The \u201cliberty\u201d the Clause protects, the Roe Court ruled, extends to reproductive privacy.\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet your fix of JSTOR Daily\u2019s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy \u00a0 Contact Us\nYou may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\n\u0394\n\n\n\nWhile June Medical no doubt represents a watershed victory for women\u2019s reproductive rights, it is also just the latest in a long series of cases that followed on the heels of the Court\u2019s partial rollback of Roe\u2019s effects, announced in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). The Court in Casey held that, Roe notwithstanding, states may place some limitations on abortion, so long as they do not impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the woman, defined by whether the regulation acts as a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d in seeking the procedure. By these lights, the Casey Court (William Rehnquist was the Chief Justice then) stated that a law requiring a woman to wait 24 hours, for example, did not impose an undue burden, but a law requiring spousal consent did.\n\nJune Medical leaves open an avenue for states to attempt to impose other costly, tedious, and moralizing restrictions on abortion.\n\nWriting at SCOTUSblog, the legal commentator Amy Howe notes that, given the complicated vote splits that have defined the Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence, the 5-4 split here means that Roberts\u2019 concurring opinion\u2014not the four-Justice plurality opinion signed by all three of the Court\u2019s women\u2014ultimately controls, since it is narrowest. The \u201cfragmented character\u201d of this decision, to borrow a phrase from the law professor Vanessa Laird, is, as she wrote of\u00a0Casey\u00a0itself, \u201cnothing new in the Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence.\u201d\nIn other words, while Roberts\u2014who also cast surprise \u201cliberal\u201d votes in high-profile cases on the Affordable Care Act and LGBTQ+ employment discrimination\u2014may seem to be making a key ideological concession, the real effect of the decision in June Medical is to reaffirm Casey. Roberts\u2019 interpretation of the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard is now the law of the land:\n\u2026the plurality expressly acknowledges that we are not considering how to analyze an abortion regulation that does not present a substantial obstacle. \u201cThat,\u201d the plurality explains, \u201cis not this case.\u201d In this case, Casey\u2019s requirement of finding a substantial obstacle before invalidating an abortion regulation is therefore a sufficient basis for the decision\u2026 I would adhere to the holding of Casey, requiring a substantial obstacle before striking down an abortion regulation.\nJune Medical thus leaves open an avenue for states to attempt to impose other costly, tedious, and moralizing restrictions on abortion, so long as they stop well enough short of regulating it out of existence (as Louisiana and other states tried to with admitting physician requirements). As Laird wrote: \u201cThe burden is now on the states and the lower courts to define the notion of a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion.\u201d June Medical just makes clear that an admitting physician requirement constitutes an undue burden.\nIn 2016, when confronted with a near-identical Texas law in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, Roberts voted with the dissent, implying that he believed that an admitting privileges requirement for physicians who perform abortions was constitutional as a \u201chealth and safety\u201d rule. However, June Medical saw Roberts, in an elaborate display of principal, claim that fidelity to precedent\u2014in legalese, stare decisis (Latin for \u201clet what has been decided stand\u201d)\u2014compelled him to concede that the issue was already litigated and decided in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which went 5-3 in favor of striking down the Texas law. If an admitting privileges law is an unconstitutional burden in Austin, surely the same is true in Shreveport. In this sense, June Medical carries a certain finality, closing the loop on a decades-long attempted conservative end-run around Roe.\nIn other words, Roberts\u2019 \u201cconcession\u201d comes at the cost of his vigorous reaffirmation of Casey\u2019s undue burden standard. For the time being\u2014he has decided for America\u2014Casey is the paradigm, and some state regulations on abortion likely will withstand constitutional scrutiny if challenged under it. This result is justified, Roberts says, not only by women\u2019s health and safety, but because paternalism around abortion is basically reasonable:\nthe State may\u2026 \u201cenact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term\u201d (quoting Casey).\nMeanwhile, by narrowly positioning his argument as being principally about stare decisis, Roberts expressly reserves the possibility of a future Court\u2014perhaps one without 87-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2014revisiting Roe\u2019s central holding:\nI joined the dissent in Whole Woman\u2019s Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided. The question today however is not whether Whole Woman\u2019s Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case\u2026\nBoth Louisiana and the providers agree that the undue burden standard announced in Casey provides the appropriate framework to analyze Louisiana\u2019s law. Neither party has asked us to reassess the constitutional validity of that standard.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, together with much of the Christian Right, has been eager to overrule Roe for decades. He writes in his June Medical dissent:\nToday a majority of the Court perpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction. As is often the case with legal challenges to abortion regulations, this suit was brought by abortionists and abortion clinics. Their sole claim before this Court is that Louisiana\u2019s law violates the purported substantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child. But they concede that this right does not belong to them, and they seek to vindicate no private rights of their own\u2026\nThe plurality and the Chief Justice ultimately cast aside this jurisdictional barrier to conclude that Louisiana\u2019s law is unconstitutional under our precedents. But those decisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitution\u2019s text. Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.\nThus, in an opinion that proudly wraps itself in the mantle of upholding the law as Law, as Rule, Roberts has carefully left the door open for future conservatives to take another crack at disestablishing a 47-year-old landmark case, which still stands for women\u2019s reproductive freedom. Roberts\u2019 opinion includes what might be called a brief ode to stare decisis:\nThis principle is grounded in a basic humility that recognizes today\u2019s legal issues are often not so different from the questions of yesterday and that we are not the first ones to try to answer them\u2026 The constraint of precedent distinguishes the judicial method and philosophy from those of the political and legislative process.\nThe doctrine also brings pragmatic benefits. Respect for precedent promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. It is the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion. [Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.]\nThis statement is a strange heel-turn for a Chief Justice who, ten years ago in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\u2014a case that overturned a then-twenty-year-old precedent limiting corporate spending on politics\u2014intoned skeptically: \u201cWhen considering whether to reexamine a prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance of having constitutional questions decided against the importance of having them decided right.\u201d When it comes to women\u2019s reproductive choices, Roberts evidently believes that this \u201cbalance\u201d just so happens to tip in favor of retaining the possibility of re-litigating Roe.
