The number of family units confined tripled compared to any previous year on record.  With these increasing numbers of detained individuals, facilities detaining migrants run by CBP and Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) were constantly at- or over-capacity prior to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe detention of immigrants is inherently a violation of reproductive justice, as it denies people their bodily autonomy and human rights. Within the system, practices of and conditions in detention facilities compound the problem, as horrifically exemplified by the coerced sterilization of detained people in a Georgia center. This document provides yet another view, by highlighting a number of areas in which CBP and ICE facilities are failing to meet the basic needs of detained individuals with respect to reproductive health care and the care of young children.\nThis report seeks to promote awareness of these problems among the legal and medical providers working with detained people, and to provide ready access to some of the relevant legal standards. The four areas of focus\u2014menstruation-related hygiene, access to diapers and formula, lactation accommodations, and pregnancy-related medical care\u2014are not exclusive nor exhaustive but were the areas most frequently mentioned in interviews conducted with formerly detained persons. Because CBP and ICE officials often failed to inform the detained individuals where they were being held in a language that they understood, most of those interviewed did not know the names of the facilities, or whether they were held in a CBP or ICE facility. Many interviewees also reported being transferred to multiple facilities during their detention.\nWe hope that, by applying a reproductive justice lens to immigration detention, these documents offer a new advocacy avenue to support and enhance legal and service providers\u2019 powerful work with and on behalf of people who have been subjected to immigration detention in the United States.\nHear from people currently experiencing barriers to their reproductive health and learn more about the consequences when these barriers go unchecked by exploring menu options below.\nFor references, see the PDF download.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Access to Menstruation-Related Hygiene\n\n\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t given any menstruation pads. I asked officials three times and was told to wait but they never came. On the first day, I was given one shirt and had to tear it up to make some padding. I also had to use diapers as pads.\" \u2013 Angelica*, 30 *All names from here on are pseudonyms to protect the identities of interviewees.\n\nRestricted access to appropriate menstrual hygiene products and the inability to change such products when needed can lead to individuals developing urinary tract infections, vaginal bacterial and yeast infections, and life-threatening gynecologic infections such as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Prolonged use of a tampon, for instance, can lead to Toxic Shock Syndrome, a rapid and deadly infection. Such untreated vaginal infections are also associated with cervical cancer and can cause infertility and sterility. The use of unhygienic substitutes due to the denial of sufficient menstrual products can also lead to higher rates of infection.\n\nDetention facilities\u2019 policies state that individuals should have access to basic personal hygiene items. For example, ICE\u2019s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) specifies that \u201cfemale detainees shall be issued and may retain sufficient feminine hygiene items, including sanitary pads or tampons.\u201d  Yet detained people consistently reported that immigration jails fail to adhere to these policies.\n\nInterviewees reported that they often had to knock on the doors of their cell and ask an official\u2014who didn\u2019t always speak or understand the detained person\u2019s language\u2014for supplies like menstrual pads and toilet paper. They experienced delays in accessing these supplies due to insufficient supplies or selective distribution of supplies by detention staff. For example, Beatriz, 15, remembered being given one pad a day, but on other occasions, only six pads were distributed to a room of 80 people who could have been menstruating. Staff members told her that there were too many women  and there weren\u2019t enough supplies for everyone.\nIn other instances, staff would simply refuse to provide supplies and/or would become angry with those asking for them. For example, according to Celia, 44: \u201cThey didn\u2019t have any supplies for us, so we had to knock and ask for menstrual products and toilet paper when we ran out. Some guards would get mad and yell at us or refuse to give it to us.\u201d\nSome interviewees, like Angelica, were never given any menstrual hygiene products and had to utilize what limited other resources they had on hand\u2014such as diapers, toilet paper, or even their own clothing. Angelica also described the lack of access to other essential hygiene supplies. She was given only one pair of underwear upon her arrival, which she had to wear for the 10 days she was detained. Despite asking for a clean pair, since hers was messy with blood, the officials refused to give her another. She was also denied a shower.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Access to Diapers\n\n\n\n\"My two-year-old daughter was sick while we were detained in Calexico. She was having diarrhea and refused to eat. I asked the officials to have her see a doctor but they said it wasn\u2019t an emergency. The officials told us to stop bothering them with requests. They only gave us one diaper a day despite her having diarrhea. I had to use my own clothes to clean my child. We didn\u2019t even have spare toilet paper. They only gave us one toilet paper roll for the 50 people in the cell a day.\" \u2013 Flor, 30\n\"We were given two diapers for my one-year-old upon arrival and then, when I requested more diapers, I had to wait six hours for another diaper.\" \u2013 Elizabeth, 31\n\n\nDetention facilities should provide diapers and wipes in a timely manner. Infants are unable to control their bowel habits and time their bowel movements to more ideal conditions. Delay in changing an infant\u2019s diaper after it is soiled can lead to dermatitis, or urinary or skin infections.  In ICE\u2019s clinical manual for nurses and other medical professionals under the ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC), which provides direct care to the detained persons housed at 21 designated facilities throughout the country, the guidelines state that \u201c[p]revention [of diaper dermatitis] is key to treatment.\u201d It further recommends that medical professionals educate parents to \u201cchange soiled diapers as soon as possible . . . [and as frequently as] every two hours during the day,\u201d if dermatitis is present.\nStandards governing detention facilities dictate the provision of such hygiene items for infants. The 2011 PBNDS standards that govern ICE\u2019s interactions with detained individuals state that \u201cdetainees shall be provided with basic personal hygiene items (e.g., . . . diapers and sanitary wipes), as appropriate.\u201d  Meanwhile, TEDS states that, while in CBP custody, \u201c[f]amilies with small children should have access to diapers and baby wipes.\u201d \nInterviewees\u2019 experiences demonstrate that, despite these CBP and ICE standards, detained people are being denied diapers in the quantity and timeframe that they need and that the standards ostensibly support. Interviewees consistently reported that although they knocked on cell doors and asked staff members for more diapers for their young children, officials often withheld the supplies, informing the parents that they had to wait for an undisclosed and arbitrary amount of time. For example, Gabriela, 23, stated that \u201c[t]he room was so cold that my four-year-old son didn\u2019t want to take off his pants to use the bathroom despite being potty trained. I ended up putting diapers on him. I had to keep asking for diapers. They ended up only giving me five diapers in two days and when I asked for more, they told me, \u2018there\u2019s no more; you have to wait\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Lactation Accommodations and Support\n\n\n\n\"We were detained in a large room with as many as 100 women and men, some adults as old as in their 40s. I was primarily breastfeeding my two-month-old baby, but there was no privacy. I had to bare my breast in front of everyone every 15-20 minutes to feed her.\" \u2013 Josefina, 19\n\nBreastfeeding infants is strongly recommended by leading health organizations around the world and has been proven to be unambiguously beneficial to both parent and child.  For the child, breastfeeding is protective against diabetes, infections, and even respiratory illnesses. Meanwhile, breastfeeding parents have lower risk of developing high blood pressure, obesity, and certain cancers. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for a child\u2019s first 6 months of life.  Lactation is a pregnancy-related condition, and so refusing to give nursing parents appropriate lactation accommodations is a denial of medically necessary health care.\nUnlike for the other issues examined in this document, current CBP and ICE standards lack any explicit requirements around lactation beyond having intake screening questions regarding breastfeeding.  However, the 2011 PBNDS incorporates the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) standards which delineate the standards for a carceral health delivery system in the United States. The 2017 NCCHC standards adopted a position statement highlighting the importance of centers to \u201cdevise systems to enable postpartum women to express breast milk for their babies and to breastfeed them directly.\u201d  Current NCCHC standards do recommend that \u201c[f]acilities should consider support for lactating mothers and those with breast engorgement who are not nursing\u201d but do not specify how such support may take form.\nDetention facilities should be cognizant of creating spaces that encourage breastfeeding. For example, privacy is a key component in supporting one\u2019s comfort and ability to breastfeed one\u2019s child. Instead, detention center officials have been reported to be dismissive and openly antagonistic of breastfeeding. As the intake coordinator of a humanitarian non-profit organization on the border described, \u201cI perform intakes of hundreds of migrants for a legal clinic every week. A few weeks ago, a woman came, carrying a baby about seven months old. She asked me if it was okay to breastfeed there. Startled, I reassured her that it was fine to do so and found her a seat in a private office to do so. She began to cry. I asked her why she was crying, and she told me that while she was detained, an official told her that she should be ashamed for breastfeeding in public. As a result, she didn\u2019t breastfeed her child the entire time she was detained.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Access to Sufficient Formula\n\n\n\n\"I usually breastfeed my youngest child, which has never been a problem, but while in the icebox [cramped holding cells in CBP custody], I hadn\u2019t been given very much food, so I wasn\u2019t eating very well. After three days, my breastmilk dried up and so I had to switch to formula to feed my child. I had to knock and ask for formula. A few officials told me to stop asking for diapers and formula, and I was only given one diaper a day. I was afraid to ask for more because they would yell at me. My baby was only given one small plastic cup [approximately three to five ounces] of formula to drink a day, and she didn\u2019t drink very well because she was so cold all the time.\" \u2013  Dolores, 29\n\n\nInfants need regular feedings throughout the day. From as early as a few weeks of age, infants may require 32 ounces of formula a day.  Particularly at this age, appropriate nutrition lays the foundation for a child\u2019s lifetime of healthy development and growth. Very young babies who are insufficiently fed are at risk of developing low blood sugar, low blood pressure, and even irreversible brain injury.\nMultiple laws and standards are in place dictating proper treatment of juveniles in detention.  At a minimum, ICE is required to meet basic standards of care for minor non-citizens in its custody.  The 2011 PBNDS standards expound upon this requirement by highlighting that \u201cminors, pregnant women and others shall have access to snacks, milk, and juice.\u201d  The TEDS standards specifies that juveniles must have \u201cregular access to . . . milk.\u201d \nYet, detained parents and other bystander witnesses regularly reported hungry, crying babies in custody. The infant of one interviewee Gloria, 38, was only given one or two two-fluid-ounce bottles of formula each day and cried constantly from hunger. The one-year-old son of another parent Araceli, 31, was so hungry, he couldn\u2019t sleep; her requests for more formula were frequently met with staff members yelling at her and shutting the door in her face. He lost three pounds, or 15% of his body weight, after being detained for eight days.\nSometimes, detained people had access to a table full of supplies, including formula, diapers, crackers, and juice. However, the restocking of these tables was inconsistent and not based on when items ran out. One adolescent Linda, 14, noted that even infants went hungry when the tables ran out of formula. Furthermore, many of the food items on these tables were expired by several months, yet individuals who were detained\u2014even young children\u2014still ate these expired items because there were no other options. As one interviewee Esmerelda, 30, described, \u201cAll of us were also skeptical about the quality of the food and the formula given the past expiration dates, but we were so hungry, we still ate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Pregnancy Care\n\n\n\n\"I knew I was about two months pregnant when I arrived to the border from Honduras. No one asked about my pregnancy status when I was detained; and, I wasn\u2019t given the chance to take a pregnancy test. On my second day of detention, I started having heavy vaginal bleeding with clots. My belly also hurt. I told an official, but he looked at me and said that I was a liar. I kept having heavy vaginal bleeding my entire time detained. The whole room of women were only given one box of sanitary pads (about 12 pads) a day and two rolls of toilet paper. If you asked for more, the officials yelled at you and shut the door in your face. The other women in the room saw that I was bleeding a lot and gave me their toilet paper since there weren\u2019t enough pads. I was too scared to ask the officials for any medicine for my belly pain because I didn\u2019t want them to be angry with me. I never saw a doctor. I was released to Mexico after five days. In Mexico, I couldn\u2019t go to a doctor because my husband and I didn\u2019t have enough money. I was bleeding enough to fill six pads a day. A month later, I fainted, and my husband called an ambulance. I was brought to the hospital and found to have an incomplete miscarriage. The doctor immediately injected me with iron to help me with my anemia. I needed six more injections in the coming weeks. I have four children. This has never happened before.\" \u2013 Cynthia, 28\n\n\nMiscarriage is just one potential serious complication in pregnancy; others include preeclampsia and eclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, and hemorrhage.  In fact, an estimated six to eight percent of pregnancies experience high-risk complications.  Meanwhile, stress has been linked to a 42% increase in the likelihood of miscarriage.  Since detention is a major source of stress and trauma for a population that is likely already traumatized, staff at detention facilities should be attuned to the increased needs and risks of possible pregnancy complications of this vulnerable population. \n\nAs part of their arrival process to either ICE or CBP detention, female detained persons must undergo an initial health assessment that is supposed to inquire, in part, whether they are pregnant or lactating.  A pregnancy test may also be used to confirm an individual\u2019s pregnancy status. These screenings are to determine whether certain people who are detained, such as those with physical disability or with previous sexual trauma, should be considered and labeled as \u201cat [higher] risk\u201d than the general population.  However, nearly all women interviewed for this article reported not being screened for pregnancy or breastfeeding before they were placed into a cell.\n\nDespite PBNDS 2011\u2019s section on women\u2019s medical care clearly stating that pregnant detained people should receive \u201cclose medical supervision\u201d as well as \u201caccess to prenatal and specialized care and comprehensive counseling,\u201d   national data suggest that violations of these standards are rampant. Multiple parents have reported loss of a pregnancy while detained; the number of miscarriages in ICE detention facilities has doubled since August 2018.  Most of the parents who experienced a miscarriage describe a delay of hours, up to days or weeks, until they received medical attention; some did not see a medical provider while detained at all, and were released, still bleeding and in pain.\n\n\nAdvocates at legal aid organizations operating across the border also noticed increased numbers of asylum seekers suffering miscarriages while detained by US immigration authorities at the border. One attorney described similarities in three recent cases brought to the attention of her organization: \u201cthe women made repeated requests for help from authorities after experiencing vaginal bleeding. Instead of attending to the women, immigration authorities ignored them for hours, leaving them to bleed and miscarry in their cells, and only bringing them to a hospital after it was too late.\u201d  These stories reveal a widespread pattern of detention centers neglecting the medical needs of their particularly vulnerable detained persons and failing to adhere to their own standards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBarriers to Reproductive Justice While Detained: Key Standards\nThis Key Standards reference document accompanies the Barriers to Reproductive Justice While Detained report and highlights applicable requirements relating to reproductive health and the care of young children in immigration detention settings, as set out in U.S Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) standards. For references, see the PDF download.\nThe standards examined in this document are the 2015 Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS), as applied to CBP facilities; the 2008 Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS), its 2011/2016 updates, and relevant1 National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) standards,2 as applied to dedicated ICE facilities; and the 2000 National Detention Standards (NDS) and its 2019 update, as applied to non-dedicated ICE facilities.\nThe standards discussed in this reference document include access to menstruation-related hygiene products; access to diapers and formula; lactation accommodations; and pregnancy care, such as diet and medical care. This reference document is not meant to be an exhaustive resource, nor does it delve into other important issues, such as sexual assault or the unique challenges faced by transgender and nonbinary individuals in detention.\nA note on gendered language: this toolkit often uses the term \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cwomen,\u201d which reflects the language of the standards discussed. Otherwise, this toolkit strives to use gender-neutral language whenever possible.\nBackground\nThe United States government reportedly maintains the largest immigration detention network in the world. As of September 2019, this network includes at least 37 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-dedicated facilities and 186 ICE non-dedicated facilities, county and local jails that contract with ICE to confine individuals.3 No reliable statistics have been released about the number of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detention facilities in the country; these in- clude both facilities at ports of entry and Border Patrol stations in the interior of the United States.\nEach detention facility is subject to certain standards. Since October 2015, CBP has operated its detention facilities under the National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS).4 But the standards to which a particular ICE detention center is subject to depends on numerous factors, thus muddying the legal landscape and enforceability of the standards. These factors include: which federal agency operates or contracts for the facility; the state in which the facility is located (and pertinent state laws); applicable case law; whether the facility is ICE- dedicated or not; and whether the facility is publicly or privately operated.\nAll federal facilities detaining minors are additionally bound by the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, which will not be discussed in this document.\nStandards for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Detention Facilities\nNational Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS) 2015: CBP operates its detention facilities under the TEDS 2015 guidelines, which recognize numerous federal statutes and regulations binding CBP to certain standards of care. These standards set out to establish a barer minimum of agency conduct.\nStandards for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Dedicated Facilities\nPerformance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS): The PBNDS standards, initially issued in 2008 and updated twice, govern ICE-dedicated detention facilities.\n2008 PBNDS. Despite only mentioning female detainees three times, the 2008 PBNDS standards are the first standards to make explicit reference to the sexual assault and rape standards contained in the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003.\n2011 PBNDS. In the 2011 update, the PBNDS became the first detention standards to specifically address women\u2019s medical care, requiring facilities to provide gynecological and obstetrical health care in compliance with the NCCHC.\n2016 PBNDS.  In the 2016 update, PREA was incorporated into the PBNDS, as was Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, which prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires facilities to provide detainees with disabilities equal access to its programs and activities. Revisions also included improvement of communication protocols with detainees of limited English proficiency, the addition of the reporting requirement of pregnant detainees, and clarification of reporting and medical care timelines for detainees who may be pregnant or indicate a history of domestic abuse or violence.\nNational Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) 2018: NCCHC standards were created under the American Medical Association in the 1970s and are updated frequently. The most recent revisions were released in 2018. These standards are the recommended requirements for a carceral healthcare delivery system. They are explicitly folded into PBNDS 2011 and thus apply to ICE-dedicated facilities. In contrast, ICE no longer requires the non-dedicated facilities that are governed by the NDS to maintain accreditation with or follow the standards of the NCCHC.\nStandards for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Non-Dedicated Facilities\nNational Detention Standards (NDS): The NDS guidelines, initially issued in 2000 and updated in 2019, gov- ern the treatment of people held by ICE in facilities that are not solely dedicated to ICE, such as local and state jails and prisons.\nNDS 2000. A product of collaboration between the American Bar Association and the U.S. Department of Justice, the NDS 2000 was the first revision of the first set of standards on the treatment of persons in immigration detention, specifically under ICE.\nNDS 2019. This updated set of guidelines no longer requires health care programs at these facilities to be under direction of a licensed physician, but does add new provisions for the prevention and intervention of sexual abuse and assault in detention, as required by PREA. It governs the treatment of immigrant detainees in almost 140 facilities in 44 states.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Access to Menstruation-Related Hygiene Products\n\n\n\nStandards for CBP Detention Facilities\nTEDS:\n\nOfficers/Agents will consider the best interest of the juvenile at all decision points beginning at the first encounter and continuing through processing, detention, transfer, or repatriation.\nDetainees must be provided with basic personal hygiene items . . . detainees using the restroom will have access to toiletry items, such as toilet paper and sanitary napkins.\nJuveniles will be given access to basic hygiene articles, and clean bedding. When available, juveniles will be provided clean and dry clothing. Officers/Agents may give access to these provisions to any juvenile at any time.\n\nStandards for ICE-Dedicated Detention Facilities\nPBNDS 2008\n\nEach detention facility shall have a written policy and procedures for the regular issuance and exchange of clothing, bedding, linens, towels, and personal hygiene items. The supply of these items shall exceed the minimum required for the number of detainees to prevent delay in replacing the items. To be prepared for unforeseen circumstances, it is good practice for a detention facility to maintain an excess clothing inventory that is at least 200 percent of the maximum funded detainee capacity. . . Clothing that is worn out, indelibly stained . . . should be discarded and replaced as soon as practicable.\nStaff shall provide male and female detainees personal hygiene items appropriate for their gender and shall replenish supplies as needed. The distribution of hygiene items shall not be used as reward or punishment. . . Female detainees shall be issued and may retain feminine hygiene items as needed . . . the responsible housing unit officer shall replenish personal hygiene items on an as-needed basis, in accordance with written facility procedures.\nDetainees shall be provided with clean clothing, linen, and towels on the following basis: a daily change of socks and undergarments. An additional exchange of undergarments shall be made available to detainees if necessary for health or sanitary reasons.\n\nPBNDS 2011 & 2016\n\nDetainees shall be provided with basic personal hygiene items (e.g., water, disposable cups, soap, toilet paper, feminine-hygiene items, diapers, and sanitary wipes), as appropriate.\nFemale detainees shall be issued and may retain sufficient feminine hygiene items, including sanitary pads or tampons, for use during the menstrual cycle . . . The responsible housing unit officer shall replenish personal hygiene items on an as-needed basis, in accordance with written facility procedures.

For example, NCCHC states that the use of restraints is potentially harmful to the pregnant woman and fetus.  Overall, NCCHC is the most detailed in highlighting a comprehensive approach to the medical screening and care of pregnant detainees.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\nTheresa Cheng, MD, JD, conducted the interviews and wrote this document in collaboration with the ACLU of California\u2019s Gender, Sexuality, and Reproductive Justice and Immigrants\u2019 Rights teams.
