The share of opponents dropped from 35 percent to 28 percent.\u201cThe stark differences in the two versions of the question shows just how important wording can be when it comes to public opinion,\u201d Binder was quoted saying. \u201cIf people see a benefit for the state, such as increased funding for education, they\u2019re more likely to support a variety of policies. One of the big reasons lotteries were legalized at the state level in the first place was that a large chunk of those revenues went toward education and online gambling supporters are simply following in those footsteps.\u201d\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
