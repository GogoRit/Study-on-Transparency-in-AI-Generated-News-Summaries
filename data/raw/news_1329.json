Solis/AP Photo \n\n\n\n\n\nDespite uncertainty about the enforceability of Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban, there are fears it could already be hurting recruitment of students interested in becoming OB-GYN\u2019s or family practice physicians in the state. During a Tuesday presentation hosted by Wisconsin Health News, lawyers and physicians discussed the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade abortion protections in June. Diane Welsh, an attorney at Pines Bach LLP in Madison, said \u201cthe biggest question\u201d is whether doctors can be charged with felonies under a pre-Civil War ban on most abortions in Wisconsin. \n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we have not had the Legislature reaffirm that statute,\u201d said Welsh. \u201cThey were called back into special session by Gov. Evers, and they didn\u2019t take action. They didn\u2019t take action to reaffirm the old ban or pass a modern ban or amend this in any way.\u201dWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat running for reelection, filed a lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court four days after Roe was struck down. It claims the 1849 law shouldn\u2019t be enforced because it conflicts with more recent statutes. Kaul originally listed Republican leaders of the state Legislature as defendants, but Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, and State Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, were dismissed from the case after successfully arguing they weren\u2019t proper targets. Kaul amended the suit to name three district attorneys as defendants. Welsh said while the courts and the Legislature sort out legal questions, physicians have had to decide whether to provide medical services that weren\u2019t suspect months ago.  \u201cSo, from a practical standpoint, it\u2019s had a chilling effect.\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin ended abortion procedures June 25.Dr. Abigail Cutler, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said another practical effect is that medical students doing residencies at Wisconsin hospitals won\u2019t be able to learn about training related to inducing abortions, which also applies to miscarriage management. \u201cBut in a state like Wisconsin, where we\u2019re already concerned about women\u2019s health care providers, OB-GYN shortages, this is a real worry that we would not be able to recruit and retain physicians who want to work in this space or even just doctors, you know, who want to live here and are worried about the impacts of this law on their own health,\u201d said Cutler.  In September, the Mayo Clinic Health System announced it would end labor and delivery services at hospitals in Barron and Menomonie due to staffing shortages that predated Roe being overturned.  Wisconsin Medical Society President Dr. Wendy Molaska said the state of abortion law in Wisconsin was so unclear after a draft U.S. Supreme Court decision was leaked months before Roe was struck down, the organization \u201cstarted to scramble.\u201d \u201cThe Medical Society was trying to sit down with our lawyers and come up with some kind of written guidance that we could provide to our members to say, \u2018This is what\u2019s okay, this isn\u2019t what\u2019s okay,\u2019\u201d said Molaska. But because of the uncertainty surrounding the 1849 abortion statute, Molaska said the group changed course. \u201cAnd what we decided, as we started working on this, is this could actually become a problem for us rather than a help in terms of providing some kind of written black and white guidance,\u201d said Molaska. \u201cBecause this could then be used against us potentially if us physicians ended up having to go to court.\u201d\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nSheboygan County DA to appeal ruling that abortions are legal to Wisconsin Supreme Court \n\n \n\n\n\nHead of anti-abortion group files license complaints against Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, OB-GYN \n\n \n\n\n\nHow We Got Here: Abortion in Wisconsin since 1849 \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
