Aquila, who expressed his support for the initiative early on. \u201cProtecting children in the womb is an essential part of building a society that treats all life, no matter its age or ability, as sacred. God has given each person a dignity that comes from being made in his image and likeness, and the degree to which our laws reflect that will be the degree to which we experience true freedom and happiness.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe desire to change the culture of death in Colorado is real,\u201d\u00a0said\u202fDeacon Geoff Bennett, Vice President of Parish and Community Relations at Catholic Charities of Denver. \u201cWe have seen strong bipartisan support with\u00a0the signature collection effort\u2026\u00a0During this pandemic Colorado has become a destination place for those seeking abortions from other states.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording\u00a0to the Secretary of State, the campaign initially submitted\u00a0over 137,000 petition signatures of which only a little over 114,000 were determined to be valid signatures. However, during a two-week cure period granted after falling short, over 400\u00a0volunteers\u00a0worked diligently and\u00a0collected another\u00a048,000 signatures by May 28, nearly five times the amount sought during the cure period.\u00a0Of those signatures,\u00a038,557 were\u00a0validated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThis is an incredible victory for Due Date Too Late and our dedicated volunteers, who worked tirelessly to ensure that Coloradans will have the chance to vote to save lives from late-term abortion in November,\u201d\u00a0said Lauren Castillo, spokesperson for the Due Date Too Late campaign.\u00a0\u201cThe numbers handed in are indicative of the overwhelming support for Initiative 120 and we are prepared and excited for the next step in the campaign.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIf passed,\u00a0Initiative 120 would restrict abortions after 22 weeks\u00a0of\u00a0pregnancy in the state of Colorado, with the only exception being if the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Under Initiative 120, a person conducting the abortion could be subject to having a medical license suspended and would be subjected to a fine, but it wouldn\u2019t impose a penalty on the woman receiving the abortion.\u00a0Colorado is one of several states in the country that allows unborn babies to be aborted for any reason up to birth.\u00a0- Advertisement -\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity to limit the assault on children in the womb,\u201d\u00a0Deacon Bennett added. \u201cColorado has allowed the killing of the unborn up until birth\u00a0since 1967.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\nIn 1967, Colorado was the first state to eliminate abortion restrictions and it\u00a0remains a destination for late-term abortions\u00a0just as Deacon Bennett stated.\u00a0However, this\u00a0could change if state residents vote\u00a0to restrict abortion laws by passing\u00a0Initiative 120, in the November ballot.\u00a0\u00a0\nFeatured image by Christian Bowen | Unsplash\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinPinterestEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n\n\n\nPrevious article\u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God\u2026\u201dNext articleA conversation with Black Catholics on racism\n\nRocio MaderaRocio is the Communications Specialist for both El Pueblo Cat\u00f3lico and Denver Catholic.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\nFeast Days  \n\nBake St. Joseph\u2019s Bread for the Solemnity\n\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nNew recreation center for St. John Vianney seminarians breaks ground\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nPHOTOS | St. John Vianney Seminary celebrates 25 years with special Mass\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n \n\nPrepare your hearts for Easter joy at a Lenten Penance Service\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhy get married in a church?\n\n\nMarch 11, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day: History, spirituality and traditions\n\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nFacebookInstagramTwitter\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nLea nuestra publicaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol \n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFeast Days\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day: History, spirituality and traditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJared Staudt\nA Biblical Path for Lent: Brant Pitre\u2019s Introduction to the Spiritual Life\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLent\nOne Less Thorn for Every Act of Charity: A Beautiful Lenten Tradition to Embrace with Your Children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCatholic News Agency\nMeet the young Catholic pilgrims who will walk thousands of miles with the Eucharist this summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFeast Days\nBake St. Joseph\u2019s Bread for the Solemnity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Catholic Faith\nAll Saints\u2019 Day not a Holy Day of Obligation in 2021, but go to Mass anyways!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSaints\nWhy is devotion to Mary important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFeatures\nOur Lady Of Guadalupe: The miracle that changed history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEucharist\nThe Eucharist throughout history: A timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJared Staudt\nArs Moriendi: The art of dying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\nContact\nPast Issues\nEvents\nAdvertising\nObituaries\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1999-2023 Archdiocese of Denver.
