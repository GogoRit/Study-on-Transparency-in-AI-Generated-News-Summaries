But across the state, we\u2019re seeing that accessing adequate reproductive and pregnancy care in jails is often a frightening and traumatic experience.Pregnant people who are incarcerated often receive biased, coercive information about their reproductive options, get substandard prenatal and postnatal care that endangers their health, and are denied reasonable accommodations that help ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy.That's why we need AB 732, which improves the quality of the healthcare and accommodations pregnant people receive in California's jails.Bill Developments\nAugust 20, 2020: Approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee\nJuly 31, 2020: Approved by the Senate Public Safety CommitteeJanuary 27, 2020: Passed the AssemblyJanuary 23, 2020: Approved by the Assembly Appropriations CommitteeMarch 26, 2019: Approved by the Assembly Public Safety CommitteeFebruary 19, 2019: Bill is introduced \n\n\n\n\n      Sponsors    \n\n    ACLU of California, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Women\u2019s Policy Institute of the Women\u2019s Foundation of California, and Young Women\u2019s Freedom Center  \n\n\n\n      Authors    \n\n    Assembly Member Bonta; Coauthors: Assembly Members Lim\u00f3n and Weber, Senator Mitchell  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Status    \n\n    Passed House  \n\n\n\n      Session    \n\n    2019-2020  \n\n\n\n      Bill number    \n\nAB 732 \n\n\n\n      Position    \n\n    Support  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove care for pregnant people in jail\n\n\n \n\nYES on AB 732 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReproductive Health Care in California Jails \nKnow Your Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated IssuesGender Equity and Reproductive Justice\nJails Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related content    \n\n\n \nImprove care for pregnant people in jail\n\n \nOn the 47th Anniversary of Roe, Let's Advance Reproductive Justice...January 22, 2020\n\n \nReproductive Health Care in California JailsOctober 24, 2017\n\n \nOvercrowded and inhumane: How a 1975 lawsuit on horrific jail...December 21, 2023\n\n \n23 Books Leading Us To A More Just And Equitable FutureJuly 11, 2023\n\n \nLeading the way, the California wayJune 27, 2023\n\n \nSex Worker Rights in CaliforniaJanuary 9, 2023\n\n \nThis is what happens when we vote!November 17, 2022\n\n \nACLU SoCal 2022 Ballot GuideOctober 4, 2022\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch aclusocal.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Assistance\nPress\nContact\nShop\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on Instagram\nACLU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 ACLU of Southern California\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
