(Annmarie Timmins | New Hampshire Bulletin)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was updated March 24, 2023 at 8:45 a.m. to correct the name of the representative who addressed a proposed constitutional amendment.\u00a0\nThe support of several Republican House lawmakers Thursday gave Democrats wins on significant abortion bills.\nBy fairly wide margins, members voted to remove criminal and civil penalties from the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban and to prohibit the state from further restricting access to an abortion.\u00a0\nLegislation repealing the 24-week ban ended in a 192-192 tie, with five Republicans supporting repeal. The bill was tabled and is likely to stay there; un-tabling it requires a two-thirds vote moving forward.\nAnd two bills that would have further restricted access to an abortion failed, again because Republicans joined Democrats in voting them down.\nHouse Majority Leader Jason Osborne, an Auburn Republican, issued a statement immediately after the votes, calling Democrats\u2019 support for all three bills \u201cradical.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhile it is easy for extremist Democrats to use heated rhetoric to try to advance their radical agenda, the fact of the matter is that public opinion is not on their side,\u201d Osborne said.\u00a0\nHis statement did not acknowledge the impact made by the Republicans who voted with Democrats. The House\u2019s near even party divide of 201 Republicans and 197 Democrats has made daily attendance and every vote all the more critical this session.\u00a0\nOsborne argued that polling has shown strong support for abortion rights in New Hampshire but also support for restrictions. \u201cOur current law satisfies and represents the majority of Granite Stater\u2019s views on abortion. Today\u2019s votes prove the Republicans are not the extremists on this issue.\u201d\nAbortion rights supporters will face a tougher fight when the bills reach the Senate, where Republicans have a 14-10 majority.\nGov. Chris Sununu\u2019s office did not immediately return a message asking if he would sign the bills if they reach his desk. While campaigning for his fourth term, Sununu said he supported repealing penalties for violating the law, which include up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.\nRepeal of penalties\nRep. Dan Wolf, a Newbury Republican who helped add a fatal fetal anomaly exception to the abortion law last session, was the prime sponsor of this year\u2019s bill to repeal the law\u2019s penalties. That effort, House Bill 224,\u00a0 passed 199-185 on Thursday, with the help of 16 Republicans.\nThe state\u2019s abortion law allows an abortion after 24 weeks in limited circumstances: when a baby has a fetal anomaly that it is unlikely to survive or when continuing the pregnancy endangers a mother\u2019s life.\u00a0\nMedical providers, including Dr. Ilana Cass, chairwoman of obstetrics and gynecology at Dartmouth Health, told lawmakers that abortions at or after 24 weeks are rare. But they are also complicated, providers say, because a fatal fetal anomaly may be discovered shortly before 24 weeks, giving a provider and family little time to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy.\nAt an hearing earlier this year, Cass told lawmakers that threats of prison time and fines in such complicated situations have dissuaded providers from choosing to practice in New Hampshire.\nSpeaking on the House floor Thursday, Wolf reminded House members of Cass\u2019 testimony, arguing that fewer providers mean fewer options for patients.\nWolf said his daughter was in the last days of her pregnancy in northern New Hampshire when she felt something was wrong. She made it to the hospital within an hour, enough time for medical staff to deliver her baby by an emergency Cesarean section.\u00a0\n\u201cThe baby was born with its umbilical cord wrapped around its neck four times,\u201d Wolf said, \u201cThe baby survived because she didn\u2019t have to drive an hour to Dartmouth or an hour and a half to Boston. We cannot allow the decline in good medical services to put our daughters at risk.\u201d\nRep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican, challenged arguments about the penalties\u2019 severity, saying providers must know their decisions violate the law.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that doctors often are required to deal with complicated cases and to make difficult decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the requirement of engaging in \u2018knowingly\u2019 unlawful conduct affords health care providers substantial protection against being prosecuted for mere errors in judgment, even in circumstances where with the benefit of hindsight they perhaps should have acted.\u201d\nNo further restrictions\nAhead of this week\u2019s session, Osborne had said leadership would not call for further abortion restrictions. Several Republicans went further Thursday, voting with Democrats to pass House Bill 88, which would leave the existing law in place but prohibited the state from setting additional restrictions on access to abortion.\nRep. Kristine Perez, a Londonderry Republican, was not among them. Perez argued the existing law poses no threat to those who have an abortion prior to 24 weeks.\n\u201cThere is no law stating I cannot hike Mount Washington,\u201d Perez said. \u201cTherefore, if a law enforcement officer arrested me for hiking Mount Washington, it would have no merit and be thrown out.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThere is no law that says you have to wear a yellow shirt on Fridays. Therefore, you cannot be arrested for wearing a blue shirt on Friday. We have a law that allows women to exercise their rights as stated in the existing (law).\u201d\nRep. Alexis Simpson, an Exeter Democrat and the bill\u2019s prime sponsor, countered that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal abortion protections makes state protections even more critical.\n\u201cThe 24-week abortion ban did not guarantee abortion protections prior to that cutoff,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026HB 88 adds critical protections prior to 24 weeks, prohibiting the state from interfering with a woman\u2019s access to abortion in the first 23 weeks of pregnancy.\u201d\nThe bill passed in a 199-185 \u201cdivision\u201d vote, a process that doesn\u2019t reveal how each member voted. But the Democrats are two members shy of 199 when all are present and voting \u2013 and not all were Thursday.\u00a0\nA constitutional right to choice\nAn effort to add constitutional protections for reproductive health choices like abortion won a narrow 193-191 majority but fell far short of the required three-fifths vote to pass. Rep. Eric Turer, a Brentwood Democrat, urged representatives to support the legislation, which would have allowed voters to decide whether to enshrine the right in the state constitution.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s do the \u2018little D\u2019 democratic thing. Let\u2019s do the \u2018little C\u2019 conservative thing. Let\u2019s do the true Live Free or Die thing,\u201d Turer said. \u201cLet\u2019s pass this elegantly crafted bill to offer the people back their right.\u201d\nThree Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the measure.\nAdditional restrictions fail\nThe House defeated House Bill 591, which would have banned abortion after six weeks. The 217-110 vote included 81 Republicans voting against the bill.\nHouse Bill 562, the so-called \u201cinformed consent\u201d bill, failed on a voice vote. It would have added a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, during which time providers would have to tell the person seeking the abortion about the health risks of abortion, the availability of government assistance for pregnancy care, and the fact that the child\u2019s father is liable for child support \u201cif his identity can be determined.\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRepublicans help deliver Democrats two abortion wins\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin March 24, 2023\nRepublicans help deliver Democrats two abortion wins\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin March 24, 2023\n This story was updated March 24, 2023 at 8:45 a.m. to correct the name of the representative who addressed a proposed constitutional amendment.\u00a0\nThe support of several Republican House lawmakers Thursday gave Democrats wins on significant abortion bills.\nBy fairly wide margins, members voted to remove criminal and civil penalties from the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban and to prohibit the state from further restricting access to an abortion.\u00a0\nLegislation repealing the 24-week ban ended in a 192-192 tie, with five Republicans supporting repeal.
