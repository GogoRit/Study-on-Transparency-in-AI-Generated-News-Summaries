    "description": "The South Carolina Senate has approved a bill that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy, sending the bill to the governor who has promised to sign it. The proposal passed on Tuesday restores the ban South Carolina had in place when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. That ban was overturned by the state\u2019s highest court because it violated the state Constitution\u2019s right to privacy. Republicans have been searching for an answer to that ruling because it left abortion legal through 22 weeks of pregnancy and sharply increased the number of abortions taking place in South Carolina as most other Southern states enacted stricter laws.",

(AP) \u2014 Abortion will soon be severely restricted in one of the last bastions for legal access in the U.S. South.The South Carolina Senate approved a bill Tuesday that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before most people know they are pregnant \u2014 and sent it to the Republican governor who has promised to sign the bill into law as soon as possible.The proposal restores a 2021 ban that took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. The ban was overturned by the state\u2019s highest court because it violated the state Constitution\u2019s right to privacy.South Carolina reported increasing numbers of abortions following that decision, which left abortion legal through 22 weeks of pregnancy, while other Southern states enacted stricter laws.Abortion is banned or severely restricted in much of the South, including bans throughout pregnancy in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Georgia, it\u2019s allowed only in the first six weeks.\n\nMost abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy will be banned in North Carolina beginning July 1 after the state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature successfully overrode the Democratic governor\u2019s veto last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA legal fight is widely expected in South Carolina. Vicki Ringer, the director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said Tuesday evening that her organization would file a request for a temporary restraining order after Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signs the measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny challenge that reaches the South Carolina Supreme Court would also face a new bench, as the lone woman who authored the leading opinion in the abortion case had reached the court\u2019s retirement age.Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey expressed confidence the law would stand.\u201cIt has been a long and bumpy road but it was an important debate to have,\u201d Massey, a Republican, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m glad we finally got a resolution on it. It\u2019s something that\u2019s going to make South Carolina not the abortion destination state of the Southeast and I think that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nThe move marks the end of a monthslong impasse between the two Republican-led chambers. The South Carolina House backed off a proposal to ban abortion almost entirely at conception and passed the new restrictions last week after nearly 24 hours of debate split across two days. Senators had tried three times to muster the votes necessary for the near-total ban over the past year.The latest attempt failed last month after the only five women in the 46-member chamber successfully filibustered the proposal. Members of the coalition known as the \u201csister senators\u201d \u2014 three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent \u2014 again fought the new bill.In blistering speeches, the three Republican women said the six-week ban did not give women enough time to make a decision. They urged other members of their party to adopt a 12-week abortion ban instead in what Sen. Katrina Shealy called a \u201creal compromise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe in the South Carolina Legislature are not God. We do not know what\u2019s going on in somebody else\u2019s life. We do not have the right to make decisions for someone else,\u201d Shealy said.Shealy and Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson had voted for an earlier version of the six-week ban but said they could not support changes inserted by the House. Shealy criticized a new requirement that biological fathers make child support payments beginning at conception as \u201cridiculousness.\u201d House Republicans also axed a provision expressly allowing minors to petition the court for an abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Republican Sen. Sandy Senn denounced new sections permitting civil lawsuits against doctors who violate the proposal and mandating that patients sign an additional form attesting that they had the chance to view the ultrasound. She called the latter requirement an intimidation tactic that is \u201cpiling up the paperwork\u201d on women.Massey insisted the differences were \u201cnot significant\u201d and largely technical changes necessary to satisfy one South Carolina Supreme Court justice who previously voted with the court\u2019s 3-2 majority to strike the last ban.\n\nThe bill includes exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies, the patient\u2019s life and health, and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. Doctors could face felony charges carrying up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.The Senate\u2019s 15 Democrats, unified against both abortion bans, have largely let the Republican majority debate the issue among themselves. As they have before, Democrats suggested Tuesday that voters should decide the matter. Opponents have also argued that South Carolina\u2019s high maternal mortality rates \u2014 with even poorer outcomes among Black patients \u2014 would grow worse under the new restrictions.\n\nThe three Republican women joined every Democrat in voting against the bill.\u201cI\u2019m conflicted because I want to reduce abortions but I don\u2019t want to eliminate women\u2019s and mother\u2019s rights,\u201d Gustafson told reporters after the vote.Just like when they first entered the state House on Tuesday, the women of the Senate were greeted with rousing applause from the dozen remaining abortion rights supporters as they exited the chamber. All five donned buttons that read \u201celect more women.\u201dIndependent Sen. Mia McLeod said she was disheartened that a male-dominated chamber voted on a bill that would have a \u201cdevastating impact on women and girls for generations.\u201d\u201cWe should be initiating the discussions because we\u2019re the only ones who have firsthand knowledge about what it takes not only to give birth but to raise a child,\u201d she told The Associated Press.While those discussions may be over this session, some of the most ardent abortion opponents in both chambers are already looking ahead to the 2024 elections.Republican Sen. Richard Cash acknowledged the Senate\u2019s current makeup lacked the votes for a stricter proposal but vowed that \u201cthe fight will continue\u201d to outlaw all abortions. If he wins reelection, he said \u201cthere\u2019s going to certainly be a renewed effort to protect life at an earlier point in time.\u201dShealy, a Republican who rejected assertions that she is a \u201cbaby killer\u201d in her floor speech, cited conversations with \u201creal people\u201d in her conservative district as the impetus for her decision.\u201cI didn\u2019t get elected to get reelected. I got elected to do the right thing,\u201d said Shealy.___This story version substitutes the 12th paragraph to correct that the Republican women senators argued against a six-week ban as not giving women enough time to make a decision, not 12 weeks.___James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
