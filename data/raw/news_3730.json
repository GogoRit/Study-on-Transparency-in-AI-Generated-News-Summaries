Northam signs Virginia Reproductive Health Protection ActCropped Photo: Wolfgang Moroder / CC BY-SA 3.0(WNDU)By WHSV newsroom ; SARAH RANKIN, Associated PressPublished: Apr. 10, 2020 at 3:00 PM EDTShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInOn Friday, April 10, a day before Governor Ralph Northam's legislative action deadline for bills passed by the General Assembly in 2020, he announced that he had signed a bill to repeal a number of abortion restrictions in Virginia.Northam signed the Reproductive Health Protection Act, which repeals what the governor says are \"medically-unnecessary restrictions on women\u2019s healthcare.\"Senate Bill 733 and House Bill 980, identical measures, repeal Virginia\u2019s mandatory ultrasound law and 24-hour waiting period prior to abortion. The bills also roll back restrictions on women's health centers, which Democrats said were designed to force centers that provide abortions to close.\u201cNo more will legislators in Richmond\u2014most of whom are men\u2014be telling women what they should and should not be doing with their bodies,\u201d said Governor Northam in a statement. \u201cThe Reproductive Health Protection Act will make women and families safer, and I\u2019m proud to sign it into law.\u201d\"This is about protecting Virginians\u2019 health, rights, and basic dignity,\u201d said Senator Jennifer McClellan, who sponsored the bill. \u201cToday, we have finally put an end to these medically unnecessary barriers to women's reproductive health care. Politicians should not interfere in women\u2019s personal medical decisions, period.\u201dThe restrictions were enacted when Republicans controlled Virginia\u2019s General Assembly.Abortion-rights advocacy groups praised the legislation's passage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia called it the first-ever \u201cproactive bill on access to safe, legal abortion\u201d in Virginia\u2019s history.\u201cWhen this legislation goes into effect, Virginians will no longer have to navigate an obstacle course of delays and barriers in order to access a safe and legal abortion,\u201d said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia.The measures passed largely along party lines, with staunch opposition from Republicans and religious advocacy groups that testified against it in committee hearings.Republican Del. Kathy Byron said in a floor speech during the General Assembly session that the changes would lead to women being less informed about \u201cmaybe one of the most important decisions that they ever make.\u201d\u201cWhat we're doing today is we're voting to deny women complete information on what an abortion means, its consequences, its implications, its alternatives,\" she said.House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, who sponsored that chamber's version of the bill, said the measure was doing away with medically unnecessary requirements. She said it was particularly important because women sometimes need an abortion to complete a miscarriage.\u201cWe're requiring an ultrasound, and a woman has miscarried,\u201d she said of one of the existing requirements.The bills are advancing at a time when abortion-rights advocates are increasingly worried the nation's highest court could overturn or chip away at the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.Abortion-rights advocates have said the changes will make Virginia a \u201csafe haven\u201d for abortion access for women in neighboring conservative states.Also signed into law by Northam on Friday were a number of gun control bills, including universal background checks.Most Read Wildfire burning near Churchville 90 percent containedTwo men facing charges after woman was shot in Augusta CountyAuthorities investigating shooting in Mount Sidney Pendleton County wildfire updateJMU President named new president of American UniversityLatest News Much cooler, windy this week Sentara Community Impact: Skyline Literacy Harrisonburg man pleads guilty to charges in 2022 Devon Lane shooting Harrisonburg man pleads guilty to charges in 2022 Devon Lane shooting Wildfire burning near Churchville 90 percent containedNewsWeatherSportsContact UsWHSV50 North Main StreetHarrisonburg, VA 22802(540) 433-9191Terms of ServicePrivacy PolicyEEO StatementFCC ApplicationsPublic Inspection Filepublicfile@whsv.com - (540) 433-0350Digital MarketingAdvertisingClosed Captioning/Audio DescriptionYOUR PRIVACY CHOICESCookie SettingsAt Gray, our journalists report, write, edit and produce the news content that informs the communities we serve.
