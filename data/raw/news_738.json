Federal courts issued split decisions last week on whether a federal emergency medicine statute preempts state abortion bans.  Phelan M. Ebenhack/The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\u00a0Stateline\u00a0coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions.\nEver since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, emergency health care providers in states that ban abortion have had to make wrenching legal and ethical judgments before treating a pregnant woman whose health or life may be in peril. \n\u201cIt\u2019s happening every single day,\u201d said Dr. Jen Villavicencio, lead for equity transformation at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing treatment for ectopic pregnancies being stalled until they rupture and become life-threatening. We\u2019re seeing people with broken water and fetal parts stuck in their vagina sent home until fetal demise occurs or the patient ends up in the ICU because of infection or bleeding.\u201d \nFederal courts in Idaho and Texas are wrestling with the thorny question of whether state abortion bans or a federal emergency medicine statute should determine whether and when doctors can perform emergency abortions. \nLast week, they came up with opposite answers. \nA Texas judge ruled that state abortion laws preempt a federal law requiring hospitals and physicians to protect the health and life of all patients who enter an emergency room or labor and delivery department.\nDays later, an Idaho judge found that the same federal law preempts state abortion bans. \nAt issue is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, known as EMTALA. Enacted in 1986, the statute was intended to ensure that all people have access to emergency medical services regardless of their ability to pay. \nTo qualify for Medicare funding, which virtually all hospitals need to stay in business, emergency and labor and delivery departments are required by law to screen and stabilize patients, and to provide whatever medical treatment is necessary to protect the health and life of anyone with an emergency medical condition, including active labor. \nOn July 14, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, sued the federal government to block enforcement of a July 11 letter to all health care providers stipulating that their legal duty to provide any available treatment necessary to stabilize patients with emergency medical conditions \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandate that might otherwise prohibit such treatment.\u201d\u00a0 \nOn Aug. 2, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Idaho seeking a judgment that federal law preempts the state\u2019s abortion ban in cases where the procedure is a necessary treatment for an emergency medical condition. \nLegal experts say the conflicting court decisions pave the way for a slew of new battles that could lob the question of federal preemption back to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nEMTALA requires emergency physicians to provide whatever treatment is necessary to protect the health and life of a patient. In most states that ban abortion, an exception is carved out for abortions performed to save the life of a patient \u2014 but not to protect the health of a patient. \nPhysicians and hospital administrators say it\u2019s difficult or impossible to know when an individual patient might be at risk of dying. More important, medical ethics require doctors to provide the best available treatment to prevent patients from reaching that point. \nThe most common pregnancy-related medical emergency is ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus and will never develop into a viable fetus. Occurring in roughly 2% of all pregnancies, the recommended treatment is to remove the embryo and end the pregnancy. If not treated, ectopic pregnancy can result in hemorrhaging, infection and sometimes death. \nPatients also go to hospital emergency rooms and labor and delivery departments when they go into early labor, their water breaks or they begin bleeding, all signs of a potential miscarriage. Since there is no chance a fetus will survive outside of the womb in the first trimester of pregnancy, when most miscarriages occur, the recommended treatment is medication or clinical abortion. \n\u201cThe Idaho decision showed some understanding of the gray area we\u2019re often in, where we know that a person needs treatment but we\u2019re not clear on when or if their condition will become life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Alison Haddock, chair of the Board of the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nNo emergency doctor wants to become a test case for how long a physician must wait before performing an abortion to save the life of a patient, she said.\n\u2018Chilling Effect\u2019\nLast week\u2019s federal district court decisions only affect physicians and patients facing health emergencies in their respective states. \nIn Texas, the judge ruled that emergency abortions to protect the health of a patient are not excluded from the state\u2019s law, which makes performing an abortion a felony unless it is needed to save the life of the patient.\nIn Idaho, the judge exempted emergency abortions to protect the health or life of a patient from the state\u2019s newly effective trigger law banning nearly all abortions. \nBoth decisions were preliminary injunctions that will remain in effect until a final decision is reached in district court. In both cases, the decisions can be appealed to a circuit court. From there, the question could land in the U.S. Supreme Court. \nIn the meantime, legal experts say lawsuits addressing the same issue could crop up in the 24 other states that have statutes prohibiting abortion prior to viability, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. \nIn six of the states with abortion bans \u2014 Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee \u2014 the bans authorize prosecutors to criminally prosecute health care professionals for performing abortions. Providers there are allowed to offer evidence that the procedure was necessary to save the patient\u2019s life only after they\u2019re charged. \nIn other states, abortion bans include an exception for emergency abortions needed to protect the patient\u2019s life, meaning health care providers will not be prosecuted unless evidence indicates the patient\u2019s condition was not life-threatening. \u00a0\nBut medical professionals say it\u2019s impossible to know how close a patient must be to dying before a needed abortion is exempt from a state ban. Even if a clear line existed, they say, medical ethics require doctors to treat patients as early as possible to avoid any negative outcomes. \n\u201cThe overall impact of these laws is a chilling effect on the practice of medicine,\u201d said Villavicencio of the obstetricians\u2019 organization. \u201cRegardless of the specific language, abortion bans scare health care providers into thinking that their profession is at risk, their freedom to provide the best possible care for their patients. \n\u201cFor some,\u201d she said, \u201cthe only choice is to not provide care at all.\u201d \nLegal Mayhem\nLegal experts on all sides of the issue predict a morass of lawsuits over federal preemption of state abortion bans under EMTALA before the issue is resolved.\nSteven Aden, general counsel of Americans United for Life, which opposes abortion, called the Idaho case brought by the Biden administration a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d He agreed with the judge\u2019s finding in the Texas case, arguing that the federal government is not authorized to sue a state under its EMTALA statute but only to withhold Medicare funding.\nAden argued that criminal law provides several layers of protection for doctors who perform emergency abortions to save the life of a patient and that state lawmakers never intended their bans to allow prosecutors to go after health care providers unless they show a pattern of behavior and intent to violate the law.\nBut doctors should not have to be experts on state abortion bans and criminal law to practice medicine, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. \n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable to require doctors to face an agonizing choice of whether to follow state law, federal law or medical ethics. When it comes to the emergency department, doctors shouldn\u2019t have to hesitate to provide the care that\u2019s needed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor now, President Biden is focusing his strategy on existing federal law since he can\u2019t get Congress to take any action and the future for the Supreme Court is bleak,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cThe only federal options available for preserving abortion rights are EMTALA primacy and FDA preemption over medication abortion. We\u2019ve already seen split rulings from Idaho and Texas, and we\u2019re likely to see more of that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdahoTexasUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXSome Abortion Bans Put Patients, Doctors at Risk in Emergencies\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline September 1, 2022\nSome Abortion Bans Put Patients, Doctors at Risk in Emergencies\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline September 1, 2022\n Read more\u00a0Stateline\u00a0coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions.\nEver since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
