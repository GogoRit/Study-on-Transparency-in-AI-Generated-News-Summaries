And yet, I have never been as concerned about the future of abortion access, which is being hollowed out by a game of constitutional whack-a-mole. It\u2019s past time for Congress to step in and end it.Determining whether or when to have a child has a profound impact on a person\u2019s health and life. For this reason, the Constitution protects our personal liberty and dignity to make such decisions for ourselves. But today that right is in peril.Although we just won the case before the Supreme Court, June Medical Services v. Russo, this is a fight we shouldn\u2019t have needed to wage at all. The Louisiana law at issue in the decision was identical to a Texas law we challenged, and which the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. Because states such as Louisiana continue to defy the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion rulings, we have to go to court again and again and again, with no end in sight.AdvertisementRelentless state-by-state attacks on abortion are only ratcheting up. Politicians have passed more than 450 state laws restricting abortion access over the past decade. Those laws are pushing abortion access out of reach. Nearly 90 percent of U.S. counties are without a single abortion provider. Six states \u2014 Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia \u2014 are down to their last clinic. In 2019, nine states passed brazenly unconstitutional bans on abortion starting at six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before many people know they\u2019re pregnant. And at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, governors and officials of more than 10 states shamelessly took advantage of the crisis and tried to restrict abortion care.This insidious campaign against abortion access hurts communities of color, young people, rural communities and people living in poverty the most. These restrictions mean that because there are fewer clinics and patients may have to travel considerable distances to reach them, a person\u2019s ability to access abortion care often depends on where they happen to live, how much money they have and whether they can take time off work. This is just wrong. A right is not a right if you can\u2019t exercise it.It\u2019s time to end this grinding, wasteful state of uncertainty. The Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (WHPA) is the answer.AdvertisementWHPA takes the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents and solidifies them into a clear federal standard for preserving the constitutional right to abortion and treating abortion for what it is: health care.Share this articleShareThe bill creates a federal statutory right for health-care providers to deliver, and for their patients to receive, abortion care free from medically unnecessary limitations and bans. It applies only to those restrictions that single out abortion care and no other comparable medical procedure. If states wouldn\u2019t impose waiting periods or unnecessary protocols on patients seeking colonoscopies; if they wouldn\u2019t limit early, less invasive medical treatment to help patients get care more quickly; and if they wouldn\u2019t require doctors to provide medically dubious counseling for patients seeking those procedures, then they won\u2019t be able to restrict abortion care in these ways under the WHPA.Congress has taken this kind of corrective action before when abortion rights were under threat: Thirty years ago, during a particularly heightened period of terror, when doctors and clinic workers were murdered, and clinics were being bombed, vandalized, torched and blockaded. Federal action was needed, and in 1994, Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.AdvertisementToday, access to abortion services is being blocked through an avalanche of pretextual laws designed to accomplish by the pen what could not be accomplished through brute force: the closure of facilities providing essential reproductive health care to patients in large swaths of the country.Though the bill would face likely insurmountable hurdles in the current Senate, if the House passes the first proactive federal abortion rights legislation in decades, it would give Americans an opportunity to consider an alternate reality to continue fighting for \u2014 one in which basic health care is not constantly under attack.For nearly half a century, the Supreme Court has continuously affirmed that a woman has the right to make personal decisions about her body, her family and her life. Now Congress must act and pass WHPA to stop these whack-a-mole state attacks, and ensure that the right to abortion first recognized in Roe v. Wade is a reality for people all across the country.AdvertisementRead more:Ava Skolnik: The coronavirus threat to public health is no time to restrict abortion accessPaul Waldman: Public opinion on abortion is turning away from RepublicansNancy Northup: Roe isn\u2019t just about women\u2019s rights.
