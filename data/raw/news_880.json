The school enrolls teens who are pregnant or parenting and offers a host of resources, including child care.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nLike a lot of teenagers, Iryanna Rodriguez\u2019s day starts early and ends late, and she\u2019s often running behind from the moment she wakes up. The 18-year-old juggles all the normal high school experiences \u2014 classes, a boyfriend, a search for a part-time job \u2014 along with some additional hurdles.\n\u201cI\u2019m always in a rush in the morning, getting my son ready and out for school,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then the baby, I have to get her changed. It doesn\u2019t get more real than that, first thing in the morning.\u201d\nRodriguez got pregnant for the first time when she was just 13 years old. Her son is now 4, and last year, she had a daughter as well. She says her children are her greatest blessing and have taught her that she\u2019s capable of so much more than she realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut, yes, two children is a lot harder than one,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nRodriguez lives with her boyfriend, but has a lot of family support in raising her children. Her mother had her first child when she was around 15, she said, and her grandmother was a young mother, too.\nWhile teenage birth rates have declined significantly across the country in recent decades, Texas remains above the national average, consistently ranking in the top 10 states. Out of all births in Texas, around 6% were teen births in 2019 and 2020.\nAnd a startling proportion of teenagers who gave birth in Texas in 2020 \u2014 more than 1 in 6 \u2014 already had at least one other child. Analysis by The Texas Tribune using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Texas had the highest rate of these so-called \u201crepeat teen births\u201d in the country, along with Alabama. In the last decade, the state has been in the top five states for repeat teen birth rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodriguez lives in Brownsville, a city in the poor, predominantly Hispanic Rio Grande Valley on the U.S.-Mexico border. While Texas has seen an overall decline in the repeat teen birth rate, the counties that make up this region have not, with more than one in five teens that give birth already having at least one child almost every year since 2005. This is according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services.\nCynthia Cardenas sees the impact of this every day. She\u2019s the principal at Brownsville\u2019s Lincoln Park High School, where all the students, including Rodriguez, are pregnant or parenting. Cardenas said the school currently has five students with three children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Principal Cynthia Cardenas, center, jokes with students about consuming hot sauce as they cover their faces in laughter during lunch at Lincoln Park High School.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nOther schools in the Brownsville Independent School District have softball teams or drama productions. Lincoln Park has a day care and flexible scheduling. Her students are smart and ambitious, Cardenas said, and they want to be in school \u2014 but they\u2019re juggling demands most other high school students couldn\u2019t imagine.\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at what they need to do to raise their child right now,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cThey tell me, \u2018I can\u2019t make it to school tomorrow because I have to work.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait a minute. You have to prioritize your education.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardenas said Lincoln Park is doing all it can to make sure these students stay on track to graduate. But she wishes there was more attention paid to what happens before the students need to enroll there at all.\n\u201cWe need to be proactive instead of reactive,\u201d she said. \u201cThe parents will not talk to their students about safe sex. \u2026 It\u2019s just not an open conversation here. These girls need to be educated.\u201d\nTexas does not require high schools to teach sex education, and the vast majority that do focus on sexual abstinence. The state has a complicated maze of requirements for teenagers seeking birth control and is currently operating under the strictest abortion laws in the country.\nAll of this leaves teenagers with insufficient tools to proactively manage their own reproductive health, advocates and teenagers say, with long-lasting consequences for themselves, their children and their communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodriguez is on track to graduate and wants to become a nurse. She and her boyfriend are planning to have a big family. She said she plans to talk to her children early and often about topics like safe sex, healthy relationships and birth control.\n\u201cI want them to have more education on that than I did,\u201d she said.\nSex education\nA lot of what 18-year-old Jannely Villegas learned about sex came from the TV show \u201c16 and Pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cI would always watch those and be like, \u2018How do they do it? They\u2019re so young and to be juggling school and having a baby, it must be stressful,\u2019\u201d she said.\nNo one taught her about birth control before she started having sex with her boyfriend. And even when she started suspecting that she might be pregnant, she dismissed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Jannely Villegas, 18, is a student at Lincoln Park High School in Brownsville.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wish someone taught me about any of that stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not born with the knowledge of, hey, if you\u2019re pregnant, this is what it\u2019s going to feel like, or this is what it means to miss your period.\u201d\nShe ignored her fluctuating weight and swollen ankles until, one day, she couldn\u2019t anymore. In the middle of the night, she went into the bathroom in her mother\u2019s house, hunched over in pain.\nTwo pushes, and she gave birth to her son, all alone, on the floor of the bathroom.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel the pain until after because I guess I was so traumatized,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I called my mom in, she almost passed out.\u201d\nVillegas and her now 3-month-old son are both healthy and thriving. But that\u2019s an experience she wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone else.\n\u201cI really do wish I had the knowledge in the beginning so I could have done all the things, like the sonogram, the ultrasound, taking care of myself better,\u201d she said.\nVillegas grew up in La Feria, a small town west of Harlingen, where she said sex education was limited to one sit-down with sports coaches to go over the basics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty common in Texas, which does not require schools to teach sex education. According to the left-leaning Texas Freedom Network, in the 2015-2016 school year, 25% of school districts offered no sex education and an additional 58% taught abstinence-only sex ed.\nIn 2020, the Texas State Board of Education overhauled its sex education standards for the first time in two decades. While schools still must stress abstinence, starting this year, seventh and eighth graders will also have to learn about other birth control methods.\nThe board declined to require districts to teach about sexual orientation, gender identity and consent. And after a change by the Legislature, all sex education in Texas is now \u201copt-in,\u201d meaning parents must proactively enroll their students in these classes.\nTexas Values, a right-leaning group that advocates for abstinence-only education, said they heard from more than 22,000 parents concerned that teaching comprehensive sex education would end up encouraging more teens to have sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pregnancy rates among teens are not ideal right now, but we are seeing that decline,\u201d said senior policy adviser Mary Elizabeth Castle. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019re going to continue to see this decrease as more schools are adopting the sexual risk avoidance model.\u201d\nTexas Freedom Network political director Carisa Lopez said the recent changes, while progress, are insufficient to meet the needs of teenage Texans.\n\u201cYoung people spend all of their early life in school. \u2026 We teach them history, we teach them math, but what is more important than teaching them about health and sex ed and their bodies?\u201d she said. \u201cThey deserve to be armed with this information to guide them through the rest of their lives.\u201d\nAccess to contraception\nTeenage birth rates have declined precipitously in the United States in recent decades to an all-time low in 2019 of 16.7 births per 1,000 girls ages 15-19. But in Texas, there were 24 births per 1,000 girls in the same cohort, according to the CDC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite all of this tremendous progress, the pace of the decline has been inconsistent,\u201d said Jennifer Biundo, director of policy and data at the Texas Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. \u201cWhat\u2019s really coming to light is increasing disparities and the young women who are left behind.\u201d\nIn Texas, Biundo said, it\u2019s Hispanic and Black teenagers who continue to have high rates of teenage pregnancy, as well as teenagers in the foster care system, teens in rural areas and teens with a history of trauma.\nBiundo and other advocates say that decades of declining teen pregnancy rates have shown what works, specifically a system that has \u201cno wrong doors\u201d for teens who are looking to access contraception, education and other tools to manage their own reproductive decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Students at Lincoln Park High School take a test in class. The school for pregnant and parenting teens has 69 students enrolled.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nBut in Texas, teens have to navigate an unstable maze of federal and state programs with varying confidentiality and parental consent requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTexas has some of the most complex laws in the nation just around teens\u2019 access to health care in general,\u201d said Biundo. \u201cWe want parents to be very involved in their child\u2019s health \u2026 but we want to make sure that teens aren\u2019t being left behind.\u201d\nGenerally, parents have to consent to medical care for their minor children. But many states make an exception for reproductive health care: 23 states allow minors to consent to start birth control in all situations, and another 10 states have broad exceptions for minors who are of a certain age, pregnant or parenting.\nTexas is in the remaining minority of states that does not allow minors to consent to birth control, except in extremely rare cases, like if the teenager is legally emancipated from their parents.\nTexas minors who have already given birth and are actively parenting their children still need their parents\u2019 permission to get on birth control. Rodriguez was surprised to learn this after she had her first child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to get on birth control and they required my mom\u2019s signature to put it in my arm,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, my mom was like, you need to get on it.\u201d\nCastle, with Texas Values, said having conversations about birth control can be an opportunity for that teenage parent to develop a closer relationship with their own parents. She acknowledges that some minors may be in situations where their parents aren\u2019t involved or it\u2019s otherwise difficult to get their consent, but she said that\u2019s not justification to loosen the requirements.\nMinors who get their health insurance through Medicaid can access birth control without parental consent. But Texas is one of 12 states that chose not to expand Medicaid, leaving many teenagers on the state-run Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas and North Dakota are the only states that do not cover birth control on CHIP. With or without parental consent, a teenager on CHIP cannot get birth control through their insurance program unless they can prove that it\u2019s for a medical need other than pregnancy prevention.\n\u201cCHIP covers [teens] up through the month of their 19th birthday,\u201d said Biundo. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about legal adults whose birth control isn\u2019t covered by their insurance program. There are very, very few insurance programs in the country that don\u2019t cover birth control.\u201d\nThere is a workaround: The state\u2019s Family Planning Program provides birth control, with parental consent, at one of roughly 200 clinics funded. But if teens on CHIP get birth control through this program, it comes with a much higher price tag for the state, which covers 100% of the Family Planning Program. The state covers less than 25% of the cost of CHIP claims, with the federal government providing the rest.\n\u201cInstead of adding this as a benefit and taking the federal funds for it and allowing these teens to have easy access to contraception, we\u2019re going to send them through this convoluted maze of programs, and the state\u2019s going to pay for the whole thing,\u201d said Biundo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, has repeatedly introduced a bill that would have added coverage for contraception for pregnancy prevention on CHIP. After passing the House and stalling in the Senate in 2019, the bill did not even get a hearing in 2021.\n\u201cWe have huge challenges with making sure that we are providing the youth in this state with the tools that they need,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe know that contraceptives are an important part of that toolbox and to not make it available to some of our youth who are in some of these programs is just irresponsible.\u201d\nHer bill would still require parental consent to obtain birth control on CHIP, which she says is just a matter of being realistic about what would be seen as acceptable in Texas.\nCastle said her group, Texas Values, advocated against adding birth control to CHIP.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t encourage sexual activity among teens or kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it would motivate them to not be sexually active if they know that they don\u2019t have an alternative that would help them avoid risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Students can buy clothing and baby supplies at a school store with the points they get from attending class and completing assignments.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nResearch indicates that providing adolescents with low- or no-cost contraception does not increase their number of sexual partners, and in fact leads to a significant decrease in teenage pregnancy rates.\nWhen Myrna Alvarado was growing up in the Dallas area, she said talking about birth control with her parents would have been taboo. By the time she graduated high school, she had received, by her estimation, about 90 minutes of sex education in seventh grade.\n\u201cA lot of the information teens have is from Google or rumors that pass round their friends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting information from a reliable source.\u201d\nShe knows how difficult it can be for teens to talk to their parents about birth control \u2014 and how that may not be enough to deter them from having sex. She now helps teens in the Dallas area access information and contraception through the North Texas Alliance to Reduce Unintended Pregnancy in Teens.\n\u201cWe can show them what clinics are near them and which clinics are teen-friendly, where they won\u2019t need parental consent to go and their privacy will be respected, and usually low- to no-cost,\u201d she said.\nTeens in the Dallas area can seek confidential contraception at clinics funded by the federal Title X program.\nBut the 175 Title X clinics in Texas are distributed unevenly across the state, leaving whole swaths of Texas underserved. And some of the clinics that receive this funding have struggled with inconsistent funding and political pressures in recent years that leave teenagers in limbo.\nFamily planning clinic closures\nBy the time teenagers find their way to one of Access Esperanza\u2019s clinics in the Rio Grande Valley, they\u2019re often already pregnant or parenting. CEO Patricio Gonzales said one of their most important programs is helping teenagers access confidential reproductive health care.\n\u201cThe criticism we always get is, \u2018Your contraceptives promote promiscuity,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy response is, you\u2019ve got the wrong P. It\u2019s not promiscuity, it\u2019s prevention. Preventing unwanted diseases as well as unwanted pregnancies, especially at a young age.\u201d\nA decade ago, Access Esperanza operated eight clinics, providing sexual and reproductive health care to 23,000 people across the Rio Grande Valley. Back then, the group went by a different, more recognizable name: Planned Parenthood of Hidalgo County.\nThen, in 2011, Texas passed legislation that blocked public funds from going to Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics. Almost immediately, Planned Parenthood of Hidalgo County lost millions of dollars in state funding, Gonzales said. They had to close five clinics and lost two-thirds of their patients.\nAll that for a clinic that never provided abortions, which was the target of the cuts.\n\u201cWe were doing prevention work,\u201d said Gonzales. \u201cWe\u2019re preventing abortions by putting women on contraceptives.\u201d\nAfter three years of scaled-back services, the board voted to disaffiliate from Planned Parenthood and changed its name to Access Esperanza. Six months later, Gonzales said, the money started flowing again from the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Students walk toward the cafeteria for lunch at Lincoln Park High School.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nNearly a decade after the initial cuts, they are finally getting close to serving the same number of clients as before. Gonzales worries most of all about the teenagers the clinics couldn\u2019t serve during those years.\n\u201cA lot of the young people were blaming us, saying \u2018What did y\u2019all do wrong?\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u201cThey were not realizing the politics behind it with us just being a Planned Parenthood.\u201d\nA quarter of family planning clinics statewide closed as a result of these funding cuts, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. The fallout continues to this day, said Rosann Mariappuram, executive director of Jane\u2019s Due Process, a group that helps teenagers access contraception and abortion care.\n\u201cA lot of clients will call us and say, \u2018I went to my local Planned Parenthood, but they said, there\u2019s this law and they can\u2019t actually help me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey just end up confused about where they can go and maybe just stop looking.\u201d\nAbortion access\u00a0\nMariappuram said this is a common occurrence in Texas, where teens often end up caught in the crossfire of political decisions they have no say in. The best example, she said, is Texas\u2019 latest effort to restrict access to abortion.\nThe controversial law, known as Senate Bill 8, bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\nMany women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant yet at that point, and that\u2019s particularly true for teenagers, who may not yet have a regular period or a full understanding of their reproductive system.\nIf a minor did detect a pregnancy before that point, Texas requires parental consent to get an abortion. If their parents won\u2019t consent, the minor can seek a judicial bypass in which a judge agrees the minor is mature enough to make that decision on their own.\n\u201cWe always encourage youth to involve their parents if it\u2019s safe for them to do so,\u201d Mariappuram said. \u201cOur clients tend to be in a more severe or dangerous situation where, especially if they\u2019re pregnant, talking to their parents can lead to them getting kicked out of the house or being forced to continue a pregnancy against their will.\u201d\nCastle, with Texas Values, emphasized the importance of parents being involved in this decision \u2014 hopefully, she said, with the goal of encouraging the child to keep the pregnancy.\n\u201cI believe there is adequate support for teens to carry those babies to term,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are over 200 pregnancy care centers in the state that can help these teen moms with whatever they need \u2026 to take care of that child in the future.\u201d\nTexas has invested more than $100 million in its \u201cAlternatives to Abortion\u201d program, which funds these pregnancy centers, although there\u2019s little data available about how the money is spent.\nSince Senate Bill 8 went into effect on Sept. 1, Mariappuram said calls to her organization\u2019s hotline have dropped by more than half \u2014 and less than a third of the teens who did call were still in the window of time in which they could access an abortion.\nThe judicial bypass process can take days or weeks, pushing some teens over the time frame during which they could legally have the procedure. And teenagers are less likely to be able to travel out of state to have an abortion as some adults have been able to do, Mariappuram said.\nIn the face of all these barriers, a lot more teens are carrying pregnancies to term. In September 2021, the month the law went into effect, only 29 women under the age of 18 had an abortion, according to data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.\nThat\u2019s a nearly 75% decline from the year prior and a 70% decrease from 2019. The number of abortions in 2021 are still subject to change as the state finalizes numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of emotional support around thinking through how to handle being forced to stay pregnant against their will,\u201d said Mariappuram.\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood, Texas Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and Texas Freedom Network have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
