Wade was overturned. \n\nWritten by Grace Deng \n\n\n | Published on August 9, 2022 \n\n\n Tweet\n\n\n Share\n\n\n\n\n \n\nVirginia's \"Trust Women. Respect Choice.\" license plate. Photograph by Eli Christman / Creative Commons 2.0. \n\n\nPro-life and pro-choice license plates aren\u2019t new to Virginia: The commonwealth has issued \u201cChoose Life\u201d plates\u00a0since 2009 and \u201cTrust Women. Respect Choice.\u201d since 2010. As of the end of July, there were 3,221 pro-choice plates and 5,210 pro-life plates on the road, according to figures from the Virginia DMV.\nSince the US Supreme Court overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade in June, though, more people are buying pro-choice plates. That follows a trend at the DMV: Since July 2020, the number of pro-choice plates has gone up from 2,646, while the\u00a0number of pro-life plates has decreased from 5,363.\u00a0From June 22 to July 31 of this year, 135 people got new pro-choice license plates on their cars. That may not seem like many, but consider that the\u00a0number of pro-choice license plates on the road increased by 178 from July 2020 to June 2021.\n\nVirginia is one of the rare states that offers both pro-choice and pro-life license plates. In fact, only Virginia and Pennsylvania offer pro-choice license plates, while 34 states offer \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plates, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health policy. DC and Maryland both offer pro-life plates.\n\u201cTrust Women. Respect Choice.\u201d plates cost $25, and $15 of the $25 fee goes directly to the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood. The money is not allowed to go to abortion care.\nA Virginia \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plate. Photograph by Eli Christman / Creative Commons 2.0.\n\u201cChoose Life\u201d plates were the brainchild of \u201cChoose Life, Inc,\u201d an anti-abortion advocacy group in Florida. In some states, the \u201cChoose Life\u201d plates help fund crisis pregnancy centers, which dissuade women from getting abortions. In Virginia, $15 of the $25 fee is donated to Heartbeat International, Inc. to distribute to these centers. Choose Life, Inc claims the plates have raised $29 million nationally.\n\u201cTrust Women, Respect Choice\u201d plates are available for purchase at Virginia\u2019s DMV here and \u201cChoose Life\u201d plates are available here. \nMore: AbortionLicense PlatesVirginia\n\n\nJoin the conversation!\n\n\n Share\n\n\n Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace Deng\n\nEditorial Fellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular in News & Politics\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat It Felt Like for a Virginia Marching Band to Win Metallica\u2019s Contest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMeet the 2023 Washingtonians of the Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat\u2019s IN and OUT in DC Restaurant Trends for 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIntroducing 8 of DC\u2019s Most Stylish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWashingtonian Magazine\n\n\n \n\nMarch 2024: Cool Jobs\nView Issue\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Social\nWe'll help you live your best #DCLIFE every day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Social\nWe'll help you live your best #DCLIFE every day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n \n\n\n \nMary Timony on Her Emotional New Album, \u201cUntame the Tiger\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Beatles in DC: A New Exhibit in Maryland Looks Back on Early Beatlemania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNorthern Virginia High School Wins Metallica\u2019s Marching Band Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow Noochie\u2019s Porch Became One of DC\u2019s Hottest Venues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nMore from News & Politics\n \n\n\n\n\nMegan Thee Stallion and Gunna Will Perform at Broccoli City Festival\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Toured Metro\u2019s \u201cNewly Renovated\u201d Bathrooms.
