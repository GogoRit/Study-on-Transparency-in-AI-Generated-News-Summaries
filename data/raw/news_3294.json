Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision recognizes that an unborn child has a right to life,\u201d\u00a0said Dr. Cassidy. \u201cBeing pro-life means being pro-mothers, pro-babies, and pro-healthy futures\u2014a philosophy I carry with me in the Senate. This is a deeply emotional issue for many Americans, no matter which side one stands, but it is now up to individual states to enact their own policies.\u201d\nThis week, Cassidy introduced the Stop Supreme Court Leakers Act, legislation that criminalizes individuals who leak confidential information from the Supreme Court of the United States. The Stop Supreme Court Leakers Act requires a $10,000 fine and imposes up to a 10-year prison sentence on those who leak confidential information from the Supreme Court. Additionally, Cassidy\u2019s legislation goes one step further by enforcing a seizure of profits derived from the leak which could include book deals or cable television contributor contracts.\nFacts about today\u2019s decision:\n\nOverturning\u00a0Roe\u00a0allows each state, not the courts, to decide how and when to protect life in the womb.\nLegislatures determined when to protect life for 200 years prior to the Roe decision in 1973.\nTreatment of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages is not abortion and is not affected by this decision.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, at week seven, a baby\u2019s nostrils will become visible. At week nine, a baby\u2019s toes are visible. At week 10, a baby can bend his or her elbows. At week 12, a baby\u2019s heart beats. At week 14, you may know if your baby is a male or female. At week 17, your baby\u2019s heart is pumping roughly 100 pints of blood every day. At week 18, a baby begins to hear and his or her digestive system works. At week 20, a mother can feel her baby\u2019s movement and the baby is sleeping and waking up. At week 21, a baby can suck his or her thumb.\u00a0\n\n###\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Print\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPrevPrevious Article \n\nNext ArticleNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAbout\nNews\nServices\nContact\nFunding LA\n \n\nAbout\nNews\nServices\nContact\nFunding LA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
