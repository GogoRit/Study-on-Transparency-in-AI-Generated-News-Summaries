Eric Holcomb on Friday signed a bill that would ban most abortions in Indiana \u2013 making it the first state to pass a restrictive law against the procedure since Roe v. Wade was overturned this summer. \n    \n\n            The Indiana House and Senate passed the GOP-sponsored bill earlier Friday. \n    \n\n            The new law provides exceptions for when the life of the mother is at risk and for fatal fetal anomalies, up to 20 weeks post-fertilization. It also allows exceptions for some abortions if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. It will go into effect on September 15.\n    \n\n            Current Indiana law allows abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization (or 22 weeks after the mother\u2019s last menstrual period). \n    \n\n            The US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to eliminate a federal right to abortion sent the issue back to the states, and several Republican leaders have pledged to curtail access. West Virginia also has reconvened a special session, though its near-total abortion ban remains in limbo after the Republican-led legislature could not come to a consensus and adjourned, leaving abortion legal until 20 weeks post-fertilization. And in Kansas, voters this week handily defeated an effort to amend the state\u2019s constitution to remove the right to abortion.\n    \n\n            On Thursday, the Indiana House rejected Republican-sponsored amendments that would have removed the exceptions for rape, incest and fatal fetal anomalies from the bill. Members of House Republican leadership were divided as Speaker Todd Huston and Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Karickhoff voted against the amendments, while Majority Leader Matt Lehman backed the amendments.  \n    \n\n            A House amendment also failed Thursday that would have placed a non-binding question on the 2022 general election ballot as to whether abortion should remain legal in Indiana. \n    \n\n            White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre slammed the new law in a statement Saturday, calling the bill\u2019s passage \u201canother radical step by Republican legislators to take away women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.\u201d\n    \n\n    Emotional debate\n\n\n            Friday\u2019s vote in the state House followed an emotional and sometimes contentious debate during which protesters\u2019 cheers and jeers could be heard amid lawmakers\u2019 speeches.  \n    \n\n            GOP House Rep. John Jacob of Indianapolis, who supports a total ban on abortion, said on the House floor Friday said he would not support the bill because it \u201cregulates abortion, which is baby murder,\u201d while calling on his colleagues to repent before God. \n    \n\n            Democratic Rep. Renee Pack of Indianapolis later fired back at Jacob and spoke of her own abortion in 1990 when she served in the US military.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt took me getting to this statehouse for my colleagues to call me a murderer. I had to get that kind of abuse in this room, in this chamber. Sir, I am not a murderer, and my sisters are not murderers either,\u201d Pack said on Friday. \u201cWe are pro-choice. That is what we are. We believe that we have command over our own bodies.\u201d \n    \n\n            During Friday\u2019s debate, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle lamented the time crunch they were under to consider such a difficult topic. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe are all trying, we are all discerning, none of us are sleeping, none of us are doing well. We\u2019re walking around with \u2026 knots in our stomachs,\u201d state Rep. Ann Vermilion, a Republican from Marion, said on the floor Friday ahead of the vote. \n    \n\n            \u201cEveryone of us, 150, have cried this week and we are all trying to do the will of the people while equally being true to our faith and our core beliefs,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            Particular attention has been placed on Indiana after a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio crossed state lines to get an abortion in June, after Roe was overturned. \n    \n\n            The Indiana doctor who provided abortion services for the 10-year-old girl said the Indiana abortion bill \u201cis going to hurt Hoosier women.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cMedicine is not about exceptions,\u201d Dr. Caitlin Bernard told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on \u201cNew Day\u201d earlier Friday. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how many patients I see in very unique situations that can\u2019t fit in to those exceptions, that can\u2019t have a list of what I can and can\u2019t do. They can\u2019t wait to check with their lawyer, I can\u2019t wait to check with my lawyer, I need to be able to take care of patients when and where they need that care.\u201d \n    \n\nThis story
