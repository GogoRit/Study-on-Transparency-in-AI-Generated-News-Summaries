I. McBurney struck down Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is legal again in Georgia \u2013 for now \u2013 after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually after about six weeks and before many women know they are pregnant.\nThe six-week ban had been in effect since July but was thrown out Tuesday along with a requirement that physicians report to the state Department of Public Health when an abortion qualified under the state\u2019s narrow exceptions, such as in the case of rape if a police report has been filed.\nIn his ruling, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert C. I. McBurney called the provisions \u201cplainly unconstitutional\u201d because they passed in 2019 and before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ended the federal protection to abortion access.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cUnder Dobbs, it may someday become the law of Georgia, but only after our Legislature determines in the sharp glare of public attention that will undoubtedly and properly attend such an important and consequential debate whether the rights of unborn children justify such a restriction on women\u2019s right to bodily autonomy and privacy,\u201d McBurney wrote in his ruling.\nAs is, the restrictions passed three years ago \u201cexist on paper only,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThey were and are void and must be re-enacted in our post-Roe world if they are to become the law of Georgia,\u201d McBurney wrote.\nAttorney General Chris Carr quickly filed a notice to appeal with the Georgia Supreme Court Tuesday.\n\u201cWe have filed a notice of appeal and will continue to fulfill our duty to defend the laws of our state in court,\u201d Kara Richardson, Carr\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.\nReaction to the ruling\nCritics of the state\u2019s new anti-abortion restrictions celebrated the ruling. Monica Simpson, who is the executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, which is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit, called the decision \u201ca win for reproductive justice.\u201d\n  Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, speaks to reporters in October. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder\n\u201cPeople were so disheartened by the Dobbs decision,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWhen we do get these wins, it\u2019s so important for our communities, it means so much to so many.\n\u201cWe know that our fight for reproductive justice in this state is going to have to continue, but we are taking the time to really sit in this victory,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are seeing reproductive justice show up in a way that is really, really powerful.\u201d\nSupporters of the law criticized the judge, who was appointed to the Fulton County bench by Republican Gov. Nathan Deal in 2012.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling places the personal beliefs of a judge over the will of the legislature and people of Georgia. The state has already filed a notice of appeal, and we will continue to fight for the lives of Georgia\u2019s unborn children,\u201d Andrew Isenhour, a spokesperson for Gov. Brian Kemp, said in a statement.\nState Rep. Ed Setzler, an Acworth Republican who sponsored the bill in 2019, says he is hoping for a different result with the state Supreme Court.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that a liberal Fulton County judge has attempted to throw another roadblock to prevent the implementation of the LIFE Act,\u201d Setzler said Tuesday. \u201cAfter a campaign season of the most craven, reckless lies told about this very reasonable bill, I have no doubt common sense and the protection of helpless unborn children will win very soon in the Georgia Supreme Court.\u201d\nState lawmakers are due to return to Atlanta for the new session in January but are unlikely to pursue any potential attempt to reenact the law as outlined by McBurney while the lawsuit finishes winding its way through the courts.\nThe restrictions narrowly passed in 2019 after a bitter and emotionally charged debate, and they have not been well received by most Georgians, if polling is a guide. A poll released last month found that nearly 62% of respondents in Georgia were opposed to the law, with about 54% saying they strongly objected to it.\nThe polarizing debate over abortion access was a dominant issue in the midterm election, which is dragging into overtime here in Georgia. Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker hold vastly different views. Warnock says he believes the issue should stay inside an exam room while Walker has said he would support a national abortion ban.\n\u201cI believe that we ought not replace the wisdom of women and their doctors with that of politicians,\u201d Warnock said at an event Tuesday after the ruling was released. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing right now the chaos that ensues when that happens.\u201d\n\u2018There\u2019s a political accountability element to this as well\u2019\nHealth care providers and abortion rights advocates, who are represented by the ACLU, filed a new legal challenge shortly after Georgia\u2019s law took effect in July.\nTheir legal challenge argued the law violates Georgia\u2019s state constitutional right to privacy and contended that the state Legislature should be required to pass a new law since Kemp signed HB 481 into law when Roe v. Wade was still federal precedent. The lawsuit did not challenge the law\u2019s so-called personhood provisions.\u00a0\nMcBurney, who held a two-day trial last month, agreed that lawmakers would need to start over, but he did not weigh in on whether a six-week abortion ban violates a woman\u2019s right to privacy under the state constitution.\n\u201cWhether Georgia\u2019s Constitution countenances a post-heartbeat ban (with certain exceptions for medical emergencies, rape, etc.) is not being decided here because that is not (yet) the law in Georgia,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0\u201cOur state legislators are now, under Dobbs, free to move away from a post-viability ban in an effort to strike a different balance between the interests of fetal life and women\u2019s bodily autonomy, should they conclude that that is what is best for Georgians.\u201d\nAnthony Michael Kreis, a Georgia State University law professor, said Georgia is an outlier from other states that passed similar laws in anticipation of a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\nThe Georgia Constitution has a provision barring its lawmakers from passing laws that are unconstitutional at the time they are passed \u2013 and that provision is not in most state constitutions, Kreis said.\n\u201cPart of the reason for this is one, people are owed and entitled to due process, and they should know exactly what the laws are and what the law requires of them,\u201d Kreis said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also a principle here about legislative responsibility. Legislators should be adopting public policy which they in good faith think can be enforced right away, and so there\u2019s a political accountability element to this as well.\u201d\u00a0\nMcBurney said he would rule later on whether a provision that allows local district attorneys to obtain a patient\u2019s health records violates the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy.\nGeorgia Recorder Senior Reporter Stanley Dunlap contributed to this story.\u00a0\n2022CV367796 - ORDER\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXUpdated: Fulton judge overturns Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban as unconstitutional\nby Jill Nolin, Georgia Recorder November 15, 2022\nUpdated: Fulton judge overturns Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban as unconstitutional\nby Jill Nolin, Georgia Recorder November 15, 2022\n Abortion is legal again in Georgia \u2013 for now \u2013 after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually after about six weeks and before many women know they are pregnant.\nThe six-week ban had been in effect since July but was thrown out Tuesday along with a requirement that physicians report to the state Department of Public Health when an abortion qualified under the state\u2019s narrow exceptions, such as in the case of rape if a police report has been filed.\nIn his ruling, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert C.
