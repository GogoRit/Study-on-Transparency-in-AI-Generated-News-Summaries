But mobilizing the G.O.P.\u2019s religious wing left some members out in the cold.Photograph by Gregory Smith / Corbis / GettySave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storySusan Cullman, a cigar heiress, philanthropist, and pro-choice activist, joined the Republican Party in the nineteen-seventies, when support for abortion rights was widely seen as consistent with conservative ideology. Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for President in 1964, was himself pro-choice, and his wife, Peggy, had helped to found an Arizona chapter of Planned Parenthood. \u201cThe conservative view at the time when Goldwater was around was that you don\u2019t want the government in your life,\u201d Cullman said. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t supposed to enter your home, never mind your body.\u201dIn 1981, Cullman moved from New York City to Washington, D.C., as a consummate Republican insider: her former husband, Larry Kudlow, advised President Ronald Reagan on economic policy, and Cullman joined the President\u2019s task force on private-sector initiatives. By that time, after a decade of courting Catholic voters and amid new efforts to sway evangelical Christians, the G.O.P. had become less hospitable to pro-choice views. Reagan and Bush had both turned against abortion rights, and the 1980 Republican Party platform supported a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade. \u201cI would say, \u2018Larry, I just got a thing in the mail from Planned Parenthood\u2014I think I\u2019m going to send some money,\u2019 \u201d Cullman recalled. \u201cAnd he would say, \u2018Well, don\u2019t tell anybody.\u2019 \u201d (A spokesperson for Kudlow denied that these exchanges ever took place.)In 1991, Cullman, by then divorced from Kudlow (who is now director of the National Economic Council), joined a nascent advocacy organization and political-action committee founded by Mary Dent Crisp, the former co-chair of the R.N.C., called the National Republican Coalition for Choice. \u201cI discovered that I joined an Administration that was starting to reduce women\u2019s ability to manage their own life,\u201d Cullman said. \u201cSo I was going to fight them, and I wanted to fight them on the inside.\u201dThe group, renamed the Republican Majority for Choice (R.M.C.) in the early two-thousands, shut down operations two years ago, but many former R.M.C. members remain close. It was these women, all of them white and well-connected, to whom Cullman turned on the evening of Friday, September 18th. She had just sat down to dinner with her stepson and his wife in her home in Stamford, Connecticut, when her stepson\u2019s phone dinged. \u201cGinsburg died,\u201d he said.\u201cI felt horror in my bones, just horror,\u201d Cullman said. She left the dinner table, turned on MSNBC, and started e-mailing her \u201cold gang\u201d from the R.M.C. These women had spent decades arguing to G.O.P. leadership that the Party\u2019s increasingly narrow outlook on abortion, as reflected in its platform, candidates, and judges, did not reflect the views of a majority of Republican voters. The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal feminist icon, would give President Trump his third Supreme Court appointment, cementing the rightward turn of the court for a generation or more, and placing the future of Roe v. Wade in doubt.The e-mail thread began in despair and moved to possible action. The group would need to convince a handful of Republican senators to delay a vote on Ginsburg\u2019s replacement. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, the last two pro-choice Republicans remaining in the Senate, confirmed that weekend that they would not support a vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the election. (Murkowski reversed her position on October 24th.) The group tried to think of other, relatively moderate Republicans who might be swayed to delay confirmation: Rob Portman, of Ohio; Shelley Moore Capito, of West Virginia; Mitt Romney, of Utah. But none of the women had any current connections to Portman or Capito. And, back in 2007, ahead of the Presidential primaries, the R.M.C. had run ads in Iowa and New Hampshire that called out Romney for his \u201cflip-flops\u201d on reproductive rights.\u201cWe realized,\u201d Cullman said, \u201cthat we really didn\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on.\u201d The eventual nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is a devout Catholic; as a professor at Notre Dame Law School, she was a member of University Faculty for Life, and she once signed her name to an ad calling Roe v. Wade \u201cbarbaric.\u201d Barrett was confirmed to the Supreme Court on October 26th, with Collins as the lone Senate Republican voting against her.At the end of 2016, the National Institute for Reproductive Health (N.I.R.H.) conducted focus groups in Ohio and North Carolina that tried to deduce if Trump\u2019s electoral success in those states indicated an over-all drop-off in support for reproductive rights. \u201cThese voters thought, He says lots of things, but maybe he doesn\u2019t believe them all,\u201d Andrea Miller, the president of the N.I.R.H., told me. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe that this\u201d\u2014rolling back abortion rights\u2014\u201cwas truly the agenda.\u201dHistorically, Miller said, \u201cthe Republican Party had the ability to have their cake and eat it, too\u2014to speak to the base with a wedge issue and still maintain the support of white suburban women.\u201dDecades ago, Republican lawmakers could claim credit for many advances in reproductive rights. In 1967, as governor of California, Ronald Reagan liberalized the state\u2019s abortion law. Three years later, another Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller, signed a bill, co-authored by the Republican assemblywoman Constance Cook, that made New York the first state in the country to legalize abortion without a residency requirement. George H. W. Bush\u2014a son of Prescott Bush, who was an early treasurer of Planned Parenthood\u2014earned the nickname \u201cRubbers\u201d for his support for contraceptive access. As a freshman member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bush co-sponsored legislation that created Title X, the domestic family-planning program that the Trump Administration is now dismantling.Yet, in the late nineteen-sixties, Republican strategists were beginning to identify blue-collar social conservatives as an untapped voter base. These potential converts to the G.O.P. cause included Southern whites and Catholic Democrats\u2014the latter mostly Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrants, who were historically bound to Democrats through urban machines. \u201cMen showed a strong anti-Democrat trend between 1960 and 1968; women showed considerably less change,\u201d the strategist Kevin Phillips wrote in the book \u201cThe Emerging Republican Majority,\u201d from 1969. \u201cThe new popular majority is white and conservative.\u201d Some of the Republican strategists of the time, such as Richard Viguerie and Paul Weyrich, were Catholic themselves, and sought to align themselves with an increasingly vocal Catholic leadership.Weyrich identified abortion as a key wedge issue, \u201cperhaps the most effective\u201d of all the single-issue groups, as Michele McKeegan, the former executive director of California\u2019s Six Rivers Planned Parenthood, wrote in her book \u201cAbortion Politics,\u201d from 1992. Donald Devine, another strategist, suggested wrapping traditional Republican priorities, such as lower taxes and smaller government, in a blanket of opposition to abortion rights, sexual freedom, and women\u2019s liberation. This approach, Devine argued, would heighten the Party\u2019s appeal to a group of voters\u2014twelve per cent of Americans, by his calculations\u2014who didn\u2019t vote Republican but held socially conservative values. Phyllis Schlafly, the telegenic conservative who helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, rallied women to the G.O.P. in the name of family values.By 1970, Republican registrars stood outside of Catholic churches across California, ready to enlist voters who were frustrated by the state Democratic Party\u2019s support for legal abortion. Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, tightened this alliance. Toward the end of the seventies, evangelical Christian leaders\u2014such as Jerry Falwell, of the Moral Majority; James Dobson, of Focus on the Family; and Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2014sensed an opportunity to align themselves with powerful political forces.The emerging Christian right\u2019s enthusiasm for the issue, however, was not reflected among the rest of the Republican Party\u2019s voting base. In 1972, a Gallup poll showed that sixty-eight per cent of Republicans believed that \u201cthe decision to have an abortion should be made solely by a woman and her physician.\u201d These numbers remained steady, even rising at times, for the next two decades.Even today, although polling indicates that clear majorities of Republican voters oppose abortion access and support anti-abortion candidates, their stated views can shift significantly depending on how a question is posed. In May and June of this year, when the N.I.R.H. Action Fund polled voters in Arizona and Pennsylvania, sixty-one and sixty-five per cent of Republicans, respectively, agreed with the statement \u201cI can hold my own moral views about abortion and still trust a woman to make this decision for herself.\u201d Similar proportions of Republicans agreed that \u201cthese decisions are best left to women, their families, and their doctors/healthcare providers.\u201dIn the nineteen-nineties, the R.M.C. (then still the National Republican Coalition for Choice), had chapters in nearly twenty states, an annual budget of a million dollars, and eight people working in its D.C. office. Its political-action committee helped elect many pro-choice, moderate Republicans: Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Lincoln Chafee, of Rhode Island; Susan Molinari, of New York; Christine Todd Whitman, of New Jersey; Jodi Rell, of Connecticut; Bill Weld, of Massachusetts; and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, of Maine. But even candidates who shared the organization\u2019s views felt increasingly compelled to hide them. \u201cThey would say, \u2018I agree with you, but I gotta get elected first,\u2019 \u201d Cullman said.Of the many Republican turnarounds on abortion, one of the most striking was Romney\u2019s. In 2002, as a candidate for governor of Massachusetts, \u201che called me personally\u2014he said, \u2018I need your endorsement to win,\u2019 \u201d Jennifer Stockman, the co-chair of the R.M.C. from 2000 to 2010, said. In his candidate questionnaire, Romney pledged to uphold abortion rights and support Medicaid funding to cover abortions for low-income women. \u201cWithin twenty-four hours, he sent it back, checked basically all the \u2018Yes\u2019 boxes, a hundred per cent pro-choice,\u201d Stockman said. In 2005, as his Presidential ambitions crystallized, Romney executed a full reversal. As governor, he vetoed a bill requiring hospitals in Massachusetts to provide emergency contraception to rape victims, and used the occasion to publish an op-ed in the Boston Globe affirming his opposition to abortion. \u201cI understand that my views on laws governing abortion set me in the minority in our Commonwealth. I am prolife,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother.\u201d\u201cWe were so angry at what he did to reverse his opinion, just for political reasons, because he was running for President,\u201d Stockman said. \u201cMitt Romney totally manipulated us.\u201d (A spokesperson for Romney did not respond to a request for comment.)Like Cullman, Stockman was a Republican insider partly by marriage\u2014her husband is David Stockman, a former Republican congressman for Michigan and President Reagan\u2019s budget director from 1981 to 1985. \u201cThe problem with our side was two things,\u201d Stockman said. \u201cOur supporters would much rather play golf and tennis than go fill out mailers to get the vote out. And they were more interested in their pocketbooks than they were social issues. So they would vote Republican and say, \u2018Oh, well, Roe v. Wade won\u2019t be overturned\u2014we\u2019re not worried.\u2019 \u201dTanya Melich, who co-founded the New York State Republican Family Committee, in 1984, thought that the R.M.C. lacked the political chops to play hardball with abortion opponents. Melich had been a Republican since birth: her father was a Utah state senator, and in 1940, as a preschooler, she had handed out pamphlets for the Republican Presidential candidate Wendell Willkie. She later worked on the staff of Governor Rockefeller; her own pro-choice organization was backed by wealthy Manhattan women with last names like Du Pont, Gimbel, and Mosbacher.In Melich\u2019s view, her national pro-choice counterparts had misplaced faith in George H. W. Bush, whom many of them knew personally. \u201cThe pro-choice Republican women supported the Republican establishment, and the establishment played them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no fight.\u201d Melich stormed out of the 1992 Republican National Convention in disgust, and, in 1996, published the book \u201cThe Republican War AgainstWomen.\u201dIn 2010, the Republican Majority for Choice merged with the WISH List, a political-action committee aimed at electing pro-choice Republican women to office, but the organizations\u2019 combined forces had little effect. There were few donors willing to write big checks to an increasingly steep uphill battle, and still fewer candidates who would run as pro-choice in what was becoming a monolithically pro-life party. \u201cLooking back, we missed the state legislatures, the judicial appointments,\u201d Cullman said. \u201cWe were focussed on national politics.\u201dIn the time Stockman had been involved with the R.M.C., at least a dozen former members of its board had quit the Republican Party altogether. \u201cThe whole thing was dwindling,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was nobody there.\u201d When the R.M.C. shut down, in 2018, Cullman and Susan Bevan, both national co-chairs, published an Op-Ed in the Times, titled \u201cWhy We Are Leaving the G.O.P.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have the space to outline President Trump\u2019s transgressions,\u201d they wrote, \u201cbut it is important to understand that his rise is an inevitable result of the hostility to women within the Republican culture.\u201d On reproductive rights alone, Trump has reinstated and expanded the global gag rule, which blocks funding for N.G.O.s that provide abortion services and counselling; blocked patients who use Title X funding from choosing Planned Parenthood clinics; and routed federal dollars toward religious groups that counsel against abortion.Bevan said that she will still vote for moderate Republicans in Connecticut, where she is based. In the 2016 election, she voted for Hillary Clinton after writing in Michael Bloomberg during previous cycles; this year, she said, she is \u201cproudly supporting Biden.\u201d Stockman told me that she occasionally writes in her husband\u2019s name for President, voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, and voted for Biden. Melich registered as a Democrat in 2018. Cullman did the same last month, and plans to vote for Biden.Among the prominent Republican pro-choice activists of this era, the only one I could find who still strongly identifies with today\u2019s Republican Party was Ann Stone, a communications consultant and direct-marketing entrepreneur. For sixteen years, Stone was the wife of the political consultant Roger Stone, the convicted felon and former adviser to President Trump. She launched the Republicans for Choice PAC in 1990, inspired, she said, by the 1989 Supreme Court decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, which permitted Missouri to put restrictions on abortion care and unleashed a flood of state-level regulations across the country.In 1992, delegates gathered in Salt Lake City to debate the Republican Party platform, which included a declaration that \u201cthe unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life\u201d and supported \u201ca human life amendment to the Constitution.\u201d (This language remains largely intact in the current G.O.P. platform.) Ahead of the hearings, Stone bought up billboards along the route from the Salt Lake City airport to the convention center that read, \u201c68% of the Party Can\u2019t Be Wrong: Republicans for Choice.\u201dHer P.R. flair was also evident at the hearings themselves, where she appeared on a panel on abortion issues. Stone defended abortion rights before the roomful of delegates, expressed her support for sex education and contraception access, and, most provocatively, dared pro-life Republicans to prove the strength of their convictions by becoming adoptive parents. \u201cIf you vote for the platform language as is, that would mandate more unwanted children be born, then, to show good faith, back up that commitment with action, and adopt,\u201d Stone told her audience. \u201cI have sample adoption papers here for each of you.\u201d A woman then began distributing the applications to Stone\u2019s fellow panelists, who included Phyllis Schlafly. \u201cShe about had a coronary during the hearing,\u201d Stone recalled with a laugh.According to a 2010 Atlantic piece by Josh Israel and Aaron Mehta, between 1990 and 2010, Stone\u2019s group raised some $5.5 million, but between 2000 and 2010 less than five per cent of spending went to political candidates, committees, or independent expenditures, and between 2005 and 2010 about half of one per cent went to federal or state campaigns. \u201cMuch of the group\u2019s spending,\u201d Israel and Mehta wrote, \u201chas gone to the coffers of consulting companies owned by the PAC\u2019s chair, Ann E. W. Stone,\u201d with much of the balance covering Stone\u2019s travel and entertainment expenses, car repairs, and parking tickets. (Stone told me that she spent heavily with her own companies because no other Republican-affiliated direct-mail firm would work with her.)In 2016, Stone helped launch a quixotic group called Women Vote Trump, and nowadays can often be found tweeting her support for the President using the hashtag #CrookedJoeBiden. She praised Trump for his \u201cpeacemaking efforts all over the world\u201d and for securing the release of American hostages. I asked her what she thought of the President\u2019s record on reproductive rights. \u201cFrom a reproductive-choice standpoint, obviously I\u2019m not happy,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThe other stuff he\u2019s doing\u2014as a Republican, I\u2019m thrilled.\u201dAnna Louie Sussman is a journalist based in New York, writing on gender, economics, and reproduction.More:AbortionAbortion RightsRepublicansG.O.P.Pro-ChoiceDailyOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top stories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.E-mail addressSign upBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
