These were also identified as a prerequisite for women\u2019s health and wellbeing. Over the past 25 years there has been important progress in several areas of women\u2019s health, however, gender discrimination, bias and inequalities in women\u2019s health persist. There are also new and emerging threats to women\u2019s health. The covid-19 pandemic is one such threat disproportionately impacting women\u2019s health and social and economic wellbeing in the immediate and long-term.\nThis collection, launched at the World Health Summit 2020, aims to provide insights into how to advance women\u2019s health and gender equality. The papers draw on successes, challenges and evidence-based strategies over the last 25 years and includes analyses of new and emerging threats to women\u2019s health. The series of papers push for real change in women\u2019s health now and over the next 25 years. \n\n\nEditorial\nGender equality by 2045: reimagining a healthier future for women and girlsGender equality is achievable and an imperative, by Avni Amin, Michelle Remme, Pascale Allotey, and Ian Askew.\nAnalysis\nViolence against women health workers: The tip of the gender power iceberg  Tackling gender power relations is key to ensuring health worker safety and wellbeing, and the ability to deliver quality care, say Asha George and colleagues.\nEmployment-based health financing does not support gender equity in Universal Health Coverage Health financing and entitlement systems linked to employment can disadvantage women, argue Lavanya Vijayasingham and colleagues.\nMaking pharmaceutical research and regulation work for womenThe legacy of male-bias within pharmaceutical research, regulation, and commercialization needs to be rectified, argue Sundari Ravindran and colleagues.\nHow can countries create outbreak response policies that are sensitive to maternal health?Ensuring women\u2019s need for sexual and reproductive healthcare are met should be a priority during disease outbreaks, say Maira L S Takemoto and colleagues.\nProtecting women and girls from tobacco and alcohol promotionGender transformative measures could curb the industries\u2019 expansion into low and middle income countries, contain the burden of chronic disease, and promote gender equity, argue Emma Feeny and colleagues\nWomen\u2019s wellbeing and the burden of unpaid workSoraya Seedat and Marta Rondon examine how gender inequities in the time allocated to unpaid work, exacerbated by covid-19, are affecting women\u2019s mental health\nExpanding data is critical to assessing gendered impacts of household energy useZeenah Haddad and colleagues call for an expansion of data on household energy use routinely collected through national surveys to gauge the health effects by gender\nOpinion\nRe-committing to women\u2019s health 25 years after the Beijing Platform for Action on Women: What must governments do?
