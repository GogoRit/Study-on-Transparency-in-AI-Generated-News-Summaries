A global pandemic is no time to play political games with Americans\u2019 access to time-sensitive health care services. And yet, when we should be working together to ensure everyone has access to the health care they need, anti-abortion extremists are instead wasting valuable time and resources.\u00a0\nYou need to know we're here with you \u2014 and that we\u2019re fighting back. Read on to see how.\nWhy Reproductive Health Care \u2014\u00a0Including Abortion \u2014 Is Essential\nHere\u2019s the background: In an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 and keep hospital beds open, many states are calling for \u201cnon-essential\u201d medical procedures to be postponed until the pandemic subsides. Non-essential or \u201celective\u201d medical procedures does not mean optional or unimportant \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re just not urgent, meaning they don\u2019t require immediate treatment. So, surgeries for early-stage cancer, joint replacement, or having a gallbladder removed are getting pushed back in states with these new, temporary restrictions.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s challenging by itself. These changes are leaving some patients stressed out and unsettled, even \u201cfeeling as if a time bomb was inside\u201d them.\u00a0\nSo what does it mean for a state to include abortion in its list of non-essential medical procedures? Imagine how you\u2019d feel if politicians postponed your abortion appointment until the pandemic ends \u2014 a milestone that could take well into 2021 to reach. That\u2019s what anti-abortion politicians in Texas, Ohio, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma have tried to do. They\u2019re ignoring the time-sensitive nature of abortion and lumping abortion into their lists of non-essential medical procedures.\u00a0\nMedical experts agree that abortion access is not optional. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology, abortion is an essential and time-sensitive medical procedure.\nWe can\u2019t believe we really need to say this \u2014\u00a0but during a pandemic, people need more access to birth control, abortion, and other reproductive health care,\u00a0not less.\n\n\nBREAKING: We filed an emergency lawsuit today to prevent the state of Alabama from using the COVID-19 crisis to prevent people from obtaining abortion care.Our government's response to the pandemic must be grounded in science and public health, not politics.\u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) March 30, 2020\n\n\n\nFive States Exploiting a Public-Health Crisis\nThe states using the pandemic to try to ban abortion and cut patients off from care are (so far): Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Ohio, and Alabama. Their cruel, dangerous abortion bans ignore the fact that abortion is essential, time-sensitive health care \u2014 while doing nothing to show how these states would provide extra care for pregnant women or newborns amid the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\nTexas\nIn Texas on March 22, Governor Greg Abbott banned all procedures that are \u201cnot immediately medically necessary\u201d \u2014\u00a0and he lumped abortion into that group, with the only exception in cases where the pregnancy would cause significant harm to the pregnant person.\u00a0\nThe Texas abortion ban forced abortion providers across the state to immediately cancel all scheduled appointments for safe, legal abortion. Whole Women\u2019s Health alone had to cancel 150 appointments, reporting that patients cried and expressed feelings of helplessness. Some patients whose abortion appointments were canceled reportedly drove hundreds of miles to access care elsewhere \u2014\u00a0a race against the clock before bans on abortion later in pregnancy kicked in. It\u2019s unclear what other patients did.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve taken Texas to court: To ensure that people can still access the health care they need, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Lawyering Project filed a lawsuit against the Texas abortion ban. On March 30, a federal judge blocked Texas from banning abortion as part of the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u2014 but on the next day, a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the Texas ban.\u00a0\n\n\nOhio\nOhio had the same bad idea as Texas. On March 22, the Ohio attorney general ordered all abortion clinics to stop performing any abortion in which the mother\u2019s health was not at risk, declaring them \u201cnon-essential.\u201d The move was in response to anti-abortion fringe groups, which wouldn\u2019t stop harassing state officials until they promised to attack people\u2019s access to safe and legal abortion.\u00a0 During the resulting confusion, Ohio providers had to delay appointments.\n\n\nWe got a restraining order against Ohio: On March 30, abortion providers in Ohio \u2014 represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ACLU of Ohio, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), along with local Ohio lawyers \u2014 took emergency legal action to ensure that they can remain open to provide time-sensitive, critical abortion care to patients. And the same day, a federal judge granted Ohio abortion providers a temporary restraining order to allow abortion services to continue for the time being.\u00a0\n\n\nOklahoma\nOn March 24, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt ordered all \u201celective\u201d medical and surgical procedures to be postponed. Along with the order, he made a point of prohibiting abortion specifically.\n\n\nWe took them to court: On March 30, the Center for Reproductive Rights, PPFA, and Dechert LLP challenged Gov. Stitt\u2019s order.\u00a0\n\n\nIowa\nOn March 27, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds followed suit. She banned surgical abortion right along with other \u201cnon-essential\u201d care.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHow are we fighting back? You guessed it \u2014\u00a0in court: On March 30, the ACLU of Iowa, PPFA on behalf of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed a lawsuit against Reynolds and other Iowa state officials.\u00a0\n\n\nAlabama\nEarlier in March, Alabama\u2019s Department of Public Health\u2019s also imposed a ban on non-essential health care, but it seemed to exempt abortion providers \u2014\u00a0at first. At least one of Alabama\u2019s abortion providers got an influx of callers from Texas seeking appointments \u2014 and from protesters threatening to report them to the health department for remaining open.\nOn March 28, Alabama\u2019s attorney general expanded the ban to include \u201call medical and surgical procedures\u201d except those required to treat emergency conditions that put patients\u2019 health in \u201cserious jeopardy.\u201d Given the risk of licensure penalties and being convicted of a crime, abortion providers were forced to cancel appointments and stop providing abortions.\n\n\nAnother successful lawsuit: The ACLU and Alabama abortion providers are suing the state Department of Public Health to stop it from using the excuse of the COVID-19 crisis to block people\u2019s access to abortion services. Thanks to that lawsuit, on March 30 a federal court blocked the policy so that safe, legal abortion care can continue in Alabama.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re fighting back, but more states could follow the lead of declaring abortion \u201cnon-essential\u201d \u2014\u00a0including Missisippi, which only has one abortion provider.\nWhat Happens When People Can\u2019t Get Safe, Legal Abortion Care\nPeople prevented from getting a safe, legal abortion will have few options:\u00a0\n\n\nTravel to another state \u2014 if they have the resources to take off work and make the trip \u2014 and risk exposing themselves or others to the new coronavirus,\n\n\nTry to self-manage an abortion, or\n\n\nWait until it is too late and they cannot get the care they need \u2014 which could also mean prenatal visits to doctors and hospitals already stretched thin by the pandemic, increasing the potential of exposure to COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS.\u201cIncreasing the number of women carrying pregnancies against their will won\u2019t relieve the current drain on doctors and hospital resources\u2014it\u2019ll exacerbate it.\u201d@c_cauterucci https://t.co/mrx6nPjyF6\u2014 Emily Crockett (@emilycrockett) March 24, 2020\n\n\n\nNow is the time to protect abortion access. Nobody should be forced to have a child against their will.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re Fighting Back\n\nNo matter what, Planned Parenthood won\u2019t stop fighting for you.
