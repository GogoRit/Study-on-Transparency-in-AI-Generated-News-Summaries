So far, the ads have inspired \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d reactions from Satanic Temple members, Goodwin said. \n\n\u201cWe have had some on social media say that they\u2019d love to take a trip to one of the three cities just to see the billboards \u2014 and, in fact, I would too,\u201d she said with a laugh. \n\nThe temple unveiled two designs last week; both state, \u201cOur religious abortion ritual averts many state restrictions.\u201d The Dallas billboard goes on to say, \u201cPregnancy complications are the sixth most common cause of death among women between the ages of 20 and 34.\u201d\n\nThe second billboard depicts a woman telling her friend that Satanists don\u2019t have to endure state-mandated waiting periods for an abortion. \n\nErected last week, Dallas\u2019 billboard will stay up until mid-January, Goodwin said. It seeks to notify local Satanists of the temple\u2019s abortion ritual, a process by which members reflect on Satanic tenets and a personal affirmation while receiving an abortion. \n\nGoodwin said the ritual provides spiritual comfort and feelings of self-worth during what some consider to be a difficult time. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process to provide spiritual sustenance in a satanic way,\u201d she said. \n\n   click to enlarge      Dallas drivers can catch a glimpse of this billboard off Highway 80.   Courtesy The Satanic Temple    The Satanic Temple sought to post billboards in states that have enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; 21 states have done so in all, including Texas and Florida. Satanists living in such states don\u2019t have to comply with certain medically unnecessary and unscientific abortion regulations, such as waiting periods or mandatory listening to the fetal heartbeat, Goodwin said.\n\nTemple organizers also made sure to place the billboards near crisis pregnancy centers, which Goodwin said are frequently confused with abortion clinics. To the unsuspecting layperson, those centers seem as though they would provide abortion services, but they instead offer advice that deters women from undergoing the procedure. \n\nThe billboards come as the Texas GOP doubles down on its mission to end a woman\u2019s right to abortion. \n\nThursday, the Republican Party of Texas said in a statement it will \u201crelentlessly work\u201d to end abortion during the state\u2019s upcoming legislative session. It also accused women\u2019s reproductive health care provider Planned Parenthood of openly working with Satanists to \u201cslaughter\u201d and \u201cdismember\u201d unborn children. \n\nIn response, Texas Democratic Party Executive Director Manny Garcia on Friday accused Republican leadership of trying to distract from their failure to contain the COVID-19 crisis. \n\n\u201cThe Texas Republican Party has gone off the dead end,\u201d Garcia said in an emailed statement. \n  \"Us demanding medical care in accordance to our religious views, as is required by law, is a right that should be guaranteed to us.\u201d \u2013 TST Spokeswoman Sydney Goodwin tweet this    This isn\u2019t the first time The Satanic Temple has tried to rent a billboard. \n\nIn September, TST sued Lamar Advertising Co. for religious discrimination because it had refused to post the religious organization\u2019s designs. The advertising giant denies the temple\u2019s initial allegations, according to a TST press release. \n\nAlthough Goodwin can\u2019t comment on the active lawsuit, she said TST ultimately struck a deal with billboard company Clear Channel Outdoor. \n\nOf course, not everyone is happy about the billboards, including commenters on an article by right-wing news site Breitbart. \n\n\u201cSatanic Temple is not a \u2018religion.\u2019 It's a cult that wants to murder people,\u201d one commenter wrote. \n\nBut TST\u2019s website claims it is a religious organization with a mission to encourage empathy, benevolence and common sense, while opposing tyrannical authority and injustice. \n\nEven pro-choice critics may think the temple\u2019s billboards could ultimately work against its calls for an expansion on women\u2019s reproductive rights. This is Texas, after all, and the Republican Party will continue its quest to close clinics. \n\nGoodwin said that while she understands that sentiment, the temple is ultimately responsible for protecting its membership\u2019s religious rights \u2014 including the right to a religious abortion ritual. \n\n\u201cSatanists have religious views in accordance to our tenets,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cUs demanding medical care in accordance to our religious views, as is required by law, is a right that should be guaranteed to us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP THE OBSERVER FREE...\nSince we started the Dallas Observer, it has been defined as the free, independent voice of Dallas, and we'd like to keep it that way.
