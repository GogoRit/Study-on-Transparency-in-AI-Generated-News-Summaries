That makes two of us. BLM supporters choose to focus on police brutality as their biggest issue but\u2014in reality\u2014they\u2019ve chosen the wrong battleground as public enemy number one for Black people is actually abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn op-ed on this topic, co-written by Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins and pro-life activist Patrina Mosley, was recently published at The Washington Times and entitled \u201cAbortion is the Number One Killer of African Americans.\u201d The authors write, \u201cBlack Americans comprise about 13% of the population but undergo 34% of all the nation\u2019s abortions, many committed by the nation\u2019s leading abortion vendor, Planned Parenthood, whose death chambers are conveniently located within walking distance of minority communities \u2014 nearly 9 in 10!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThey continue, \u201cCoincidence? Planned Parenthood and pro-abortionists would have you think so today.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nClick HERE to read the rest of the article at The Washington Times.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 5,377\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
