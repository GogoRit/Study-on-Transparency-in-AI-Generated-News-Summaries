Today\u2019s ruling of the Constitutional Court means underground/abroad abortions for those who can afford & even greater ordeal for all others. A sad day for #WomensRights.\n\u2014 Commissioner for Human Rights (@CommissionerHR) October 22, 2020\n\n\u201cRemoving the basis for almost all legal abortions in #Poland amounts to a ban & violates #HumanRights,\u201d Mijatovic tweeted.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling \u2026 means underground/abroad abortions for those who can afford & even greater ordeal for all others.\u201d\nSince 1993, Poland has only allowed abortions in case of rape or incest, a threat to the mother\u2019s life or a deformed fetus.\nNow the court ruling could pave the way for legislators from the governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party to approve draft legislation that would ban pregnancy terminations in the case of fetuses with congenital birth defects.\nMany Polish women bridled when PiS backed the bill originating as a popular petition earlier this year, prompting conservative legislators to refer the matter to the constitutional court.\nThe tribunal, whose main role is to ensure any law complies with the constitution, underwent government reforms in 2016 that led critics to contend it is stacked with PiS allies.\nPolice separate pro-choice activists, right, carrying a poster saying \u2018We are not incubators\u2019 from anti-abortion rights protesters, left, in front of Poland\u2019s constitutional court in Warsaw [Wojtek Radwanski/AFP]\n\u2018Blood on your hands\u2019\nFormer liberal Polish Prime Minister and PiS critic Donald Tusk called the timing of the abortion issue \u201cpolitical wickedness\u201d.\n\u201cThrowing the topic of abortion and a ruling by a pseudo-court into the middle of a raging pandemic is more than cynical,\u201d the head of the European People\u2019s Party tweeted.\nThe NGO Action Democracy, which had gathered more than 210,000 signatures against the stricter law, issued a statement saying the court delivered \u201ca shameful, political verdict dictated by right-wing fundamentalists\u201d.\nLeftist legislator Barbara Nowacka blamed the devoutly Catholic country\u2019s bishops, telling them at a news conference in parliament: \u201cYou have blood on your hands.\u201d\nPiS-allied President Andrzej Duda has said if approved by the parliament he would sign the draft legislation into law.\nOn Thursday, his spokesman Blazej Spychalski said \u201cthe president\u2019s views on this matter are well-known and haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019re satisfied that the constitutional court sided with life\u201d, he was quoted by the Polish news agency PAP as saying.\nThe country of 38 million people sees fewer than 2,000 legal abortions a year, but women\u2019s groups estimate up to 200,000 procedures are performed illegally or abroad.\nAn attempt by the PiS government to tighten the abortion law in 2016 was scrapped following nationwide protests by tens of thousands of women dressed in black.\n \n\n\n\n \nSource: AFPaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
