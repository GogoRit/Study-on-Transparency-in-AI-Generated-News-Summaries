Planned Parenthood is part of the problemThis article is more than 3 years oldJessa CrispinThe organization is a fundraising juggernaut but women\u2019s practical access to abortion services continues to declineMon 13 Jul 2020 05.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 14 Jul 2020 06.21 EDTShareThe pro-choice movement in America is almost inextricable from Planned Parenthood. The non-profit is not only the largest provider of abortion services in the country, it is also its political leader. Planned Parenthood and its executives are whom liberal politicians turn to for endorsement and support. They issue the talking points and they decide the agenda.Increasingly, abortion seems to be a thing progressives care about only whenever there\u2019s an opening on the supreme court, or when a state we don\u2019t care about or know anyone in closes another clinic, and that is pretty much it. (Even the New York Times, in a recent article about how irrelevant abortion rights seem to young feminists, seemingly couldn\u2019t find anyone outside a major urban area to talk to, someone who maybe didn\u2019t live a short Uber ride away from a clinic and have the $600 on hand to pay for the procedure before the end of the first trimester.)If Planned Parenthood is one of the leaders, if not the leader, of the pro-choice movement, perhaps it needs to take some responsibility for the movement being in a shambles. Because while many blame Trump for having \u201cemboldened\u201d conservative state governments to pass sweeping legislation challenging abortion access \u2013 Tennessee and Iowa being the latest \u2013 these challenges have been happening, and succeeding, for decades.Like many major non-profits, Planned Parenthood seems more concerned with hobnobbing with the powerful, paying the CEOs of its regional chapters salaries in the mid-six figures, making symbolic gestures and coming up with a catchy slogan to sell on T-shirts than with providing care for the people who need their services. They\u2019ll send out a fundraising appeal whenever a new restrictive law is passed, but that fundraising doesn\u2019t often seem to translate into grassroots-level advocacy to make it understood healthcare is a human right, and reproductive justice is a necessity if a person is going to live with dignity and autonomy. The organization doesn\u2019t, for example, endorse Medicaid for All. (Full disclosure: I was a Planned Parenthood employee in the Texas Capital Region chapter for about five years.)It\u2019s often the national organization that makes the headlines with its celebrity supporters and its adversarial relationship with Washington. But it\u2019s local Planned Parenthood clinics \u2013 often incredibly underfunded \u2013 who do the work, offering health screenings, birth control, reproductive services and abortion in often difficult environments. Plus, Planned Parenthood\u2019s brand recognition often draws support and dollars away from non-affiliated local clinics operating in rural regions without institutional support.Instead, Planned Parenthood spends its time talking about \u201cprotecting Roe\u201d, a notoriously weak and hobbled supreme court decision that guarantees legality but not access, and there is a massive difference between those two. For large parts of the nation, abortion is simply not accessible \u2013 logistically, financially or politically. Six states each have only one remaining clinic, meaning women there must travel extreme distances to access services. Then there are waiting limits, invasive medical tests, \u201ccounseling\u201d and other wastes of time they must undergo. These facts are well known in the feminist community, but they are often recited as a head-shaking \u201cwhat are you going to do?\u201d commentary on how the pro-life movement has us on our heels. Rarely do we use them to indict ourselves on just how many people we are letting down every year.There\u2019s no choice when the nearest clinic is 400 miles away and you don\u2019t own a car and it\u2019s been 80 years since Amtrak stopped in your townWhen I spoke with workers at a clinic in Kansas last year, they informed me that only about half their clients come from within the state. Women were forced to travel from Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and beyond to find providers with open appointments and who could accommodate their particular issues. But there are also an untold number of involuntarily pregnant people who don\u2019t even get as far as the clinic, because of the enormous cost of the procedure itself. Planned Parenthood and other clinics charge $400\u2013$600 (the price varies from region to region and clinic to clinic) for the combination of drugs that induce a medication abortion, despite the fact that the medication only costs about $90 for the clinics. That\u2019s the same amount charged for the surgical procedure \u2013 and that\u2019s if you want to experience potential white-knuckling pain during an already potentially emotionally traumatic procedure; if you want pain relief it will cost you much more.Then there\u2019s that word, \u201cchoice\u201d. There\u2019s no choice when you don\u2019t have the necessary funds to back it up. There\u2019s no choice when the nearest clinic is 400 miles away and you don\u2019t own a car and it\u2019s been 80 years since Amtrak stopped in your town. There are small independent funds to assist those in financial need, but there are too many people left underserved. \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d is the best our pro-choice leaders can seemingly come up with to protect our rights, which sounds like the argument of a 16-year old trying to convince their parents to sign off on a tattoo of a butterfly smoking weed. They can\u2019t even make clear what is at stake. The state should not mandate parenthood, but that is absolutely what it does under current law.There\u2019s a T-shirt available in the Planned Parenthood store that reads \u201cI Stand With Planned Parenthood.\u201d I\u2019m sure the people who buy and wear these shirts have the best of intentions. But shouldn\u2019t Planned Parenthood be standing with us? After all, we fund them with our donations. We keep abortion access available with our votes and our screaming voices in state legislatures. We\u2019re the ones who work in clinics for salaries barely above minimum wage. We\u2019re the ones who escort women through screaming protesters. We\u2019re the ones who go to jail or die from self-induced abortions because of lack of access. But that slogan doesn\u2019t seem like it would fit into Planned Parenthood\u2019s media strategy. At least not this year.\nJessa Crispin is a Guardian US columnist.
