Ron DeSantis is too severe and showing an openness to changing the country\u2019s immigration system.In an interview with The Associated Press, Suarez expressed support for a 15-week federal abortion ban, saying the country \u201cis not there yet\u201d on six weeks. He also said his status as the only Hispanic candidate in the GOP race gives him \u201ca lot of credibility\u201d in a conversation about reforming immigration laws, though he was vague about what he\u2019d propose.\u201cI do think that we need to right-size legal immigration and that it should be connected to our employment rate and our declining birth rate,\u201d said Suarez, who has Cuban ancestry. \u201cAnd I do think we have to do something with those who are undocumented in our country.\u201d\n\nSuarez, 45, made his candidacy official Wednesday by filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. He announced his run Thursday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d evading questions about the GOP primary front-runner, former President Donald Trump, who appeared in federal court in Suarez\u2019s city two days ago on charges he illegally hoarded classified documents and refused government demands to give them back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst charter flight with US citizens fleeing Haiti lands in Miami\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs threats to Black cemeteries persist, a movement to preserve their sacred heritage gains strength\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevered by Hemingway and visited by popes, why Cuba\u2019s small patron saint is such a huge symbol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is the third Florida resident to launch a 2024 bid for the White House, but the race so far is largely seen as a contest between the two other candidates in his state: Trump and DeSantis. Suarez has said he did not vote for Trump for president in 2016 or 2020 or for DeSantis for governor in 2018, though he did end up backing him in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuarez spoke Thursday at the Reagan Library in California, repeatedly praising his father, Miami\u2019s first Cuban mayor, who traveled with him. He said that under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, inflation was high, homelessness was worsening and the country was losing its influence around the world.\n\n\u201cWe must not shy away from the challenges that will allow us to continue to deliver generational prosperity,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cTo meet this challenge, we need a strong leader who shares America\u2019s values, who understands that unity is more powerful than division.\u201dWhen it comes to abortion, Suarez indicated to the AP that the limits in the new law in Florida and other states are much stricter than what he would support as president.\u201cLook, I think that the country is not there yet,\u201d he said of the six-week ban, which is before many women know they are pregnant.He said he would back a 15-week federal abortion ban with rare exceptions, in line with a plan proposed by GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina last year that more moderate Republicans tried to distance themselves from before the midterm elections.\u201cWe are in a situation where 70% of the country agrees with a limitation of 15 weeks where there is an exception for the life of the mother and an exception for rape and incest, and I think that is a position that will save a tremendous amount of babies,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cIf there was that kind of federal law, that\u2019s one that I would support as president.\u201d\n\nThe six-week abortion ban in Florida will take effect if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives.Abortion has been a top issue in the Republican presidential field so far, with candidates including DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence supporting six-week bans. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, like Suarez, has backed a 15-week federal ban, while former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has said she supports a federal ban but hasn\u2019t specified at how many weeks.Trump, whose appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, has suggested that Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban is \u201ctoo harsh\u201d and blamed Republican abortion hard-liners for GOP losses in last year\u2019s midterms.\n\nOn immigration, Suarez acknowledged there is a need to secure the border and change the immigration system. Many of Suarez\u2019s Republican rivals back hard-line immigration policies, including deploying troops and reinstating a Trump policy that made asylum seekers wait in Mexico.DeSantis has said Trump did not follow through his promises to toughen the border and has pledged to do more, telling voters recently in South Carolina that he would shut the border down.During his term in office, Trump enacted more than 400 immigration policy changes, including separating children from their parents at the border with no plans to reunite them.In the interview, Suarez also addressed questions about a recent Miami Herald report saying the FBI is investigating payments he received from a developer who was looking to secure permits from the city. He said he has not been contacted by investigators.\n\nSuarez said he has reached out to the Miami-Dade County\u2019s Commission on Ethics and Public Trust, which is reviewing the allegations with state prosecutors.\u201cI\u2019m confident and I have said that I will not use and did not use my official position to benefit any private party, and nor will I ever do that as mayor or as president,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
