A local South Carolina council member is ditching the Democratic Party and running for reelection as a Republican.\u00a0    \"Some things that I had looked at, I just don't agree with any longer,\" Dorchester County council member Harriet Holman told \"Fox & Friends First\" on Wednesday.\u00a0\"One of the things was that I am just totally pro-life, and I am by for capitalism, I am for funding the police. Those things are what made me make my final decision,\" she told host Todd Piro.\u00a0  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG WARNS DEMOCRATS 'HEADED FOR A WIPEOUT' IN MIDTERMS  The retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel said she believes Republicans will grow their numbers in African-American communities.\u00a0 Video  \"We're born into our families, and we kind of take on the trait of what our families are, and my parents were Democrats,\" she explained.\u00a0Holman noted since she retired from the military, she started getting more involved in her community. She saw policies she didn\u2019t agree with and decided to become a Republican, instead.\u00a0  SAN FRANCISCO ORGANIZERS CELEBRATE RECALL OF WOKE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS: 'MESSAGE IS LOUD AND CLEAR'\"It wasn't an easy decision. I talked to family, I talked to friends, I talked to my constituents, and a lot of my family members are really Republican, as well. So it was not too hard of a transition at all,\" she remarked.  The Dorchester County council member added she is \"very happy\" with her decision.

(Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)     Meanwhile, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote in an op-ed Tuesday, warning Democrats are \"headed for a wipeout\" in the midterm elections this November. His argument is that Democrats need to stop focusing on \"political correctness\" and \"culture wars.\"\u00a0Holman argued that one of the biggest things Democrats should be focused on is inflation.\u00a0\"[This is] the highest inflation we've had since 1982, I believe, and then we're talking about gas prices, which we may see a $4 gas price here in this year, alone. So those are the things that we need to focus on,\" she concluded.\u00a0    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"Those are the things that my constituents are focusing on, those are the things that I want to change and help my constituents get through. We need to just help them get further with not having inflation being a huge part of their life right now.\"  Stephanie Giang-Paunon is an Entertainment Writer for Fox News Digital.
