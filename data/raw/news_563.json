Greg Abbott\u2019s March 2020 executive order prohibited abortion under all but a few narrow circumstances in an attempt to preserve medical resources for COVID-19 patients. Abortion providers have said that the procedure rarely requires hospital time and typically does not involve extensive personal protective equipment.\nThe executive order ended over the summer, allowing abortions in the state to resume, but Planned Parenthood has said leaving the lower court rulings on the books would set harmful legal precedent for abortion rights advocates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lawyering Project called Abbott\u2019s order \u201ca transparent attempt to chip away at access to reproductive health care by exploiting a public health crisis,\u201d and said it was \u201cimportant we took this procedural step to make sure bad case law was wiped from the books,\u201d according to a NBC News report.\nAfter Abbott paused all non-urgent medical procedures and surgeries to slow the spread of COVID-19 and conserve medical equipment, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the order should include a ban on most abortions, setting off a barrage of conflicting court rulings that created confusion for clinics and women seeking to end their pregnancies.\nMany Texans left the state to receive abortions during that time, a new study found earlier this year.\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
