She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n      \n\n\n\n\nIowa\u2019s new ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they are pregnant, has been temporarily blocked in court. \nAn Iowa judge ruled Monday that the state must preserve the previous status quo consistent with the current Iowa Supreme Court precedent. The state\u2019s highest court previously struck down a practically identical version of the ban passed in 2018. The ruling only puts the law on hold until a final decision in the case is made, but for now, Iowans can once again access abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. \nRepublican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the law on Friday, briefly bringing to a halt most abortions in the state. The ban has exceptions for cases where the life or health of the pregnant person is in danger and for survivors of rape and incest, miscarriages, and certain fetal diagnoses.\nAbortion providers challenged the ban in state court on the basis that it violates Iowans\u2019 constitutional rights to abortion and substantive due process, as well as the state constitution\u2019s inalienable rights clause, which they argue guarantees those rights to women specifically and grants them equal protection under the law. \nBefore Reynolds signed the bill, Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said in a statement that the ban places an \u201cunacceptable burden on patients\u2019 ability to access essential abortion care, especially those who already face systemic inequities. Hundreds of Iowans will be impacted in mere weeks,\u201d \nIn response to the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to uphold a permanent block on the 2018 ban, Reynolds called a special session last week with the singular purpose of passing the new law, which she maintains is reflective of Iowans\u2019 values. \n\u201cIowans have elected representatives willing to stand up for the rights of the unborn and, in doing so, they have voted strongly in support of pro-life principles and against the arbitrary destruction of innocent, defenseless lives,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement announcing the special session.\nHowever, polling suggests that Iowans feel differently. A Des Moines Register-Mediacom Iowa poll conducted earlier this year found that 61 percent of Iowa adults supported legal abortion in all or most cases, and only 35 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. \nStill, openly anti-abortion Republicans continue to win elections in Iowa, which has taken a hard-right turn in recent election cycles. And Republican lawmakers are taking that as a carte blanche to advance their ultra-conservative agenda, including an abortion ban among the most restrictive in the country. \nWhat the ban means for Iowans \u2014 and the region\nThe exceptions to the ban are limited, and Republican lawmakers rejected amendments proposed by Democrats that would have expanded them. The organizations challenging the law, including Planned Parenthood North Central States, the Emma Goldman Clinic, and the ACLU of Iowa, said in a joint statement that people who do meet the criteria for an exception would face \u201cbarriers to care\u201d and that \u201cthe reality is that abortion will be largely unavailable for most vulnerable Iowans that might try to rely upon these exceptions.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve already seen massive reductions in care in other states that have enacted abortion bans. In Texas, for example, doctors are put in the position of having to determine whether the life or health of the pregnant person is endangered. That\u2019s led to delays in performing abortions, putting patients at further risk for complications. \nIf Iowans can\u2019t access abortion in-state, only those with the necessary financial resources may be able to do so elsewhere, and even then, they could face hurdles. Abortion access in the Midwest has severely contracted since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. Now, Wisconsin, Missouri, and the Dakotas have implemented bans on almost all abortions. Indiana will also implement its own ban starting in August.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Iowa ban is upheld in court, other states in the region will likely be under further pressure to provide abortions to out-of-state patients. That includes Michigan, where voters resoundingly approved a ballot measure last fall to codify abortion rights in the state constitution.\nThe state has already seen a significant increase in out-of-state patients in the last year, with Michigan doctors performing 2,761 abortions on such patients in 2022 compared to 1,665 in 2021, according to state data obtained by Bridge Michigan. Planned Parenthood, which operates 14 clinics in the state, has seen its out-of-state patient load nearly triple since the end of Roe.\nThe question is whether they can continue to expand their capacity to meet increasing demand from out-of-state patients. Many blue states have increased government funding for family planning service providers like Planned Parenthood, and the organization itself is redirecting resources toward clinics that are seeing higher demand, but staffing shortages and rising costs remain a concern. \nUpdate, July 18, 10:25 am ET: This story was originally published July 12 and has been updated multiple times, most recently with news that an Iowa court has put the new abortion ban on pause. \n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
