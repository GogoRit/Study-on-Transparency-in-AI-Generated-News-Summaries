Following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, some women in abortion-banning states have reported that clinicians and pharmacists denied them access to medications like methotrexate and misoprostol that are used to manage chronic conditions but are also used for medication abortions and treatment of ectopic pregnancies.\nClinicians prescribe methotrexate, which is harmful to fetuses and used to treat ectopic pregnancies, to also manage autoimmune diseases including Crohn\u2019s disease and lupus as well as certain cancers. Misoprostol is one of the drugs that is taken as part of a medication abortion typically with mifepristone, and is also prescribed for miscarriage management, to induce labor, and reduce the risk of ulcers caused by medications like aspirin and ibuprofen.\u00a0\nThis analysis used a large claims database of enrollees in large employer plans to look at the gender, age, and common diagnoses of people with methotrexate and misoprostol prescriptions in 2019. Key findings include the following:\n\nSeven in ten people with a methotrexate prescription were women. Among women of childbearing age (ages 18-49) with methotrexate prescriptions, 92% were not pregnant in the year. Among those who were not pregnant, the vast majority had an autoimmune disease and about one in five had a cancer diagnosis at some point in the year.\nAmong women of childbearing age with misoprostol prescriptions, 97% were women and 61% were not pregnant. The majority of non-pregnant women had a diagnosis for which misoprostol would be needed in preparation for a cervical procedure such as intrauterine device (IUD) insertions, while another one in three were diagnosed with abnormal bleeding.\n\nRead \u201cAbortion Bans May Limit Essential Medications for Women with Chronic Conditions\u201d to learn more.\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nWomen's Health Policy\n\n\n\nTags\n\nAbortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tGet The Latest On Health Policy\t\t\n\n\t\t\tSign Up For Email Alerts\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tYour Email Address\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tSign Up\t\n\n\nTopics\n\nAffordable Care Act\nCOVID-19\nGlobal Health Policy\nHealth Costs\nHIV/AIDS\nMedicaid\nMedicare\nMental Health\nPatient and Consumer Protections\nPrivate Insurance\nRacial Equity and Health Policy\nUninsured\nWomen\u2019s Health Policy\n\n\nSections\n\nPolling\nState Health Facts\nGraphics & Interactives\nCharts & Slides\nKFF Health News\nSocial Impact Media\nPeterson-KFF Health System Tracker\n\n\nNewsroom\n\nNews Releases\nEvents\nSubscribe to Emails\nCite Us/Reprint\nMedia Contacts\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nFrom Drew Altman\nOur People\nOur Programs\nKFF Board\nContact Us\nSupport Our Work\nJoin Our Team\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nFollow Us\n\nEmail Alerts\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nThreads\nX\nRSS Feeds\nYouTube\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 KFF\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPowered by WordPress VIP \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCitations and Reprints\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKFF Headquarters: 185 Berry St., Suite 2000, San Francisco, CA 94107 | Phone 650-854-9400\t\t\n\t\tWashington Offices and Barbara Jordan Conference Center: 1330 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005 | Phone 202-347-5270\t\nwww.kff.org | Email Alerts: kff.org/email | facebook.com/KFF | twitter.com/kff\n\nThe independent source for health policy research, polling, and news, KFF is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
