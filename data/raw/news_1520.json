(AP) \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s newly all-male Supreme Court reversed course on abortion Wednesday, upholding a law banning most such procedures except in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.The continued erosion of legal abortion access across the U.S. South comes after Republican state lawmakers replaced the lone woman on the court, Justice Kaye Hearn, who reached the state\u2019s mandatory retirement age.The 4-1 ruling departs from the court\u2019s own decision months earlier striking down a similar ban that the Republican-led Legislature passed in 2021. The latest ban takes effect immediately.Writing for the new majority, Justice John Kittredge acknowledged that the 2023 law also infringes on \u201ca woman\u2019s right of privacy and bodily autonomy,\u201d but said the state Legislature reasonably determined this time around that those interests don\u2019t outweigh \u201cthe interest of the unborn child to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a Court, unless we can say that the balance struck by the Legislature was unreasonable as a matter of law, we must uphold the Act,\u201d Kittredge wrote. Kittredge wrote that \u201cwe leave for another day\u201d a determination on what the law\u2019s language means for when exactly during a pregnancy the ban should begin, likely forecasting another long court fight on that question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Justice Donald Beatty provided the lone dissent, arguing that the 2023 law is nearly identical, with definitions for terms including \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d and \u201cconception\u201d that provide no clarity on when the ban begins, exposing doctors to criminal charges if law enforcement disagrees with their expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood South Atlantic clinic in Columbia had served only a \u201chandful\u201d of the roughly 30 patients scheduled for abortions Wednesday when the ruling came down, according to Dr. Katherine Farris, the group\u2019s chief medical officer. The center \u2014 one of three clinics in the state \u2014 has paused abortions while officials work to understand the ruling\u2019s implications.\n\nBeatty warned that the majority\u2019s failure to address such a key question could lead to political retribution. He added that judicial independence and integrity were weakened by the court\u2019s decision to backpedal on its prior ruling.Hearn wrote the majority\u2019s lead opinion in January striking down the ban as a violation of the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy. She then reached the court\u2019s mandatory retirement age, enabling the GOP-led Legislature to put Gary Hill on what is now the nation\u2019s only state Supreme Court with an entirely male bench.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers then crafted a new law to address Justice John Few\u2019s concern, expressed in the January ruling, that the Legislature had failed to take into account whether the restrictions were reasonable enough to infringe upon a woman\u2019s privacy rights.Abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, sued again. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic\u2019s lawyer said during oral arguments this summer that both laws limited abortions at the same point in pregnancy and were equally unconstitutional.\n\nThe 2023 law restricts most abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, declaring that this happens about six weeks after a pregnant woman\u2019s last menstrual period. Lawmakers defined this as \u201cthe steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201dBut Beatty wrote that at six weeks, the fetus doesn\u2019t exist yet \u2014 it\u2019s still an embryo \u2014 and the heart doesn\u2019t develop until later in a pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it\u2019s inaccurate to call such \u201ccardiac activity\u201d a heartbeat.\u201cThe terminology is medically and scientifically inaccurate. As such, it is the quintessential example of political gaslighting; attempting to manipulate public opinion and control the reproductive health decisions of women by distorting reality,\u201d Beatty wrote.The newly sworn Hill joined Wednesday\u2019s majority along with Few, who had previously voted to overturn the 2021 law. In a separate concurring opinion, Few wrote that the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy does not provide blanket protections against \u201creasonable\u201d invasions.\n\nThe majority opinion found a key difference in the lawmakers\u2019 deletion of a reference to a pregnant woman having the right to make an \u201cinformed choice.\u201d The 2023 law expanded \u201cthe notion of choice to the period of time before fertilization, certainly before a couple passively learns of a pregnancy,\u201d Few wrote. That change lengthens the window for couples to avoid unwanted pregnancies by promoting \u201cactive family planning.\u201d In addition, the new law provides insured contraceptives to \u201calmost all couples\u201d and places responsibility on sexually active couples to actively use pregnancy tests, Few wrote.Planned Parenthood South Atlantic\u2019s lawyer had noted during oral arguments that such analysis ignored the possibility for failures in testing and contraceptives.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that provided nationwide access to abortion, most GOP-controlled states have enacted or adopted abortion bans of some kind. All have been challenged in court.Republican officials in South Carolina celebrated what Gov. Henry McMaster called \u201cthe culmination of years of hard work\u201d to curtail abortion access. Republican legislative leaders scrambled at the end of the session to pass the new limits as the number of abortions increased rapidly under the state\u2019s reversion to a 22-week ban passed in 2016.Republican South Carolina Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said Wednesday that he anticipates future challenges based on the definition of cardiac activity. Still, he expects the new ruling will put the issue to rest next session.That is, at least until 2024 elections possibly alter the composition of a state Senate that fell just shy several times this past year of clearing procedural hurdles to enact a near-total ban.More court shakeups are also coming. Beatty must retire in 2024 because he, too, will reach the mandated retirement age of 72 for judges. Kittredge is the only judge who applied to replace him. The Legislature is expected to approve Kittredge and choose another new justice next year.___Associated Press writer Jeffrey Collins contributed to this report.
