Wade, abortion-rights advocates took their fight to the states \u2014 and they won. The pro-choice side emerged victorious in nearly every 2022 election where abortion rights were at stake \u2014 including five ballot measures to either enshrine or abolish abortion rights in state constitutions. For many liberals, it felt like they had hit upon a winning strategy to protect abortion rights in a post-Roe world: bring the issue directly to the people. Talk quickly started about putting more pro-abortion-rights amendments on the ballot in 2024.\nBut there\u2019s a problem: Many states don\u2019t let citizens put constitutional amendments on the ballot. And that includes most of the states with the strictest abortion bans.\n\nOf the 22 states that have a total or six-week abortion ban on the books (including states where courts have temporarily put the ban on hold), 15 do not allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments.1 This includes some of the biggest and most important states for abortion access, like Texas, which, according to the American Community Survey, is home to nearly seven million reproductive-age women.2 Overall, nearly 20 million reproductive-age women live in those 15 states, which means their access to abortion can\u2019t be changed by residents who want to put abortion rights on the ballot. \nThat said, it is possible for voters to nullify an existing ban in the other seven states, which are home to just over seven million reproductive-age women. A ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution \u2014 like the one Michigan voters passed in 2022 \u2014 could legalize abortion in Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota. It would put a decisive end to the court fights over Arizona\u2019s and North Dakota\u2019s bans as well. The biggest battle could be in Ohio, where a six-week ban is currently blocked in court but there has been talk of passing an even stricter ban that covers all stages of pregnancy.\u00a0\nHowever, these amendments still wouldn\u2019t be easy to pass. According to polling by Civiqs, a majority of adults in Arkansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota believe abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. And in Ohio, where a majority of adults do support legal abortion in most circumstances, Republicans have proposed raising the threshold to pass any citizen-initiated constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent. Republicans have denied that this is an intentional attempt to make it harder for a potential abortion-rights amendment to pass, but it would certainly have that effect. Abortion-rights advocates might end up having the best shot in Arizona, where a majority of residents think abortion should be legal in most cases, and a 19th-century ban on abortion is being challenged in the courts.\nA few other states could also see abortion-related ballot measures in the future, even if they wouldn\u2019t change the law as it stands right now. For example, abortion is currently legal before 20 weeks in Nebraska, but it\u2019s possible the state will pass a stricter ban in the next few years.3 However, since Nebraska allows citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, a Michigan-style ballot measure could guard against this.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolitics\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead Now\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd abortion is currently protected in under the Florida and Montana state constitutions, but only because their state supreme courts have said so. And they could very well change their minds \u2014 there are currently abortion-related cases pending before both courts. Abortion-rights advocates may try to pass amendments explicitly protecting abortion rights in these states, too, as insurance against future unfavorable rulings.\nFinally, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon could use citizen-initiated constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights as well.4 Although abortion rights aren\u2019t seriously threatened in these states, advocates may want to put pro-abortion-rights measures on their ballots anyway as a symbolic move (or to protect against extreme future scenarios) \u2014 similar to amendments passed by California and Vermont in the 2022 election. In fact, Democrats may see an advantage to be gained by doing so. In Michigan this year, high interest in the abortion amendment appeared to buoy Democrats up and down the ballot (though this did not appear to be true in California). Although most of these states are solidly blue, voters motivated by an abortion-rights measure could theoretically boost Democrats in districts like Colorado\u2019s 3rd \u2014 where a Democrat nearly unseated Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in November \u2014 and Oregon\u2019s 5th. Of course, with 2024 being a presidential election year, many voters won\u2019t need to be told twice to go to the polls.\nCLARIFICATION (Dec. 14, 2022, 1:50 p.m.): This story has been updated to make clear that each state\u2019s share of women 15-49 is relative to national numbers.\nCORRECTION (Dec. 14, 2022, 2:10 p.m.): A previous version of this story said Illinois could pass a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights. However, constitutional amendments in Illinois are limited to changes in legislative structure or procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nThree of these states, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, do allow citizen-initiated statutes to be put on the ballot, but there is nothing stopping their legislatures from simply repealing those statutes if they pass. In Wyoming, the legislature would have to wait two years before fully repealing the statute, though it could amend it (i.e., water it down) at any time.\nWomen between the ages of 15 and 49.\nAlthough state Republicans did not have enough support to pass even a 12-week ban last summer, they may try again.\nIllinois also allows citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, but they are \u201climited to structural and procedural subjects\u201d about the legislature.\n \n\n\nNathaniel Rakich is a senior editor and senior elections analyst at FiveThirtyEight.   @baseballot\n\n\n\nAmelia Thomson-DeVeaux is a senior editor and senior reporter for FiveThirtyEight.   @ameliatd\n\n\n\nFiled under\nAbortion (166 posts)\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Interactives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Abortion\n\n\n\n \nPolitics Podcast Politics Podcast: How Much Is Abortion Motivating Voters?\nAug 14, 2023\n\n\n\n \n2023 Election A Special Election In Ohio Shows Voters Still Care About Abortion\nAug 9, 2023\n\n\n\n \nPolitics Podcast Politics Podcast: Ohio Voters Weigh In On Abortion (Indirectly)\nAug 7, 2023\n\n\n\n \n2023 Election Everything You Need To Know About The Ohio Ballot Measure That Could Block Abortion Rights\nAug 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\nImpeachment What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry\nSep 14, 2023\n\n\n2024 Election The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans\nSep 13, 2023\n\n\n2024 Election Why 'Bidenomics' Isn't Working For Biden\nSep 12, 2023\n\n\nPolitics Podcast Politics Podcast: Polling Silly Season Begins\nSep 11, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGet more FiveThirtyEight\t\t\n\n\n\nStore\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nData\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @FiveThirtyEight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nMasthead\n\n\nPitch FiveThirtyEight\n\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPowered by WordPress VIP \n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\n\n\nInterest-Based Ads\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.
