AalenOpinion ContributorThe motto at Bellarmine, a Roman Catholic Institution and now a University here in Louisville, Kentucky is In Veritatis Amore, translated as \"In the love of Truth.\"\u00a0 As a senior student, 50 years ago, graduating in English and Theatre, I was one of three men nominated for the award based on the motto. I certainly didn\u2019t merit winning and didn\u2019t, but felt both honored and completely humbled some faculty thought I was somewhat headed in that direction in any sense whatsoever. At the time I was in vows and headed to become a Roman Catholic priest in the Passionist religious community of men that was frequently and genuinely idyllic. I deeply love the life.Abortion was a somewhat theoretical issue in those days before the Roe v. Wade Decision in 1973 the year after I graduated.\u00a0 But in an ethics class I learned it was morally wrong and just put the issue in the forbidden bucket.\u00a0It was a purely theoretical issue for me at the time.In that same year I left my studies for the ministry and religious community life because I felt I would be sheltered from the full spectrum of life. In a short time, I was working in my first advertising agency creating print ads, broadcast commercials for clients like Churchill Downs, Falls City Beer and Rebel Yell Bourbon\u00a0I had realized I am an experiential learner, not\u00a0lock step accepting somebody else\u2019s theory.\u00a0I suppose that is why I am deeply drawn to the words of the Indian poet Kabir, \"If you have not lived through something it is not true.\"But there is a problem regarding the truth on issues of abortion for me. I am not female.\u00a0 And in my personal experience no woman I've ever known in my circle of family or friends has had the procedure or asked my advice; I have never had to make a judgment.\u00a0That is until now with the absolutist Amendment 2on the Nov. 8 ballot here in Kentucky.More:On Election Day, you'll decide whether to ban abortion in Kentucky. Here's what to knowNear the beginning of the 20th century the brilliant Irish playwright, novelist and essayist Oscar Wilde noted The truth is rarely pure and never simple. At Bellarmine I \u00a0confronted an axiom attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle: Learning is not child\u2019s play; we cannot learn without pain. One would have to be a masochist to enjoy grappling with the difficult and complex issue of abortion without a reason.\u00a0In my opinion it is Aristotle\u2019s child\u2019s play to take a predefined answer from anyone else rather than exploring it with one\u2019s own heart, conscience and life experience. And, as the pithy comedian Moms Mabley advised us \u201cUse your head\u2026your brains are in it.\u201dCurrent Kentucky law forbids abortion on all grounds (including rape and incest) with legal procedure only in life threat to the mother. Should my daughter face a pregnancy because of a criminal act we have the means to whisk her to another state or country for a procedure: not so for a poor woman in Kentucky today.\u00a0I cannot accept the finality of this legislation in good conscience or sound reason.Many women and men in the U.S. Catholic Culture have made the decision to hold tension on the issue of abortion:More:Jewish women sue to block Kentucky abortion ban, say it violates religious freedomOverall, about three-quarters of U.S. Catholics (76%) say abortion should be illegal in some cases but legal in others. Just one-in-ten say abortion should be illegal in all cases, with no exceptions, while a similar share (13%) take the position that abortion should be legal in all cases, without exceptions. Pew Research, May, 2022.I deeply honor a side of the debate holds a profound reverence for human life; I am with you. And I stand steadfast with those who seek to protect individual rights of women in the experimental and delicate system called democracy; especially in protecting the economically marginalized. It is not inconceivable in Kentucky\u2019s future the unbending legalize an adopted amendment would allow a well-meaning political majority to take away the current allowance for termination of pregnancy when life threatening to a mother.\u00a0Since in my opinion none of us have all the answers on this issue I will be voting \"No\" on Amendment 2.\u00a0I have discovered in my 73 years that as I have opened my heart, mind and conscience on some dense questions I have traveled from the illusions of truth and feelings of certainty to the certainty of past illusion and impermanence of emotions.Love the true truth?\u00a0 It is rarely pure and never simple and not child\u2019s play.\u00a0Jim Aalen's marketing and advertising career left Louisville forty-five years ago with stops in Dallas, TX, Salt Lake City, UT, and The West Coast.\u00a0 A long list of Clients included Chili's, Southwest Airlines, Zales Jewelers, Chiffon Margarine, and Paramount Pictures.\u00a0 Jim and his Wife Lyn moved back to Louisville to retire here eight years ago.\u00a0 Lyn taught humanities and directed plays for JCPS at Waggener and Moore High Schools.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Promote Your Event Licensing & Reprints Help Center Courier Journal Store Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Events Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.courier-journal.com.
