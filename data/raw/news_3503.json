Newsroom, May 26, 2022 / 03:05 am\nSeven students have been suspended from Hunterdon Central Regional High School in New Jersey \u2014 and seven \u201cextended detentions\u201d given, with more disciplinary measures possibly to come \u2014 after a rowdy pro-abortion protest by students resulted in the physical and verbal assault of a sophomore holding a pro-life sign.\nJeffrey Moore, the school\u2019s superintendent, acknowledged the \u201cdistressing\u201d behavior of the pro-abortion students toward 16-year-old Nichole Pagano at a live-streamed school board meeting on May 23. But he was still severely criticized at the meeting for the way the situation was handled. \nAt the meeting, Moore gave a presentation about the unsanctioned protest, which took place on May 16. \n\u201cI want to reiterate, certainly the most distressing moments of this incident were in the behavior that was shown to counter-protesters who had arrived and those involved,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShoving, expletive-laden verbal aggression, vandalism to signs, signs were knocked over, thrown, kicked, all of those things that made this a most distressing and disrespectful scene and example of student behavior against a student there who showed up with another viewpoint.\u201d\nNichole speaks out\nNichole told CNA on May 24 that when she and her senior sister Vanessa, both Catholics, saw around 200 students forming a pro-abortion protest in the middle of the school\u2019s campus during class hours, they immediately felt a call to action: they needed to stand up for the unborn. And they did. \nAs Nichole walked around the protest holding a pro-life sign that said \u201cEqual Rights For Babies in the Womb,\u201d she was physically attacked and screamed at by students. \nNichole, of Readington Township, recalled: \u201cThere\u2019s like 200 kids there and then all of a sudden they come surrounding us \u2014 mostly trying to come at me and attack me because I had the sign \u2014 and then they came at me all up in my face, verbally screaming at me, and physically even grabbed me and ripped me down.\u201d\nNichole Pagano, 16, stands holding a pro-life sign at an unsanctioned pro-abortion rally that occurred at Hunterdon Central Regional High School May 16, where she was verbally and physically harassed while having her sign vandalized. Vanessa Pagano.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNichole said that her 18-year-old sister was the only person protecting her, \u201ctrying to get these kids away from me and almost pushing them off of me, off my arm, and blocking them so they wouldn\u2019t get my sign.\u201d\nNichole said that after the protest she had scratches on her arm and legs, and her shoulder hurt. Her father, Michael Pagano, described the shoulder injury as being a \u201csore shoulder.\u201d\nSuperintendent Moore said at the board meeting that some school and town police officers \u201cwere attached near that student so that she would have that presence nearby as we continue to work to dissipate the crowd.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter he said this, someone could be heard yelling from the crowd: \u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d\nNichole told CNA that the school\u2019s principal Edward Brandt apologized to her at a school board meeting on the day of the protest. Moore also publicly apologized to her.\nReferring to Brandt\u2019s apology, she said that \u201cit didn\u2019t seem like too big of an apology, though. It kind of seemed like a quick, short, little apology. It didn\u2019t seem very long and even that concerning.\u201d\nShe added that after the apology, she \u201cdidn\u2019t hear anything from anyone,\u201d adding that the school didn\u2019t contact her parents. Her father confirmed that no one had contacted him or his wife, Jennifer, as of May 25.\n\nMore in Americas\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Irish Catholic slaves brought the faith to the Caribbean\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nNichole spoke publicly at the May 16 board meeting about the \u201churtful\u201d events that occurred that day. \nShe told CNA that when she saw the protest, she was baffled that students thought it was acceptable to protest in favor of abortion, especially in school.\n\u201cLike, do they really know what that is? I don\u2019t think enough of them even know exactly what it is and how it works,\u201d she said. \nNichole said that if she were to give other high school students advice on how to deal with similar situations, she would say: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to just do what your heart says and what you believe in. You\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s sometimes hard to do, you go to do it to make a stand and make a point.\u201d \nSchool board members scolded by the public\nAt the most recent school board meeting, the school\u2019s handling of the situation was criticized multiple times, with one man even calling for Moore\u2019s job termination. \n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nThe critical comments included a statement from New Jersey state assemblyman Erik Peterson, who represents the 23rd Legislative District, including parts of Hunterdon.\nExplaining that he was present at the meeting \u201cin solidarity with the parents,\u201d Peterson said that Nichole \u201cis the victim, not the \u2018counter-protester.\u2019 She was assaulted. It\u2019s on video.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem, from my perspective, is the leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cThese kids didn\u2019t learn this on their own, they learned it here. And it starts with this board and the superintendent.\u201d\nPeterson called Moore\u2019s presentation \u201cdisrespectful to everybody in this room and to this board, to everybody, and to the victim.\u201d \nAsked if the school had checked in with Nichole to ensure her future safety and well-being, a school spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply distressed by the behavior between students who engaged in verbal and, in a very small number of instances, physical aggression during this gathering.\u201d\n\u201cYouth demonstrations have a long history of educating students toward civic-mindedness; however, the behavior in this demonstration was disrespectful and distressing enough to be an affront to that tradition of peaceful assembly and protest. We are investigating thoroughly and taking all appropriate disciplinary actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement went on: \u201cThis demonstration brings us to serious reflection on the procedures we have for managing such events and, most especially, on the examples that we, as adults, are setting for our children.\u201d \n\u201cThe actions that they see taken by adults impact the actions that they believe to be appropriate and acceptable.\u201d\n\u201cAs we move to correct their behavior, we must work together to offer better object lessons. We must provide outlets for expression, but these need to be exercised with care, respect, and dignity for ourselves and one another. We need to teach these lessons of civil discourse to our children in much more deliberate ways, especially in these times.\u201d\nThe statement concluded: \u201cAt Central, we will continue to insist on respect in all civic and political processes and hope that this contributes to a future in which there is better and more constructive civic participation. We are thankful for the partnership with our community in that effort.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nNew Jersey, \nPro-choice, \nHigh school, \nAbortion in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Bukuras is a journalist at the Catholic News Agency.\u00a0 Joe has prior experience working in state and federal government, in non-profits, and Catholic education.
