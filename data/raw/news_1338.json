In that time, life has changed dramatically for millions of Americans when it comes to their healthcare choices.\nGiving states individual choice when it comes to providing abortions is spurring the creation of a chaotic patchwork system across the country. The procedure is banned or severely restricted in more than a\u00a0dozen states, mainly in the south. Nearly 10 other states have bans in the works, but face legal challenges. This means almost\u00a0one in three American women of reproductive age \u2013 disproportionally poorer women and those of colour \u2013 now live in a state with no abortion options, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\u00a0Studies show\u00a0that this lack of access puts pregnant women at risk for worse financial, health and family outcomes.\nBeyond the procedure itself, physicians say vaguely-worded laws are\u00a0having a chilling effect on treating high-risk patients. Fearful of criminal prosecution, doctors in some states have been hesitant to treat pregnant women with cancer or women whose fetuses are diagnosed with fatal complications, putting their lives in danger.\nPolls show that a majority of Americans (62 percent) support keeping abortion legal, and the issue is expected to galvanise voters in next month\u2019s midterm elections. The outcome would impact efforts to pass legislation that either legalises or restricts abortion on a national level.\nIn this episode of The Stream, we\u2019ll look at the impact that abortion bans are having on Americans, particularly the poor and women of colour.\nOn this episode of The Stream, we speak with:\nElizabeth Nash, @ElizNash\nPrincipal Policy Associate, Guttmacher Institute\nJessica Rubino\nFamily medicine physician\nMichele Goodwin, @michelebgoodwin\nProfessor of Law, University of California\nPublished On 12 Oct 202212 Oct 2022More from the same showCan Russia\u2019s Gen Z make a real change?play-arrowVideo Duration 25 minutes 20 seconds 25:20How is Israel using cultural erasure as a weapon of war?play-arrowVideo Duration 24 minutes 40 seconds 24:40Why are millions internally displaced in DRC?play-arrowVideo Duration 25 minutes 00 seconds 25:00How is Palestine connected to the climate justice movement?play-arrowVideo Duration 25 minutes 15 seconds 25:15How is occupied East Jerusalem\u2019s diversity under threat?play-arrowVideo Duration 24 minutes 58 seconds 24:58What Black History Month means for those on the front lines of activismplay-arrowVideo Duration 25 minutes 19 seconds 25:19How is Israel\u2019s arms industry profiting from the war on Gaza?play-arrowVideo Duration 25 minutes 13 seconds 25:13AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebook-f-darktwitteryoutube-whiteinstagram-whiterss-white\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
