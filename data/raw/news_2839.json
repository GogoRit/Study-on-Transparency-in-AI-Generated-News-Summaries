City officials have  ignored the First Amendment\u00a0and created censorship zones around many businesses, including abortion facilities.\nThis is unconstitutional, and the U.S. Supreme Court has already struck down such policies. Thankfully, pro-life sidewalk counselors decided to challenge this in court. Let\u2019s take a look at their case.\nWho is Nikki Bruni?\nNikki Bruni\u00a0was listening to the radio when the topic of abortion came up. She found herself deeply affected by the discussion, and it motivated her to address an issue that she realized was damaging many people.\nToday, Nikki is a sidewalk counselor in the City of Pittsburgh.\nNikki and her colleagues provide an important pro-life witness by peacefully standing on sidewalks in front of abortion clinics. They quietly pray for the mothers and unborn children inside. When men and women walk to and from the clinic, they speak compassionately to them about the development of their child and offer to help them in any way they can.\nBut their right to freely speak and do sidewalk counseling like this was being threatened.\nBruni v. City of Pittsburgh\nIn 2005, Pittsburgh passed an ordinance that allowed government officials to ban leafleting and other speech within 15 feet of the facilities of abortionists, eye doctors, dentists, and any \u201ctherapeutic,\u201d \u201chealing,\u201d or \u201chealth-building\u201d treatment provider. When Mayor Bill Peduto took office in 2014, he began enforcing this ordinance, which he had voted for as a city councilman.\nWhile it may seem odd for an ordinance to lump such different facilities together, the law\u2019s intent is clear. It targets pro-life counselors who stand on public sidewalks outside of abortion facilities.\nHow do we know? Because the city only enforced the ordinance in front of abortion facilities. And while it prohibited pro-life speech in the censorship zones, it allowed abortion facility employees to shout down and speak over pro-life sidewalk counselors.\nThis clearly violates the freedom of speech, and it contradicts Supreme Court precedent from  McCullen v. Coakley. In that case, the Court unanimously struck down a similar law in Massachusetts, saying that it violated the First Amendment rights of sidewalk counselor Eleanor McCullen.\nThat\u2019s why Alliance Defending Freedom  filed a lawsuit\u00a0against the City of Pittsburgh.\nCase timeline\n\nSeptember 2014: ADF attorneys  first challenged\u00a0the Pittsburgh law in federal court.\nMarch 2015: The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania refused to halt the unfair law\u00a0and partially dismissed the lawsuit. So, ADF attorneys  appealed the decision\u00a0to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\nJune 2016: The Third Circuit said that  the lower court had failed to follow Supreme Court precedent. The court even said in its opinion that the Pittsburgh law \u201cimposes the same kind of burden on speech\u201d as the Massachusetts law struck down by the Supreme Court in McCullen.\nNovember 2017: Despite the Third Circuit opinion, the lower court issued another ruling  upholding Pittsburgh\u2019s anti-free speech zones.\nJanuary 2018: ADF attorneys  appealed to the Third Circuit\u00a0again.\nFebruary 2019: Oral arguments\u00a0for the case were held.\nOctober 2019: The Third Circuit  issued its ruling. While the court recognized the constitutional problems with Pittsburgh\u2019s law, it claimed to  narrow the law\u00a0to say that the ban doesn\u2019t apply to sidewalk counseling, only prayer or standing quietly while holding a sign or wearing buttons. It then upheld the ban as constitutional.\nMarch 2020: ADF  asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear this case, because federal courts can\u2019t simply rewrite local laws to save them from unconstitutionality.\nJanuary 2021: The Supreme Court  denied our petition, leaving the ruling from the Third Circuit in place.\n\nOutcome\nEvery American has the God-given right to speak freely, including pro-life counselors.\n\u201cThe government can\u2019t silence speakers just because it doesn\u2019t like what they have to say,\u201d  said ADF Senior Counsel and Vice President of Appellate Advocacy John Bursch.\n\u201cWhile we are pleased that Pittsburgh\u2019s ordinance can\u2019t be enforced against pro-life sidewalk counselors, the city shouldn\u2019t be allowed to carve out space on public sidewalks and declare that certain topics and forms of speech are off limits there. As the Supreme Court declared as recently as 2018 in  another ADF case, \u2018the people lose when the government is the one deciding which ideas should prevail.\u2019\u201d\nThe bottom line\nEvery American has the right to speak on public sidewalks\u2014including pro-life sidewalk counselors.\nLearn more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
