Senate Bill 10, sponsored by Democratic Senator Linda Lopez (District 11-Bernalillo) and others, would strike an entire section of law that among other things protects medical professionals from being forced to participate in abortions and requires that abortions be performed by licensed physicians.\n\u201cThough some of the existing law is unenforceable because of\u00a0Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals,\u201d said Senator Gregg Schmedes (District 19-Bernalillo, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Torrance).\u201d As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans.\u201d\nThe current law includes protections from recriminatory action when a hospital or their staff decline to perform abortions based on \u201cmoral or religious grounds.\u201d In 1973, the New Mexico Court of Appeals declared this section of the law to be constitutional and a 1990 New Mexico Attorney General Opinion further reiterated its constitutionality.\n\u201cA total repeal of New Mexico\u2019s abortion law is not the solution,\u201d added Senator Crystal Diamond (District 35-Dona Ana, Hidalgo, Luna, and Sierra). \u201cIn addition to keeping the conscience clause intact, we should be working to strengthen, not weaken standards of care for women. The thought that a non-physician would be allowed to perform a dangerous, late-term abortion on a minor child without any parental knowledge is unconscionable. That is the type of scenario we are exposing women to if this bill passes.\u201d\nSenate Bill 10 advanced from the Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on a 5-3 vote with all three Republican Senators, Gregg Schmedes, David Gallegos, and Stuart Ingle, voting in opposition. The bill will now be referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee where it could be heard as early as next week.\nShare this:TweetEmailPrintLike this:Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n \n\n\nLegislature\nPolitics\nState \n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPublished by Los Alamos Reporter \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tView all posts by Los Alamos Reporter\t\t\t\n\n\n\nPost navigation\nPrevious Legislature: Historically Underutilized Business Opportunity Act Unanimously Passes In House CommitteeNext NM Medicaid Works With Providers To Address Hiccups With New Federal Electronic Verification Requirements And More\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\nFollow Blog via Email\n\n\nEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n2020 Census (11)\n\nArts (1,537)\n\nBandelier National Monument (259)\n\nBirth Announcements (41)\n\nBusiness (1,656)\n\nCampaign 2020 (211)\n\nCOVID-19 (4)\n\n\n\nCampaign 2022 (170)\n\nCampaign 2024 (5)\n\nChamber of Commerce (184)\n\nCommentary (605)\n\nCommunity (14,460)\n\nCourts (691)\n\nCOVID-19, Coronavirus (1,893)\n\nDepartment of Energy (831)\n\nEconomic Development (255)\n\nEducation (3,377)\n\nEmployment (178)\n\nEngagement/Wedding (48)\n\nEntertainment (606)\n\nEnvironment (1,828)\n\nEquity (14)\n\nFBI (98)\n\nFire Department (373)\n\nFishing Report (38)\n\nFood/Dining (334)\n\nHealthcare (1,000)\n\nHistory (321)\n\nKiwanis (72)\n\nLeague of Women Voters (109)\n\nLegislature (615)\n\nLetter to the Editor (612)\n\nLos Alamos County (3,888)\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (1,549)\n\nLos Alamos Police Department (1,009)\n\nLos Alamos Public Schools (1,646)\n\nMilitary (146)\n\nNation (197)\n\nNew Mexico State Police (212)\n\nObituary (408)\n\nPajarito Environmental Education Center (183)\n\nPerforming Arts (354)\n\nPolitics (1,377)\n\nPublic Safety (1,152)\n\nRegion (2,647)\n\nRegional Coalition (99)\n\nRotary Club of Los Alamos (70)\n\nScience (817)\n\nSeniors (167)\n\nSheriff (38)\n\nSnow Delays (52)\n\nSpiritual (241)\n\nSports and Recreation (1,203)\n\nState (2,641)\n\nUncategorized (6,986)\n\nValles Caldera National Preserve (79)\n\nVeterans (158)\n\nWildlife (202)\n\nWorld (53)\n\nYouth (692)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nArchives\n\nMarch 2024\u00a0(152)\nFebruary 2024\u00a0(175)\nJanuary 2024\u00a0(172)\nDecember 2023\u00a0(187)\nNovember 2023\u00a0(215)\nOctober 2023\u00a0(265)\nSeptember 2023\u00a0(193)\nAugust 2023\u00a0(207)\nJuly 2023\u00a0(222)\nJune 2023\u00a0(208)\nMay 2023\u00a0(289)\nApril 2023\u00a0(261)\nMarch 2023\u00a0(317)\nFebruary 2023\u00a0(278)\nJanuary 2023\u00a0(259)\nDecember 2022\u00a0(235)\nNovember 2022\u00a0(311)\nOctober 2022\u00a0(400)\nSeptember 2022\u00a0(316)\nAugust 2022\u00a0(330)\nJuly 2022\u00a0(289)\nJune 2022\u00a0(331)\nMay 2022\u00a0(403)\nApril 2022\u00a0(314)\nMarch 2022\u00a0(344)\nFebruary 2022\u00a0(332)\nJanuary 2022\u00a0(313)\nDecember 2021\u00a0(272)\nNovember 2021\u00a0(276)\nOctober 2021\u00a0(372)\nSeptember 2021\u00a0(297)\nAugust 2021\u00a0(252)\nJuly 2021\u00a0(304)\nJune 2021\u00a0(319)\nMay 2021\u00a0(356)\nApril 2021\u00a0(340)\nMarch 2021\u00a0(400)\nFebruary 2021\u00a0(373)\nJanuary 2021\u00a0(335)\nDecember 2020\u00a0(262)\nNovember 2020\u00a0(284)\nOctober 2020\u00a0(361)\nSeptember 2020\u00a0(292)\nAugust 2020\u00a0(266)\nJuly 2020\u00a0(302)\nJune 2020\u00a0(273)\nMay 2020\u00a0(362)\nApril 2020\u00a0(317)\nMarch 2020\u00a0(364)\nFebruary 2020\u00a0(220)\nJanuary 2020\u00a0(154)\nDecember 2019\u00a0(160)\nNovember 2019\u00a0(171)\nOctober 2019\u00a0(262)\nSeptember 2019\u00a0(219)\nAugust 2019\u00a0(195)\nJuly 2019\u00a0(183)\nJune 2019\u00a0(194)\nMay 2019\u00a0(221)\nApril 2019\u00a0(227)\nMarch 2019\u00a0(167)\nFebruary 2019\u00a0(173)\nJanuary 2019\u00a0(130)\nDecember 2018\u00a0(83)\nNovember 2018\u00a0(110)\nOctober 2018\u00a0(128)\nSeptember 2018\u00a0(39)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLos Alamos Reporter: The News from Los Alamos and Beyond \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover more from Los Alamos Reporter\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tType your email\u2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWrite a Comment...\n\n\n\n\nEmail (Required)\n\n\n\nName (Required)\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%d\n\n\n"
