They speak with a 43-year-old mother, a teenage girl and a woman short on cash \u2014 all seeking help from the Chicago Abortion Fund (CAF), which offers financial, logistical and emotional support to people seeking abortion services. The hotline is open three days a week.  As Shariyf talks through logistics, a woman on the other end of the line explains why she is calling an organization in Illinois to help pay for an abortion. \u201cBecause in Iowa, I\u2019m not sure if you know we don\u2019t really have a right to say we want an abortion,\u201d said the woman, who explained that she was five weeks pregnant and had little money to pay for an abortion. The woman is wrong. Abortion is legal in all 50 states. But Iowa briefly had the most restrictive abortion limit in the country \u2014 no abortions, if a fetal heartbeat is detected. Last year, an Iowa state judge struck down that law.  \n        RELATED STORY\n         \n        Chicago Area Doulas Discuss Reproductive Justice at Home and Abroad\n         \n    read more\n          CAF committed $325 to help cover the woman\u2019s costs to have an abortion in Illinois. Women travel from all over the country to have abortions in Illinois. As neighboring states restrict abortion access, Illinois is seen as a haven that protects access. And that protection is largely due to the efforts of a strong and long-standing reproductive justice community in Illinois that has also worked to change the narrative on abortion rights. The number of abortions for out-of-state residents has been on the rise in Illinois. In 2014, there were 2,970 such terminated pregnancies. In 2018, there were 5,668, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. \u201cThe problem is that, in the states surrounding Illinois, you have mandatory counseling requirements. You have waiting periods. You have restrictions,\u201d Jeyifo said. \u201cIf you have two appointments in Wisconsin, for instance, you have to see the same doctor.\u201d  For some women outside of Illinois, even if they have access to care in their home state, \u201cthey\u2019ll choose to come here because it\u2019s quicker and less expensive,\u201d Jeyifo said. The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization, tracks state abortion laws. It found that, between 2011 and 2019, states enacted 483 new abortion restrictions. The most common \u2014 enacted by many states in the Midwest \u2014 are parental notification or consent requirements for minors, mandated counseling and mandated waiting periods before an abortion. In Indiana, private insurance policies cover abortion only in cases of life endangerment, rape, incest or if the woman\u2019s health is severely compromised, unless individuals purchase an optional rider at an additional cost. In Ohio, 93% of counties have no clinics that provide abortions. In Missouri, the waiting period is 72 hours. Last year, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that effectively keeps abortion legal in Illinois, even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. While most states ban Medicaid from paying for abortions through the Hyde Amendment, two years ago Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner overturned that in Illinois. As Illinois became stronger and shored up access to care, CAF saw an uptick in out-of-state callers \u2014 from 15% of all callers to 55%. For Jeyifo, the work of CAF is personal. She has a totebag that reads \u201cF--- your abortion ban.\u201d \u201cPart of my abortion experience that was so difficult is I had a nurse that said something horrible to me,\u201d Jeyifo said when asked why she does this work. \u201cSomeone who gave care like this everyday and she still felt it was okay to say a really stigmatizing, demeaning thing to a 16-year-old girl who was alone like half-clothed on a table. And I think I\u2019ve carried that throughout my whole life.\u201d \u201cWhen I found out that abortion funds exist and that they affirm abortion care as healthcare, it was transformative for my own experience,\u201d Jeyifo added.      Megan Jeyifo and Qudsiyyah Shariyf make phone calls to clients at the South Loop offices of the Chicago Abortion Fund on Feb. 19, 2020. Manuel Martinez / WBEZ NewsAnd in a political climate where the U.S. Supreme Court is viewed by many as conservative-leaning and open to restricting access to abortions, CAF has seen an uptick in funding \u2014 leading to a 349% increase in the number of people it\u2019s helped in just a year.\n\u201cRoe means nothing to people who don\u2019t have money for their abortion or who have to take a three-hour bus ride and don\u2019t have bus fare for their abortion. Or who live in communities where abortion is so stigmatized,\u201d Jeyifo said. This is the mentality of reproductive justice, which is a movement started here in Chicago back in 1994. Toni Bond and 11 black women coined the term during a pro-choice conference. The core principles are the right to have a child, the right not to have a child and the right to parent in a healthy environment. \u201cThe beauty of the reproductive justice framework is the way that it looks at things much more expansively,\u201d said Bond. Bond, who now lives in California, was the first black woman to lead CAF. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just about physical access to an abortion. But it\u2019s also about what are those other interlocking issues that make it a challenge for someone to get an abortion, particularly women of color, low-income women and young women,\u201d Bond said. Back in the 1990s, when Bond was doing her work, \u201ckeep abortion safe, legal and rare\u201d was a popular Democratic tagline. Today, in her downtown office, Illinois Planned Parenthood CEO Jennifer Welch wears a bright pink T-shirt with another message. \u201cOne of the reasons why my T-shirt says \u2018protect safe and legal abortion\u2019 is because I don\u2019t want to stigmatize a patient for choosing the medical care that they need,\u201d Welch said. \u201cWe trust a woman or a patient to make their choices about when and whether to have children. Talking about abortion being \u2018safe, legal and rare\u2019 may perpetuate the stigma.\u201d  Messaging is important for those invested in protecting abortion rights and, even as Illinois is regarded as a haven, activists still fight stigma. Yamani Herndanez wears a shirt that reads \u201ceveryone loves someone who\u2019s had an abortion.\u201d It\u2019s a membership shirt for the organzation she runs, National Network of Abortion Funds, the umbrella organization for groups like CAF. It\u2019s also a reflection of how common abortion is today. Nearly 1 in every 4 women will have an abortion by the age of 45, according to a 2017 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cWe do political education with folks, teach them about reproductive justice, racial justice, economic justice. If you listen to anti-choice people, they\u2019ll have you thinking that abortion is something that only people who hate children do and people who are irresponsible and we know from listening to people on hotlines that most of the people who have abortions are already parents,\u201d Hernandez said. Years ago, Hernandez led a youth program in Humboldt Park when she met a 14-year-old teen mom. Hernandez said the girl asked other youth to beat her up for $10. The girl was pregnant again, and she said her parents would kick her out. She said it was easier to explain getting beat up than to explain having an abortion. Hernandez called a friend for help and that\u2019s when she learned about CAF. \u201cThat was a life-changing experience for me,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI had an abortion at 19. I didn\u2019t have any barriers to access,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cBut this really helped me understand about reproductive justice. And she was navigating her youth, housing and safety concerns.\u201d Hernandez said political education means astute communication and storytelling. And humanizing people. \u201cNo matter how you feel about abortion, you do know someone who had an abortion and you probably love somebody who\u2019s had an abortion, even if they didn\u2019t tell you yet,\u201d Hernandez said. For the Illinois anti-abortion community, they, too say that want to use compassion when spreading their message. \u201cIt is much harder to be pro-life than to be anything else in this country,\u201d said Mary Kate Knorr, the executive director of Illinois Right to Life. For the pro-life community in Illinois, she said there\u2019s one area left to defend: the parental notification law. The law doesn\u2019t require parental consent for minors. It requires that a healthcare provider notify an adult family member at least 48 hours prior to an abortion procedure \u2014 or get a pass from a judge to not notify an adult. \u201cDemocrats in the state legislature want to appeal that law and that\u2019s considered by the standards of Planned Parenthood \u2026 the last restriction on the books in the state,\u201d Knorr said. For Planned Parenthood and other advocates, yes, it is considered the last restriction on the books. And one they want to eliminate.
