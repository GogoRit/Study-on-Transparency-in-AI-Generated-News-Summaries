Many high school and college students joined in the rally.\nTrump, seeking re-election on November 3, addressed the event in the midst of his impeachment trial in the US Senate on charges passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. While not mentioning impeachment, he assailed congressional Democrats on abortion policy. Trump drew loud applause from the crowd.\nAmong his most loyal political supporters are evangelical Christians, who strongly oppose abortion rights. The event took on aspects of a campaign rally, with Trump lashing out at his political opponents and some in the crowd chanting \u201cFour more years!\u201d\n\nAnti-abortion rights activists carry a banner during the 47th annual March for Life in Washington, DC [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]\u00a0\n\nTrump, who years earlier had supported abortion rights, cast himself as a committed abortion opponent on religious grounds.\n\u201cWe know that every human soul is divine and ever human life, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of almighty God,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump pledged during the 2016 presidential campaign to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v Wade.\nAbortion remains one of the most divisive issues in the US. About 58 percent of US adults say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last year.\nPast US presidents have opted to stay away from the march, though Republicans Ronald Reagan and George W Bush both previously delivered remarks to the rally remotely.\nRoe v Wade\nThe Supreme Court on March 4 will hear arguments in a major case concerning the legality of abortion clinic regulations in Louisiana that could lead to new curbs on access to the procedure.\nThe case will test the willingness of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority that includes Trump\u2019s two appointees, to uphold Republican-backed abortion restrictions being pursued in numerous conservative states.\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy organisation, more than 55 abortion restrictions were passed in state legislatures last year. Many of these restrictions were blocked by the courts. Anti-abortion rights activists and politicians say their goal is to get the Supreme Court to reconsider the Roe v Wade decision.\u00a0\nMore than 140 measures were implemented in 2019 that improve sexual and reproductive health.\nSome at the rally on Friday held signs with slogans including \u201cMost Pro-Life President Ever,\u201d \u201cStop Killing Babies\u201d and \u201cI Am The Pro-Life Generation.\u201d\nMany were from religious groups and conservative nonprofit organisations.\nAmong them was Anne Fitzgerald, 44, who said that at age 21 she gave up her daughter for adoption so she could finish college. She now runs Days of Tears, a Virginia nonprofit that advocates against abortion, and said she was marching to help women recognise \u201cthat in the moment of a decision between raising or aborting a child, adoption is a viable option.\u201d\nFitzgerald said she was at first sceptical of Trump\u2019s stance on abortion, but is proud he turned out to be \u201cstrong ally\u201d.\nTrump delivered remarks by video at the 2019 march. Vice President Mike Pence attended the event in person last year.\nA \u2018war\u2019 on women\nOutside the Supreme Court, anti-abortion rights demonstrators in the march were met by abortion rights activists, some of whom held signs saying \u201cKeep abortion safe and legal\u201d and \u201cSafe abortion is a human right.\u201d There were also some activists backing Trump\u2019s removal from office.\nEmily Goodman, 33, who stood with several fellow supporters of abortion rights during the march, said the event \u201creeks of a form of religious fundamentalism\u201d.\n\u201cWhat the pro-life advocates seem to be focused on is bussing in young people with signs to declare that their side of the argument is right and no other opinion matters,\u201d said Goodman, who volunteers for a Washington-based nonprofit organisation. \u201cI wish there was a conversation today, involving two sides, focused on a woman\u2019s ability to both hold her view on abortion yet not impose that view onto another.\u201d\n\nPro- and anti-abortion rights activists demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court during the 47th annual March for Life [Oliver Douliery/AFP]\u00a0\n\nRights groups have accused the Trump administration of waging a war against women\u2019s rights and reproductive health by reinstating and expanding the global gag rule, appointing anti-abortion rights activists to key posts in federal departments dealing with women\u2019s health and seeking to cut Title X funding to health providers that perform abortions or make abortion referrals.\nEarlier this week, his administration announced new visa restrictions on pregnant women to combat \u201cbirth tourism\u201d.\nIt is unclear how the rule will be enforced as immigration officials cannot ask during visa interviews whether a woman is pregnant or intends to become so.\nMany supported the rule, but critics slammed it, saying targeting pregnant women was \u201ca new low\u201d.\nSource: Al Jazeera, News Agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
