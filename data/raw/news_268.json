Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n      \n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Standing in front of the US Supreme Court on Wednesday morning, Dennis McKirahan was in a hopeful mood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day,\u201d he said, glancing at the blue sky. \u201cThe sun is shining in me and outside.\u201d\nHe and around a dozen other activists were with the group Shofar Call International, a Christian group that blows a horn typically used in Jewish ceremonies called the shofar as part of anti-abortion demonstrations and religious events. \u201cIn Hebrew the Shofar is also referred to as the Bat Kol or the Voice of Heaven,\u201d the group\u2019s website states. \u201cWhen the enemy hears the Voice of Heaven being proclaimed in the earth, he trembles in fear.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the horns had the effect of partially drowning out the speakers in the abortion-rights rally, organized by the Center for Reproductive Rights and other groups, taking place across the street.\nIn fact, the sidewalks outside of the Supreme Court were bustling with hundreds of activists on both sides of the issue shouting and waving signs on the morning justices were to hear oral arguments in a case that has the potential to transform abortion law in America. \nJune Medical Services v. Russo concerns a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local clinic. Louisiana legislators and abortion opponents say the measure is meant to protect patients. But abortion-rights advocates argue that such laws have no medical purpose and are simply aimed at creating more red tape to ultimately shut clinics down. And if the Supreme Court upholds the Louisiana law, clinics not just in Louisiana but around the country could close as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first abortion case to be argued before the Supreme Court since President Trump\u2019s nominees Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch joined the bench, solidifying a conservative majority.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion demonstrators were outnumbered by abortion-rights protesters outside the Supreme Court, but they were vocal. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the Louisiana law, abortion clinics around the country could close.\n\n\n\n\n\nRestrictions in Louisiana and elsewhere are \u201cjust pushing abortion out of reach for people, and specifically for people who are already struggling to make ends meet,\u201d Ravina Daphtary, director of state strategies at the abortion-access advocacy group All* Above All, told me outside the courthouse on Wednesday. \nWhile the Court won\u2019t issue a decision in the case until this summer, the optimism among anti-abortion activists \u2014 and the concern among abortion-rights supporters \u2014 on Wednesday reflected a larger reality: In many ways, abortion opponents have already won when it comes to restricting the procedure around the country. In the last 10 years, a wave of new laws have closed clinics across the South and Midwest \u2014 Louisiana today has just three clinics, and six other states have just one. \nMeanwhile, President Trump has repeatedly delivered on anti-abortion priorities, including enacting a rule last year barring health care providers that refer or provide abortions from getting federal family planning funds. \nOverall, McKirahan believes the country is moving toward an end to abortion: \u201cthere\u2019s great things happening,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause God is moving people and stirring their hearts to change.\u201d\nIt\u2019s one thing both abortion-rights activists and abortion opponents in front of the Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed on: While Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land for now, the landmark 1973 decision is hanging by a thread. And regardless of what happens in June Medical Services v. Russo, that thread is getting thinner and thinner.\nAbortion opponents are essentially getting a redo of a 2016 case\nIn a way, the fact that the Louisiana law is before the Supreme Court again at all is a victory for abortion opponents. In the 2016 case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Court struck down a nearly identical Texas measure. At that time, the Court found that the Texas law did not provide enough benefit to patients to justify the barriers to access it created \u2014 namely, the closure of more than half the clinics in the state.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter for Reproductive Rights senior litigation director Julie Rikelman (center) and president Nancy Northrup (right) leave the Supreme Court after oral arguments. \nAlyssa Schukar/Center for Reproductive Rights via AP\n\n\n\nThat decision slowed states\u2019 efforts to pass admitting-privileges laws. But Louisiana had already passed one, in 2014. Hope Medical Group (whose corporate name is June Medical Services) challenged the law, but in 2018, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld it. Hope appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court, and last year, the Court agreed to take the case. \nEssentially, abortion opponents in Louisiana were given an opportunity for a redo of Whole Woman\u2019s Health. But this time, thanks to Trump\u2019s nomination of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, many believe the majority of justices on the Court take a favorable view of abortion restrictions.\nHope and many abortion-rights advocates argue that the Fifth Circuit violated Supreme Court precedent by upholding the Louisiana law \u2014 that, in essence, we shouldn\u2019t be here at all.\n\u201cThe feeling in the courtroom was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is arguing the case on behalf of Hope, told reporters after the oral arguments on Wednesday. \u201cIt is not right that we have to be here re-fighting a legal battle that we have already won.\u201d \nSome of the justices seemed to feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as well. The state of Louisiana argues that admitting privileges are important in part because requiring them is a way of credentialing doctors, weeding out the ones who are underqualified. But Justice Elena Kagan noted that the Court had already rejected that argument in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, finding that in Texas, admitting privileges are granted or denied for reasons having nothing to do with whether a doctor is qualified (often abortion providers are unable to obtain privileges simply because so few of their patients ever go to a hospital \u2014 which is one reason why abortion-rights advocates say these requirements are unnecessary). \n\u201cIt was true in Texas and it\u2019s true here,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cIt seems that Whole Woman\u2019s Health precludes you from making this credentialing argument, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \nEven Chief Justice John Roberts, seen on today\u2019s Court as a swing vote on abortion issues, seemed skeptical of the state of Louisiana\u2019s case, as Vox\u2019s Ian Millhiser reports. Louisiana argues that its law does not violate Whole Woman\u2019s Health because the medical and legal landscapes are different. But Roberts twice seemed to question this argument, asking at one point why each state should be treated differently if the purported benefits to patients of admitting privileges laws (which the Court had previously found were not enough to justify the burdens) are the same everywhere.\nJustice Samuel Alito, however, focused his questions on another issue in the case: whether clinics like Hope should be allowed to challenge abortion laws, or whether patients should be the ones to do so. The state of Louisiana and anti-abortion groups have argued that clinics and doctors just want to avoid regulation and don\u2019t have their patients\u2019 best interests at heart, and Alito seemed sympathetic, peppering Julie Rikelman, the attorney arguing the case for the Center for Reproductive Rights, with questions about situations where doctors\u2019 and patients\u2019 interests might be in conflict. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nGetting an abortion in \u201cthe most pro-life state in America\u201d\n\nIf the justices do decide to uphold the Louisiana law, two of the state\u2019s remaining clinics, including Hope, could close. And abortion-rights advocates fear more would follow around the country, as more states pass admitting-privileges laws and other restrictions on clinics. Meanwhile, if the Court decides that abortion clinics don\u2019t have the standing to challenge abortion laws, those laws could become much harder to fight \u2014 and more could stay on the books, even if they might be unconstitutional.\nNo one will know exactly what the justices are thinking until they issue a decision this summer, and many abortion-rights advocates hold out hope that the Court may strike down the Louisiana law.\n\u201cWe were here before, four years ago, discussing the very same law and were able to successfully show the true intent of these terrible bills,\u201d Daphtary of All* Above All told me.\nBut many in the anti-abortion movement are bullish about Louisiana\u2019s chances. \u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic,\u201d Alexandra Seghers, director of education at the group Louisiana Right to Life, told me, saying that Louisiana was \u201csuch a different landscape\u201d from Texas.\n\u201cAnd of course the Supreme Court is a different landscape,\u201d she added.\nAnd while some heard Roberts\u2019s questions as a bad sign for the Louisiana law, Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel for the group Americans United for Life, which filed an amicus brief in the case, told me by phone that he \u201cdid not sense any skepticism by the Chief Justice\u201d on Wednesday.\nThe Court is likely to make a narrow decision in the case, he said \u2014 there\u2019s no indication that the justices will use it to overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that established the right to an abortion in America.\nBut the decision could still have an impact on abortion laws around the country. \u201cIn prior cases when the Court has upheld an abortion regulation, many states have moved ahead to pass similar regulations,\u201d Forsythe said.\nThis case, and this law, are likely to be no different.\nAbortion restrictions have whittled away access around the country\nBut anti-abortion groups\u2019 optimism \u2014 and abortion-rights advocates\u2019 fears \u2014 go far beyond June Medical Services v. Russo.\nWhile abortion remains legal in all 50 states, it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to access, especially for low-income Americans. \u201cEven if the Court strikes down the Louisiana law, there are still going to be a lot of people who still don\u2019t really have access to abortion,\u201d Monica Edwards, federal policy manager at the group Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE), told me as she watched the abortion-rights rally on Wednesday.\nA lot of the reason for that is restrictions on abortion doctors and clinics, which have proliferated since Republicans took control of statehouses around the country in 2010. Since then, the South and Midwest have lost more than 80 clinics, leaving many people hundreds of miles from the nearest facility where they can get an abortion. \nIn the years since 2010, many states have also passed laws requiring an ultrasound and a 24-hour waiting period before a patient can get an abortion, making the procedure more time-consuming and expensive for patients who now have to take two long trips to a clinic instead of one. Those laws \u201creally keep the most marginalized \u2014 specifically people of color, queer and trans folks \u2014 out of the ability to access care,\u201d Edwards said.\nMeanwhile, since the election of Trump, states around the country have imposed blanket bans on abortion, with six states last year banning it six weeks into pregnancy, or even earlier. All of those laws have been blocked in court, but states around the country continue to move to restrict abortion.\nFlorida, for example, recently passed a law requiring minors to get parental consent before an abortion, and legislators in Utah have proposed a bill that would ban abortion automatically if Roe is overturned. Eight states already have similar laws on the books. \n\u201cThey\u2019re coming in fast because God is moving,\u201d McKirahan said of the measures in Florida, Utah, and elsewhere.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlise Daigle, 31, stands in silent protest alongside her husband Christopher, 28. The Boston couple are protesting with Bound4LIFE, a grassroots movement for ending abortion.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abortion-rights rally included speakers from actress and activist Busy Phillips to Representative Rashida Tlaib.\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of abortion rights still see signs of hope. Most Americans understand that access to abortion \u201cis a legal right right now and should stay that way,\u201d Jessica Crabtree, who was attending the abortion-rights rally, told me. Indeed, a majority of Americans, including Republicans, support leaving Roe v. Wade in place.\n\u201cI am concerned that we are heading in a direction that\u2019s going be taking access away from people,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s more likely with crowds like this and with support like this that\u2019s growing, that we won\u2019t actually head in that direction.\u201d \nBut abortion-rights groups and some Democratic legislators are also preparing for a post-Roe reality \u2014 one that, in some states, has already essentially arrived. Those preparations include laws that guarantee the right to an abortion if Roe is overturned, as well as efforts to remove legal penalties for self-managed abortion so that people who do the procedure themselves with medication or herbs are not prosecuted later.\nWhile June Medical Services is unlikely to be the case that does it, many now believe that a showdown over Roe is all but inevitable. \n\u201cThe expectations of the country are clearly moving in the direction of expecting the Court sooner or later to send the abortion issue back to the people,\u201d Forsythe said. \u201cThe Court will sooner or later have to revisit Roe v. Wade.\u201d \nAnd when that happens, the odds are good that Kavanaugh and Gorsuch will still be sitting on the Court. If Trump is reelected in November, he could have the chance to nominate even more justices \u2014 and he has promised to pick justices who would overturn Roe.\nOn abortion, \u201ca lot of people morally think it\u2019s wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong,\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer said during Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments. \u201cI think personally the Court is struggling with the problem of what kind of rule of law do you have in a country that contains both sorts of people.\u201d\nBut advocates on both sides of the issue seem to agree on one thing: as Kate Doyle, attending the rally as part of the reproductive-rights group If/When/How, put it, \u201cRoe is experiencing a death by 1,000 cuts.\u201d\nAnd in many ways, for many Americans, it\u2019s already dead. \n\nMelissa Lyttle is an independent photojournalist based in Washington, DC. \n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
