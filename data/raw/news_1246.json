The ban had been in effect since July.\nIt prohibited most abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d was present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia were effectively banned at a point before many women knew they were pregnant.\nMcBurney\u2019s ruling came in a lawsuit filed in July by doctors and advocacy groups that sought to strike down the ban on multiple grounds, including that it violates the Georgia Constitution\u2019s right to privacy and liberty by forcing pregnancy and childbirth on women in the state. McBurney did not rule on that claim.\nInstead, his decision agreed with a different argument made in the lawsuit \u2014 that the ban was invalid because it violated the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court precedent at the time it became law.\nKara Richardson, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, said in an email that the office intends to pursue an \u201cimmediate appeal.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Voters uphold abortion rights in Michigan, California, Vermont ballot measures\nGeorgia\u2019s law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but had been blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court\u00a0overturned Roe v. Wade,\u00a0which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years.\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Georgia to begin enforcing its abortion law just over three weeks after the high court\u2019s decision in June.\nAbortion clinics in the state remained open, but providers said they were turning many women away because cardiac activity had been detected. Those women could then either travel to another state for an abortion or continue with their pregnancies.\nDuring a two-day trial in October, abortion providers told McBurney the ban was causing distress to women denied the procedure and confusion among doctors.\nMcBurney wrote in his ruling that when the law was enacted, \u201ceverywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments \u2014 federal, state, or local \u2014 to ban abortions before viability.\u201d\nHe wrote that the state\u2019s law \u201cdid not become the law of Georgia when it was enacted and it is not the law of Georgia now.\u201d\nThe state had argued that the Roe decision itself was wrong and the Supreme Court ruling wiped it out of existence.\nMcBurney did leave the door open for the state Legislature to revisit the ban.\nNow that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the prohibition on abortions provided for in the 2019 law \u201cmay someday become the law of Georgia,\u201d he wrote.\nBut, he wrote, that can happen only after the General Assembly \u201cdetermines in the sharp glare of public attention that will undoubtedly and properly attend such an important and consequential debate whether the rights of unborn children justify such a restriction on women\u2019s right to bodily autonomy and privacy.\u201d\nGeorgia\u2019s ban included exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report was filed, and allowed for later abortions when the mother\u2019s life was at risk or a serious medical condition rendered a fetus unviable.\nAt the October trial, witnesses for the state disputed the claim that the law was unclear about when doctors could intervene to perform a later abortion. They also argued that abortions themselves could harm women.\nAbortion was a central issue in Georgia\u2019s U.S. Senate contest between Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, which is now headed to a runoff in December.\u00a0Two women accused Walker, who opposes abortion, of paying for them to have the procedure. Walker vehemently denied that.\nAssociated Press writer Kate Brumback contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights protesters participate in nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v.
