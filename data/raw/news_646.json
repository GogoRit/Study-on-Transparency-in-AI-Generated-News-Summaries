Paul Wieland, could endanger the state\u2019s entire Medicaid program by eliminating a health care service required by federal law, said Senate Minority Leader John Rizzo, D-Independence.\n\u201cI would say on its face that is why the bill got laid over immediately and the panic button was hit because it put us out of compliance in those regards,\u201d Rizzo said.\nWieland said in an interview that he doesn\u2019t intend to dismantle the Medicaid program. But he wants to extend a current ban on using public funds for abortions.\n\u201cMy intent was not to deny Medicaid recipients birth control,\u201d Wieland said. \u201cMy intent was to prevent the state of Missouri from paying for abortions.\u201d\nMissouri uses a tax on hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacies and other medical providers to support the medical program for lower-income residents. Called a reimbursement allowance, the taxes are the major reason general revenue paid only 18.2 percent of the program\u2019s $10.8 billion cost in fiscal 2020.\nThe bill before the Senate, sponsored by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, would extend the expiration date of the taxes for one year. The bill is must-pass legislation for balancing the state budget.\nWieland\u2019s amendment would bar the use of Medicaid funds for any FDA-approved medication or device that would cause \u201cdestruction of, or prevent the implantation of\u201d a fertilized ovum. Those products include levonorgestrel, commonly called the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill and some intrauterine devices, or IUDs.\nLevonorgestrel can prevent fertilization if used soon after intercourse. IUDs are designed to prevent fertilization as well either through spermicidal action or hormonal treatments.\nWhen Wieland offered his amendment, Hegeman said he didn\u2019t like it but wouldn\u2019t fight it.\n\u201cI would like to keep this bill as clean as possible but I respect your passion for what you are interested in here,\u201d Hegeman said during floor debate. \u201cI would like for this not to be on the bill.\u201d\nThere was little other discussion and the amendment passed on a 21-12 vote, with Hegeman and Sen. Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, joining all 10 Democrats in opposition. The bill was immediately set aside after the vote.\nThe impact of Wieland\u2019s amendment was being studied Wednesday afternoon, Hegeman said. He added that he doesn\u2019t know if keeping it in the bill would put the Medicaid program in danger.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are pondering,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to figure out the implications of the amendment and we have not completed that analysis.\u201d\nWieland said he was surprised his amendment passed with no supporters of abortion rights challenging it.\n\u201cI think that people were caught off guard that it went on as easily as it did,\u201d he said.\nThe Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 made birth control an essential health benefit that all insurance plans must provide. Every state Medicaid program must provide the same set of health benefits and failure to do so puts the state out of compliance with federal law.\nBut federal law also bars the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions and Missouri law mirrors that limitation. Wieland said his amendment just emphasizes that the prohibition also covers any method that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, which he said is a human life deserving of protection.\n\u201cIf a device that\u2019s been approved by the FDA kills a human life, that is an abortion,\u201d Wieland said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the rest of the world doesn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d\nA lobbyist who helped work on the language, Sam Lee of Campaign Life Missouri, said he doesn\u2019t think the impact of the amendment on the state\u2019s Medicaid program will be as dire as feared. If the amendment, or some version, is approved, it will likely end up in court, Lee said.\nWith strong anti-abortion sentiment dominating the legislature for decades, every significant step taken to limit access or funding has been challenged in court. In June, for example, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers could not bar Planned Parenthood from being a Medicaid provider just because some of its clinics offer abortions.\nArguing that Missouri would lose federal support for all Medicaid services because of a law banning the program from paying for a particular class of products is extreme, Lee said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a choice of one or the other, either you have the program as it is or you don\u2019t have it at all,\u201d Lee said.\nThe reimbursement allowance bill is not the place to have the debate, Rizzo said.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is a reason why when we pass an FRA bill, we try to do it as clean as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to stay tight to the boundaries to make sure we are not compromising that funding.\u201d\nThe fight over contraceptive care is not new for Wieland. In 2016, he won a lawsuit arguing that he did not have to accept or pay for contraceptive coverage in the state\u2019s health insurance plan for employees.\nThe amendment approved Tuesday was not a surprise, Wieland noted. It was distributed to other Senators three weeks ago in anticipation of the debate.\nAnd, he said, there is time to consider the implications of his amendment and draft language that will keep the state in compliance while achieving his goal.\nThe budget must be passed by May 7 and extending the reimbursement taxes is part of that process.\n\u201cIt is a false choice to me to say we are going to sacrifice unborn children to provide health care to other people,\u201d Wieland said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAbortion amendment puts bill to finance Missouri Medicaid program in limbo\nby Rudi Keller, Missouri Independent March 24, 2021\nAbortion amendment puts bill to finance Missouri Medicaid program in limbo\nby Rudi Keller, Missouri Independent March 24, 2021\n Missouri Senate leadership pulled a bill vital for funding the state\u2019s Medicaid program from floor debate Tuesday after adopting an amendment barring the use of public money for common contraceptive treatments.\nThe amendment, sponsored by Republican Sen.
