(WWMT/Maria Serrano)KALAMAZOO, Mich. \u2014 Hundreds of women and men showed their support for abortion rights outside Grand Rapids City Hall on Saturday.Protest are happening across the country after a recent leaked draft opinion uncovered the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent opposition to Roe v. Wade.The divisive abortion rights issues were also being reflected in Grand Rapids.Pro-choice protesters were on one side of city hall, and pro-life protesters on another.There were only a few counter protesters from a collective of churches, compared to the hundreds rallying in support of abortion rights.Pro-choice protesters said abortion should be a woman\u2019s choice, not the government\u2019s business.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, that\u2019s something that should be taken away and something that should be in the hands of men who aren\u2019t living our life every day,\u201d Stephanie Meyer said.The crowds said the right to have an abortion shouldn\u2019t be up for discussion or debate.\u201cI feel like there\u2019s so many bigger issues in the world, so why are we focusing on putting laws on women\u2019s bodies,\u201d Alyssa Waid said.  \u201cThere\u2019s a pandemic, a war, formula shortage right as we speak.\u201dA pro-life crowd at the rally said they disagreed with abortion.\u201cWe have to love all people not just people who are born, we have to be consistent about that,\u201d said Jordan, who did not reveal his last name.Jordan and his group said abortion is murder, and they attended the rally to bring the gospel to pro-choice protestors.\u201cHoping that they will receive the lord Jesus Christ and be saved, we care about them,\u201d Jordan said.\u201cDon\u2019t choose death, choose life,\u201d Derek said.Keith Arteaga said he spent his Saturday with his family at the rally.\u201cI\u2019ve got a daughter that\u2019s of reproductive age and I\u2019d be horrified if she had a pregnancy that she didn\u2019t want and the government forced to go through nine months of bodily and hormonal change,\u201d Arteaga said.Arteaga said the personal beliefs of the opposite side are fine for their own purposes, but it shouldn\u2019t be forced upon other people.\u201cEven people that believe in it, it\u2019s still a very difficult and traumatic choice,  but they should still have that choice,\u201d Arteaga said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be decided by somebody else.\u201dThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was not expected until June or early July.Follow Maria Serrano on Facebook and Twitter.
