She is quoted in the article in National Review.\n\u201cOn\u00a0the steps of the Supreme Court on Wednesday morning, hundreds of demonstrators gathered as the justices heard oral arguments in\u00a0June Medical Services v. Russo, the first abortion-related case on the docket since Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the Court.\nThe case was brought by abortion providers against the state of Louisiana, challenging a law that requires them to maintain admitting privileges at a local hospital so women can get emergency care if necessary after a failed abortion procedure. Louisiana law currently requires the same of all other ambulatory surgical centers in the state; the Unsafe Abortion Protection Act aims to hold abortionists to the same standard.\nSources who attended oral arguments told\u00a0National Review\u00a0that seven of the nine justices asked questions. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch were the two who did not.\nOutside the Court, meanwhile, both the abortion-rights movement and pro-life advocates hosted rallies all morning, standing right beside each other underneath a perfectly blue and sunny sky, the abortion-rights crowd swathed in teal and the pro-lifers in a lighter shade of blue.\n\u201cMy right, my decision,\u201d read most of the signs on the pro-choice side. The signs were printed, and the rally coordinated, by the Center for Reproductive Rights, the abortion-advocacy group that argued against the Louisiana law this morning, representing June Medical Services and two unnamed abortionists.\nOne of the most prominent speakers for the abortion-rights rally was Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who directed part of his remarks at Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. \u201cThey\u2019re taking away fundamental rights,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won\u2019t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\u201d\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) also addressed the pro-choice crowd, opening her remarks by suggesting that \u201cthey are obsessed with our bodies,\u201d as well as that abortion is an issue of \u201ceconomic justice\u201d and \u201cracial justice.\u201d\n\u201cWe have every frickin\u2019 right to fight for our lives and our bodies,\u201d Tlaib said. Most of the remarks from speakers at the pro-choice rally didn\u2019t touch on the substance of the Louisiana law at all, or they falsely claimed that it was intended to restrict access to abortion. But in fact, in a decision upholding the statute last fall, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that \u201cthe only permissible finding, under this record, is that no clinics will likely be forced to close on account of the Act.\u201d\nMuch of the abortion-rights rally centered around common slogans such as permitting or trusting women to control their own bodies.\nA poster that one of the abortion-rights demonstrators held read, \u201cHey Kavanaugh, keep your religion out of my health care. And yea, we still believe Dr. Blasey Ford.\u201d Another, much larger sign said, \u201cThank God for abortion.\u201d\nOn the pro-life side of the divide, meanwhile, most signs read, \u201cProtect women, protect life.\u201d The remarks from the slate of speakers in defense of Louisiana\u2019s law focused almost entirely on the law itself, as well as the goal of ensuring that women are able to get emergency care.\nKatrina Jackson, the Louisiana Democrat who sponsored the Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, addressed the pro-life crowd after exiting the Court following the hearing. \u201cFor so long, this nation has put the abortion industry before the health and safety of the women,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe will no longer be quiet, because we love the child, and we love the woman. And Louisiana is all about love, even when someone doesn\u2019t agree with us,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cWe seek to protect them in their decisions. We seek to hold others accountable, and especially when a billion-dollar industry makes money off of that woman\u2019s decision, they should be held accountable just as other doctors who treat us for other things.\u201d\nOne young woman from Louisiana, who serves as a campus leader for Concerned Women for America, spoke to the group close to the end of the rally. \u201cTwenty-two years ago, my mom went to a Louisiana Planned Parenthood seeking to know what her options were because she was in a crisis pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had no support from anybody in my family or from my biological father. They told her that my life was not worth anything and that her only option was to abort me, that she would not be successful in life, that she could not get an education, and that I would essentially ruin her life. Twenty-two years later, I think she begs to differ.\u201d\u201d\nRead the Entire Article in National Review Here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweets by CWforA  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT \n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE DO\nCAREERS\nCWA INTERNSHIPS\nCONTACT CWA\n \n\nWHAT WE DO\nCAREERS\nCWA INTERNSHIPS\nCONTACT CWA\n \n\n\n\n\nTRENDING ISSUES \n\n\n\n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\nSO YOU THINK YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?\nSTANDING WITH FEMALE ATHLETES\nPROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN\n \n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\nSO YOU THINK YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?\nSTANDING WITH FEMALE ATHLETES\nPROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES    \n\n\n\n\nELECTION RESOURCES\nCWA ACADEMY FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES\nCWA PUBLICATIONS\nSTORE\n \n\nELECTION RESOURCES\nCWA ACADEMY FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES\nCWA PUBLICATIONS\nSTORE\n \n\n\n\n\nMEDIA \n\n\n\n\nPenny Nance\nPRESS RELEASES\nPODCASTS\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\n \n\nPenny Nance\nPRESS RELEASES\nPODCASTS\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\n \n\n\n\n\nGRASSROOTS ENGAGEMENT \n\n\n\n\nCONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA\nWOMEN FOR AMERICA INFLUENCERS\nYOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA\n \n\nCONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA\nWOMEN FOR AMERICA INFLUENCERS\nYOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDONATE \n\n\n\n\nDONATE TODAY\nDEBORAH\u2019S ARMY\nLEGACY GIVING\n \n\nDONATE TODAY\nDEBORAH\u2019S ARMY\nLEGACY GIVING\n \n\n\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 CWALAC.
