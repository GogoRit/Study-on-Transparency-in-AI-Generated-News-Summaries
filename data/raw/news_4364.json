The crusade to make birth control safe, effective, and widely available has been raging for more than a century. In the early 1900s, contraception was taboo (as were all discussions of reproduction and sexuality). The few birth control methods that existed on the market were sold as \u201cfeminine hygiene products,\u201d and no one had ever tested them to see if they were effective or safe.\nBy the 1920s, a birth control movement had emerged on the fringes, led by several dedicated social activists. One was Margaret Sanger, future founder of Planned Parenthood. Sanger knew that in order to legitimize her cause, she needed support from scientists.\n\nBiologists were tempted by the promise of using contraception as a means to control human evolution.\n\nIndeed, according to science historian Merrily Borell,  it was biologists who played a key role in giving legitimacy to the the birth control movement. Unfortunately, in the 1920s, the best way to spark a scientist\u2019s interest was with the language of eugenics (which was, at the time, more mainstream than the study of reproductive health). Sanger argued that \u201cbirth control was [\u2026] needed to limit the birth rate of the \u2018unfit,'\u201d writes Borell. As horrifying as it sounds today, Sanger\u2019s eugenics-centric argument worked\u2014biologists were tempted by the promise of using contraception as a means to control human evolution.\nOnce Sanger and other activists proved that birth control could be \u201csocially relevant\u201d (as a form of population control), they were able to employ scientific expertise to push for greater funding and to initiate serious research. Early research focused mainly on spermicides (meant to \u201ceffectively immunize women against sperm\u201d), before bridging into more complex chemical contraceptive methods.\nBy the early 1930s, eugenics had lost some of its shiny appeal (yet another reason to cheer the defeat of the Nazis), and \u201cbiologists had become uncomfortable with those very arguments which had originally captured their interest,\u201d writes Borell. \u201cBiologists further began to recognize, however, that although the hopeful genetic solution to human problems was probably an illusion, contraception still remained one tangible means to alleviate human misery.\u201d With that, \u201cfor a few brief years, social needs and scientific goals were mutually supportive and closely intertwined.\u201d\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet your fix of JSTOR Daily\u2019s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy \u00a0 Contact Us\nYou may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\n\u0394\n\n\n\nGradually, scientific interests shifted. Eventually, writes Borell, \u201cthe scientific issues surrounding fertility and reproduction [\u2026] surpassed that of the reforming value of birth control.\u201d Scientists became so intrigued by the study of reproductive health that they ended up eclipsing the advocates\u2019 original goal (which was the \u201cproduction of a simple, safe, effective, and cheap vaginal contraceptive\u201d). The revolution summarized by geneticist Francis Crew in 1934: \u201cSex and reproduction [were] no longer hedged around by myth and taboo; they [were] no longer accepted as mysteries that defy understanding.\u201d\nBy 1940, scientists had invented the first birth control pill, a sophisticated oral contraceptive that the public widely accepted. Thanks to scientific support, within two decades, birth control advocacy had transformed from a radical cause to a mainstream movement. Let\u2019s hope it stays that way.\n\nSupport JSTOR Daily!
