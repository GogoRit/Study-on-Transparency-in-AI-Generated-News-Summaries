We will never stop fighting. #StopTheBanSC #scpol pic.twitter.com/UjV8YJP1Lo\n\u2014 PP South Atlantic SC (@PPSATSC) February 19, 2021\n\nThe \u201cSouth Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act\u201d is similar to abortion restriction laws that a dozen states have previously passed. All were stopped from taking effect and currently are tied up in court. Federal law, which takes precedence over state law, currently allows abortion.\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s lawyers said South Carolina is \u201copenly flouting this law\u201d.\nThe South Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office said in court papers filed on Friday morning that Planned Parenthood cannot be sure the law will be rejected by the US Supreme Court. With three justices appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, they said, the court could overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision supporting abortion rights.\nAbortion opponents celebrated in the State House lobby outside the House chambers as members gave the bill final approval on Thursday. Standing shoulder to shoulder, they sang \u201cPraise God\u201d to the tune of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d after the Republican governor held up the new law so they could see his signature, signed with eight different pens. The Republican Party tried for years to pass the ban, finally succeeding after the party flipped three Senate seats in 2020.\nThe law requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the foetus, which can typically be detected about six weeks after conception. If one is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\nOpponents of the ban said many women do not know they are pregnant by then, especially if they are not trying to conceive. And with such an early deadline, the law gives women little time to consider whether to have an abortion.\n\u201cThe act would force patients to race to a health center for an abortion, even if they did not yet feel confident in their decision,\u201d Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, wrote in court papers.\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster holding up a bill banning almost all abortions in the state after he signed it into law on Thursday, February 18, 2021, in Columbia, South Carolina [Jeffrey Collins/AP Photo]\nSouth Carolina has three clinics that provide abortions in its largest metropolitan areas \u2013 Charleston, Columbia and Greenville \u2013 and none of them perform abortions after the first trimester. Two of them perform abortions only twice a week, according to Planned Parenthood\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe suit says a high rate of women, especially Black Americans, die during or immediately after childbirth in South Carolina and the abortion ban would fall hardest on low-income women, who would not be able to travel to a nearby state where abortion is still permitted.\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down state laws that prevent abortions before a foetus can live outside the womb.\nLawyers for the state are making a different argument: that a heartbeat in a foetus is an important milestone in a pregnancy. They cite the new law, which states that \u201ccontemporary medical research\u201d has found \u201cfewer than 5 percent of all natural pregnancies end in spontaneous miscarriage after the detection of a fetal heartbeat\u201d.\nThe new law does not punish a pregnant woman for getting an illegal abortion, but the person who performs the procedure can be charged with a felony, sentenced up to two years and fined $10,000 if found guilty.\nSource: APaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
