(WGEM) - Sen. Darren Bailey (R-Xenia) received a major endorsement Thursday in his campaign to become the next governor of Illinois. The state\u2019s top three anti-abortion organizations are now backing his campaign.This is a key endorsement in the battle between a large list of Republican candidates for governor. That group includes Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin, venture capitalist Jesse Sullivan, businessman Gary Rabine, and former state senator Paul Schimpf. Bailey\u2019s campaign hopes this endorsement will help land him on the ballot against Gov. J.B. Pritzker in November.The Illinois Federation for Right to Life, Illinois Citizens For Life, and Illinois Family Action joined the downstate Republican for the announcement at Trump Tower. Advocates say Bailey has shown a strong commitment to life and is unafraid to speak about his opinions on abortion.They feel Bailey and running mate Stephanie Trussell are running a strong campaign, drawing on support from anti-abortion advocates across the state.\u201cThey have put together the people, grassroots support, and financial resources to make them very viable candidates to win in November, to defeat a radically anti-life incumbent governor JB Pritzker,\u201d said Ralph Rivera, Illinois Right to Life Action chairman.Pastor James Pittman with Illinois Family Action said Bailey stands with parents who \u201cknow better than the state about what\u2019s best for their children.\u201d\u201cDarren Bailey supports fairness in women\u2019s and girls sports and privacy in restrooms and locker rooms,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cWe believe that Darren Bailey knows the difference between boys and girls. And yes, Darren Bailey is a pro-life voice as a governor. And he will make the protection of women and their babies a priority.\u201dBailey told supporters the unborn in Illinois need someone fighting for them in the governor\u2019s office. He also criticized Democrats for rescinding the parental right of notification of abortion law last year. Bailey said he would fight to restore parental rights and stop taxpayer-funded abortion if he becomes governor.Bailey said, if elected governor in a state with Democratic control in both legislative chambers, he will continue to let people know about different options and what the future could be.\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends on the other side of the aisle,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAnd I believe that they will have a sense of freedom when there is a Republican governor who is elected that will bring everyone to the table and talk about life for Illinois in all aspects.\u201dBailey also said he doesn\u2019t personally consider procedures to save the life of a mother to be abortion because there is a choice of life. The candidate clarified that he would lean toward saving the mother in that case.The Pritzker campaign quickly responded to the announcement Thursday. Communications Director Natalie Edelstein said Bailey continues to prove he is far too conservative to lead Illinois.\u201cHis long record of attacking reproductive freedoms and women\u2019s bodily autonomy poses an existential threat to families in every corner of Illinois,\u201d Edelstein said. \u201cAs GOP extremists try to drag us backwards, Gov. Pritzker is focused on protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, bolstering access to vital health care, and ensuring Illinois remains a safe haven for women everywhere.\u201dCopyright 2022 WGEM.
