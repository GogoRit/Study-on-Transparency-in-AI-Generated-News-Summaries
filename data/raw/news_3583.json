After stirring controversy with Monday's Yeezy fashion show, where he and models sported \"White Lives Matter\" shirts, the 45-year-old rapper sat down with Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson where he sounded off on a number of hot-button issues, including abortion.\"You just came from Paris Fashion Week, you just landed and you have the lanyard still on from it and there\u2019s a photograph on it. What is that?\" Carlson asked.\"It's a photograph of a baby's ultrasound,\" West said on Thursday's Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"You designed that. Why? What does that mean?\" Carlson probed.\"It just represents life. I'm pro-life,\" West clarified.\"You wear it on a badge. What kind of response do you get?\" Carlson asked.\"I don't care about people's responses, but I care about the fact that there are more Black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point,\" West replied. \"That 50% of Black death in America is abortion. So I really don't care about people's response to that. I perform for an audience of one and that is God.\"West, who goes by Ye, doesn't hide his conservative views. During his failed presidential run in 2020, the Grammy winner publicly revealed he and ex-wife Kim Kardashian considered aborting their first child. West's talking point at the campaign rally was the beginning of the end of his marriage.West also talked to Carlson about supporting Donald Trump. The rapper was the former president's most famous supporter and didn't shy away from wearing Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" hat in public.\"My so-called friends/handlers around me told me if I said that I liked Trump that my career would be over. That my life would be over. They said stuff like people get killed for wearing a hat like that. They threatened my life,\" West explained. \"They basically said that I would be killed for wearing the hat. I had someone call me last night and said anybody wearing a 'White Lives Matter' shirt is going to be green-lit. That means they are going to beat them up if they wear it. I'm like, you know, OK, green light me then.\"West went on to condemn the media.\"We are in a battle with the media. Like, the majority of the media has a Godless agenda, and their jokes are not working,\" West declared. \"This whole like 'Oh, Ye's crazy' and all these things, they don't work because the media has, you know, they\u2019ve also watched travesties happen, just even specifically to me, and just watch it and act like it wasn\u2019t happening. And they stay quiet about it.\"Presumably, West doesn't put Fox News in the \"Godless\" category.MORE: Kanye West faces backlash for WLM shirts at Yeezy showRecommended StoriesSportsYahoo SportsNFL free agency good, bad and ugly: How has your favorite team done so far?Which teams should be most excited after a week of NFL free agency?1d agoSportsYahoo SportsPass or Fail: Houston Texans show off new road uniforms after Reddit leakTexans CEO and Chairman Cal McNair took to Reddit to show off one of the team's new uniform combinations in response to a leak.16h agoBusinessYahoo FinanceThe CEO of Warren Buffett's favorite oil company thinks its stock is 'very undervalued'Occidental Petroleum's CEO said the company will focus on paying off debt for the next couple of years as it puts a pause on aggressive share buybacks.3h agoSportsYahoo SportsMarch Madness: Ranking the NCAA men's tournament teams from 1 to 68UConn is the favorite, but there are at least eight others who are legit contenders to cut down the nets in April.2h agoSportsYahoo SportsTimberwolves star Anthony Edwards throws down ridiculous dunk of the year over John Collins in win vs. JazzJohn Collins got put on a wild poster on Monday night, and had to leave the game due to a head injury.14h agoSportsYahoo SportsBaker Mayfield gets called 'a 10 on the pr--- scale' by Bucs GM, then thanks him: 'I'll take that'Baker took it as a compliment, even though it didn't really sound like one.6d agoSportsYahoo Sports2024 Fantasy Baseball: Jackson Holliday leads 5 key draft sleepers from the infieldDalton Del Don examines potential draft values with the upside to make a difference in fantasy baseball leagues.1d agoBusinessYahoo FinanceFed's inflation fight will affect housing supply for decades, says Redfin CEOThe housing market is showing signs of a recovery, but Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman warns higher rates will affect the housing sector for decades.2d agoSportsYahoo SportsNearing a loaded 2024 NFL Draft, Justin Fields and the 2021 QB class remind us the position is a crapshootWhy Fields wasn\u2019t scooped by other teams largely centers on his one year of rookie contract control, which features a fifth-year option that will be set at $25.6 million.2d agoU.S.Yahoo SportsAaron Rodgers says 'Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy' in wake of report he believed in conspiracy theoryRodgers' statement comes a day after a CNN story detailing comments Rodgers made about the shooting in 2013.5d agoMore StoriestwitterfacebookinstagramyoutubeYahoo!MoviesTV + StreamingHow to WatchMusicCelebrityBooksThe It ListInterviewsYahoo PicksTerms and Privacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardHelpSuggestionsAbout Our AdsSite map\u00a9 2024 Yahoo.
