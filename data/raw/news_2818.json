The movie is about a 17-year-old girl in high school named Veronica who finds herself pregnant. She lives in a state that requires parental consent for abortion and doesn\u2019t want to tell her conservative parents. The nearest state that allows consent-free abortions for underage girls is New Mexico, so she convinces her childhood best friend to road trip over the weekend. \nShe tells her parents she\u2019s \u201cstudying at a friend\u2019s house for the weekend\u201d and then heads off with her friend for what seems like a grand adventure. The soundtrack is peppy and lighthearted. The overall theme is happy and fun, which is the exact opposite of abortion (as many post-abortive women will tell you).\nAlthough there are many issues with UnPregnant, here are the four major issues that need to be addressed.\u00a0\nUnPregnant glorifies abortion. \nAt the beginning of the movie, Veronica is terrified to tell anyone she is going to get an abortion. She feels uncomfortable even saying the word. But throughout the movie, she becomes more and more comfortable with the topic. As the characters in the movie slowly become desensitized to the truth of abortion, so do do the viewers. At least that is the whole goal of the movie. Comments like \u201cIt\u2019s not a baby yet\u201d are found all throughout the movie. Not once do they talk about what the procedure is like, what the recovery is like, or the possible risks. Abortion is damaging, and this movie makes it seem like a fun weekend trip.\u00a0\nUnPregnant encourages abusive boyfriends. \nAfter Veronica finds out she\u2019s pregnant, she goes to her boyfriend Kevin to tell him. Immediately, he proposes, and tells her he will support her. This is exactly what many women\u00a0need\u00a0from their baby\u2019s father; coercion is a huge reason for abortion.\nInstead of being relieved the father of her baby wants to be involved, she is upset that he expects her to keep the baby. Several times he tries to convince her to keep the baby and let him help her, but she continues to disregard him. She calls him a stalker and tells him he doesn\u2019t have a say. The only thing this narrative accomplishes is encouraging young men to avoid responsibility. We need men to take responsibility and support women. We should encourage men to be strong and present.\u00a0\nUnPregnant depicts a false view of pro-lifers.\nThey openly mock them, and portray them as lunatics. Whenever a pro-lifer is mentioned or seen in the movie, they are overbearing, aggressive, creepy mobsters. While watching these scenes, one would think the pro-life characters were about to murder someone. If the goal of the movie was to paint the Pro-Life movement as a dangerous enemy, they succeeded, although its hard to believe any person would fall for this. The Pro-Life community is loving and cares for women and babies. The people who fight for the preborn about passionate about empowering women to succeed as mothers and support them in their endeavors. The screenwriter either has never been to a pro-life event or maliciously decided to paint their own picture that suited their agenda.\nIn-your-face irony about the role of fathers.\nOne of the main plots in the movie is the friendship between Veronica and her childhood ally Bailey. Bailey\u2019s father left when she was young and lives with her mother. However, she found out her father lives in New Mexico. She decides to visit him after years of not seeing him. She shows up to his work, hoping for a father-daughter reunion, and he immediately asks, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Heartbroken that her father doesn\u2019t want to see her, she walks away defeated, but Veronica comes to the rescue. \nShe marches up and gives him a grand speech about how he does not get to avoid responsibility. She goes on about how valuable, loving, and kind Bailey is. He tells them he never wanted kids, and Veronica responds by telling him that he doesn\u2019t get to avoid responsibility because he is her father. His daughter matters. As she is on her way to kill her own child. She pushed away the father of her baby and then turned around to lecture the father of her best friend for not being involved. She shouts about the value of her friend while she fails to see the value of her baby. It is surprising they even allowed that scene to be in the movie, because it is so contradictory to the overall message they were trying to force.\u00a0\nOverall, 10/10 on the gross scale.\nThe entire movie tried to normalize abortion and make girls feel like it is courageous to engage in premarital sex, get pregnant, and then go behind their parents\u2019 backs to get an abortion. In the beginning, Veronica is scared and ashamed to get an abortion. But by the end, she\u2019s proudly shouting it from the rooftops. But that\u2019s not the reality of abortion. Abortion only takes. Abortion is heartbreaking and hurts women. UnPregnant is lying to us. We need to flip on the light and shine truth in the darkness. Abortion is not an adventure, and glorifying it like this spits in the face of thousands of women who feel betrayed by the abortion industry.\u00a0\nIf you are a parent, talk to your children about this movie. Use it as an opportunity to start an important conversation about abortion. If you have a subscription to HBO or HBO Max, cancel it. \n\n Post Views: 1,423\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawSupportersSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
