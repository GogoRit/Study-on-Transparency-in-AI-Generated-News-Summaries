Any person can challenge someone suspected of aiding in an abortion. The plaintiff would receive a minimum $10,000 \u201cbounty\u201d if the defendant is found guilty.\nThe unusual legal mechanism has allowed the broad abortion restriction to be in effect since September 2021 as the case moves through the legal process.\nIn a separate case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit on Tuesday upheld a lower court decision temporarily blocking a South Carolina law with a six-week abortion ban. It has been facing litigation since it was signed into law in February 2021 and does not use the same legal maneuver as the Texas ban.\nThe Texas law has also faced multiple legal challenges from abortion rights advocates, and it has led to a tangle of procedural questions that are still being unraveled.\nAn attorney for Texas told the state\u2019s highest court Thursday that it could decide the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong in December when it gave abortion providers a narrow legal pathway to challenge a Texas law that effectively bars procedures after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\nJudd Stone of the Texas Solicitor General\u2019s Office told the Texas Supreme Court that the state law was written in a way that meant there could be no lawsuits against state officials who tried to stop the law before it took effect.\nThe problem with that argument, as one member of the Texas Supreme Court pointed out right after Stone made that point, is that \u201ceight justices on the Supreme Court didn\u2019t think that.\u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in December that challenges could move forward against some state licensing officials, although it also ruled 5-4 that the challenges could not move forward against state judges and clerks.\nAbortion providers\u2019 lawsuits are against state officials who may or must take enforcement actions against the petitioners if the petitioners violate the terms of Texas\u2019 Health and Safety Code, including the abortion law.\nWhen the Supreme Court sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, that court decided to send the case to the Texas Supreme Court for more clarity on what the state law means.\n\n\n\nStone told the Texas Supreme Court on Thursday that five members of the U.S. Supreme Court basically said Texas courts are free to agree or disagree on their interpretation.\nTexas Supreme Court Justice Debra Lehrmann told Stone that the Supreme Court ruling is \u201ccertainly not something we\u2019re going to thumb our nose at.\u201d\nStone then said the Texas high court has made stronger commitments to interpret statutes using the text of the law, known as textualism, than the U.S. Supreme Court has. And upon further review, the Texas court could decide the highest court in the land \u201csimply was incorrect.\u201d\n\u201cThere are several members of the United States Supreme Court who are not so committed, and that court is sometimes fairly described as the fair-weather textualist bench,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThis one is not. So that\u2019s a meaningful difference.\u201d\nOne Texas justice asked a follow-up about Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who wrote the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in December and considers himself a textualist.\n\n\n\n\u201cJustice Gorsuch is a fair-weather textualist?\u201d Texas Supreme Court Justice Evan A. Young asked, eliciting laughter from the bench from at least one other justice.\nStone replied: \u201cI was speaking of the body.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Justice Gorsuch is a fair-weather textualist,\u201d Stone continued. \u201cI think he\u2019s merely wrong.\u201d\nLehrmann then corrected him, referring to the 8-1 decision: \u201cEight of them.\u201d\nAbortion pill uptake\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, new data released by the Guttmacher Institute on Thursday showed that a majority of all abortions are medication abortions, a nonsurgical procedure that induces an abortion through a two-pill cocktail: mifepristone and misoprostol.\nThe data showed that 54 percent of abortions in 2020 were medication abortions, up from 39 percent in 2017.\nThe information indicates 2020 was the first year the majority of abortions were medication abortions, and the institute said this percentage has been increasing since the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000.\nThat number is likely to rise after FDA announced in December that it would change two requirements related to how medication abortions can be administered nationwide. The announcement allows mifepristone to be dispensed outside of a clinic and to be stocked in a certified pharmacy.\nLast year, Texas implemented a second law that reduced the window for providing a medication abortion from 70 days to 49 days \u2014 less than what FDA recommends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Recent Stories\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump support may not be enough to save Bost in Illinois\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus sharpens on China\u2019s tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitol Ink | Cash flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFatal flaw: Buttigieg\u2019s inaction means women\u2019s lives are at risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe election-year dance over ByteDance and TikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A lot of vitriol\u2019: Lawmakers fret over tone of Trump-Biden rematch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Source for news on Capitol Hill since 1955\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nEvents\nPrivacy\nRC Jobs\nNewsletters\nThe Staff\nSubscriptions\n\n\n\nCQ Roll Call is a part of FiscalNote, the leading technology innovator at the intersection of global business and government.
