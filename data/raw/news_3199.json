That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing at the College of William and Mary in Virginia where pro-abortion students are rabidly bullying pro-life students in ways that are dark and foul. But then, when has the abortion lobby been anything but dark and foul?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Students for Life of America group at the College of William and Mary, known as the Tribe for Life, has been continually oppressed on their campus. Pro-abortion students tear down their fliers and create an overall hostile environment for the pro-life movement\u2014but the group didn\u2019t expect the bullying to be virtual, as well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThey were shocked to discover a repulsive Instagram account by the username of \u201c@tribefordeathwm,\u201d created for the purpose of making disgusting jokes about the pro-life group and life in general. If there was any confusion about just who this account was targeting, the biography of this Instagram page reads, \u201cHey there tribe for life [kissy face emoji] DISCLAIMER: this account is 100% a joke aimed only at clowning our campus\u2019s anti abortion group.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is debatable that this account\u2019s obscene and evil portrayal of life is satirical. Pro-abortion supporters consistently use demeaning language when speaking of preborn children. For example, if you\u2019ve ever been at a pro-life march or event, you may have seen the popular pro-abortion sign, \u201cF*ck them kids.\u201d Other pro-abortion supporters say equally alarming sentiments such as \u201cI eat babies for breakfast.\u201d The Tribe for Death is just another wing of the heinous abortion lobby.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Tribe for Death\u2019s Instagram page has a variety of distasteful posts. One particularly disturbing video shows a preborn child as being represented by a spoonful of red jam and then being made into a sandwich for consumption. The caption of the post is: \u201cHey @tribeforlifewm [the Tribe for Life\u2019s Instagram page] do you want a sandwich?\u201d Another post is a screenshot of a direct message to the Tribe for Life Instagram page with the caption, \u201cAnother day, another DM with my one true love [three heart emojis] absence makes the heart grow fonder, just like abortions.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, the most blatantly anti-life post has to be the fake infographic shown below. The graphic reads, \u201cOnly 14% of OB/GYNs Collect human teeth in their free time.\u201d Perhaps this lewd account was referring to the vile abortionists who kept baby remains in their own homes as \u201csouvenirs\u201d of their dark work\u2014like Kermit Gosnell who kept fetal remains in milk jugs and glass jars or Ulrich Klopfer who secretly collected thousands of dead babies in his garage.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe caption of this post is even more interesting. It reads, \u201cOH MY GOSH so honored to help share these super useful graphics [heart emojis] remember that fetuses are secretly trying to kill you which is why we have to murder them first.\u201d It just can\u2019t get much worse than that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the incidents at the College of William and Mary are not uncommon\u2014hostility towards pro-life students is a pattern we\u2019ve seen regularly. In some cases, it\u2019s more than just students; even school faculty will pile on. That\u2019s what happened in our most recent lawsuit at Noblesville High School.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Pro-Life Generation is staying strong in the face of adversity, and we extol you to continue in the fight for life. Pro-abortion trolls will continue trolling, but our cause is more important. We can\u2019t let bullies with too much time on their hands distract us from our goal; we will end abortion whether they like it or not.\u00a0\u00a0\nClick HERE to read why you should feel encouraged in the face of bullying.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,563\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
