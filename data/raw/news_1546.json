State attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to stop the AG from prosecuting those who aid Alabamians seeking out-of-state abortion care. (Photo/Stew Milne)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alabama Attorney General Office Wednesday asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to stop the AG from prosecuting those who aid Alabamians seeking to access abortion care in states where it is legal.\nIn the motion to dismiss, state attorneys doubled down on statements Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall made in an August 2022 radio interview, in which he said that health care providers could face felony charges for assisting Alabamians in traveling to other states to obtain legal abortion care.\n\u201cAn elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,\u201d the brief said.\u00a0 \u201cPlaintiffs identify no constitutional provision that would bar the State from enforcing that law,\u201d the Attorney General wrote in the motion.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed on July 31 by former abortion providers in the state, cited Marshall\u2019s comments and alleged that the potential prosecution of people helping Alabamians access abortion care in states where it is legal had forced health care providers to cease providing critical information, counseling and practical support to Alabamians exercising their constitutional right to access medical care across state lines.\n  Signage at West Alabama Women\u2019s Center in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Friday, Feb. 10, 2023. (Vasha Hunt for Alabama Reflector)\nMessages seeking comment were left Thursday with the attorney general\u2019s office. \nMeagan Burrows, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Thursday morning that the motion only affirmed Marshall\u2019s prior comments.\n\u201cI think the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss just really indicates that the office is doubling down on their intent to use Alabama criminal laws to prosecute people for helping pregnant Alabamians get access to legal abortion care out of state,\u201d she said.\nAlabama enacted a near-total abortion ban after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion rights protections in Dobbs v. Jackson\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Organization in 2022.\nIn its motion to dismiss, the attorney general\u2019s office cited a state statute allowing Alabama law enforcement to charge people with committing a crime outside the state if it were illegal to do so in Alabama.\u00a0In response to a claim that such a move violates the plaintiffs\u2019 1st Amendment rights, the office wrote that \u201ca crime receives no constitutional protection.\u201d\n\u201cLikewise, the right to travel, to the extent that it is even implicated, does not grant plaintiffs the right to carry out a criminal conspiracy simply because they propose to do so by purchasing bus passes or driving cars,\u201d the motion stated.\nBurrows said there was no attempt to \u201cdisavow\u201d or even walk back some of the comments he made in asking the court to dismiss the case, nor did he say that they do not intend on enforcing the law in this way.\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically saying, \u2018Yes, I intend to use Alabama criminal law to go after people in Alabama,\u2019 which I think, based on his motion to dismiss is not necessarily confined to our plaintiffs, but could include family members, friends, clergy members, employers, who help the people that they love, who\u2019re pregnant and seeking legal abortion care out of state access that care,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nThe motion from the AG\u2019s office claims that the federal court \u201clacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on behalf of their staff and clients,\u201d asserting the plaintiffs have a potential conflict of interest with their staff or clients.\n\u201cBy promoting out-of-state abortions, in-state abortion providers necessarily advance their own financial and reputational interests irrespective of any costs (or even benefits) it may have on the women consulting them,\u201d the motion said. \u201cThus, plaintiffs and pregnant women have a potential conflict of interest, barring third-party standing.\u201d\nAttorneys for the state also allege that for plaintiffs to have standing to sue on behalf of staff and clients, they must have \u201csufficiently close relationships,\u201d to the staff and client. The motion alleged the plaintiffs\u2019 relationship with the third-party does not satisfy a close relationship.\n\u201cIn other words, there must be a continuous and standing relationship between the plaintiffs and third parties\u2014not a one-off \u2018incidental congruity of interest.\u2019 This continuity is not present between Plaintiffs and their clients,\u201d the motion stated.\nHealth care providers sue Alabama officials over threats of prosecution in abortion aid\n\nThe ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of West Alabama Women\u2019s Center in Tuscaloosa; Dr. Yashica Robinson, based in Huntsville, and Alabama Women\u2019s Center in Huntsville, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama in Montgomery.\n\u201cNo Alabama law authorizes such prosecutions. Nor could it,\u201d the lawsuit stated. \u201cThat would be a blatant extraterritorial overreach of state power that not only contravenes the Due Process Clause, the First Amendment, and the fundamental constitutional right to travel, but also the most foundational principles of comity upon which our federalist system rests.\u201d\nWithout court intervention, the lawsuit alleged that pregnant individuals may face delays in accessing necessary care. Some might be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. The lawsuit said this could have serious consequences in a state with the nation\u2019s third-highest maternal mortality rate, especially impacting Black women, who experience a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to systemic racism.\n\u201cThe percentage of people who have sought abortion care in Alabama in the past who are Black, the heightened risk of criminalization for Black people and communities of color, and the poor health outcomes, including maternal health, for Black people in Alabama demonstrate the need for helpers like Plaintiff to be able to do their work and fulfill their mission without fear of prosecution,\u201d the lawsuit from the Yellowhammer Fund stated.\nThe lawsuit from ACLU stated that particularly for Black women, who make up the majority of Plaintiffs\u2019 patients, \u201cthe ability to travel out of state for care may be what makes the difference between obtaining a safe abortion and dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth.\u201d\nBurrows said the attorney general in his briefing placed no limits or restrictions on his use of the law to prosecute people. She said they have no indication that he wouldn\u2019t use the same laws to go after other Alabamians, such as family members, and not just the plaintiffs in this case.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe, given the nature of the criminal laws and given the attorney general statements, that other people are not also in the crosshairs here for helping friends, family members, employees, access legal state abortion care,\u201d Burrows said.\nU.S. District Judge Myron Thompson last week consolidated the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit with a one from the Lawyering Project, a legal organization aimed at increasing access to abortion. The organization filed a similar case on behalf of the Yellowhammer Fund, an organization that supports pregnant Alabamians seeking out-of-state abortion care.\nThompson scheduled a hearing Tuesday to consider Marshall\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAlabama Attorney General doubles down on threats to prosecute out-of-state abortion care\nby Alander Rocha, Alabama Reflector August 31, 2023\nAlabama Attorney General doubles down on threats to prosecute out-of-state abortion care\nby Alander Rocha, Alabama Reflector August 31, 2023\n The Alabama Attorney General Office Wednesday asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to stop the AG from prosecuting those who aid Alabamians seeking to access abortion care in states where it is legal.\nIn the motion to dismiss, state attorneys doubled down on statements Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall made in an August 2022 radio interview, in which he said that health care providers could face felony charges for assisting Alabamians in traveling to other states to obtain legal abortion care.\n\u201cAn elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,\u201d the brief said.\u00a0 \u201cPlaintiffs identify no constitutional provision that would bar the State from enforcing that law,\u201d the Attorney General wrote in the motion.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed on July 31 by former abortion providers in the state, cited Marshall\u2019s comments and alleged that the potential prosecution of people helping Alabamians access abortion care in states where it is legal had forced health care providers to cease providing critical information, counseling and practical support to Alabamians exercising their constitutional right to access medical care across state lines.\n  Signage at West Alabama Women\u2019s Center in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Friday, Feb. 10, 2023.
