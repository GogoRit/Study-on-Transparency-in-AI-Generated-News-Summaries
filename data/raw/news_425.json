Wade, vowing he would enact legislation making Roe v. Wade \"the law of the land\" if it were overturned by the court, which prompted President Trump to lash out at Biden via Twitter Tuesday morning regarding reproductive rights, still one of the more continuous and divisive issues among the American populace.\nresident Donald Trump stands on the Truman Balcony after returning to the White House from Walter ...

That's what I would do.\"\n\n\n\nBiden has reiterated this position on Roe V. Wade, a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, on multiple occasions while on the campaign trail this year (\"It's a woman's right to do that. Period,\" Biden said at a Democratic primary debate back in February).\n\n\n\nTuesday morning, President Trump tweeted that \"Biden just took a more Liberal position on Roe v. Wade than Elizabeth Warren at her highest,\" and then falsely accused Biden of being \"in favor\" of late-term abortions \"right up until the time of birth, and beyond.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nBiden has not publicly espoused a position explicitly supporting late-term abortions and has previously declared he supported a ban on partial-birth abortions or late-term abortions.\n\n\n\"As president, Biden will work to codify Roe v. Wade, and his Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion, such as so-called TRAP laws, parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements,\" Biden's published plan states.\n\n\nBiden has also said he plans to restore federal funding to Planned Parenthood and, following some criticism from liberal Democrats, stated he no longer supports the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion except in rape cases, incest or life-threatening circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background:\nBiden\u2019s position on reproductive rights has shifted throughout his political career. In a 1974 interview with Washingtonian, Biden, a practicing Catholic, criticized Roe v. Wade. \"I don't like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don't think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body,\" Biden said. According to Axios, he voted several times, including in 1983, to prevent federal employees from obtaining abortion services through their health insurance. In 2006, in an interview with Texas Monthly, the former Vice President stated, \"I'm a little bit of an odd man out in my party,\" adding, \"I've made the groups\u2014the women's groups and others\u2014very angry because I won't support public funding and I won't support partial-birth abortion.\" In 2007, during an appearance on Meet the Press, Biden was asked whether he supported a ban on partial-birth abortions or late-term abortions. \"I did, and I do,\" he replied. During the Vice Presidential debate against Paul Ryan in October of 2012, Biden stated, \"I accept church rule personally, but not in public life.\" During a debate in 2019, Biden said, \"Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.\" President Trump's views on abortion have also changed dramatically. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press in 1999, Trump claimed, \"I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion\u2026 But you still \u2014 I just believe in choice.\" While running for president in 2016, Trump said his views had changed and that he was now opposed to abortion.\nTangent:\nSome 56% of respondents in a New York Times/Siena College poll published last month said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if his choice for justice would help overturn Roe v. Wade, versus just 24% that said they would be more inclined to vote for him. When asked which candidate would do a better job picking a Supreme Court justice, 50% of voters trust Biden, 43% trust Trump, and 7% are undecided.\n\n\nFurther Reading:\nPolls Show Key Voting Groups Want Supreme Court Seat Filled After Election (Forbes)\u00a0\nTrump blasts Joe Biden following pledge to pass national abortion law (New York Post)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Tommy BeerEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
