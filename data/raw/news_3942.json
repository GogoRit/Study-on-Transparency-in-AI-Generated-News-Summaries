The anti-endorsement is the first in the organization\u2019s 7-year history and shines a light on Sen. Lucio\u2019s destructive anti-women, anti-reproductive rights and anti-LGBTQ record.\u00a0\n\u201cSen. Lucio has repeatedly voted for and supported extremely dangerous and discriminatory legislation \u2014 and his constituents are demanding accountability,\u201d said Dyana Limon-Mercado, Executive Director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \u201cDuring his three-decades long career, Lucio has voted for every bill that cuts critical reproductive health care access, adding to the devastating health disparities in his community.\u201d\nDuring the 2019 legislative session, Sen. Lucio voted in favor of Senate Bill 22, which prohibits local governments from partnering with Planned Parenthood on critical health care, education and outreach. Sen. Lucio also authored and passed Senate Bill 24 last year, which requires false and misleading information be given to those seeking an abortion in order to shame and coerce them from their decision. SB 24 was one of three anti-abortion priority bills for anti-choice extremist Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.\u00a0\nFor the first time since he took office in the early 1990s, Lucio is facing two formidable primary challengers in the race for SD 27.\u00a0 Candidates Sara Stapleton-Barrera, a former trial lawyer, and Ruben Cortez, a member of the State Board of Education, have each pledged 100 percent support for defending Planned Parenthood patients and health centers.\u00a0\n\u201cOver the last 30 years, Sen. Lucio has earned a reputation for doing the dirty work for extremist politicians like Dan Patrick and Greg Abbott \u2014 whether it\u2019s attacking immigrant communities, LGBTQ communities or women\u2019s health and reproductive rights,\u201d said Aileen Garza, Rio Grande Valley Youth Organizer for Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \u201cThe Valley deserves someone who truly represents our diverse and welcoming community. We deserve a champion who will fight for all of us.\u201d\u00a0\nBoth Stapleton-Barrera and Cortez present a stark contrast to Lucio, who has consistently voted against the LGBTQ community and reproductive rights.In 2013, Lucio voted in favor of the infamous and sweeping anti-abortion bill HB 2, ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and in 2017, he was the only Democrat to vote for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\u2019s transphobic \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d\u00a0\nFor more information on Sen.
