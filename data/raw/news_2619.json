Such figures emerge from registries kept in clinics across the UK.\nWhile insisting he was not seeking to cast any judgment on these women, Debattista said it was high time that the government stepped up its support to discourage this practice.\n\u201cThe government should set up pro-life clinics to support these women and help them overcome the challenges which pregnancy brings with it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAt present their choice is either to face their problems alone or set an appointment for an abortion abroad. Such options do not leave a lot of room for choice,\u201d he said.\nWhile noting that there are NGOs that offer support to pregnant women, the parliamentary secretary said the government should intervene to do its share as well.\nDebattista acknowledged that Malta was the only EU country where abortion is illegal but insisted this did not mean there was something intrinsically wrong.\n\u201cUniversal faith is not a universal truth. Until the advent of Galileo and Copernicus everybody thought the world was flat,\u201d he remarked,\n\u201cI believe these pro-life clinics will be of huge support to the mother and give a chance to the baby. If we manage to save just one life, it will be worth the effort and expense,\u201d Debattista insisted.\nHe said such clinics would also help to reverse the declining birth rate and promote the work of the Embryo Protection Authority to promote life.\n\u00a0\u201cApart from preaching in favour of life I am bound to offer support\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up to our free newsletters\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\nGet the best updates straight to your inbox:\n\n\n\nDaily newsletter (the day\u2019s top headlines, sent every\nmorning)\n\n\n\nFrom the editors (a curated selection of stories, sent\nevery Saturday)\n\n\nPlease select at least one mailing list.\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.
