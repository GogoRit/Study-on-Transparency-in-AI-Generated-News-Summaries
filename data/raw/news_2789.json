Wade, Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented an Air Force captain in a reproductive rights caseAs factions of America celebrate and criticize\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy, a\u00a0story of a\u00a0little-known 1970s reproductive rights\u00a0case is raising eyebrows.\u201cIt's disheartening to see the 'Pro-life'\u00a0response to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death,\u201d Amber LeBeau posted to Facebook on Sept. 20. \u201cIt's very clear that the folks who think RBG was a vehement 'baby killer'\u00a0have never heard of the name Susan Struck.\u201dThe post goes on to tell the story of Susan Struck, an\u00a0Air Force captain who\u00a0sued the secretary of Defense after she became pregnant and military policy forced her to get an abortion or resign.\u201cSo before you paint Ginsburg as some satanic villain, at least acknowledge the many abortions that likely DIDN'T happen because of her tireless advocacy for women and families,\" the post concludes. It has been shared over 25,000 times.Many comments expressing shock and disbelief\u00a0of the unheard of, and seemingly unbelievable, story\u00a0caught the attention of Facebook's Third-Party Fact-Checking Program.\u00a0However, the story is true.Fact check:Ginsburg cared for her young child, sick husband while excelling in law schoolMilitary policy required Struck to have an abortion or resignStruck joined the Air Force\u00a0active duty on April 8, 1967. She became pregnant while serving in Vietnam in 1970.At the time, Air Force\u00a0policy forced officers who became pregnant to either have an abortion or be discharged. When military leadership learned Struck was pregnant on Oct. 16, 1970, they recommended she be honorably discharged from the Air Force.Struck was Roman Catholic and did not want to get an abortion. Instead, she arranged to\u00a0place the child for adoption and use her leave for the pregnancy. But, she was dismissed and began a\u00a0legal battle with the military.Fact check:It's true, Ginsburg and Scalia were close friends despite ideological differencesGinsburg argued the Air Force policy discriminated against womenGinsburg, who was working with\u00a0the American Civil Liberties Union at the time, represented Struck in her legal battle.In Struck v. Secretary of Defense, Ginsburg argued that forcing pregnant women to have an abortion or leave the military was\u00a0fundamentally discriminatory. According to Ginsburg, this policy unfairly placed upon women\u00a0the burden of child-rearing, denied them equal opportunities and placed\u00a0them second to men.\u201cUntil very recent years, jurists have regarded any discrimination in the treatment of pregnant women and mothers as 'benignly in their favor.'\u00a0But in fact, restrictive rules, and particularly discharge for pregnancy rules, operate as 'built-in headwinds' that drastically curtail women\u2019s opportunities,\u201d she wrote.As Ginsburg prepared Struck\u2019s case to be heard before the Supreme Court, the U.S. solicitor general, the Justice Department's top lawyer at the high court,\u00a0persuaded the Air Force to waive Struck\u2019s discharge and change the pregnancy regulation. He filed a motion to dismiss the case\u00a0as moot.The Supreme Court never heard the case and decided Roe v. Wade\u00a0soon after.Fact check:False claim that Ginsburg wanted Trump to immediately fill her seat on Supreme CourtGinsburg wished the high court had\u00a0heard\u00a0Struck's caseStruck's suit\u00a0''would have been my choice for the first reproductive freedom case to come before the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Ginsburg\u00a0said at a\u00a0University of Chicago Law School event on May 11, 2013.She questioned if the Supreme Court may have better understood reproductive access as a right to choice rather than a right to abortion if the first successful petitioner there had wanted to maintain a pregnancy.\"The idea of getting that to the court first was to say, \u2018Government should stay out of this. Here\u2019s Susan Struck. She wants to make the decision for birth, but the government is saying you do so at the cost of your job,\u2019\u201d explained\u00a0Ginsburg.Ginsburg questioned if the Supreme Court had ever made the connection of the shared theme of choice between Struck v. Secretary of Defense and Roe v. Wade.\u201cI wish that would have been the first case. I think the court would have better understood that this was a question about a woman\u2019s choice,\u201d she said.Fact check:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent in pharmaceutical case wasn't anti-vaccineOur ruling: TrueIn an early 1970s lawsuit regarding an\u00a0Air Force captain who was discharged because she refused to have an abortion, Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued for a woman's right to reproductive choice. Struck v. Secretary of Defense\u00a0is relatively unknown because the Air Force\u00a0changed the pregnancy policy rendering Struck's suit moot\u00a0before the case could be heard by the Supreme Court.\u00a0We rate this claim TRUE, because it is supported by our research.Our fact-check sources:USA TODAY, Sept. 25,\u00a0\"Ruth Bader Ginsburg becomes first woman to lie in state: 8 other strides she made for women\"USA TODAY, Sept. 23,\u00a0\"Fact check: No guarantee Obama would've replaced Ginsburg with a progressive justice\"Shelly DeMotte Kramer's Facebook postFindLaw, Feb. 16, 2012,\u00a0\"How Justice Ginsburg Struck Out in the Pro-Choice Movement\"Casetext, May 4, 1972,\u00a0\"Struck v.
