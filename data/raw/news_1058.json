Texas will soon ban all abortions from the moment of fertilization with narrow exceptions only to save the life of a pregnant patient or prevent \u201csubstantial impairment of major bodily function.\u201d\nThe Biden administration reassured the nation\u2019s doctors that they don\u2019t need to wait until a patient\u2019s health deteriorates before acting and that they can act in cases where nontreatment would result in serious impairment, guidance that comes as medical professionals in Texas and other states where abortion is banned are trying to figure out what kind of women\u2019s health care is allowed under new restrictions. The guidance isn\u2019t seeking to update existing law but is said to clarify a hospital\u2019s duties under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn no uncertain terms, we are reinforcing that we expect providers to continue offering these services, and that federal law preempts state abortion bans when needed for emergency care,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. \u201cUnder the law, no matter where you live, women have the right to emergency care \u2014 including abortion care.\u201d\nThe Biden administration warned that if a hospital fails to provide emergency abortion treatment when necessary, it could be fined or have its Medicare status revoked.\n\u201cThese hospitals are now threatened with having to choose between violating state law under the threat of criminal penalty or jeopardizing their ability to participate in Medicaid,\u201d Paxton\u2019s office argued in the suit.\nAny ruling will likely be appealed. Paxton\u2019s office argues that the federal guidance isn\u2019t merely clarifying existing law but \u201cincludes a number of new requirements related to the provision of abortions that do not exist under federal law.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis administration has a hard time following the law, and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions,\u201d Paxton said in a statement. \u201cI will ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administration\u2019s unlawful agenda.\u201d\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back on Paxton\u2019s suit, emphasizing that the guidance is based on existing law.\n\u201cThe Texas Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit is yet another example of an extreme and radical Republican elected official,\u201d Jean-Pierre wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt is unthinkable that this public official would sue to block women from receiving life-saving care in emergency rooms, a right protected under U.S. law.\u201d\n\nJoin us at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in downtown Austin, and hear from 300+ speakers shaping the future of Texas including Joe Straus, Jen Psaki, Joaquin Castro, Mayra Flores and many others.
