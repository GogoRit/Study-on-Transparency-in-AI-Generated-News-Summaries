Lane\r\n\n in the July 27, 2022 issueShareShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail to a friendPrint\n\n\n \n(\u00a0Photo by Robin Marty / Creative Commons)\n\n\nMy mother, a nurse practitioner and a self-identified pro-life Christian, worked at Planned Parenthood while pregnant with me. I did not know this until recently, after I published a book about my choice not to become a biological mother.\n\u201cI started reading your book,\u201d she told me.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSubscribe\n\nRead our latest issue or browse back issues.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cI never told you your only options in life were mother or Mother Superior, did I?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo, Mom. That was the Catholic Church. You taught me the proper way to pronounce clitoris and how to talk to the Holy Spirit.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said, proudly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not all.\u201d\nIt was 1984 in Nashville, and my mother, a charismatic who would later convert to Catholicism for my father, had taken a job at Planned Parenthood\u2019s teen health clinic. It was a job that was as much about diagnosing eczema in pubescent youth as it was about treating them for sexually transmitted infections and talking to them about family planning. And yes, she made the occasional abortion referral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you still considered yourself pro-life?\u201d I pressed her.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied evenly. \u201cPro-life to me meant pro\u2013responsible life. I always told you, your body is a gift from God\u2014but it\u2019s up to you to enjoy wisely.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the impact of my mom\u2019s pro-life legacy on me lately, for obvious reasons. The constitutional right to abortion has been overturned, revealing once again the strange fruit of a mother-venerating, woman-phobic country.\nI am not shocked by this outcome, but I am worried. I am worried about the outsized impact this ruling will have on the poor\u2014a category of people for whom I was taught Jesus had an outsized preference. I am worried about the intimate impact this ruling will have on me\u2014a woman who sees her choice not to bear biological children as a calling akin to the priesthood, whereby one abstains from having a natural family to be more available to the improbable family of God.\nIf I\u2019m being honest, though, my peskiest and most visceral worry is this: that one of my daughters will unintentionally, prematurely get pregnant and become captive to her own life rather than its coauthor.\nThat my husband and I are currently raising three teen daughters is as much a shock to me as it was to everyone to whom I had declared myself \u201cchild-free for the common good\u201d in my 20s. But the common good has a way of roping you into group projects you never expected. Our girls, school-age sisters we met through foster care, didn\u2019t expect to be adopted by a couple of principled progressives either. Community, not parenting, compelled us to sign up for what we expected would be a satisfying but ultimately temporary endeavor. We hoped, as they did, that they would be able to reunite with their family of origin.\nSo my daughters already know the cost of living in a country with family-friendly values that aren\u2019t backed by family-friendly safety nets\u2014or rather, where safety nets are only available to some families. They already know the resignation that comes when a court decides for you without asking what you think. What they need is to feel the unruly joy\u2014and responsible worry\u2014of what it\u2019s like when life happens with you and not to you. I imagine we all need to feel this now.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Supreme Court decision came out, my mom told me about the women she cared for over the course of her 20-plus-year career, women who risked a \u201cwith\u201d rather than a \u201cto\u201d kind of life. She told me about the woman who said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t terminate this pregnancy, my boyfriend will.\u201d (I\u2019ve learned that adults and teens denied abortion care are more likely to stay in abusive relationships.) She told me about the depleted woman who simply couldn\u2019t afford one more mouth to feed, one more body not her own. (Another learning: despite the stereotype, the majority of people who seek to terminate their pregnancies are already parents.)\nI told my mom that with more than 400,000 children in the US foster system, this country has already revealed its ghastly inability to care for those who are already here. We commiserated on the couch together. How cruel to laud a child\u2019s life and neglect its mother\u2019s, to laud a mother\u2019s life and neglect a woman\u2019s. This is not pro\u2013responsible life. This is pro-patriarchy.\nSo, naturally I am worried. I am weary. I am depleted of disappointment. But I am not without hope. Not when I remember that no matter what church or state says, there always have been and always will be people like my mom\u2014nurses and doctors, sex educators and congregational leaders, wise friends and cool aunts\u2014who are willing to tell the truth that life is choice. That the call is not to abdicate or inflate our sense of agency but to be faithful to the sliver we\u2019ve been given.\nI chose to become a mother\u2014albeit in an unconventional way\u2014and there are still days when I flop onto my bed with a quiet, \u201cthis is not what I signed up for\u201d scorn. While I know this is normal, I also know it\u2019s not a good look. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be dumpster-loads worse if I felt forced into parenthood. So now it\u2019s my turn to choose life within the life I\u2019ve been given and to teach my daughters to do the same\u2014to know the satisfaction of writing our own stories within some bigger stories.\nThank God for my mom, who already provided an epigraph when she said, \u201cMother or not, your body is sacred and your body is yours.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared at Religion News Service.
