Extensive damage was caused that will take months to repair, the group said.Nobody in the anti-abortion group was hurt, though two firefighters incurred minor injuries.Graffiti spray-painted on the side of the CompassCare building said \u201cJane was here\u201d. There was speculation that the phrase might be a reference to a pro-choice militant group that goes by the name Jane\u2019s Revenge.Last month Jane\u2019s Revenge claimed responsibility for an arson attack at an anti-abortion office in Wisconsin. The group sent a statement to a local paper in which it said it had attacked the headquarters of Wisconsin Family Action in Madison because of its anti-abortion stance, warning that similar institutions in the US faced \u201cincreasingly extreme tactics\u201d if they did not disband.In a video posted on CompassCare\u2019s Facebook page, the chief executive, Jim Harden, used hyperbolic language to characterise the attack. \u201cThis is the pro-abortion Kristallnacht,\u201d he said, referring to the violence unleashed by the Nazis against the Jewish population in Germany in November 1938.He added: \u201cThey broke glass under the cover of darkness to keep us from doing the work of the Lord, from being the light of the world. And we are not going to stop.\u201dCompassCare claims to offer legitimate medical services to women considering abortion. Those \u201cservices\u201d include reversal of an abortion for women who have taken an abortion pill, and providing information about the health risks of terminating a pregnancy.The American Medical Association\u2019s Journal of Ethics has described pregnancy centers like CompassCare as unethical. They are \u201corganisations that seek to intercept women with unintended pregnancies who might be considering abortion. Their mission is to prevent abortions by persuading women that adoption or parenting is a better option.\u201dThe supervisor of Amherst, Brian Kulpa, told the local ABC station WKBW7 that he was \u201cdisgusted that lives were put at risk. A violent response is never the answer. There is no place in Amherst for such attacks.\u201dThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, put out a statement saying that she \u201ccondemns violence of any kind\u201d.Explore more on these topicsAbortionNew YorknewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
