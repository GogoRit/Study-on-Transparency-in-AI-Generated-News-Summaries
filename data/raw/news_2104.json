The abortion industry and 21 Attorneys General want to flood states with mail-order RU-486 abortion drugs and remove common-sense oversight.\nThe letter states, \u201cWe write to urge you to continue to robustly enforce the REMS for medication abortion and end dangerous runarounds of these protections under the guise of medical research\u201d and urges the FDA to \u201cact promptly to stop illegitimate and dangerous experiments with women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\n\nWith hospitals pushed to their limits by #COVID19, we should minimize, not increase, unrelated pressures on health care providers. @boblatta & I lead an effort to urge @SteveFDA not to let up on REMS abortion drugs restrictions during the crisis. https://t.co/jSUpCIz5jc @SBAList pic.twitter.com/yk3mxJW2P7\n\u2014 U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (@SenHydeSmith) April 14, 2020\n\nYou can read the full letter here.\nWhile abortion activists and the abortion industry try to make abortion more widely available during the coronavirus crisis, many medical professionals are pushing back, pointing out that abortion is not essential.\nFor example, 30,000 health care professionals have stated that abortion is non-essential.\nWe previously wrote, \u201cPro-life doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals are calling on the government to\u00a0halt abortions\u00a0during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. They are fighting back against the spin of the abortion industry that apparently, the answer to the COVID-19 crisis is\u00a0more abortion\u2026.Abortion is not essential healthcare. It\u2019s an unnatural, violent termination of preborn children. The groups that represent over\u00a030,000 physicians signed the letter\u00a0calling for the suspension of abortion in order to save the resources for essential, life-saving healthcare. Rather than trying to save lives, abortion facilities are using this time of crisis to push their agenda. Some abortion proponents are even going so far as to suggest that the\u00a0FDA lift restrictions\u00a0placed on the abortion pill, RU-486.\u201d\u00a0\nFresno Pro-Life Future leader and California SFL Action Captain Bernadette Tasy breaks down the problems with RU-486 below.\n\n\nWhat is RU-486, or the Abortion Pill? It is NOT \"Plan B.\" It's an #abortion up to 10 weeks pregnancy.And now they're starting to put them on #college campuses & even mail them to patients.#ProLifeGen #prochoice #StopSB24 pic.twitter.com/ygDVSUk2nE\n\u2014 Fresno Pro-Life Future (@FresnoPLF) April 13, 2020\n\n\n Post Views: 783\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
