Wade decision that sanctioned abortion in the U.S., was insincere in her conversion to pro-life. \u201cDon\u2019t trust it. It\u2019s patently false,\u201d she says.The documentary, \u201cAKA Jane Roe,\u201d\u00a0which premiered Friday on FX, features an interview of McCorvey that purports to show the anonymous plaintiff in Roe v. Wade as saying before her death in 2017 that she turned pro-life because she was paid to do so.\u201cI spoke to Norma McCorvey days before her death,\u201d Johnson wrote on Facebook. \u201cIt was the only time we had ever spoken. An unexpected call and a number I didn\u2019t recognize, I almost didn\u2019t answer. I am so thankful that I did. There was no long introduction. No formalities. She told me that she called because she needed to talk to someone else who had a \u2018big number\u2019 and would understand what she needed to ask me.\u201dGet Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.SubscribeJohnson said the term \u201cbig number\u201d referred to the number of babies aborted while she was a director at Planned Parenthood, and for McCorvey, the number of abortions nationwide she felt responsible for.\u201cYes, I have a \u2018big number\u2019\u00a0\u2013 22,000,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cBut it was a drop in the bucket compared to the burden that she felt. My number was just part of \u2018her number.\u2019 Because she felt like she owned EVERY number. She owned my 22,000. She felt like she owned them all. Every abortion that had been committed under the law that bore her name... \u2018Jane Roe\u2019 ...they were \u2018hers.\u2019\u201dJohnson added, \u201cNow imagine 50 million, 60 million. That\u2019s the burden that Norma carried. A self-imposed burden that she could not shake...that she carried with her until the day of her death. She was a fragile woman. A woman whose life was riddled with heartache. She was shamelessly used by the abortion industry at a young age. She was a vulnerable target for them and that's who they prey on. No one reading this can even understand the mental state of a woman tormented by that burden...especially in the last year of her life,\u201d Johnson wrote.She added: \u201cOf all of the people who claimed to be friends with Norma McCorvey, the one I saw who loved her completely was Fr. Frank Pavone. Listen to his opinion of this nonsense. Listen to his perspective. \u2026 There is a reason that HE was not asked to be in this recent documentary. If he would have been involved, the entire thing would have crumbled. He knew the real Norma. And he knew the sincerity of her conversion.\u201dPavone, national director of Priests for Life and who served as McCorvey\u2019s spiritual counselor for over two decades, and Janet Morana, the group\u2019s executive director, also released statements.\u201cOne would think that any normal or honest person who wants to understand the journey of Norma McCorvey would talk with those who journeyed with her,\u201d Pavone said.\u201d\u201cI knew her and was one of her key spiritual guides for 22 years, starting in 1995 with her baptism, right through the conversation we had on the day she died. I was privileged to lead and preach at her funeral. I knew her struggles and her pain. She didn\u2019t just have positions; she had deep wounds because of her involvement with Roe vs. Wade, and I guided her through the healing of those wounds, in the quiet hours of struggle that nobody saw or heard about. Those are things you don\u2019t fake,\u201d Pavone continued.\u201cYes, she not only rejected abortion, but she became a new creation in Christ,\u201d he added. \u201cI received her into the Catholic Church and rejoiced together with her as she discovered day by day the joy of prayer, and in her final years made rosaries by hand to help others experience that same joy. Her desire to protect children in the womb was no act.\u201cThere have always been people who have tried to reshape her story, or get her to reshape it. She resented that and would resent it today. Norma was not somebody you could come to know in a snapshot, in an interview, or even in years of interviews. I\u2019ll have a lot more to say about this once I see the documentary.\u201dEvangelist Alveda King, a niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., also responded to the claims in the documentary.\u201cFor me, Norma was never a trophy, she was my friend,\u201d King wrote in an op-ed in TruthPR. \u201cI loved Norma, and told her so. Norma loved me too. She told me so. We laughed together, we cried together, we worked together. I miss her.\u201dKing continued: \u201cThe abortion lobby pays billions a year to kill babies, and dehumanize their mothers. The authors of Roe v. Wade used Norma. They lied to her. The Prolife Family loves Norma. We thank GOD for Norma\u2019s love for Life. Her memory lives on in our hearts.\u201dShe added, \u201cIn 1995, Norma prayed, and God opened her eyes. Then, Norma blew the whistle.\u00a0Norma\u2019s heart was won and transformed by love, not money.\u201cShameful fake news would have us believe that Norma McCorvey was a mercenary. Nothing could be further from the truth. For those of us who knew and loved Norma, we know that at the end, Norma loved God, and Norma loved life,\u201d she added.Live Action, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to exposing the truth about abortion and affirming the life of every child, spoke to Norma\u2019s friends, including Karen Garnett, who said: \u201cWhen she came back to Dallas, she was living in the home of a saintly pro-life woman who took her in and was giving her loving hospitality. And she was not well. She was in and out of the hospital with failing health. She had absolutely no wealth at all. It was the pro-life community who she was with. We loved her. She went to mass with us. We celebrated her birthday. Never was there any indication that she was acting.\"Was this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
