While life-affirming values are not always welcome in medicine, the physicians in Dr. Catherine Stark\u2019s thriving practice serve with these principles and also bless the community with their gifts and medical expertise\u00a0in the pregnancy help community.\nStark and Dr. James McBride opened their practice in 1998 and it has grown into a large group of pro-life health care professionals.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDrs. Stark and McBride\n\n\u201cWe started the practice as a pro-life philosophy for obstetrics,\u201d Stark said. \u201cOur group expanded from two to 15 doctors in the group. When we hire on new people, we let them know our pro-life stance and our practice has thrived for the past 22 years.\u201d\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nIn addition, their life-affirming philosophy extended beyond the private practice into community work with oversight today of six different pregnancy help clinics in Detroit and the surrounding communities.\nThe first center was Crossroads Care Center in Auburn Hills. Stark became the medical director in 2014. Birth Choice was an additional center located in Rochester, where she became the medical director. In 2017, she also became the medical director of Compassion Pregnancy Center in Clinton Township.\u00a0\nOver the past five years additional centers were added including an ICU mobile unit (Birth Choice) servicing Detroit and the suburbs offering free ultrasounds and counseling for abortion-minded women.\nFor the past two years Stark has also been a provider for the Abortion Pill Rescue Network (APRN), receiving clients in need of abortion pill reversal\u00a0services in the southeastern portion of Michigan.\u00a0\u00a0\nStark was a registered pharmacist before attending medical school, and this background only adds to her conviction in regard to the science behind APR.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it makes sound sense from a physiological standpoint,\u201d said Stark. \u201cThe APR protocols have sound medical reasoning behind it.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cThe APR protocol has sound medical reasoning behind it\u201d\nStark had to work for the ability to offer the protocol, but once she succeeded, she immediately began meeting women\u2019s needs.\nThe abortion pill reversal protocol entails prescribing progesterone, the natural hormone in a mother\u2019s body that sustains a healthy pregnancy, to counteract the effects of the abortion. If a pregnant mom takes the first of the two pills in a chemical abortion and experiences regret, she may be able to save her unborn child if she acts quickly enough.\u00a0\nIn a chemical abortion, the first drug, mifepristone, also known as RU-486, destabilizes the pregnancy endeavoring to end the unborn child\u2019s life, and in continuing the chemical abortion process it would be followed by misoprostol a day or so later to induce the mother\u2019s labor to deliver her deceased child.\nThe best chance for success in saving the child occurs when the mom acts within 24 hours, though successful reversals have happened as long as 72 hours after the first abortion drug is taken. In contacting the APRN, a pregnant mom is put swiftly in touch with an APRN provider for an ultrasound and assessment of her pregnancy. When the child is still viable, APR treatment follows. To date, more than 1,000 lives have been saved thanks to the APRN.\nThey will not acknowledge that the abortion pill is the problem\nAbortion supporters in and outside the medical field are opposed to providing women this life-giving choice and attempt to smear abortion pill reversal as unsound, even trying to project the negative effects of abortion drugs onto the APR protocol.\nFor example, a statement from the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists (AAPLOG), reveals the unwillingness of the abortion industry to complete a study that was not providing findings in line with their bias.\u00a0\nStark, an AAPLOG member, pointed out the bias: \u201cIt showed that progesterone was working to reverse the effects of RU-486 so they stopped the research saying it (the research) is too risky. They will not acknowledge that the abortion pill is the problem.\u201d\nDr. Christina Francis and Dr. Donna Harrison, both from AAPLOG, write of the biased study, \u201cThis study was aimed at examining the efficacy and safety of a now well used protocol for abortion pill rescue (or APR). APR provides the possibility to save the unborn child if women change their mind after taking the first medication (mifepristone) of two that are involved with a medication abortion.\u201d\nReferencing Francis and Harrison\u2019s writing, Stark noted it was two of the women in the placebo group (who did not receive progesterone to counter RU-486) who required surgery, with one needing a blood transfusion.\u00a0\n\u201cThese findings are consistent with what we\u2019ve known about mifepristone, which is that it increases the risk of significant hemorrhage from the uterus due to its physiologic effects of vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation,\u201d AAPLOG stated in response to the study.\nA year before joining APRN, Stark was inspired by the thought of utilizing the APR protocol after hearing Harrison present on it. So Stark, wanting to be an APR provider, went to the board of Crossroads and received a hard \u201cno\u201d because of fears their malpractice insurance would not cover the protocol and would drop their service.\nNine months of trying to figure out a way for APR to be offered led Stark to ask her partners in private practice to consider adding it as part of their services. She reasoned, since progesterone is something they already utilize, why wouldn\u2019t they add this service?\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, this was accepted as the plan and their practice would become an APR provider.\nAn APR mom in need on the first day\nWhen Stark learned of the APRN, she inquired into becoming a provider and her practice was added in January 2019.\u00a0\nIt was a Tuesday; her office hours were added for the next day. Stark had just placed the details on a bulletin board and at 1 p.m. that Wednesday, a patient was brought into the office.\nThe medical assistant told Stark the patient was pregnant and having some bleeding. As she entered the exam room, the woman started to cry and said, \u201cI have to admit something. I took the first abortion pill and I want to save my pregnancy.\u201d\nStark knew the Lord had led her in this direction but her thought at that moment was, \u201cHow could God have done this?\u201d In her mind it was confirmation she was doing the right thing.\nThis patient was not from the area, but she continued appointments at Stark\u2019s practice as the APR protocols were followed until she was 15 or 16 weeks when her care was transferred to her own local OB. The protocol was successful, and several viable ultrasounds confirmed a healthy pregnancy.\nIn 2019 Stark saw 13 patients through APRN and has seen 15 so far this year. She expressed how grateful she is for God\u2019s confirmation and in the successful life-saving work of Abortion Pill Rescue\u00ae.\nCalls to the APRN often come in on Friday evenings. When Stark\u2019s phone rings late on Friday she finds herself anticipating it will be the APRN hotline nurse.\u00a0\n\u201cThe people I talk to and prescribe for are often ambivalent,\u201d Stark reflected. \u201cA lot of them get pressured into finishing the abortion.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI call and try to get them to follow up in the office,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, many have a boyfriend or their own mother pushing them into finishing their abortion. I pray for them and hope. Abortion always has two victims.\u201d\u00a0\nShe continued, \u201cThe mother is damaged by this in a deep spiritual way and unfortunately can\u2019t see past their situation. I try to give them hope as best I can. The truth is you just can\u2019t fix it always. So, I just give it to God.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard world we\u2019re in,\u201d said Stark, \u201cthere are no easy answers. What we can do is provide hope, love and healing to as many as I can and save these precious children.\u201d\u00a0\nTweet This: \u201cThere are no easy answers. What we can do is provide hope, love and healing to as many as I can and save these precious children.\u201d - APR doc\n\u201cOur answer is to just answer in love,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a victim and we need to love on her.\u201d\nThe attacks on APR are from politically correct institutions with a different agenda\nStark and her colleagues\u2019 passion for life drive them to give their time and expertise to the multiple pregnancy help centers associated with the practice \u2013 despite the cost.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re going to be targets,\u201d Stark said. \u201cIn Michigan pregnancy help centers are portrayed by the media as medical clinics operating without a license. The truth is these are well run and well-staffed pregnancy help centers. There are licensed medical professionals running them.\u201d\nStark also noted of the errant attacks on APR, \u201cThe attacks are from politically correct institutions with a different agenda.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to study this,\u201d Stark said. \u201cThe use of progesterone has been a medically accepted treatment for more than 50 years. There is no doubt it is very safe. It is safe to use for women and it does not cause birth defects in babies.\u201d\nFrancis and Harrison\u2019s AAPLOG statement reflected agreement: \u201cProgesterone administration (in doses consistent with what are currently recommended by the APRN) resulted in a doubling of the chance that a woman who regrets her decision after beginning a medication abortion can save her unborn child.\u201d\nTheir concluding statement said, \u201cAs compassionate healthcare providers, it would be unethical for us to withhold this treatment from women seeking it given the information we have. All women\u2019s healthcare physicians, regardless of their feelings about abortion, should be able to agree on this.\u201d\nStark and all the physicians in her practice wholeheartedly agree.\nEditor's note: Heartbeat International manages the Abortion Pill Rescue Network and Pregnancy Help News.
