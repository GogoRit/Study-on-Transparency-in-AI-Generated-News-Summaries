[+] Jackson Women's Health, a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, on December 01, 2021 in Washington, DC.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe poll found 48% of respondents at least somewhat support restricting abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, while 43% oppose it.\n\n\n\nThe share of those who strongly oppose a 15-week ban is higher than the share that strongly support it, however (34% versus 31%).\n\n\n\nSupport for 15-week bans was heavily dependent on respondents\u2019 political party: only 21% of Democrats backed 15-week bans versus 75% of Republicans.\n\n\n\nA 55% majority still believe abortion should be legal \u201cin all or most cases,\u201d while 30% say it should only be legal in cases of rape, incest, and medical emergencies and just 11% don\u2019t want it to be legal at all.\n\n\nAmericans are more opposed to six-week abortion bans\u2014such as the one in Texas, which other states are now replicating\u2014with 50% opposing those bans and 42% supporting them.\n\n\nThe poll was conducted March 2-7 among 1,500 registered voters, and the Journal notes it was conducted jointly by Republican and Democratic polling firms.\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Watch For\nThe Supreme Court is now deliberating whether to uphold Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban, with a decision expected by late June or early July. Justices on the 6-3 conservative court signaled during oral arguments in the case they\u2019re likely to side with Mississippi, though it\u2019s still unclear whether they\u2019ll narrowly uphold 15-week bans, or if their ruling will go even further and let states impose stricter restrictions\u2014or overturn Roe v. Wade and let states ban abortion entirely. A growing number of states are imposing 15-week bans in the meantime: Arizona became the first state this year to enact a 15-week law on Wednesday, and Florida will soon follow, as the state has already passed a 15-week bill that\u2019s just waiting on Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. Kentucky has also passed a 15-week ban, though it\u2019s unclear whether or not Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, will veto it. West Virginia\u2019s legislature is also considering a 15-week bill, which already passed the state\u2019s House of Delegates in February.\nKey Background\nThe Journal poll is in line with other polling on abortion that\u2019s found Americans are broadly supportive of the procedure remaining legal, but are more willing to accept restrictions once it\u2019s further into the pregnancy. The 15-week bans are part of a broader slew of state-level abortion restrictions that have been passed in recent years, with the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute reporting more than 100 were passed in 2021 alone, the most in a single year since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Fifteen-week laws have become increasingly popular among anti-abortion lawmakers, however, the Washington Post reports, as the bans are seen as less \u201cextreme\u201d and controversial than stricter restrictions and let lawmakers curb abortion while seeming more \u201creasonable\u201d and garnering less outrage from the left.\n\nSurprising Fact\nOnly a small subset of abortions take place after 15 weeks\u2014they made up just 2% of all U.S. abortions in 2019, the most recent year for which data is available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abortion rights advocates stress it\u2019s still important to have abortion access after 15 weeks, however, as many of the procedures that do take place are often for minors, people who didn\u2019t have access to care sooner or those with health complications that only emerged later into the pregnancy.\n\nFurther Reading\nSupport for 15-Week Abortion Ban Outweighs Opposition, WSJ Poll Finds (Wall Street Journal)\nArizona Enacts 15-Week Abortion Ban \u2014 Same As Mississippi Law Supreme Court Now Weighing (Forbes)\n\nFla.
