Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, said at The Texas Tribune Festival on Friday that he would support a rape exception under Texas\u2019 abortion law.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Azul Sordo/The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nRepublican state Sen. Robert Nichols of Jacksonville said Friday that he\u2019d support a change to Texas\u2019 abortion laws to allow victims of rape to legally obtain the procedure.\n\u201cIf I get a chance to vote for an exception to rape, I will vote yes,\u201d the East Texas senator said during a panel of Republican lawmakers at the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival. \u201cI think instead of us telling women what to do, we should show our support for women of this state.\u201d\nNichols is one of the first anti-abortion lawmakers to say he would support loosening the abortion laws when lawmakers meet in January.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas has one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws, which went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade \u2014 the landmark case that established the legal right to an abortion. Under Texas law, abortions are prohibited in almost all cases, including rape and incest, and are allowed only to save the life of the pregnant person.\nTexas is competing against private companies who are willing to bus their employees out of state for \u201cpregnancy care,\u201d said Nichols. \u201cAnd what are we doing?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan rules out raising the minimum age to buy a firearm \n\n\n\n\n        \n        Sept. 23, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nAt the least, Nichols said, the state should provide a minimum of four weeks of paid maternity leave for state employees.\nNichols self-identifies as \u201cpro-life\u201d and has voted in favor of the state\u2019s abortion laws, including the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law that went into effect last September. The law prohibited most abortions after an ultrasound could detect cardiac activity in a embryo, about six weeks into a pregnancy. Nichols\u2019 office did not immediately respond to questions about whether the senator would support any other exceptions to the abortion law, such as for incest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic polling shows that Texans overwhelmingly support exceptions for both rape and incest, with only 13% and 11%, respectively, saying pregnant people should not be able to obtain abortions in those cases.\nTexas House Speaker Dade Phelan also signaled an openness at the Festival on Friday to reexamining exceptions to Texas\u2019 abortion law. Phelan, a southeast Texas Republican, said he was unlikely to personally support such exceptions but that some members of his caucus have said they may want to revisit the matter.\nGov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said in previous interviews that the abortion issue appeared settled.\n\nThe Texas Tribune Festival is here!
