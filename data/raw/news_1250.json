Doctors who had started providing abortions after six weeks had to immediately stop.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Biden rallies supporters around abortion rights ahead of midtermslist 2 of 3Photos: Thousands rally across US for women\u2019s rightslist 3 of 3How are new abortion laws affecting women in the United States?end of list\nAbortion advocates blasted the order, saying it will traumatise women who must now arrange travel to other states for an abortion or keep their pregnancies. Women waiting for an abortion at providers\u2019 offices were turned away, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, which represents abortion providers challenging the ban.\n\u201cIt is outrageous that this extreme law is back in effect, just days after being rightfully blocked,\u201d said Alice Wang, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which also represents plaintiffs in the case.\n\u201cThis legal ping pong is causing chaos for medical providers trying to do their jobs and for patients who are now left frantically searching for the abortion services they need.\u201d\n\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office in a court filing said \u201cuntold numbers of unborn children\u201d would \u201csuffer the permanent consequences\u201d if the Supreme Court did not issue a stay and halt the November 15 decision by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.\nMcBurney had ruled the state\u2019s abortion ban was invalid because, when it was signed into law in 2019, United States Supreme Court precedent that was established by Roe v Wade and another ruling had allowed abortion well past six weeks.\nThe decision immediately prohibited enforcement of the abortion ban statewide. The state appealed and asked the Georgia Supreme Court to put the decision on hold while the appeal moved forward.\nAlthough abortions past six weeks had resumed, some providers said they were proceeding cautiously over concerns the ban could be quickly reinstated.\nGeorgia\u2019s ban first took effect in July, after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. It prohibits most abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d is present.\nCardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo\u2019s cells, which will eventually become the heart, at approximately six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant.\nThe measure was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp in 2019.\n\nIn his ruling, McBurney said the timing \u2013 before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade \u2013 made the law immediately invalid. Legislatures exceed their authority when they enact laws that violate a constitutional right declared by the judicial branch. To enact the law, the state legislature would have to pass it again, he wrote.\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office in a filing with the Georgia Supreme Court blasted McBurney\u2019s reasoning as having \u201cno basis in law, precedent or common sense\u201d.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys defended it in a reply and warned of \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to women if it were put on hold. They also asked the Supreme Court for 24 hours\u2019 notice before issuing any stay to \u201cavoid the potential chaos\u201d of resuming the ban while women waited for an abortion or were in the middle of getting one.\nThe state\u2019s Supreme Court did not conduct a hearing before issuing its order and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys said it denied their request for 24 hours\u2019 notice.\nThe court\u2019s order said seven of the nine justices agreed with the decision. It said one was disqualified and another did not participate.\nSource: APaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
