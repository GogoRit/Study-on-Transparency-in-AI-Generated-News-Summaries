Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. These decisions laid the foundation for abortion jurisprudence for decades to come. Ginsburg would become an important voice and presence on the Supreme Court in ensuring that women\u2019s health remained front and center in the conversation on abortion at the highest court in the country.\nWhile Roe is the monumental case that decriminalized abortion, Casey, decided the year before Ginsburg joined the court, would become the defining case for the future of abortion jurisprudence. In Casey, the court articulated the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard. This standard held that if a law has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before viability, the law would be deemed unconstitutional.\nWhile attempts to limit access to abortion through the law began after Roe, Casey opened the floodgates not only to more legal limitations on abortion but also to a grave misinformation campaign about the abortion procedure and its consequences. This was especially true in the case of the psychological consequences of abortion. The Casey plurality, over the interventions of the American Psychological Association and other amici, upheld informed consent laws that mandated the provision of information about abortion, including its \u201cpossible detrimental psychological effects.\u201d In their brief before the court, the APA argued that this information mispresented the psychological effects of abortion, and that mandating its provision may cause harm to women seeking abortion. The Casey decision exemplified two important aspects of shifting abortion jurisprudence: first, the ongoing success of a new strategy of \u201cwomen protective abortion laws\u201d that feigned care for women while attempting to dissuade women from having abortions (or limiting access to them); and, second, the very specific validation of the idea that abortion can cause negative mental health consequences. This was a turn away from the reasoning in Roe, which acknowledged that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term could have negative consequences for the woman.\nIn the face of these newly legitimated anti-choice ideas, Ginsburg\u2019s presence on the court was all the more important. She became the counterweight to ongoing attempts by anti-choice advocates, and conservative members of the court, to continue the project of rewriting facts about abortion in order to limit access. Ginsburg\u2019s opinions in two cases demonstrate how she pushed back: Carhart v. Gonazales (Carhart II) and Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. \nAt issue in Carhart II was a law that enacted a so-called \u201cpartial birth abortion ban.\u201d The law banned an abortion procedure known as an \u201cintact dilation and extraction,\u201d which was utilized in abortions occurring later in pregnancy. The case asked whether an exception for the health of the woman was constitutionally required. The majority went against its prior precedent in Stenberg v. Carhart (Carhart I) and held that there was no need for the ban to include a health exception. For women\u2019s health advocates this was horrifying. Physicians expressed clear support for the need for a health exception, arguing that in some cases the intact dilation and extraction was a safer procedure than other alternatives \u2013 and without it, they would be forced to use a procedure with more risk to the woman. Yet the Supreme Court painted the physicians as divided and decided that, in the face of medical uncertainty, the health exception was unnecessary.\nIn her dissent in Carhart II, and as the sole woman on the Supreme Court at the time, Ginsburg made her debut as an ardent supporter of abortion rights and truth-telling. Calling the majority opinion \u201calarming,\u201d she argued that the court did not take precedent \u201cseriously\u201d in applauding a ban on a \u201cnecessary and proper procedure.\u201d Importantly, she argued, for the first time since Roe, the court \u201cblesse[d] a prohibition with no exception safeguarding a woman\u2019s health.\u201d As her dissent continued, she drove home a point that she would highlight in later abortion jurisprudence: that the court ought to protect women\u2019s health \u2014 not, as she argued the majority did in this case, offer a \u201cflimsy and transparent\u201d justification for a ban on a women\u2019s health procedure. She called out the majority for attempting to offer a moral justification for the ban in its reliance on an \u201cantiabortion shibboleth\u201d for which there is no evidence: that women who have abortions suffer from \u201csevere depression and loss of self-esteem.\u201d\nGinsburg\u2019s role as truth-teller on the court \u2013 a justice who could see through these thinly veiled attempts to ban abortion access \u2013 continued as abortion access continued to come under attack. In Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a new set of laws that claimed to protect women from unsafe abortions \u2013 requiring physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and requiring clinics to meet ambulatory surgical requirements \u2013 came before the Supreme Court. Again, the laws were justified as protective of women\u2019s health. The majority of the court struck down the Texas law at issue, relying on a careful review of evidence by the district court. In her short concurrence, Ginsburg again called out the attempt to block women\u2019s access to abortion, describing as \u201cbeyond rational belief\u201d the argument that the laws under consideration would genuinely protect women. Using the language developed by advocates, she referred to these laws as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provider, or TRAP, laws.\nChief Justice John Roberts\u2019 concurring opinion in a case from last term striking down a similar admitting-privileges law in Louisiana, June Medical Services v. Russo, suggests a willingness by a majority of the court to take seriously the false claims of legislators when they enact laws that will make accessing abortion more difficult. As the Supreme Court sits on the cusp of becoming more conservative, Ginsburg\u2019s absence will be felt most deeply by the many people seeking abortions that she fought to protect.\n\n\n\n\nPosted in Symposium on Justice Ginsburg's jurisprudence\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Citation: \n\t\t\t\t\tAziza Ahmed, \n\t\t\t\t\tSymposium: Ginsburg\u2019s abortion jurisprudence prioritized women\u2019s health, \n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTUSblog (Oct. 13, 2020, 10:55 AM), \n\t\t\t\t\thttps://www.scotusblog.com/2020/10/symposium-ginsburgs-abortion-jurisprudence-prioritized-womens-health/\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Posts\n\n\n\n\n \nSlide 1Supreme Court skeptical of restricting government communications with social media companiesREAD MORESlide 2Public officials can be held liable for blocking critics on social mediaREAD MORESlide 3Supreme Court rules states cannot remove Trump from ballot for insurrectionREAD MORESlide 4Court sympathetic to NRA\u2019s free speech claimREAD MORE \n\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n December 2023 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n August 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n November 2022 \n October 2022 \n September 2022 \n August 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n December 2021 \n November 2021 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n August 2021 \n July 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n December 2020 \n November 2020 \n October 2020 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n June 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n December 2019 \n November 2019 \n October 2019 \n September 2019 \n August 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n September 2018 \n August 2018 \n July 2018 \n June 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n August 2017 \n July 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n November 2016 \n October 2016 \n September 2016 \n August 2016 \n July 2016 \n June 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n December 2015 \n November 2015 \n October 2015 \n September 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n June 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n December 2014 \n November 2014 \n October 2014 \n September 2014 \n August 2014 \n July 2014 \n June 2014 \n May 2014 \n April 2014 \n March 2014 \n February 2014 \n January 2014 \n December 2013 \n November 2013 \n October 2013 \n September 2013 \n August 2013 \n July 2013 \n June 2013 \n May 2013 \n April 2013 \n March 2013 \n February 2013 \n January 2013 \n December 2012 \n November 2012 \n October 2012 \n September 2012 \n August 2012 \n July 2012 \n June 2012 \n May 2012 \n April 2012 \n March 2012 \n February 2012 \n January 2012 \n December 2011 \n November 2011 \n October 2011 \n September 2011 \n August 2011 \n July 2011 \n June 2011 \n May 2011 \n April 2011 \n March 2011 \n February 2011 \n January 2011 \n December 2010 \n November 2010 \n October 2010 \n September 2010 \n August 2010 \n July 2010 \n June 2010 \n May 2010 \n April 2010 \n March 2010 \n February 2010 \n January 2010 \n December 2009 \n November 2009 \n October 2009 \n September 2009 \n August 2009 \n July 2009 \n June 2009 \n May 2009 \n April 2009 \n March 2009 \n February 2009 \n January 2009 \n December 2008 \n November 2008 \n October 2008 \n September 2008 \n August 2008 \n July 2008 \n June 2008 \n May 2008 \n April 2008 \n March 2008 \n February 2008 \n January 2008 \n December 2007 \n November 2007 \n October 2007 \n September 2007 \n August 2007 \n July 2007 \n June 2007 \n May 2007 \n April 2007 \n March 2007 \n February 2007 \n January 2007 \n December 2006 \n November 2006 \n October 2006 \n September 2006 \n August 2006 \n July 2006 \n June 2006 \n May 2006 \n April 2006 \n March 2006 \n February 2006 \n January 2006 \n December 2005 \n November 2005 \n October 2005 \n September 2005 \n August 2005 \n July 2005 \n June 2005 \n May 2005 \n April 2005 \n March 2005 \n February 2005 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n ABOUT\nRESOURCES\nJOB POSTINGS\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCONTACT US\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSign up to receive a daily email\r\ndigest from follow.it by\r\nentering your email. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis website may use cookies to improve your experience.
