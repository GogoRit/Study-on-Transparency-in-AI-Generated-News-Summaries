Kim Reynolds can proceed with an appeal on a temporary block on the state\u2019s new, restrictive abortion law, the Iowa Supreme Court said Tuesday.\nReynolds announced her intentions to appeal last week and said it was \u201cjust a matter of time\u201d before lawyers for the state filed the request, which they did Friday. The Iowa Supreme Court had to say whether the request could move forward.\nREAD MORE: Iowa\u2019s restrictive abortion measure faces legal challenge as governor prepares to sign it into law\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature approved the measure to ban most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy during a July 11 special session, and the law went into effect days later, immediately after Reynolds signed it. The ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic launched a legal challenge and Judge Joseph Seidlin on July 17 granted their request to pause the law as the courts assess its constitutionality.\nAbortion remains legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the new law is on hold.\nReynolds is asking the state Supreme Court to override the lower court\u2019s ruling and allow the law to go back into effect. The full court considered Reynolds\u2019 application for appeal, but a spokesperson declined to say whether all the justices will also consider the appeal itself.\nREAD MORE: Iowa Republicans pass ban on most abortions after 6 weeks\nA justice\u2019s recusal led to a rare 3-3 decision in June and left the block intact on the nearly identical 2018 law, prompting Reynolds to call the special session. The 2018 law was passed despite state and federal court decisions at the time, including Roe, that affirmed a woman\u2019s constitutional right to abortion. Both courts reversed those decisions last year.\nThe state Supreme Court can rule on the temporary injunction alone, or it can decide to fast-forward a decision on merits of the law itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Republican Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds speaks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S. on October 1, 2022.
