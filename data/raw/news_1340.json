It comes after a woman complained publicly that she couldn\u2019t terminate her compromised pregnancy.\u00a0\nThe state Department of Health quietly suggested an update to state abortion regulations in September that would put acrania \u2013 a disorder where a fetus develops without a complete skull \u2013 in the group of \u201cmedically futile\u201d pregnancy conditions that can justify an abortion under state law.\u00a0\nThe change was proposed about a month after Nancy Davis told reporters she had been denied an abortion at Woman\u2019s Hospital in Baton Rouge for a fetus diagnosed with acrania. The condition results in miscarriage, stillbirth or a very short lifespan for an infant born after the prognosis.\u00a0\nDavis said Woman\u2019s Hospital in Baton Rouge told her it could not end her pregnancy because of Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban that went into effect last summer. She ended up traveling to New York in early September to undergo the procedure. Woman\u2019s Hospital has not responded to a request for comment for this story. \n\n Slow process to add exceptions\u00a0\nAdding acrania to the state\u2019s medically futile pregnancy conditions list would change that dynamic moving forward. Once it is on the list, a person with a pregnancy affected by acrania should be able to get to an abortion, and a hospital could provide one without question.\u00a0\nStill, the process for putting acrania on that list is slow-going. The health department has opted to update the state\u2019s abortion regulations through a process that takes at least four months \u2013 and often as long as six or seven months.\u00a0\nOfficials decided not to use an emergency process that would add acrania to the list immediately. \n\n\u201cI am very pleased they are adding acrania [to the medically futile conditions list], but it should be added as an emergency item immediately,\u201d Davis said in an interview. \u201cThere are women who are in underserved communities who need access to medical care \u2013 and they need access now.\u201d\u00a0\nThe health department, which is in charge of drafting and amending abortion regulations, has not answered questions about why it wants to add acrania to the pregnancy conditions list.\u00a0\nHealth Secretary Courtney Phillips declined in person last month to respond to a reporter\u2019s question about whether state abortion regulations would be updated. Instead, she referred the reporter to her agency\u2019s communications department.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nConfusion in state law\nThere is confusion about whether acrania diagnoses could currently justify an abortion under a catch-all exception included in Louisiana\u2019s abortion regulations.\u00a0\nAfter Davis\u2019 case garnered media attention, state Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, and several other anti-abortion legislators released a written statement saying Woman\u2019s Hospital \u201cgrossly misinterpreted\u201d Louisiana\u2019s abortion policies. Jackson helped write the state\u2019s strict abortion ban, including the statute that provides for exceptions for medically futile pregnancies.\u00a0\nAbortions are allowed if a fetus has a \u201cprofound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly \u2026 that is inconsistent with sustaining life after birth,\u201d according to a state regulation. The lawmakers said this provision should have applied to Davis\u2019 case. \n\n\u201cThe law in conjunction with the emergency rule is very clear that this young lady is within the exception,\u201d lawmakers said in their statement. \n\nJackson said health officials told her in August that an acrania diagnosis would justify an abortion. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel sent a general statement Monday that suggested that might be the case, but stopped short of confirming what Jackson said.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is an evolving document and LDH has always said that the list would not be able to encompass every possible diagnosis that would meet the definition of \u2018medically futile,\u2019\u201d Neel wrote. \u201cThat is why the [current regulation] does \u2013 and the [final regulation] will \u2013 provide for physician certification of other conditions that would allow for termination. LDH\u2019s final rule will include acrania.\u201d\u00a0\nEmergency option\nThe confusion over acrania\u2019s status may be cleared up if health officials added it to the medically futile condition list immediately. Regulations can be adopted or amended on an emergency basis under state law if they \u201cprevent an imminent peril to the public health, safety or welfare.\u201d \n\nThe current list \u2013 that doesn\u2019t include acrania \u2013 was established under an emergency rule in August. The health department hasn\u2019t answered questions about why it isn\u2019t using that process to update the list. \n\nState officials routinely approve or amend emergency\u00a0 regulations. Recent emergency rules include those that closed the red snapper fishing and oyster harvesting seasons as well as adjustments to the minimum qualifications for a licensed teacher.\u00a0\nIn August and September alone, there were 10 new state emergency rules adopted, including one to establish weight classes for London Ring Fighting, described as \u201cthe sport of boxing conducted without the use of boxing gloves or other padding on the participants hands.\u201d\u00a0\nIn recent years, legislators have complained that state officials, particularly those in the health department, use the emergency regulation process too often. It allows state agencies to initially bypass the public hearing and comment period required before a regulation can be permanently adopted, which makes some lawmakers uneasy.\n\nAcrania is unlikely to be the only new condition proposed for the medically futile list. Doctors have already said other illnesses will come up regularly that might justify the termination of a pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201c[The health department] will never be able to think of everything because medicine doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d said Dr. Rebekah Gee, an obstetrician/gynecologist based in New Orleans and the former head of the Louisiana Department of Health. \u201cYou will never be able to come up with a complete list.\u201d \n\nAnti-abortion advocates could also push back on adding more conditions. The state\u2019s leading anti-abortion organizations didn\u2019t want the state to allow as many exceptions to the abortion ban in the first place. They unsuccessfully fought to take the language that created the medically futile pregnancy conditions list out of the law before it was approved last spring. \n\n\u201cWe were not excited about this list,\u201d said Gene Mills, head of Louisiana Family Forum, a conservative Christian organization. \u201cI think it creates \u2013 as an illustrative list does \u2013 winners and losers, and there are always unintended consequences in doing that.\u201d \n\nSome anti-abortion advocates said conditions expected to be fatal to an infant, including acrania, do not justify abortion because they believe it amounts to ending a life prematurely.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWe know that it is a heartbreaking situation, and we know people who have been through similar circumstances who have chosen to carry the baby to term. Sometimes the child can live much longer than the medical diagnosis predicts,\u201d said Benjamin Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, the state\u2019s leading antiabortion organization. \u00a0 \n\n\u201cWe are certainly not making light of this in any way,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heroic thing to love that child until the end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLouisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban\nby Julie O'Donoghue, Louisiana Illuminator October 19, 2022\nLouisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban\nby Julie O'Donoghue, Louisiana Illuminator October 19, 2022\n Louisiana has proposed adding one new condition to the list of medical diagnoses that permit a person to have an abortion under the state\u2019s strict abortion ban.
