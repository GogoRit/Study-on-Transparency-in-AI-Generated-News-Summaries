Biden and Harris deservedly have been described as the most pro-abortion ticket in the history of U.S. presidential politics \u2014 exceeding even the extremism on abortion of the previous two Democratic presidential nominees, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nVoters aware only of recent political history understandably might suppose that this contemporary situation, with the Democratic Party overwhelmingly skewed toward support for abortion, has been an immutable characteristic of the political landscape in the United States. But a recapitulation of the last five decades of Democratic presidential campaigns, during the era of legal abortion, tells a very different story.\nFor one thing, the party\u2019s platform language has shifted dramatically since the 1972 contest between President Richard Nixon and his Democratic challenger, George McGovern. Although McGovern was characterized at the time as a left-wing extremist who would remake the Democrats as the party of \u201camnesty, acid and abortion,\u201d he favored allowing states to decide on their abortion policy \u2014 a position today advanced primarily by some pro-life advocates, not abortion lobbyists, who insist it should be legal everywhere without any limitation \u2014 and at his instruction the Democratic platform that year contained no reference at all to the abortion issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nEven four years later, in the wake of the calamitous 1973 Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationally, the 1976 Democratic platform confined itself to a comment that it was \u201cundesirable\u201d to amend the Constitution to overturn that decision, alongside an assertion that Democrats \u201cfully recognize the religious and ethical nature of the concerns which many Americans have on the subject of abortion.\u201d\nThe party platform was far more explicit in its support for abortion rights in subsequent election cycles. By the time of the 1992 race between Bill Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush, it stated bluntly, \u201cDemocrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, regardless of ability to pay, and support a national law to protect that right.\u201d\nEven so, it wasn\u2019t until this century that the platform became almost completely unqualified in its support for legal abortion, with the disappearance of language that was incorporated into the 2000 version stating that Democrats \u201crespect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue\u201d and that the party was \u201cwelcoming\u201d toward views that didn\u2019t conform with its pro-abortion orthodoxy.\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s shift can also be understood on a more personal level. In 1972, McGovern\u2019s running mate was Sargent Shriver, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law. A committed Catholic, Shriver was not considered a liability to the 1972 ticket because of his adherence to the pro-life teachings of his faith. In fact, he replaced another pro-life Democrat, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, on the Democratic ticket after Eagleton was forced to stand aside because of revelations of his treatment for mental-health problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd four years later, Shriver\u2019s bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination was undermined not because he had opposed abortion, but instead because he was mischaracterized by the newsletter of the Iowa Catholic Conference as being less pro-life than eventual party nominee Jimmy Carter. This misrepresentation siphoned crucial Catholic votes away from Shriver when that year\u2019s primary campaign commenced with the Iowa caucuses, and Carter\u2019s upset win there catapulted him into a front-runner status that he never relinquished.\nIn 1992, by contrast, the party\u2019s leadership had become far more hostile to pro-life Democrats who were principled enough to break publicly from the now-entrenched party commitment to abortion rights. That year, the DNC\u2019s organizers denied a speaking slot to Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, despite the Catholic politician\u2019s stature as the governor of a key state, after it was learned that Casey intended to utilize his speaking time to deliver a pro-life message to party delegates.\nFast-forward to 2020, with the Democrats in effect hanging out a sign declaring \u201cpro-lifers not allowed\u201d before the convention even started. And this year\u2019s platform incorporates the most extreme demands of the abortion lobby \u2014 including, as in 2016, a party pledge to eradicate the Hyde Amendment, the bipartisan legislative provision that since 1977 has served to protect federal taxpayers from being forced to directly fund abortions except in limited cases.\nAnd whereas back in 1972 it was McGovern himself who, as the party\u2019s nominee, intervened to prevent the inclusion of abortion language in the party platform, in 2020 Biden presaged the convention\u2019s renewed crusade against Hyde via his own shameful campaign flip-flop on the matter last year after he was called out by abortion activists for his previous decades of support for the amendment while serving as a U.S. senator and then as vice president.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Biden\u2019s trajectory on abortion since first being elected to the Senate in 1972 largely parallels that of his party. In the immediate aftermath of Roe in 1973, he stated the Supreme Court went \u201ctoo far\u201d in the decision, and he initially opposed allowing any exemptions to the federal ban on taxpayer funding for abortions.\nBut over the years he steadily softened his resistance to limitations to abortion, culminating in last year\u2019s reversal on the Hyde Amendment. And he undertook this journey away from protecting life with the clear knowledge throughout that his Catholic faith unchangeably condemns \u201cthe moral evil of every procured abortion\u201d (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2271).\nAt this moment, there is no reason to hope that Biden will reverse his current pro-abortion position, even though the U.S. bishops have reaffirmed that ending abortion remains \u201cthe preeminent priority\u201d for Catholic voters in this election cycle. Equally, there is no sign that his party will soften its current pro-abortion litmus test against pro-life Democrats.\nStill, this review of the Democratic Party\u2019s abortion history does at least offer a pointed reminder that, in politics, there is almost nothing that is truly unchangeable. Pro-life Democrats were abundant in the ranks of their party\u2019s leaders not so very long ago, so it\u2019s proper for Catholics of every political stripe to pray that this might be the case again \u2014 and to work toward that goal as much as possible.\n\n\nKeywords: \nabortion\ndemocratic party\ndemocratic platform\n\n\n\n\nThe Editors \n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeru\u2019s Congress Approves Legislation Protecting Pregnant Women and Their Babies\n\nThe measure, sponsored by Congresswoman Rosangela Barbar\u00e1n of the Fuerza Popular party, was approved on March 13 by a vote of 87-18.\n\n\nDiego L\u00f3pez Marina/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Attorneys General Threaten Lawsuit Over Maine Abortion, Transgender Bill\n\n\u2018Maine has every right to decide what Maine\u2019s laws are and how those laws should be enforced.
