Her death comes a year after Poland introduced one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.According to a statement released by relatives, the 37-year-old was experiencing pain when she arrived at the hospital but was \u201cfully conscious and in good physical shape\u201d.The first foetus died in the womb on 23 December, but doctors refused to remove it, quoting the current abortion legislation, and Agnieszka\u2019s family claim \u201cher state quickly deteriorated\u201d. The hospital waited until the heartbeat of the second twin also stopped a week later, and then waited a further two days before terminating the pregnancy on 31 December.Agnieszka died on 25 January after weeks of deteriorating health. Her family suspect that she died as a result of septic shock, but the hospital did not identify the cause of her death in statement issued on Wednesday.\u201cThis is proof of the fact that the current government has blood on their hands,\u201d the woman\u2019s family said in a statement on Facebook. The family also uploaded distressing footage of Agnieszka in poor health shortly before she died.After the termination of the pregnancy a priest was summoned by the hospital staff to perform a funeral for the twins, Agnieszka\u2019s family said.Her death follows that of a woman known as Izabela last September, who died after being denied medical intervention when her waters broke in the 22nd week of her pregnancy. Her family claim the 30-year-old was denied an abortion or caesarean section and that the hospital cited the country\u2019s abortion laws. An investigation found \u201cmedical malpractice\u201d led to Izabela\u2019s death and the hospital was fined.Poland plans to set up register of pregnancies to report miscarriagesRead moreAgnieszka\u2019s family claim that contact with the hospital was very poor and that the hospital refused to share the results of Agnieszka\u2019s medical tests citing confidentiality guidelines. They say the doctors \u201cinsinuated\u201d that Agnieszka\u2019s rapidly deteriorating state could be caused by BSE, commonly known as \u201cmad cow disease\u201d, or Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) and suggested she ate raw meat. The hospital did not reference this claim in their statement.According to the statement from the hospital, Agnieszka tested positive for Covid before her death, although she tested negative twice when first admitted. \u201cWe stress that the hospital staff did all the necessary actions to save the patient,\u201d the statement read. It is not clear whether an autopsy has been ordered.Agnieszka is survived by her husband and three children.The Guardian has contacted the Blessed Virgin Mary hospital for comment.Explore more on these topicsAbortionRights and freedomWomenHealthPolandEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
