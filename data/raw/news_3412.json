The measure overwhelmingly passed the House on February 9 by a vote of 76-19. If signed by Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, Kentucky would join Ohio in exempting severely mentally ill defendants from capital punishment.\nUnder the bill\u2019s provisions, defendants who had active symptoms and a documented diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and/or delusional disorder at the time of the offense would no longer be subject to the death penalty. Defendants seeking to bar capital prosecution under the bill are required to file a motion in the trial court at least 120 days before their scheduled trial date. If the court determines that the defendant meets the statute\u2019s requirements, the case will proceed to a non-capital trial. Unlike a similar measure passed in Ohio in 2021, Kentucky\u2019s law would not apply to those already sentenced to death in the state.\n\n\n\n\nBipartisan support was crucial to passing the law in Kentucky\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature. The 21 co-sponsors of the bill included both Democrats and Republicans. Conservative legislators cited their pro-life views in support of the bill. \u201cYou can\u2019t say we\u2019re pro-life and then say \u2018except.\u2019 There\u2019s no exception, all life has to be precious,\u201d Sen. Stephen Meredith (R-Leitchfield) said. Sen. Julie Raque Adams (R-Louisville) noted that mentally ill defendants would still face consequences for their crimes. \u201cIt in no way absolves defendants of legal responsibilities for their crimes, they can still be tried, convicted, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms including life without parole,\u201d she said. \nCritics of the bill argued that it was unnecessary because juries are already permitted to weigh evidence of mental illness in their sentencing deliberations. Republican Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer, a death penalty proponent, opposed the measure as a \u201cslippery slope for getting rid of the death penalty.\u201d\nA previous bill to prohibit the execution of prisoners with serious mental illness passed the state House in 2021 but never received a vote in the Senate. Rep. Chad McCoy, the bill\u2019s lead sponsor and Republican House majority whip, reintroduced the bill this year but limited the illnesses that would exempt a defendant from the death penalty and added the requirement that the defendant must have been professionally diagnosed with one of the specified conditions. The revisions, he said, were necessary to garner support from key senators. \u201cHere\u2019s the change they needed, and here\u2019s what is does: You now have to have a documented history and diagnosis from a mental health professional, and we define that expressly in the bill,\u201d McCoy said.\nSimilar bills have been considered by other state legislatures in recent years. In 2021, Ohio banned the death penalty for defendants who were severely mentally ill at the time of the offense. This legislative session, Republican lawmakers in Florida, South Dakota, and Tennessee introduced bills banning the execution of people with severe mental illness. The Florida bills died in committee. The South Dakota bill passed the Senate by a 21-14 vote but failed in the House by a vote of 25-43. The Tennessee bills have not advanced as of March 28. \nSince 2017, similar bills have also been introduced in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia. The bills in Colorado and Virginia became moot when legislatures in those states abolished the death penalty.\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\nBruce Schreiner, Kentucky law\u00admak\u00aders vote to put lim\u00adits on death penal\u00adty, Associated Press, March 25, 2022; Bode Brooks, Kentucky Senate pass\u00ades bill to pre\u00advent men\u00adtal\u00adly-ill receiv\u00ading death sen\u00adtence, Fox 56 News, March 25,\u00a02022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Legislative Activity\nMar 05, 2024\n\n\nOklahoma Execution Moratorium Bill Unanimously Passes Committee and Makes Its Way to the State-House Floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Legislative Activity\nJan 12, 2024\n\n\nState Legislative Roundup: New Legislation on the Death Penalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Illness\nDec 21, 2023\n\n\nFormer Death Row Prisoner Craigen Armstrong Pioneers \u200b\u201cVital\u201d Mental Illness Treatment Program in L.A.\u00a0Jail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Policy Issues\n                                \n\n\nArbitrariness\nCosts\nDeterrence\nInnocence\nIntellectual Disability\nJuveniles\nInternational\nMental Illness\nProsecutorial Accountability\nRace\nRepresentation\nSentencing Alternatives\nVictims' Families\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Facts & Research\n                                \n\n\nFact Sheet\nDeath Penalty Census\nClemency\nCrimes Punishable by Death\nDPIC Reports\nHistory of the Death Penalty\nInnocence Database\nMurder Rates\nPublic Opinion\nRecent Legislative Activity\nReligion\nSentencing Data\nStudent Research Center\nUnited States Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Executions\n                                \n\n\nExecutions Overview\nUpcoming Executions\nExecution Database\nMethods of Execution\nBotched Executions\nLethal Injection\n\n\n\n\n                                Death Row\n                                \n\n\nDeath Row Overview\nConditions on Death Row\nForeign Nationals\nNative Americans\nTime on Death Row\nWomen\n\n\n\n\n                                State & Federal Info\n                                \n\n\nState by State\nFederal Death Penalty\nMilitary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                About\n                                \n\n\nAbout Us\nStaff & Board of Directors\nDPIC in the Media\nDPIC Testimony\nPress Releases\nWork for DPIC\n\n\n\nFor the Media\n\n\n\n                                Resources\n                                \n\n\nRelated Websites\nPublications & Testimony\nDPIC Podcasts\nDPIC Reports\nNew Voices\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n                                For Educators\n                                \n\n\nHigh School Curriculum\nTeacher's Guide\nCollege Curriculum\n\n\n\nFact Sheet\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Penalty Information Center | 1701 K Street NW, Suite 750 | Washington, DC 20006\nPhone: 202-289-2275 | Email: dpic@deathpenaltyinfo.org\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy |  \u00a92024 Death Penalty Information Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
