Wade, the Supreme Court has returned abortion to the people and their elected leaders. For the first time in 49 years, states can craft pro-life laws that truly protect unborn human life. Another law, Title IX, has just marked its 50th anniversary\u2014and it\u2019s not going anywhere. Title IX ensures that schools receiving federal funds do not bar women from school, sports or related work.\nTitle IX became law in 1972, a year before the court\u2019s ruling in Roe v. Wade, and is far less controversial than the abortion ruling. So it\u2019s no surprise that in the Dobbs case, a group of over 500 female athletes submitted an amicus brief that tied Roe to Title IX. They claimed that, without access to abortion, they could not have succeeded in their sports.\nRecently, on Title IX\u2019s 50th birthday, the Department of Education released its proposed revisions to the regulations\u2019 meaning. DOE includes \u201cpregnancy or related conditions\u201d under \u201cdiscrimination based on sex.\u201d What related conditions? Childbirth, lactation and \u2026 termination of pregnancy.\nSo, one day before the Dobbs decision returned abortion law to the states, DOE released Title IX language that would enshrine at least some abortions in federal regulation.\n>>>\u00a0Fox in the Henhouse: Biden\u2019s New Title IX Rule Puts Women in Danger\nBecause Title IX is neutral on abortion, it cannot \u201crequire or prohibit\u201d abortion. Under Roe, a woman having an abortion would not be penalized by her school, sport, or job. By neither \u201crequiring nor prohibiting\u201d abortion access in schools, though, Title IX\u2019s language creates a \u201cgray zone.\u201d If a court deems failure to provide access to abortion as discriminatory, then colleges receiving federal funding could do so for students\u2014despite a pro-life law in that state.\nIn Alabama, for example, state law now protects the pre-born child from conception. But the University of Alabama\u2014which receives federal funds\u2014could still give students chemical abortion pills through its campus health clinic.\nTitle IX funding, then, could enable colleges to be \u201cabortion sanctuaries\u201d for students and faculty. This could take the form of campus health clinics distributing chemical abortion pills or abortion referrals.\nIn short, the argument goes, Title IX could ensure surgical abortion access and dispense chemical abortion pills to students. Like \u201ccondom and candy\u201d handouts, this shift would enable colleges to pass out abortion poison pills to young students.\nThis federal workaround will surely lead to legal fights between federal regulators and state governments. Will the gimmick hold up in court? It\u2019s hard to say. But the left, and President Biden, seek\u2014by hook or by crook\u2014to overrule state laws to provide abortion access with federal funds.\nAll of this is based on the myth that women need abortion to be equal with men. But men and women, though equal in value, are different. Sane laws should reflect that fact. And no sane law includes abortion on demand.\nOf course, when abortion is an option for unexpected pregnancies, it becomes the \u201ccheap and easy\u201d method. But how many innovations have we foregone because abortion was the easy way out?\n>>>\u00a0After Supreme Court\u2019s Abortion Decision Conservatives Face a New and Even Greater Challenge\nPro-life laws will help us find out since they will change the incentives on many college campuses. Incentives matter. Schools, for their part, could offer more resources for pregnant students. And post-Roe, pro-life groups can help colleges provide women the help they need in pregnancy and parenting.\nLike the Hyde Amendment, we need to ensure that their college funds go towards supporting students, not killing babies. Along these lines, members of Congress introduced the Protecting Life on College Campus Act (2021). The bill would block federal funds from going to colleges whose health clinics provided abortion access. That money could go, instead, to supporting mothers and families. Rather than asking pregnant women to bear the burden of extra medical bills and a higher cost of living, anti-discrimination measures could ensure that Title IX helps them.\nIn the meantime, conservatives should call out the left\u2019s vile efforts to smuggle abortion into Title IX. This will not be the only approach they try. Expect such tricks so long as the pro-abortion party occupies the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Washington Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
