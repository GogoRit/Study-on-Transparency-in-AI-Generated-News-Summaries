Where do things stand, and what have we learned? Cameron KnightCincinnati EnquirerThousands of Catholic school students and pro-life advocates will rally in Washington D.C. on Friday\u00a0for the March for Life.This marks the 47th year of the march protesting the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling which legalized abortion in all 50 states.But it's more than that. The weekend also draws counter-protesters and advocates. Last year, it overlapped with the Indigenous Peoples March, a one-time event on the heels of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.It was a conglomeration of political action that led to the now nationally-known encounter between Nick Sandmann and Nathan Phillips.A short clip of the two went viral.Sandmann recently tweeted that he's been \"counting down the days\" to the march. In another tweet, on Jan. 18, he indicated he was in D.C. again to give an interview on that very spot.The ClipSandmann was 16, a student at Covington Catholic High School. He was wearing a red Make America Great Again hat.Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist, was playing a drum and singing.They stood face to face.Sandmann did not shout or say anything to Phillips. On video, he does not appear to engage verbally in any way.\u00a0However,\u00a0the images of shouting students surrounding Sandmann and Phillips and the\u00a0interaction between Native Americans and students cast the whole situation in a political light.Twitter exploded with accusations of racism and privilege. News outlets like the Washington Post, NBC, CNN and The Enquirer all began reporting\u00a0the story.The day after the march, the\u00a0Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington issued a statement condemning the action of the students and apologizing to Phillips, an action the bishop would later retract, saying he was bullied and pressured to make.\u00a0Phillips told reporters\u00a0he was trying to defuse a tense situation \u2013 some of the students had just had a loud\u00a0encounter with a group of\u00a0Black Hebrew Israelites. The Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0has labeled\u00a0the Black Hebrew Israelites a hate group that is \"becoming more militant.\"Sandmann identified himself as the teen featured\u00a0in the video in a written statement. He said he was also trying to deescalate the situation because he wasn't sure why Phillips had approached him and the other students.In the meantime, more footage of the encounter was released offering more context.Weeks later, a third-party investigation paid for by the diocese reported that the students did not \"instigate the incident\" and that\u00a0no evidence was found showing students made \"offensive or racist statements.\" The report states: \"We found no evidence of offensive or racist statements by students to Mr. Phillips or members of his group. Some students performed a 'tomahawk chop' to the beat of Mr. Phillips' drumming and some joined in Mr. Phillips' chant.\"The lawsuitsA few months after the incident, Sandmann and his family sued the Washington Post, NBC and CNN for libel and defamation.\u00a0They have also threatened to sue other news organizations, including The Enquirer.\u00a0The suit against the Washington Post said the paper's coverage was like a\u00a0\"modern-day form of McCarthyism.\"Sandmann's\u00a0attorneys claimed the Washington Post\u00a0incorrectly characterized the teen as the aggressor in the situation and exposed him to public ridicule.The lawsuit states said the false \"gist\" of the coverage was that Sandmann \"assaulted and/or physically intimidated Phillips\" and \"instigated a confrontation with Phillips and subsequently engaged in racist conduct.\"CNN has settled its\u00a0case. The details of the settlement have not been made public.The Sandmann family and its\u00a0lawyers declined to discuss the case,\u00a0the incident or the aftermath with The Enquirer for this story.NBC and the Washington Post are still in going through the legal process.A separate lawsuit was filed on behalf of eight unnamed Covington Catholic High students against specific journalists and celebrities. That case is also working its way through the court system.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, actor Kathy Griffin, author Reza Aslan and activist\u00a0Shaun King were among those named in the suit.Where it\u00a0standsMany of the defamation and libel claims brought forth by Sandmann's lawyers, L. Lin Wood and Todd McMurtry, have been dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge William Bertelsman.However, the judge has allowed one specific portion of the case to continue: three statements from the Washington Post that say Sandmann\u00a0\"blocked\"\u00a0Phillips and \"would not allow him to retreat.\"\u00a0Bertelsman said the amended complaint also argues that Phillips \"deliberately lied\" and \"had an unsavory reputation.\" The new complaint also states the Washington Post should have known about Phillips due to the previous coverage of him.The NBC lawsuit boils down the same issue \u2013 whether quoting Phillips as making these statements qualifies as a statement of fact or opinion.Bertelsman\u00a0ordered that discovery can continue so Sandmann's legal team can make requests for\u00a0internal Washington Post and NBC documents like emails and communications between editors and reporters.The impactGeorge Freeman is the executive director of the\u00a0Media Law Resource Center Center in New York City.He\u00a0said, legally,\u00a0the situation and subsequent lawsuit may not have much impact on libel law. He called the legal questions concerning the claim of Phillips being \"blocked\" are a close call.A potentially bigger conversation, Freeman said, is about the duty of the media in an ongoing news situation.Should the media talk try to talk to every side in a given situation before reporting anything? Freeman said that 50 years ago, this is exactly what journalists were taught.But in today's social media environment, Freeman said things have changed: \"It's already out there.\"\"Not going on the air because we haven't spoken to every witness is ludicrous,\" Freeman said. \"You do the best you can with the information you have at the time. That's what the media did.\"However, Freeman said, in the long term, the media could be pushed to do a better job of letting readers and viewers know what information may be available that has not yet been gathered.He said readers and viewers could be told who hasn't yet had\u00a0a voice in the story or whose\u00a0side of the story is missing.The Enquirer reached out to the Sandmann family, their lawyers, the\u00a0Diocese of Covington, Covington Catholic High School and Nathan Phillips, as well as to several families with students who attend the school. Reporters also contacted the Archdiocese of Cincinnati\u00a0and a number of Catholic high schools to see if they were making changes to how March for Life trips are handled.
