James Allard, running for his third term, talked issues outside the polls in Chichester on primary day. Allard lost his seat. (Annmarie Timmins | New Hampshire Bulletin)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was six Republicans, not Democrats, who sponsored the bill adding an exception this year to the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban for a fatal fetal anomaly. And anti-abortion groups made sure their constituents knew.\nDays ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary, campaign fliers hit mailboxes in Pittsfield and Chichester, telling residents their Republican state representative, James Allard, was a \u201ccultural liberal.\u201d Similar mailers arrived in Newbury and New London, saying their long-time House representative, Dan Wolf of Newbury, had \u201cabandoned women and preborn babies.\u201d Rep. Brodie Deshaies, a Wolfeboro Republican, was also targeted.\nOf the four sponsors who sought reelection, only Wolf beat his challenger handily. Deshaies and Allard, who said he was \u201clambasted\u201d by negative mailers, lost their seats. Another cosponsor, Rep. Bonnie Ham of North Woodstock, faces a recount after results showed her beating her opponent by just two points.\u00a0\nCornerstone Action, among the anti-abortion groups that targeted Republicans who supported exemptions, celebrated the defeats on Twitter Wednesday.\n\u201cLittle-discussed aspect of last night: a purge in state House primaries of multiple GOP incumbents who have supported abortion up to birth. Some will be returning to Concord only because no pro-life candidate ran against them,\u201d the tweet said.\u00a0\nIn a second tweet, Cornerstone Action wrote, \u201cGOP representatives who persist in promoting the slaughter of viable six through nine-month-old babies in NH should realize their days in office as Republicans are numbered.\u201d\nThe sponsors of exemption for fatal fetal anomalies acknowledged their controversial votes on other bills related to education, right-to-work, or parental rights could be at play in their primary fates. Still, as Cornerstone Action\u2019s tweet indicated,\u00a0 Wolf and Ham and Republicans who favored exemptions have not cleared the abortion hurdle yet.\nThe general election will be the first time most voters head to the polls since GOP lawmakers passed the state\u2019s 24-week abortion and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\nIf there was any doubt abortion would be on the November ballot, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham guaranteed it with his announcement Tuesday that he will seek a 15-week nationwide abortion ban with exceptions for only rape, incest, and a mother\u2019s life or health.\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNH Survey Center and political science professor, said the outcome will come down to which side of the debate can turn out more voters.\n\u201cThe (Roe v. Wade) decision is certainly something that is motivating,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats are absolutely pushing that because that is something where you got a large group of people that are angry about that. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be as high as they think it is because it\u2019s really hard to stay angry.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund sounded the alarm the morning after the primary. \u201cResults from New Hampshire\u2019s state primary set the stage for a fight for abortion rights, as voters in the November 8 general election will elect state and federal legislators with unprecedented power to control our bodies and our future,\u201d its statement read.\nCornerstone Action tweeted out its support for Graham\u2019s proposed abortion ban shortly after he announced it. \u201cGraham likely calculated that this bill would serve to expose Democrats as pro-abortion extremists,\u201d it said.\nRep. Jess Edwards, an Auburn Republican, led the effort that got 71 House Republicans to join him in passing the fatal fetal anomaly exception but hasn\u2019t faced the same kind of attacks from anti-abortion groups. Asked about getting like-minded voters to the polls in November, Edwards said the party needs to better explain its support for abortion restrictions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are not very good at fundraising off abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most responsible Republicans think what we ought to do is just stick with the law as it is because we still have a public education challenge to make sure the public understands the law. They need to understand that our critical concern is that at 24 weeks we are dealing with a yet-to-be-born baby that has human rights.\u201d\u00a0\n  Rep. Dan Wolf, a Newbury Republican, was targeted by anti-abortion groups for sponsoring legislation adding exceptions to the 24-week abortion ban. (Screenshot)\nIt will be months before we know what abortion-related bills will make it before lawmakers in January. But some are certain.\u00a0\nRep. Alexis Simpson, an Exeter Democrat, has filed a \u201clegislative bill request\u201d seeking to reintroduce a bill tabled this year that would prevent the state from further restricting abortion\u00a0 by codifying the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks in state law. That could pick up some Republican support, said Anna Brown, executive director of Citizens Count, which tracks legislation and candidates\u2019 positions on dozens of issues.\nIn responses to one of the organization\u2019s recent surveys, nearly two dozen Republican candidates said they would support a state law guaranteeing the right to an abortion prior to 24 weeks gestation. If they win their general election, Democrats will need their votes to succeed.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Kurt Wuelper, a Strafford Republican and chairman of the anti-abortion caucus, told the Concord Monitor earlier this month that he expects efforts to further restrict abortion will return after failing last session. Among those is bill that would have allowed any man, without proving paternity, to halt a woman\u2019s abortion for weeks with a court petition. Another would have prohibited abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.\nStill unclear is whether Democrats will renew their efforts to repeal the abortion ban or loosen it with additional exceptions for rape, incest, and the mother\u2019s health. If this session is any indication, the first will get virtually no Republican support and the latter will face a challenge from even Republicans who voted for adding the fatal fetal anomaly exception.\u00a0\nAs introduced, House Bill 1609\u00a0 included exceptions for rape, incest, and the mother\u2019s health.\u00a0\nIn interviews before the primary, Wolf and Deshaies said they dropped their support for those additional exceptions after talking with fellow Republicans.\u00a0\n\u201cThere were reservations even that I had regarding the health exception, which I thought was too broad,\u201d Deshaies. \u201cI think where there was consensus within caucus was if someone is raped or is a victim of incest, that they have up to six months to make that decision on whether they would receive an abortion.\u201d\nWolf, the bill\u2019s prime sponsor, said, \u201cI\u2019m satisfied where it ended up. I\u2019m very comfortable with it.\u201d\nDeshaies\u00a0 said campaigning ahead of the primary convinced him the law is in line with most voters\u2019 position on abortion.\n\u201cI think voters are really paying attention,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve knocked on a lot of Republican doors. (They say) there should be some basic protections of life but also restrictions on how much the government is allowed to regulate people with any issue, and that includes this very complex issue.\u201d\u00a0\nA few days before the election, Allard of Pittsfield received an email from an angry constituent saying he was removing his campaign sign from his yard. Allard asked the man to be more specific but guessed he was angry about his vote on abortion or perhaps his votes on bills related to parental rights and private school vouchers, both of which he joined Democrats in rejecting.\nAllard hasn\u2019t second guessed his work on abortion.\n\u201cWhen those bills come to the floor, you have to deal with them as you think is best for the greatest number of constituents,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to let the chips fall where they may. If you get the occasional call, \u2018I\u2019m throwing away your sign,\u2019 I guess you can\u2019t win them all.\u201d\nAllard said he would have been unlikely to support further exceptions. And he\u2019s persuaded by House leadership\u2019s assurances that it won\u2019t push for further restrictions.\n\u201cI\u2019m rather proud that 1609 is on the table now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also agree with what I\u2019m hearing from (Republican) leadership that, for the time being, New Hampshire does not need to be digging in even deeper. We haven\u2019t even seen the effects of the decision made last year. I am hoping in the coming sessions that this subject will be left alone and allowed to percolate.\u201d\nIt\u2019s safe to say it won\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAbortion will be on the November ballot.
