They vowed to return each year until the ruling, which established the right to abortion, was no longer the law of the land.Supreme court declines to speed challenge to Texas abortion limitsRead moreOn Friday, anti-abortion activists from across the country braved sub-zero temperatures and the coronavirus pandemic to assemble in Washington, more hopeful than ever that this would be their last march to a court where the fate of Roe will soon be decided.\u201cWe are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life,\u201d Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, told a crowd tens of thousands strong and waving signs that read \u201cI am the post-Roe generation\u201d and \u201cThe future is anti-abortion\u201d.Praising followers for standing against what she called the \u201csingle-most critical rights abuse of our time\u201d, Mancini said they sent a clear message to the supreme court: \u201cRoe is not settled law.\u201dChris Smith, a Republican congressman from New Jersey, described the mood as one of \u201cfresh hope and heightened expectations\u201d. The court\u2019s conservative supermajority appears open to reversing Roe, thereby overturning nearly 50 years of precedent since the 1973 decision.\u201cThere\u2019s optimism in the air, there is a sense that a significant hurdle to protect the unborn is about to move,\u201d he said.The rally took place a day before the 49th anniversary of the Roe decision. The theme of the march, also in its 49th year, was \u201cequality begins in the womb.\u201d Speakers told rally-goers that their cause was bound up with the struggles for racial justice and gender equality and described abortion as \u201cthe ultimate form of discrimination\u201d.The march typically draws about 100,000 abortion opponents by the busload to Washington. But this year\u2019s march took place amid a wave of Omicron infections in the nation\u2019s capital that limited turnout.Some activists said on social media they would not attend because of a new mandate in Washington requiring anyone over the age of 12 to show vaccination proof before entering restaurants, conference centers and other public places.Still, the event attracted a large and enthusiastic crowd, priests, pastors and busloads of high school students, among them. Together after the rally they marched to the supreme court singing hymns and chanting \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Roe v Wade has got to go!\u201dThe jubilant demonstration comes as the supreme court reviews a case involving a Mississippi law which bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a direct challenge to Roe. At oral arguments, several members of the court\u2019s conservative bloc appeared open to not only upholding the ban, but to overruling Roe entirely. A decision is expected by the end of June, months before the midterm elections.\u201cWe\u2019ve been building to this moment,\u201d said Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia who spoke on a virtual panel organized by the March. Her group was active in helping confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court, part of a decades-long legal strategy by abortion opponents to remake the nation\u2019s federal court system.\u201cWe heard justices say that precedent shouldn\u2019t be upheld if it was incorrectly decided in the first place,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal.\u201dSeveral Republican lawmakers appeared on stage and virtually to voice their unwavering support for the anti-abortion cause, declaring that the movement was \u201cwinning this battle\u201d.Last year, states enacted more than 100 new abortion restrictions, a record, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports reproductive rights and tracks state-level legislation. The group has called 2021 \u201cthe worst year for abortion rights in almost half a century\u201d, and estimates that 26 US states are \u201ccertain or likely\u201d to immediately ban abortion if Roe is overturned.And conservative states are already laying the groundwork for new restrictions as fights over issues like telemedicine and abortion pills gain momentum.Though the anti-abortion movement has made significant legal and policy gains in recent decades, public opinion polls have consistently found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or some circumstances.\u201cIf Roe falls, the battle lines will change,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cBut make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states.\u201dKelly and Greg King, a married couple from Los Angeles, who were attending the event for a third time, said the supreme court decision would likely push their state to expand abortion access. They worry about plans to make California a \u201csanctuary\u201d for out-of-state patients seeking reproductive care in a post-Roe legal landscape.Clear-eyed about the state\u2019s progressive politics, Kelly King said she would focus her efforts on \u201cchanging hearts\u201d rather than changing policy.\u201cAbortion has become \u2026 \u201d Kelly King said, searching for the word. \u201cNormalized,\u201d her husband chimed in. \u201cYes, normalized,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201dHours before marchers arrived on the National Mall, the supreme court declined to accelerate a legal challenge to a Texas law that has effectively banned abortions in the second-largest state.Yet among the speakers, there were few references to that victory or to the Texas law, which is deeply unpopular, including among Republicans.Pro-choice supporters also marked the anniversary, using the occasion to \u201csound the alarm\u201d on the threat posed to reproductive rights.Mini Timmaraju, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, warned that a \u201csmall but vocal minority\u201d was \u201cdetermined to undermine the will of the majority of people in this country who support reproductive freedom\u201d.\u201cThey falsely claim to be supporters of \u2018equality\u2019 all while working ardently to block abortion access and end the legal right to abortion,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMake no mistake \u2013 this movement\u2019s end goals would only criminalize and endanger people based on pregnancy outcomes, furthering inequality.\u201dAt the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki noted the anniversary of Roe v Wade during her press briefing, saying that \u201creproductive healthcare has been under extreme and relentless assault ever since, especially in recent months\u201d.She said the Biden administration was committed to working with Congress to pass federal legislation essentially enshrining into law a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. The Democratic-controlled House passed the bill last year, but it remains stalled in the Senate, where it faces a Republican filibuster.\u201cWe\u2019re deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care and we will defend it with every tool we have,\u201d Psaki said.At the rally, the presence of Make America Great Again hats was a reminder of the mutually beneficial relationship forged between Christian conservatives and Donald Trump, who became the first sitting president to attend the event in 2020.As they gathered, Trump voiced his allegiance: \u201cAs you gather together today for the March for Life, I am with you in spirit!\u201dWhile many of the speakers anticipated the end of Roe, several demonstrators said they would continue to attend future marches until its mission \u201cto make abortion unthinkable\u201d was achieved.\u201cI just pray every year that this is the last year we\u2019re here,\u201d said Janice LePage, who works for the youth ministry in the Archdiocese of St Louis. \u201cI\u2019m praying that the following year will be a march of celebration.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionWashington DCUS politicsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
