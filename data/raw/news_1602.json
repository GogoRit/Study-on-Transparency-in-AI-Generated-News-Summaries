(AP) \u2014 Legislation considered Wednesday in a Missouri state Senate committee would bolster the state\u2019s abortion ban.Republican Sen. Mike Moon\u2019s measure would add a line to the Missouri Constitution that says: \u201cNothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion.\u201d\u201cLet the voters weigh in on this,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThey will confirm with us that life is precious, and it should not be snuffed out prematurely through abortive actions.\u201dAbortion is already outlawed in Missouri. A law banning the procedure kicked in last year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Since then, abortion-rights advocates have been talking about trying to restore access to abortion via ballot measures, although no proposals have been filed yet. In Missouri, citizens can amend laws and the Missouri Constitution by going directly to voters through referendums or initiative petitions. \n\nBallot measures allow voters to sidestep lawmakers, a tool that has previously been used to address policy issues that voters disagree with the Legislature on or politically sticky issues that lawmakers refuse to take up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked to clear up abortion bans, GOP leaders blame doctors and misinformation for the confusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to know about the latest court rulings, data and legislation on abortion in the US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench Senate approves a bill to make abortion a constitutional right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoon\u2019s measure would also need voter approval if it\u2019s passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature by the end of session in mid-May. Abortion-rights advocates asked lawmakers to vote down the proposal. \u201cHere we are explaining again that abortion bans have devastating consequences for the patients and communities being denied this essential care,\u201d said Vanessa Wellbery, vice president of policy and advocacy at Advocates of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
