Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling reinstated Wisconsin\u2019s ban on all abortions except those done to save a pregnant person\u2019s life.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaul argues the 19th century abortion law shouldn\u2019t be enforced because it conflicts with newer state abortion laws. That includes a less restrictive law from 1985, which criminalizes providing an abortion only if it\u2019s done after the point of fetal viability. In his motion to dismiss the suit, Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski rejected the notion that Wisconsin\u2019s abortion laws are in conflict with each other, as well as the AG\u2019s assertion that Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 law is \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d Urmanski, a Republican, has said previously he would enforce Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban.Along with Urmanski, Kaul\u2019s suit also names Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne and Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, both Democrats, as defendants. Urmanski, Ozzane and Chisholm have jurisdiction in the only three Wisconsin counties that were home to legal abortion clinics just before Roe was overturned.Joining Kaul in filing the lawsuit is the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services, the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and Dr. Sheldon Wasserman, who chairs that board. In order to prove they have a legal basis to sue, Kaul and the other plaintiffs need to show how they\u2019ve been harmed by the 1849 law, said Barbara Zabawa, an attorney who specializes in health care law compliance.That could be tricky since no one\u2019s been prosecuted under Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban in recent history. Even so, a group of doctors that supports abortion rights is intervening in the case, arguing the status quo creates confusion. Additionally, Kaul has argued the ban should be considered obsolete because it hasn\u2019t been enforced in so long. Zabawa said providers need clarity on the legal status of abortion in Wisconsin.\u201cWe have two sets of laws on abortion in the state,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that we do get some clarification on how they can either coexist, or if one needs to go away. Because it\u2019s hard, I think, when you have statutes that imply different positions on an important issue like this.\u201dGracie Skogman, a lobbyist with Wisconsin Right to Life, acknowledged Thursday\u2019s hearing is a \u201csmall step\u201d in a protracted legal saga that will likely make its way to Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court.\u201cFrom our perspective as pro-life advocates here in the state, every day that this law is in effect, lives are being saved,\u201d Skogman said. \u201cWe have met women who have their children here today because of the law and women who have had their lives changed because they have been directed to pregnancy resource centers, and receive life affirming care and support there. And that is where our focus is regardless of the outcome on Thursday, or potentially at the state Supreme Court.\u201dWisconsin\u2019s newly elected Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz has expressed support for abortion rights, and liberals will gain a narrow majority on the court once she takes office in August. \n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide abortion lawsuit without lower court ruling \n\n \n\n\n\nSheboygan County DA to appeal ruling that abortions are legal to Wisconsin Supreme Court \n\n \n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood to resume abortion services in Sheboygan \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA vows to appeal Dane County ruling on Wisconsin abortion law \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
