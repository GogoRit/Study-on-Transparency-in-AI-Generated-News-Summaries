The life-size bronze statue represents Mary's loving protection for all her children, including the oppressed, forgotten and victimized. (Daniel Meloy | Detroit Catholic)\n\n\n\nSt. Benedict Parish in Waterford to install life-size bronze statue as a reminder that Mary cares for all the little ones\nWATERFORD \u2014 Catholics across Michigan are using every medium available to get the pro-life message across on the eve of Election Day, with a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would create seismic changes to the state's abortion landscape. \nThe faithful have hosted information nights, written articles and canvassed door to door \u2014 even University of Michigan football coach and committed Catholic Jim Harbaugh has pro-life radio spots running on WJR 760-AM urging people to vote \u201cno\u201d on Proposal 3. \nBut one parish is invoking an ancient medium to preach a universal truth about God's care for all life: art.\n \n\n\nArtist Mary Dudek points out a detail on the statue of the Blessed Mother, depicted cradling an infant in her arms. (Daniel Meloy | Detroit Catholic)\n\nSt. Benedict Parish in Waterford has commissioned local artist Mary Dudek to craft a statue inspired by 20th century Italian artist Roberto Ferruzzi\u2019s \u201cMadonna of the Streets,\u201d which features Mary holding a little child, which represents the poor, close to her chest. \nThe statue has been two years in the making, but providentially, is being installed the week of the election as a sign of the Blessed Mother\u2019s protection of all life, said Fr. Jim Mayworm of St. Benedict.\n\u201cI\u2019m not at all suggesting it has been timed intentionally that way by us, but providence has handed it that way to make people think about life as Nov. 8 draws neigh,\u201d Fr. Mayworm told Detroit Catholic. \u201cIt might be installed that very day \u2014 Election Day \u2014 but we\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time, using the statue to make people think about babies in the womb and afterward.\u201d\nThe statue will be installed in St. Benedict's bell tower garden behind the parish, which has become the \u201cmain entrance\u201d to the parish since it leads out into the parking lot.\n \n\n\n\n\nThe statue will be installed in the bell tower garden behind the parish, near the entrance to the church from the parking lot. (Courtesy of Mary Dudek)\n\n\n\n\n\nA boy is depicted picking roses while sitting at Mary's feet. (Courtesy of Mary Dudek)\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thought of the Madonna immediately, at least something of Mary,\u201d Fr. Mayworm said. \u201cWe had to be a little more specific about Mary\u2019s image, and with the pro-life movement going on, the urgency of it, we settled on an image of Mary as having concern for the little ones, particularly maybe those who don\u2019t have parents, the children on the streets, so we came up with idea of the 'Madonna of the Streets.'\u201d\nDudek sketched an adaption of Ferruzzi\u2019s painting and worked with the parish to add more children to the final design to convey the expansive reach of Mary's protection. \n\u201cIt was really inspiring to talk about the designs, because Fr. Jim saw even more, whether victims of abortion, human trafficking and abuse,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cMary is our intercessor. Abortion, trafficking, homelessness \u2014 these problems can be so giant and massive that it can feel like you can\u2019t tackle them yourself, but we can entrust them to the care of the Blessed Mother.\u201d\nThe 5-foot-7 statue depicts the Blessed Mother cradling an infant while a little girl is hiding beneath Mary\u2019s mantle. A boy is tugging on her clothing while another boy is picking roses at Mary\u2019s feet.\n\u201cI took the idea of her mantle being this protective piece, there to protect, to hide, to comfort people who come to her, especially the kids,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cThey are wrapped and nestled inside her mantle, kind of like how you cling to your mom and hold onto her skirt.\u201d\n \n\n\nA young boy is depicted tugging on Mary's mantle. The 5-foot-7 statue is meant to visualize the Blessed Mother's concern for all in her care, including victims of abortion, human trafficking and abuse. (Daniel Meloy | Detroit Catholic)\n\nThe children resemble different ages and races to cover the scope of humanity that looks to Mary as an intercessor, Dudek said.\nDudek crafted a model of the statue for parishioners to view to help raise some of the $42,000 necessary for its creation. Most of the cost is being covered by a philanthropic group that supports religious art. \nThe smaller model has also been used for Marian enthronement in the homes of St. Benedict parishioners, Fr. Mayworm said.\n\u201cThe feedback has been very good,\u201d Fr. Mayworm said. \u201cMary (Dudek) spoke once from the sanctuary to talk to all the people after Mass. That went over well. They knew most of the funds were coming from philanthropy; we just needed a little more to get this project over the line.\u201d\nDudek wants those who view the statue to see the humanity in the children, the forgotten and abandoned. \n \n\n\nFr. Jim Mayworm of St. Benedict Parish in Waterford, left, and artist Mary Dudek unveil Dudek's new statue, \"Madonna of the Streets,\" inspired by 20th century Italian artist Roberto Ferruzzi's painting of the same name. (Daniel Meloy | Detroit Catholic)\n\nReligious art has long been used to spur action, charity and advocacy for the disadvantaged, Dudek said. And at time when the fate of the disadvantaged is on the ballot, she wants the statue to serve as a reminder that Mary intercedes for all in need, regardless of election results. \n\u201cAfter the statue is installed this week, hopefully after the defeat of Proposal 3, it will serve as a reminder to keep coming to the Blessed Mother and to showcase the beauty of motherhood,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cWhether through birth or adoption or through foster care, the kids represent different ages, boys, girls, different ethnicities and all representatives. I hope people see this piece as celebrating the beauty of all human life.\u201d\n \nUnleashed: Called to Create\nWatch a video documentary featuring Mary Dudek's work on the Unleash the Gospel website.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\tShare:\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Copy Permalink\n Print\n\n\n\t\t\tSuggested reading\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nSt. Matthew Parish on Detroit's east side receives national historical designation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nWhen it comes to changing hearts, prayer works, former abortionist tells volunteers\n\n\n\n\nSacred art\nParish life\nPro-life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nGospels hold clues for role of women, men in the Church, panel says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a hostile world, the vocation of Christians is to hope, pope says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPapal envoy asks prayers for peace, solidarity with victims of war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidates, catechumens take final steps on their journey to Catholic Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints Detroit\u2019s Bishop Battersby to lead Diocese of La Crosse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nLocal\nNational/World\nVatican & Pope Francis\nSports\nArts\nClergy Assignments\nObituaries\nEspa\u00f1ol\nArchives\n\n\nMedia\nVideo\nPodcasts\nGalleries\n\n\nVoices\nArchbishop Allen H.
