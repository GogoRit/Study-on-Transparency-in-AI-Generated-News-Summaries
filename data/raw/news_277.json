But from now abortions will be rightly treated as a health issue,\u201d Little said in a statement.\u201cThe previous law required a women seeking an abortion to go through many hoops. That resulted in delays to access a procedure, and that was less safe. The changes agreed to by parliament will better ensure women get advice and treatment in a more timely way.\u201dKey elements of the bill that passed through parliament included removing abortion from the Crimes Act, allowing women to choose abortion up to 20 weeks after consultation with a GP, and promoting counselling options for women choosing an abortion.Terry Bellamak, the director of Alranz Abortion Rights Aotearoa, celebrated the move, saying it heralded a progressive step forward for New Zealand.\u201cFinally the New Zealand parliament has brought abortion legislation into the 21st century \u2013 it only took 44 years,\u201d Bellamak said. \u201cFinally after 44 years, New Zealand parliament has recognised that women have bodily autonomy \u2013 and that is huge. Being able to control one\u2019s fertility is key to one\u2019s life \u2013 it is hard to see how we could achieve equality without that.\u201dPreviously under New Zealand law, abortion was allowed only in cases of incest, \u201cmental subnormality\u201d or foetal abnormality, or where the physical or mental health of the mother was at serious risk. Other factors that were taken into consideration but were not grounds in themselves included \u201csexual violation\u201d and \u201cextremes of age\u201d.Jail terms of up to 14 years for those who procured a termination were possible under the Crimes Act, but the law was never enforced and women who underwent abortions were not liable for prosecution. But Little said the change was nevertheless needed.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAbortionAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMacron says battle for abortion rights is not over as France updates constitution8 Mar 2024MPs\u00a0and campaigners accuse Polish government of betrayal over abortion laws7 Mar 2024 France makes abortion a constitutional right in historic Versailles vote4 Mar 2024French move to make abortion a \u2018guaranteed freedom\u2019 gains big win in lower house30 Jan 2024Abortion rights will be in French constitution next year, Macron vows29 Oct 2023Woman in Malta charged in court for having abortion1 Jun 2023\u2018I will do the same again\u2019: activists continue fight against Poland\u2019s strict abortion laws 24 May 2023Japan approves abortion pill for the first time29 Apr 2023France moves closer to making abortion a constitutional right24 Nov 2022Malta drafts law allowing abortion if mother\u2019s life or health at risk21 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
