At the visit, the clinic\u2019s doctor began the standard procedure, then veered off course. She noted that Willams was \u201cparticularly hairy for a woman.\u201d The doctor asked her a series of questions surrounding her body hair, suggesting possible hormone tests to \u201chelp with the hair.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nWilliams felt uncomfortable at all the clinic visits that followed. \u201cThe age of the doctor seemed to inflict an implicit bias on my body,\u201d she said. \u201cNo advice seemed impartial. I felt judged and critiqued\u2026. I never felt [like I was] at a nonpartisan physician\u2019s office.\u201d \n\nThis story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words.

The Student Nation program is made possible through generous funding from\u00a0The Puffin Foundation. \n\n\nClark Atlanta University, like many historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), was founded privately on Christian principles. In practice, this frequently means its administrators, professors, and even its doctors, are protected when voicing religious/moral beliefs, even in settings where it may seem inappropriate.\nHBCUs were built on the radical premise of ensuring black Americans access to institutions of higher learning at a time when there were no other options. But despite their radical beginnings, HBCUs are frequently socially conservative, focusing on black radicalization through the lens of cis-gender heterosexual men at the expense of women and the LGBTQ+ community. In Williams\u2019s case, on-campus women\u2019s health care can feel like an experience preserved from decades ago.\nThis conflict plays out in many different ways at HBCUs, but one in particular is stark: Only 12 of the 101 HBCUs across the country officially recognize their campus\u2019s Planned Parenthood Generation Action chapters. The youth-led branch of Planned Parenthood has set up chapters primarily at college campuses in order to assist youth in working \u201cfor their generation in order to achieve reproductive freedom.\u201d Chapters across the country organize around and educate their peers about sexual health.\nOne of the 12 HBCUs that have recognized their Generation Action chapter is Clark Atlanta University. The chapter was founded in 2018 by now-alumna Belinda Freeman. Freeman worked for two years prior to that to establish the chapter as a chartered campus organization.\nClark Atlanta\u2019s campus chartered organizations must have a minimum of two on-campus advisers and submit to college administration a tentative calendar of events and the parent organization\u2019s constitution and bylaws. As simple as these terms might be, Freeman struggled with \u201cestablishing trust between all of the stakeholders and identifying potential allies. Our cause fell under the purview of the admissions office, student affairs, student health, the counseling center. We allied within these offices and that helped with the trajectory of our club.\u201d Because of this, the chartering process stretched for years.\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\n\n\nDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wild History of \u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Voting\n\nThe Wild History of \u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Voting\n\n\n\nGinny Hogan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Can\u2019t the Political Press Just Say the Truth About Trump?

Dillard said that she \u201cdid not realize how much of a traditional school Clark Atlanta was\u201d until she became the chapter president.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have a mission for the organization with restrictions. We tried to do an abortion event here and they [the administration] were just making us jump through hoops to make it happen, so we ended up throwing it at Spelman,\u201d she said, referring to the college\u2019s sister institution within the Atlanta University Center. \u201cWhy are we trying to censor students here over a health issue?\u201d\nThe university, Dillard said, needs to understand that students have already had abortions and will have them\u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of how easily they can get information about doing so safely and effectively. \u201cY\u2019all should want students to have access to those resources,\u201d she said, addressing her university\u2019s administrators. Clark Atlanta University did not respond to requests for comment.\nAman Tune, a senior at Hampton University, an HBCU in Virginia, has gone through the same issues with her administration as the vice president of her campus\u2019s Generation Action chapter. It is currently not recognized as a campus organization.\nShe and fellow student Michyah Thomas worked to establish the chapter as a campus organization two years ago. The organization was not approved \u201cbecause outside organizations cannot provide health care\u201d on private campuses. Tune said she explained to administrators that Generation Action is not a health care provider\u2014it simply provides access to reproductive health information on campus. Still, the chapter has remained unchartered at Hampton for the past two years. The chapter remains afloat by partnering with recognized campus organizations such as the NAACP, which has helped to put on events such as a \u201cStand With Black Women\u201d homecoming float and the Period Pantry Project. When asked to comment on Thomas and Tune\u2019s experience, Hampton University did not respond.\nAs a result of Tune\u2019s involvement with her chapter, she spoke at the National Planned Parenthood Conference in 2018 and has gone to several conferences with the organization. She is now in the HBCU working group, which assists in the development and planning for HBCU chapters. There, she and other volunteers from HBCUs discuss the types of events they can do, and what to do to try to overcome administration opposition.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood Generation Action chapters are a critical part of the student organizing movement overall,\u201d said Monica Massamba, Planned Parenthood\u2019s national campus organizing manager. \u201cThe most successful chapters begin from a relentless commitment to protect reproductive health and rights. Students who are seeking to start a chapter at their HBCUs should know that young people are the next generation, and currently some of our most fearless leaders for social justice and change. We need them, and we are here to help them grow and lead.\u201d\nIn the growing need for reproductive justice, these young organizers are paving the way for their fellow students to have unlimited access to nonpartisan sexual health resources. They just hope their campuses will see it this way, too.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
