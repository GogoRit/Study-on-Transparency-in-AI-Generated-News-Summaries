Wade case.\n    \n\n            State Sen. Jason Rapert, who filed the bill which would only allow abortions in the case of ectopic pregnancies or when the life of the mother was endangered, called the move \u201cthe trigger\u201d to begin the process of pushing the nation\u2019s highest court to rule on Roe. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis is a direct response to the 60 million-plus innocent babies who have had their lives taken,\u201d he told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n    \n\n            To be clear: Conservative-leaning states \u2013 primarily in the South and Midwest/Plains \u2013 have worked diligently in recent years to pass legislation that restricts when and where a woman can have an abortion. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, 15 states \u201cintroduced, moved or enacted six-week abortion bans in 2019: Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.\u201d\n    \n\n            What\u2019s different with what\u2019s going on in Arkansas right now is that the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court has changed dramatically over the last few months. The death of liberal giant Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the nomination and confirmation of conservative Amy Coney Barrett in her place has shifted the court clearly to the right.\n    \n\n            In fact, Barrett\u2019s views on Roe v. Wade were a regular feature of questions lobbed her way by Senate Democrats during her confirmation hearings. Barrett, however, offered little guidance as to how she might vote if a case challenging Roe came before her. \n    \n\n            As CNN\u2019s Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue wrote last month:\n    \n\n\u201cThe debate over the future of abortion is where it was before the hearings began: Barrett as a law professor working at a Catholic university made clear that she was opposed to abortion and as a judge voted twice to revisit her colleagues\u2019 opinions that struck down abortion restrictions. In addition, she had to supplement her record when CNN reported upon undisclosed talks she gave as a law professor to student groups that oppose abortion.. After hours of testimony, however, Barrett never strayed from her mantra: As a judge she would follow the law and leave her personal opinions aside.\n\n\n\u201cMy policy views, my moral convictions, my religious beliefs do not bear on how I decide cases nor should they, it would be in conflict with my judicial oath,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\n\n            That lack of clarity from Barrett hasn\u2019t stopped Republican lawmakers from drawing conclusions about how she \u2013 and the court \u2013 may rule if a challenge to legalized abortion eventually came before it. \n    \n\n            \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for the opportunity to do that,\u201d Rapert, the Arkansas Republican, said of the court and overturning Roe. \u201cThey have to have the right case or the right piece of legislation before them to do that.\u201d\n    \n\n            Maybe! And because Barrett has been on the court for less than a month \u2013 she was confirmed October 27 \u2013 we don\u2019t yet have any similar rulings in which she played a part to analyze.\n    \n\n            But it\u2019s also worth remembering that the most recent major decision by the Supreme Court on abortion did not go the way pro-life activists wanted. In a 5-4 ruling in June, the court declared a Louisiana law that banned doctors from performing abortions unless they had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital as unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed to the court by Republican President George W. Bush, sided with the majority.\n    \n\n            In short: Figuring out exactly how each of the nine justices will vote on any given case is no easy task. But as evidenced by Arkansas\u2019 latest efforts, it is becoming clear that we are likely to see some serious challenge to Roe appear before the court in the not-too-distant future.\n
