Curtis\n\nPosted September 10, 2020 at 6:00am\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent phone conversation \u2014 a catch-up during COVID isolation \u2014 a longtime friend talked of a memory that seemed especially relevant these days. A fellow cradle Catholic, whom I met at a Catholic university, she recalled how startled she was on entering my childhood parish for my decades-ago wedding and finding herself surrounded by statues of the saints and Christ on the cross, familiar to her but so very different. The faces and hands and pierced feet were painted black, so unlike anything she had experienced growing up.\nIt stopped her, until she realized how appropriate the scene was. Of course, these representations would be reimagined in the image of those who gathered and worshipped in this particular holy place, located in the heart of West Baltimore.\nIt opened her eyes and, at that moment, expanded her worldview. The incident was one among many that inched our friendship toward a richer, more fulfilling space, where we could see the world and its gifts, as well as its inequities, through one another\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\nI thought of that friendship, its fissures illuminated and bonds strengthened in a church pew, in the context of a 2020 election that reveals a faith divide as deep as ever in America, as stark as black and white, but with many shades of gray.\nWhere faith diverges\nFor too many who would identify as persons of faith, the words of the holy books \u2014 with encouragement from leaders who profess to have all the answers \u2014 serve as invitations to close hearts and minds rather than reach out to the unfamiliar.\nEliminating diversity programs that teach a complete and complex American history to add more all-American voices \u2014 as the Trump administration insists on doing \u2014 is akin to covering your eyes and ears to eliminate inconvenient reality while your house crumbles around you. That vision of America, moving forward without hearing voices from communities of color, without looking back to examine the origins of their discontent, leaves no room for the kind of evolving relationship that I share with my friend.\nBut for some, standing in a hardened hands-over-ears truth is easier than starting conversations with those whose belief systems and lived experiences offer a different, often challenging, point of view. It means ignoring those marching in the streets outside the doors of churches, synagogues and mosques, crying out for justice.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s the pity.\nThe\u00a0Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u00a0famously chided his fellow Christian pastors, as well as many of their congregants, for being more devoted to order than to justice. His words could be spoken today, when a narrow definition of faith and values allows many to support a president who is making demonization of \u201cthe other\u201d \u2014 the stranger, the poor and the immigrant \u2014 a campaign cornerstone.\nWe hear much about President Donald Trump\u2019s strong support among the majority of\u00a0white evangelicals,\u00a0not as much about the Black pastors and preachers and their allies of every race, whose views of the creator\u2019s plan raise up a commitment to racial and economic justice.\nThis election cycle, I expect the president\u2019s numbers among white evangelicals to stay high, driven by the administration\u2019s\u00a0pro-life policies\u00a0and championing of what it calls \u201creligious freedom\u201d issues, which often translate into hostility toward the inclusion of LGBTQ Americans and their right to serve in the military or get equal access to health treatments.\nDefine pro-life more inclusively, as many other Christians, particularly those of color, do, and you add to the mix leaders who hold both major political parties to account when it comes to serving Americans who are poor or in need, about whom much is written in Scripture.\n\n\n\n\u2018Change the narrative\u2019\nAs a continuation of its \u201cNational Call for Moral Revival,\u201d the Poor People\u2019s Campaign plans a \u201cMoral Monday on Voter Power\u201d\u00a0on Sept. 14, an online\u00a0training on\u00a0voter protection and participation. A report released by the campaign found that just a small increase in\u00a0the number of poor and low-income voters could change the political landscape. Campaign co-chair Rev. William J. Barber II has expressed frustration that the issues that affect low-income and poor Americans are often bypassed in campaign rhetoric and are not seen as moral imperatives, even as more families slip into economic uncertainty. The campaign is working to \u201cchange the narrative,\u201d Barber told me this week, centering on \u201chow you treat the poor and the immigrant and the worker and the children who are alive, and women at the margins.\u201d\u00a0Both presidential candidates have been invited to share their agenda at the Monday event. Joe Biden\u00a0is scheduled to speak for 10 minutes; Trump, Barber said, has not responded.\nBiden has said that the lessons of his own faith motivate him, and he would be the\u00a0second Catholic president,\u00a0if elected. But though the Catholic vote is not a monolith, it, too, follows familiar patterns, with voters choosing according to party loyalty, and generally divided by race. In 2016, white Catholics leaned Republican and Catholics of color favored Democrats.\nJohn F. Kennedy,\u00a0the first Catholic president, famously said in a 1960 speech to fearful Protestant ministers: \u201cI do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me.\u201d\nIn 2020, at the Republican National Convention, former Notre Dame football coach\u00a0Lou Holtz\u00a0praised Trump, and called Biden \u201cCatholic in name only\u201d for his support of the Democratic Party\u2019s pro-choice platform, questioning the nominee\u2019s faith and his heart in a way I was taught never to do.\n\n\n\nAt the Democratic convention,\u00a0Sister Simone Campbell, the executive director of\u00a0NETWORK\u00a0Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and leader of \u201cNuns on the Bus,\u201d\u00a0delivered a prayer. On a recent call for \u201cCatholics for Biden,\u201d she said, \u201cSingle issue has never been our faith,\u201d and as an example pointed to the \u201cequally sacred priorities\u201d list from\u00a0Pope Francis,\u00a0which proposes that \u201cfaith does not fit into political parties neatly.\u201d In June,\u00a0the pope said: \u201cWe cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life.\u201d\nIn a statement announcing\u00a0an open letter\u00a0from national Catholic social justice leaders, scholars and several retired officials from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, released on Wednesday by\u00a0Faith in Public Life Action, Campbell said: \u201cI vote to protect people in poverty, the elderly and migrants. I vote to reject racism in all of its forms. Donald Trump acts far outside these norms.\u201d\nWell, he is the president who\u00a0defends\u00a0white vigilantes attacking protesters, as long as they support him, and calls\u00a0anti-racist\u00a0training \u201canti-American propaganda.\u201d\nSo how does one \u201ckeep the faith\u201d?\nThis week, the\u00a0Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States\u00a0released\u00a0\u201cContemplation and Political Action,\u201d\u00a0not a voting guide, but rather a spiritual document, it said. \u201cSometimes in discernment, you try on the position that is opposite to your own,\u201d explained one of its authors in\u00a0America magazine. \u201cYou listen to the other side, not just with your pad and pencil, ready to refute it, but to ask yourself why someone might hold this position.\u201d Sounds just like a lesson from the Jesuits who taught me and my friend well.\nBut in a polarized country, that may be too much to ask, even for true believers.\nMary C.\u00a0Curtis\u00a0has worked at The New York Times, The Baltimore Sun, The Charlotte Observer, as national correspondent for Politics Daily, and is a senior facilitator with The OpEd Project.
