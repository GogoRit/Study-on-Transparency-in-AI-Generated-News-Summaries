She and colleague Peter Grant were the only two SNP MPs to vote against lifting Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion ban in 2018. Last year the Bishop\u00a0of Paisley intervened after it looked as if she would face deselection over the row.\n\n\n\n  Groups said the MP\u2019s support of groups protesting outside abortion clinics would damage the mental health of those seeking the procedure.\u00a0\n\n\n  Speaking to The Ferret, Jillian Merchant from Abortion Rights Scotland: \u201cGiven that this legislation, if passed, would not apply in Scotland, and that the SNP do not generally vote on \u2018English-only\u2019 issues, this not only calls into question Dr Cameron\u2019s priorities but also demonstrates the lengths she is willing to go, as a law-maker, to inflict her anti-choice views on other women.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u201cWomen should not have to run a gauntlet of protestors, be shouted at, have their decision-making questioned and be confronted with pictures of foetuses on their way to accessing routine healthcare.\u201d\n\n\n  Merchant said the fact that the vote was a proxy vote submitted on Cameron's behalf by the SNP\u2019s Chief Whip, Patrick Grady, was particularly concerning.\n\n\n\n  She said this called\u00a0into question \"the SNP\u2019s commitment to abortion rights\u201d.\n\n\n  Merchant added: \u201cThe SNP, as well as Dr Cameron, should be held accountable for why they think it is acceptable for women to be harassed while accessing routine healthcare.\u201d\n\n\n  A spokeswoman for Scottish Women\u2019s Aid said: \u201cWe find it unfathomable that any politician would vote against this bill, but particularly a politician with a responsibility for mental health, when women have told us for decades about the impact that limiting access to reproductive rights has on their mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\n\n  Scottish Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said that women seeking to access reproductive health services \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to worry about avoiding demonstrations outside clinics\u201d.\n\n\n  Responding to the criticisms, Cameron told The Ferret: \u201cPrior to coming into politics, I worked as a clinical psychologist in mental health for over 20 years and on no occasion did anyone ever call into question my suitability because I am a Christian with pro-life views.\n\n\n  She added: \u201cThis was entirely a conscience vote by proxy, submitted on my behalf by the SNP Chief Whip, and it was also commensurate with the parliamentary review that national buffer zones are not a proportionate response, as legislation already exists to restrict protest activities that cause harm to others.\u201d\n\n\n\n  Huq's Ealing\u00a0constituency was the site of UK's first abortion clinic buffer zone.\u00a0\n\n\n  The 100-metre exclusion zone around the Marie Stopes centre was impleimplemented by the council after women complained of being intimidated.\n\n\n  The protesters said they were there to provide help.\n\n\n  Speaking in the House of Commons, Huq said lockdown \"had provided some respite\" from protesters but \"now they are at it again.\"\n\n\n  She told MPs that staff at her local clinic reported \"being hounded themselves\" while women missed appointments or turned up in tears.\n\n\n  She said women did not need \"to be met by lifelike medically inaccurate foetus dolls and graphic images, to be handed misleading literature, be called \"Mum\" and told they'd go to hell\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Westminster\n Politics\n\n \n\n \nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Why are you making commenting on The National only available to subscribers?\n        \n\n  We know there are thousands of National readers who want to debate, argue and go back and forth in the comments section of our stories. We\u2019ve got the most informed readers in Scotland, asking each other the big questions about the future of our country.\n\n\n  Unfortunately, though, these important debates are being spoiled by a vocal minority of trolls who aren\u2019t really interested in the issues, try to derail the conversations, register under fake names, and post vile abuse.\n\n\n  So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to make the ability to comment only available to our paying subscribers. That way, all the trolls who post abuse on our website will have to pay if they want to join the debate \u2013 and risk a permanent ban from the account that they subscribe with.\n\n\n  The conversation will go back to what it should be about \u2013 people who care passionately about the issues, but disagree constructively on what we should do about them.
