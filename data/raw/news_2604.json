In view of the declarations of the President, Lacalle Pou, on the \"pro-life\" agenda that the government is going to implement, we say that we are not willing to go back on the rights that have been won.\"\n\n \"Uruguay must have strong protection for unborn children, that there must be a policy to discourage abortions, that Uruguay in its Constitution and accordance with the ratified covenants understands that there is life from conception and, in that sense, an unborn child has rights\" Lacalle stated.\nAbout a legal abortion bill, the mandatary explained that current legal disposal already\u00a0supports that issue.\u00a0 According to Lacalle, his government has a different stand from the political forces who signed the law.\u00a0\nThe Head of State explained that as he had announced during the campaign, his government has a \"pro-life\" agenda, which it would fulfill during its mandate.\n\n\n\nMuy malas se\u00f1ales est\u00e1 dando el Presidente. Primero se\u00f1ala la violencia de g\u00e9nero como da\u00f1o colateral, luego que el gobierno es pro vida, una definici\u00f3n perniciosa. Todos somos partidarios de la vida. El gobierno debe garantizar el ejercicio de los derechos. \u2014 Carolina Cosse (@CosseCarolina) \n   May 5, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The President's giving out very bad signals. First, he points to gender-based violence as collateral damage, then he points out that the government is pro-life, a pernicious definition. We are all pro-life. The government must guarantee the exercise of rights.\"\n\n Broad Front party senator Carolina Cosse rejected Lacalle\u2019s declarations. Cosse affirmed that abortion\u00a0is\u00a0a personal choice and a women\u2019s right to decide about their bodies and maternity.\u00a0\nCongresswoman Cristina Lustenberg said that \"a policy of discouraging legal abortion will be a regressive proposal in terms of rights, on an issue lauded by Uruguayan society, which questions the pillar of laicism of the State.\nUruguay has a legal abortion policy\u00a0since 2012.\u00a0 It can be performed within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy or 14 when pregnancy results from a sexual assault.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nUruguay\nAbortion\nWomen's rights\n\n\nPeople\nLuis Lacalle Pou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n                                                        Nodal\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n                                                            \n                                                            \n                                                            \t \n                                                            \n                                                                by teleSUR/gq-la\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUruguay: Broad Front Submits Motion Against Right-Wing Law \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUruguay: Nationals Returning Flights Extended Until May\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUruguay: Lacalle Evaluates Trade Possibilities Despite Health E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUruguay: Constructive Work Resumes Despite Measures by COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                            Comment on facebook   ()\n\n\n\n \n                           Comment on teleSUR (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nSign In or Register to leave a comment, use the forums and more\n\nSign In\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost with no comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nAbout teleSUR\nAbout Us\nContacts\nTeam\n\nTerms of Use\nteleSUR Apps\nSatellite Coverage\nRSS\nPublic Procurement\n\n\nSections\nLatin America\nWorld\nSports\nCulture\nTechnology\nOpinion\nMultimedia\nVideos\n\n\nServices\nServices Catalogue\n\n\n\nSpanish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our news bulletins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa nueva Televisi\u00f3n del Sur C.A.
