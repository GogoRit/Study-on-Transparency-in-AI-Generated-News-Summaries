(Getty Images)\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade this summer, as revealed by a leaked draft opinion released early last week by Politico. If the Supreme Court moves forward with its original opinion, access to abortion care will be curtailed in the U.S., but what many people may not realize is that people going through a miscarriage will also be affected.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen a pregnancy ends in miscarriage and the fetus is not expelled naturally, the pregnant person has three options: wait for their body to expel the pregnancy on its own (called \u201cexpectant management\u201d); take medication, typically mifepristone and misoprostol (commonly called the abortion pill); or use surgical management, including dilation and curettage (D&C) and aspiration to remove the tissue from the uterus.\nSome states could implement abortion bans that take the latter two options away from people experiencing miscarriage, as the medication and surgical procedures used are the same as those used for abortions.\n\u201cThis places them at grave risk,\u201d said Dr. Jen Villavicencio, the lead for equity transformation at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and an OB-GYN with a specialty in complex family planning. \u201cNo one facing a medical crisis should have to fear their physician pausing, or even halting, when in the midst of doing what the patient needs in order to resolve or avoid the threat of prosecution.\u201d\u00a0\nOne state that could feel the impact is Louisiana, which recently introduced HB 813, known as the Abolition of Abortion in Louisiana Act of 2022, criminalizing abortion. The bill doesn\u2019t specify pregnancy loss, but the ACLU of Louisiana has confirmed the law would extend to people who experience a miscarriage. Georgia\u2019s abortion ban, however, contains an exception for miscarriage.\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights has estimated that if Roe is overturned, roughly half of the states will enact restrictive laws or seek to enforce currently unconstitutional laws that ban abortion.\n\u201cThe individuals writing these laws are not medical experts,\u201d Villavicencio said. \u201cLaws like abortion restrictions and bans are not based in science or evidence and, therefore, the language does not coincide within the practice of the highest quality, evidence-based care. The language is often incorrect, not clinically meaningful, and therefore confusing to those practicing medicine \u2026\u00a0 Pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, and the treatment of those complexities require nuanced, individualized care\u2014something that is very difficult when faced with unscientific, non-medical laws.\u201d\u00a0\nBetween one-third and one-half of all pregnancies end in miscarriage before the person knows they are pregnant, and about 10-20% of people who know they are pregnant miscarry.\u00a0\nFor people who miscarry and choose to go the expectant management route, one issue they run into is not knowing when it will happen.\u00a0\n\u201c[Expectant management] can take two days, it can take two weeks, it can take over a month,\u201d said Dr. Meera Shah, a health care provider and chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic in New York. \u201cSome people choose expectant management, but many people want to plan for when exactly they\u2019re going to start cramping and bleeding and expelling the pregnancy.\u201d\nThe process can be painful and messy, and it can take time, so some patients choose surgical management to avoid enduring the physically and emotionally difficult process of cramping and bleeding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more patient-centered and compassionate to be able to offer the full menu of management options for a patient who may be experiencing a miscarriage, especially if it\u2019s a desired pregnancy,\u201d Shah said. \u201cSome people just want it to be over with.\u201d\nSometimes, patients who miscarry bleed excessively and \u201cneed to have procedural management to prevent hemorrhage. And these options need to be readily available for managing patients for these reasons,\u201d Shah said.\nMiscarriage can be traumatic, even when the person\u2019s chosen option to manage it goes as planned. Nearly 20% of women who experience a miscarriage become symptomatic for depression or anxiety, and in most of those cases, symptoms persist for one to three years, affecting quality of life.\nA 2021 study of 275 women who miscarried found that about one-quarter of women who experience an early pregnancy loss are at an increased risk of major depression, and this risk was significantly higher for Black women than it was non-Black women.\u00a0\nEven if abortion bans don\u2019t explicitly ban miscarriage management options, they may have the practical effect of reducing the number of providers willing to use them, therefore limiting access to people who miscarry.\n\u201cThat is a possibility, because what the anti-abortion movement has done is that they like to instill fear among abortion providers to prevent them from managing our patients in a way that\u2019s founded in science and centered around the patient,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same reason that there are fewer providers in hostile states\u2014because they\u2019ve just created this atmosphere of fear.\u201d\nRestricting care for miscarriage may instill fear in patients as well. \u201cPeople may fear criminalization if they go to the emergency room for hemorrhage, if they go to their doctor\u2019s office for a miscarriage,\u201d Shah said. \u201cPatients get really confused by the headlines and the laws and what all the restrictions actually mean, and they actually may not seek care.\u201d\nUnder Texas\u2019 SB 8, which bans abortions after about six weeks, pharmacies have reportedly declined to fill prescriptions for misoprostol.\n\u201cWe are hearing anecdotally that obstetrician-gynecologists and other involved specialists are already facing questions and uncertainty about whether the care they are providing to their patients is exposing them to potential legal action,\u201d Villavicencio said. \u201cThis is not in the best interests of patients, and it\u2019s an affront to the patient-physician relationship.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRestricting care for miscarriage may be especially harmful to BIPOC and low-income people who are disproportionately likely to lack access to medical care in general. Black women are also twice as likely as white women to have a miscarriage in weeks 10-20 of pregnancy, and they are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women.\n\u201cThe impact of bans and other restrictions will be felt by countless people, but we cannot forget that the greatest harm will fall on communities of color, people without robust financial resources, and people who live in rural areas where ready access to care is already limited,\u201d Villavicencio said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBarring patients and providers from certain care is one thing, but criminalizing them is another.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching, intensely frustrating, and a violation of my oath and duty to care,\u201d Villavicencio said. \u201cI worry so much that instead of being able to dedicate all of my expertise, mental energy, and attention to treating my patient in front of me, I have to also think about whether or not I will face consequences, some criminal, for offering the most appropriate, individualized, and evidence-based care.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nRelated\n \n\nTagged: abortion,\u00a0abortion bans,\u00a0georgia,\u00a0louisiana,\u00a0miscarriage,\u00a0new york,\u00a0News,\u00a0race,\u00a0reproductive freedom,\u00a0reproductive healthcare,\u00a0reproductive justice,\u00a0reproductive rights,\u00a0roe v. wade,\u00a0sb 8,\u00a0supreme court,\u00a0texas \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllison Torres Burtka\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllison Torres Burtka is a freelance writer and editor in the Detroit area.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore by Allison Torres Burtka\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tSearch\t\t\n\n\n \n\t\t\tCategories\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRace\u00a0(797)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPolitics & Democracy\u00a0(453)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGender & LGBTQIA+\u00a0(427)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrime, Reform & Abolition\u00a0(387)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomy & Workers' Rights\u00a0(306)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTags\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\u00a0(933)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCOVID-19\u00a0(224)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFeature\u00a0(216)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tracial justice\u00a0(188)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalifornia\u00a0(150)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYear\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2024\u00a0(82)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2023\u00a0(371)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2022\u00a0(423)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2021\u00a0(386)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2020\u00a0(489)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nOur Latest Stories\n\n\nHow the media facilitates climate criminality\nMarch 18th, 2024\n\n\nNever eat the candy on your pillow: Release\u00a0\nMarch 18th, 2024\n\n\nCivil rights attorneys win settlement in \u2018Don\u2019t Say Gay\u2019\nMarch 14th, 2024\n\n\n\u2018Bad River\u2019 documents tribal band\u2019s fight against Enbridge pipeline\nMarch 14th, 2024\n\n\nUniversities in Florida eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion positions\nMarch 13th, 2024\n\n\nRollbacks to child labor protections are on the rise\nMarch 13th, 2024\n\n\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get updates that make you think and act\u2014directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\t\t\t\tBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.
