One by one, they describe how their genitals had been cut as part of rituals of initiation and the unbearable pain they were forced to endure. \nAdamant that their daughters should not suffer the same treatment, most of the women say they regret ever supporting the brutal practice.\nA few steps away from them, the male leaders discussed how the community could tackle this problem.\nAnd then, what was thought impossible, happened.\n\n\t600 girls saved\nWhile global leaders and activists met in the UK to tackle female genital mutilation (FGM) at the Girl Summit 2014\u00a0in July, communities in Sierra Leone have been taking huge leaps towards ending this horrific tradition.\nAfter days of discussions and negotiations held at a series of workshops run by us and local organisations, the community signed a Memorandum of Understanding that bans female genital mutilation for girls under 18. Any woman over 18 has to give her consent before the procedure takes place.\nWithin a month of the Memorandum being signed, around 600 girls were saved from mutilation in the Masungbala Chiefdom.\n\n\tWhat is female genital mutilation (FGM)?\nSierra Leone is one of the world\u2019s worst offenders for FGM \u2013 90% of women are subjected to the practice. FGM, sometimes known as \u2018cutting\u2019, involves removing all or part of the external genitalia for non-medical reasons.\nOften it\u2019s done by someone with no medical training, using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razors \u2013 and without anaesthetic.\nGirls and women who have it done often suffer from severe pain, bleeding, shock, difficulty in passing urine, infections and sometimes even death. Many also suffer difficulties during labour, decreased sexual enjoyment and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nCommunity leaders and members who support and practice FGM say it is necessary to protect a woman\u2019s \u2018honour\u2019, believing that women\u2019s sexuality must be controlled.\n\n\tFGM in the UK\nDespite being illegal for nearly 30 years, it\u2019s estimated that around 170,000 women and girls in the UK have undergone the procedure.\nIt is still a taboo subject \u2013 even here, where the first prosecutions only came in 2014 \u2013 and well-entrenched in many societies.\nAt this week\u2019s Girl Summit 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron announced new steps to combat FGM in the UK, including:\n\n\n\t\tDoctors, social workers and teachers will be legally obliged to report all cases.\n\n\t\tParents will face prosecution if they fail to stop their daughters undergoing FGM.\n\n\n\tWe must break the silence\nThis is by no means the end. There is so much more to do to wipe out this brutal tradition.\nWe\u2019re working to raise awareness among targeted communities in Sierra Leone and helping them take action to fight FGM. We\u2019re focusing on a number of human rights issues affecting the local communities.\nSo far, the workshops have been so positive that hundreds of communities across the country have since followed suit and banned the harmful practice.\n\u2018It is very difficult for people to talk about these issues but as the communities have a strong tradition of dialogue, we called the community members together to discuss the dangers of female genital mutilation. It became clear that people knew they wanted to tackle the issue but did not know how to go about it. Now the process has completely changed the lives of many women and girls.\u2019\nArun Turay, Coordinator of the Advocacy Movement Network (AMNET), who worked with us to run the workshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          18 May 2020, 05:54pm\n        \n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related\n\n\nBackground: Why we work on women's human rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While you\u2019re here\u2026\nLike you, we are horrified by the violence and the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We\u2019re calling for an immediate ceasefire by all parties in the occupied Gaza Strip and Israel to prevent further loss of civilian lives.
