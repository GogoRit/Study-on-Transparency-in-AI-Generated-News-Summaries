The decision was the culmination of a lawsuit filed by Causa Justa, an umbrella group representing various women\u2019s health and reproductive rights organizations. It argued that the criminalization of abortion discriminates against women.More on:\n\nLatin America\n\n\nWomen and Women's Rights\n\n\nColombia\n\n\nMaternal and Child Health\n\nPreviously, a woman could only get an abortion under three circumstances: if the pregnancy was a result of rape, if the fetus was deformed, or when the woman\u2019s life was threatened. (An abortion that doesn\u2019t meet any of these criteria is still a criminal offense after twenty-four weeks of pregnancy.) Otherwise, both patient and doctor could be sentenced to up to fifty-four months in prison. Since 1998, there have been some 5,500 investigations into alleged illegal abortions and 250 women handed criminal sentences.\n\n \n\n\n      Women demonstrate in front of Colombia\u2019s constitutional court in support of removing abortion from the penal code.\n      Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters\n\n\nAdditionally, the court instructed Congress to create a new law to expand access to contraceptives, sexual education, and other reproductive health services.\nHow does this fit into regional trends?\u00a0\nCurrently, only six Latin American countries have made it legal to get an abortion on request. These include Cuba, starting in the 1960s, and Uruguay, since 2012. Nine countries, mostly in Central America and the Caribbean, prohibit the practice altogether. Most other countries fall in the middle, permitting abortions under certain circumstances, such as pregnancy due to rape or incest. Advocates for women\u2019s reproductive rights say such restrictions have made abortion a dangerous procedure: the Guttmacher Institute reports [PDF] that only one in four abortions in the region meets the World Health Organization\u2019s standards for medical safety and that around 760,000 women are treated annually for resulting complications.\nMore From Our Experts\n\n\n\n\n                            Will Freeman\n                              \n\n\n\n                                Haiti Mission Lacks Interlocutor Plus Peruvian Congress Purges Top Judges\n                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Linda Robinson\n                              \n\n\n\n                                Hafsat Abiola: Invest in Women to Accelerate Progress\n                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Ann Norris\n                              \n\n\n\n                                The Nexus of Human Trafficking, Democracy, and Corruption  \n                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World This Week\n\n\nA weekly digest of the latest\u00a0from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

These demonstrations started as a way to hold the government accountable for the country\u2019s high rates of femicide but evolved to encompass broader demands. In 2018, tens of thousands of women wearing green took to the streets to call for legalizing abortion, and protests continued until 2020, when Argentine lawmakers voted to do so.\nArgentina\u2019s ruling spurred a \u201cgreen wave\u201d throughout the region. Since then, Mexico\u2019s supreme court ruled that criminalizing abortion is unconstitutional, Ecuador\u2019s legislature made abortion legal in cases of rape, and Chilean lawmakers began seeking to guarantee women\u2019s reproductive rights through the country\u2019s new constitution. In Colombia, activists also wore green in the weeks leading up to the court\u2019s decision. \u201cWe now know that there\u2019s a bigger and more connected movement around abortion in Latin America,\u201d says Cristina Rosero, a lawyer and spokesperson for Causa Justa.More on:\n\nLatin America\n\n\nWomen and Women's Rights\n\n\nColombia\n\n\nMaternal and Child Health\n\nHowever, a few countries have moved in the opposite direction: last year, Honduras embedded its absolute abortion ban into its constitution.\n\n\nWhat is the debate around abortion rights?\nReligion plays a prominent role in the debate throughout Latin America, where churches are among the most trusted institutions, according to public polling. The Catholic Church and fast-growing Evangelical movement teach that life begins at conception and abortion in all cases is a moral evil. Religiously conservative politicians, including Colombian President Ivan Duque and former President Alvaro Uribe, have thus protested the new ruling.\nBut supporters say the green wave is improving women\u2019s health and helping to break down stigmas around abortion. Rosero highlights the importance of public dialogue. \u201cWe had a strategy to bring information, to talk about this openly, to basically eliminate some myths and prejudices around this topic,\u201d she says. On some occasions, advocates have embraced religion as a platform for expanding reproductive rights. For example, Cat\u00f3licas por el Derecho a Decidir (Catholics for Choice) in Colombia played a significant role in the push for decriminalization.\nSupporters further argue that decriminalization won\u2019t increase the number of abortions but will instead help women avoid clandestine procedures that can be dangerous, pointing to data indicating a decrease in abortions in countries with fewer restrictions. Global human rights bodies maintain that denying women access to abortion is a violation of their rights [PDF] to health and privacy.\n\n\n\nRead More\nLegal, Safe, and Affordable\n\nvia Think Global Health\n Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes next?\nAttempts to reverse the ruling in Colombia have few paths forward. Legislative efforts would likely be considered unconstitutional by the high court, and the court would have to review any referendum before it could take place.\nPushback could come from other countries, however. Referring to Argentina\u2019s 2020 decision, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro vowed that he would never allow such a law to pass. And while abortion rights are steadily expanding worldwide, the debate is becoming similarly heated in many places, including the United States.\u00a0\nAntonio Barreras Lozano is an editorial intern at CFR.\u00a0Will Merrow helped create the map for this In Brief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Commons\n\n\n\n\n      Creative Commons: Some rights reserved.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\nView License Detail\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Explore More on Latin America\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n            Haiti\n          \n\n\n\n\nHaiti\u2019s Troubled Path to Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbled by foreign interventions, political instability, and natural disasters, the former French colony is paralyzed by multiple crises.\r\n\n\nBackgrounder\n\n              by Diana Roy and Rocio Cara Labrador\n March 4, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Latin America\n          \n\n\n\n\nCentral America\u2019s Turbulent Northern Triangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States continues to seek strategies for responding to the growing number of migrants fleeing poverty, violence, and other challenges in the Central American region.\r\n\n\nBackgrounder\n\n              by Diana Roy and Amelia Cheatham\n July 13, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Americas\n          \n\n\n\n\nThe Organization of American States\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Organization of American States is an important forum for regional diplomacy and has become more assertive in promoting the rule of law, human rights, and fair elections as some states face domestic upheaval.\r\n\n\nBackgrounder\n\n              by CFR.org Editors\n October 19, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Top Stories on CFR\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            United States\n          \n\n\n\n\nCampaign Roundup: Joe Biden Opposes the Sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Friday, I look at what the presidential contenders are saying about foreign policy.
