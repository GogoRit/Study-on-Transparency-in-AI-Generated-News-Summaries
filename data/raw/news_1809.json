What are the exceptions? Stephen Gruber-MillerDes Moines RegisterGov. Kim Reynolds will sign a law Friday that bans nearly all abortions after cardiac activity can be detected in the embryo, which can occur around six weeks of pregnancy.It's a dramatic curtailment of abortion rights in the state, where the law previously allowed abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.But the law does include some exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, and for medical emergencies that endanger the life of the pregnant woman. The law also allows abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities.More:Iowa lawmakers pass 6-week 'fetal heartbeat' abortion ban; Reynolds to sign bill FridayHere's what to know:What are the exceptions to Iowa's new 'fetal heartbeat' abortion law?Here are the cases where abortion may be performed after six weeks of gestation:For rape, if the rape is reported to law enforcement or to a public health agency or doctor within 45 days.If the pregnancy is the result of incest, if the incest is reported to law enforcement or a public health agency or doctor within 140 days.If \"the attending physician certifies that the fetus has a fetal abnormality that in the physician's reasonable medical judgment is incompatible with life.\"For a miscarriage \"if not all of the products of conception are expelled.\"For a \"medical emergency,\" which is defined as \"a situation in which an abortion is performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy\" or when continuing the pregnancy \"will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\"The medical emergency exception does not include psychological, emotional or familial conditions or the woman's age.More:Abortion providers sue to block Iowa's new 6-week 'fetal heartbeat' abortion banWill Iowans be able to qualify for the abortion ban's exceptions?Doctors, Democrats and other opponents of the bill argued during Tuesday's special session that the exceptions in the law are vague and difficult to qualify for.Dr. Francesca Turner, an OB-GYN and member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said the language in the bill is ambiguous about when doctors can intervene in cases of pregnancy complications.\u201cAt what point when your wife or your daughter or your sister is having a medical emergency during a pregnancy do I get to save her life?\u201d she said. \u201cAt what moment do I get to intervene? It\u2019s unclear in this bill.\u201dA lawsuit filed Wednesday by Iowa abortion providers echoes that criticism, arguing the legislation uses vague definitions, leaving it up to providers to decide when their patients qualify as having a \"medical emergency.\"\"Patients with rapidly worsening medical conditions may be forced to wait for care until a provider determines that their conditions become deadly or threaten substantial and irreversible impairment so as to meet the exception,\" the lawsuit states.The lawsuit also criticizes the bill for excluding psychological conditions from the definition of medical emergency, \"even though mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of twenty-three percent of pregnancy-related deaths.\"Republicans said the law's exceptions are written broadly and will allow doctors to care for their patients.\"Medical emergency is defined broadly to include any situation in which an abortion is performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman whose life is endangered, and when pregnancy creates a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\" Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, said in her opening comments on the bill.Lundgren said she wanted to clear up \"misconceptions\" about laws around the country that restrict abortion.\"This bill we are passing today will not impact the care provided to women experiencing a miscarriage or having complications with her pregnancy,\" she said. \"Miscarriage is clearly not prohibited in any way in this bill.\"The lawsuit cited the U.S. Department of Justice, saying about 78% of rapes and sexual assaults were not reported to police in 2021.\"Victims of rape and incest often do not report the incidents, whether due to their young age, fear of violence or retaliation by their assailant, or severe trauma and shame,\" the lawsuit states.Lundgren pointed out during debate that cases of rape or incest can also be reported to medical providers. But she said it's important for women to report the incidents not only so they can receive health care but so the perpetrator can be stopped from committing future crimes.\"We don\u2019t talk often enough about what that crime is,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not just about that one person, but we should be stopping that person who is committing these crimes from doing it over and over and over to other women.\"Iowans overwhelmingly support exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant womanEighty-nine percent of Iowans say abortion should be legal if the pregnant person's life is in danger, and 85% say abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, according to an\u00a0Iowa Poll from October.Some Iowans unsuccessfully urged lawmakers to remove some of the exceptions from the bill. In the end, the Legislature passed the bill with the exceptions.Katie Buck, a West Des Moines resident, brought her 7-year-old son, Alex, to a public hearing Tuesday morning. Alex was born with trisomy 18, a genetic complication caused by an extra chromosome. The condition can be fatal.Buck said it qualifies as one of the fetal abnormality exceptions allowed in the bill. She urged lawmakers to remove the exception from the bill.\u201cAlex is 7 years old. How can he be incompatible with life?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no idea how hard we had to fight against this fatal fetal anomaly label to get him the medical care he needed to survive.\u201dStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.
