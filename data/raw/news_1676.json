The groups\u2019 lawyers at the ACLU of Ohio and Democracy Forward further alleged the ban violated Ohio\u2019s home-rule provisions. The city of Lebanon, in southwest Ohio, opted to revise the law rather than defend it in court. Enforcement had been placed on hold while that work took place. Opponents said they dropped their lawsuit Jan. 12 after provisions were removed that made aiding and abetting an abortion a crime, and the law was further clarified to assure that providing transportation, instructions, money or abortion doula services, including counseling, were still allowed.\n\nLebanon\u2019s ban was one of four that cropped up around Ohio in 2021, part of a national effort to ban abortion \u201cone city at a time\u201d by the Texas-based Sanctuary Cities of the Unborn organization overseen by Mark Lee Dickson. \nIt was the first local ban to be challenged nationally after a leak revealed the U.S. Supreme Court planned to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization energized abortion opponents\u2019 state and local efforts to outlaw the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis litigation exposes local ordinance bans as dangerous acts of political theater, and our lawsuit demanded accountability for the logistical and legal nightmare Lebanon\u2019s City Council created,\u201d Maggie Scotece, interim executive director of the abortion fund, formerly Women Have Options-Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cThis win is so unique in the context of our post-Dobbs legal landscape, establishing a strong, united front against these heinous attacks.\u201d\n\nDickson, a Southern Baptist minister who also directs Right to Life East Texas, said the revisions to Lebanon\u2019s ban were of little consequence to the underlying goal of the law: outlawing abortion in the city of about 20,000 beginning at conception.\u201cAbortion remains illegal in Lebanon, so this is a great victory for Ohio,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the opposition claims that we were doing more than we were actually doing. The fact that we clarified our position does not take away from the abortion ban.\u201dThe Ohio opponent groups argued that, despite Lebanon having no abortion clinics, the sweeping ban appeared to require social workers not to discuss abortion when counseling pregnant clients, in \u201cconflict with social workers\u2019 ethical obligation to promote the client\u2019s self-determination.\u201dThe social workers\u2019 association took the position that reproductive freedom is a human right.According to the Texas anti-abortion group\u2019s website, 65 cities and two counties across the U.S. have so far passed similar abortion bans. Dickson said the group will continue its work this year in New Mexico, where the Democratic attorney general has moved to nullify similar local abortion bans, as well attempt new inroads in Nebraska, Kansas and California.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot to do, even though Roe has been overturned, to promote abortion-free communities,\u201d he said. A federal judge has placed Ohio\u2019s statewide ban on most abortions on hold as a constitutional challenge is heard. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost has appealed to the Republican-controlled Ohio Supreme Court to block the federal judge\u2019s order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIE CARR SMYTH\n\n\n                Smyth has covered government and politics from Columbus, Ohio, for The Associated Press since 2006.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
