Wade Supreme Court ruling that made the procedure legal across the country.\nA woman carries an anti-abortion sign on her back during a rally at the Arkansas state Capitol in ...

(AP Photo/Danny Johnston)ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe bill would prohibit all abortions except in cases when it could save the life of the mother, with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest.\n\n\n\nFollowing its easy passage in the Republican-led Arkansas House of Representatives and Senate, the abortion ban bill was sent to the desk of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has signed into law some of the most restrictive abortion measures in the country since he took office in 2015.\n\n\n\nBut Hutchinson has so far hesitated to publicly endorse the sweeping ban now on his desk; his office told Forbes he would announce a decision on the bill next week.\n\n\n\nUnder current Arkansas law, abortion is legal for up to the 20th week of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nIf signed into law, the abortion ban in Arkansas would almost certainly prompt legal challenges. Just one day after South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster approved legislation that would prohibit most abortions last month, it was blocked by a federal court that said it was likely to be found unconstitutional. The so-called heartbeat abortion ban would have made abortions illegal as soon as cardiac activity was detected in a fetus.\n\nWhat To Watch For\nAnti-abortion advocates have increasingly sought to get the issue before the Supreme Court, which was tipped even further to the right by the addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett last year. More than a dozen other states, including Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Missouri, have proposed similar legislation in the past year that would ban or severely limit legal abortions. \u201cBarrett will further solidify the current majority of anti-reproductive health justices on SCOTUS,\u201d the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group, said in a statement last year. \u201cThat voting bloc would have enormous power to rapidly undo progress made toward a more just and equitable country.\u201d\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Gina HeebEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
