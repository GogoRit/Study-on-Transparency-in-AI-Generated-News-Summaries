He said that the three grounds for allowing abortion are still dividing his society.\u00a0\n\nRELATED:\u00a0\nDominican Republic Keeps Haitian Migrants Out of Vaccinations\n\n\"This is an issue where I have to respect the opinion of each lawmaker... I cannot impose a position on representatives who have other ideas stemming from a religious point of view,\" Abinader said.\nLast week, Lower Chamber's Justice Commission rendered a favorable report on the Penal Code's modification without including the exceptions to abortion, thus speaking outrage among women's rights activists.\nFurthermore, several political figures proposed to address the abortion issue in a special law as a strategy to smoothly approve the new Penal Code.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWomen all across the #DominicanRepublic are demanding abortion rights.

In 2019,\u00a0 there were 1,403 cases of rape and 436 incest.\nThe current Penal Code establishes penalties of one up to two years of imprisonment for those who perform an abortion or assist in it. The penalties are four to ten years for\u00a0health professionals.\nIn 2006, Congress approved a bill to amend the Penal Code which was vetoed by former Presidents Leonel Fernandez (2004-2012) and Danilo Medina (2012-2020) given that exceptions to abortion were not included.\n\n\n\n#8M | In Latin American alone, more than 23 million women have fallen into poverty due to social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. pic.twitter.com/yEPTrrdTb1 \u2014 teleSUR English (@telesurenglish) \n   March 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nDominican Republic\nAbortion\nWomen rights\nPenal Code\n\n\nPeople\nLeonel Fernandez\nDanilo Medina\nLuis Abinader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n                                                        Listin Diario\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n                                                            \n                                                            \n                                                            \t \n                                                            \n                                                                by teleSUR/ eh- JF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Dominican Republic Declares Risk of Flooding in 4 Provinces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus Strains Are in the Dominican Republic Since 2020\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Dominican Republic To Build a Wall on the Border With Haiti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Dominican Republic To Implement Energy Sector Reforms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                            Comment on facebook   ()\n\n\n\n \n                           Comment on teleSUR (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nSign In or Register to leave a comment, use the forums and more\n\nSign In\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost with no comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nAbout teleSUR\nAbout Us\nContacts\nTeam\n\nTerms of Use\nteleSUR Apps\nSatellite Coverage\nRSS\nPublic Procurement\n\n\nSections\nLatin America\nWorld\nSports\nCulture\nTechnology\nOpinion\nMultimedia\nVideos\n\n\nServices\nServices Catalogue\n\n\n\nSpanish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our news bulletins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa nueva Televisi\u00f3n del Sur C.A.
