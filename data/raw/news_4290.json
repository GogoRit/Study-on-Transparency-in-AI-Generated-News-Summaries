Churches and other houses of worship were exempted from the start; religious charities, hospitals and universities can direct their insurers to provide the coverage directly. And in 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that privately held corporations with religious objections also could opt out.\u00a0But despite the high court's best efforts, a simmering dispute involving religious nonprofits such as the Little Sisters of the Poor returned Wednesday, four years after the justices urged both sides to settle their differences\u00a0out of court.\u00a0The groups want no part of covering birth control, even if it means just allowing their insurers to do so. The Trump administration took their side, going so far as to exempt groups with moral objections as well. That effort has been blocked by lower courts.\u00a0Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter GuideRoberts, who has emerged as the court's swing vote since Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018, asked U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco if the new exemption was too broad.\u201cThe problem is that neither side in this debate wants the accommodation to work,\" a frustrated Roberts told Paul Clement, the attorney for Little Sisters of the Poor. \"Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences?\"During the third consecutive day of telephonic oral arguments prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, Ginsburg took the offensive against the Trump administration's regulation, even while recovering from a benign gallbladder condition at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\u201cYou have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential,\u201d Ginsburg told Francisco, referring to cost-free coverage for contraceptives. Despite assertions of religious freedom, she said, the solution should not be to \"give everything to one side and nothing to the other side.\"\"The women end up getting nothing,\" she continued. \"They are required to do just what Congress didn\u2019t want.\u201dMore:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joins oral argument by telephone from hospitalAssociate Justice Sonia Sotomayor also criticized the new regulation, noting the administration estimates 75,000 to 125,000 women would lose employer coverage for contraceptives.\u00a0But Francisco said those challenging the exemption, led by Pennsylvania and New Jersey, have not identified any women who would lose all access to contraceptives, such as through government programs.As he has in other such cases, Associate Justice Samuel Alito took up the cause of religious believers. He appeared to have support from the court's other conservative justices.Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the most recent addition to the high court, summed up the dispute near the end of the oral argument, which went 40 minutes beyond the\u00a0 usual hour.\u00a0\u201cThere are very strong interests on both sides here, which is what makes the case difficult, obviously,\" Kavanaugh said, noting Congress, federal agencies and the courts all have weighed in. \"There's religious liberty for the Little Sisters of the Poor and others. There's the interest in ensuring women's access to health care and preventive services, which is also a critical interest. So the question becomes: Who decides?\"Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
