The college also agreed to change its policy in regards to the allocation of student fees to prevent future discrimination in the allocation of funds.[RELATED: UI students want to make it even easier for illegal students to get state funds]\u201cI am very pleased with the outcome of the case. This is a win for everyone,\u201d Nathan Apodaca, the former Students for Life president at the time, told Campus Reform.In addition, the university highlights that all allocation decisions must be viewpoint \u201cneutral\u201d in nature, meaning that the decisions of fund allocation cannot be based on a group\u2019s viewpoint. The new policy also instructed the establishment of an appeal process that would allow a review of a decision to deny funding or restrict access to funds.\u201cWe embrace the notion that universities must be a marketplace of ideas, and that this is essential to the educational process as students critically examine new ideas, learning from the perspectives of others,\u201d the San Marcos campus and the CSU chancellor office told Campus Reform in a joint statement.The university said that while the court had found no evidence that the group was discriminated against, they did admit that the court had found that the funding process was \u201cnot adequately identified and documented\u201d and that the commitment to not discriminate based on viewpoint needed to be expressly set out in the policy writing.\u201cOverall the process was a collaborative effort, by both sides, to strengthen viewpoint neutrality at this very diverse campus,\u201d the statement concluded.[RELATED: Conservative legal group wants Supreme Court to hear this free speech case]As reported by Campus Reform in 2017, the lawsuit had previously been filed after the school had denied a $500 stipend for the group to bring a pro-life speaker onto campus. At the same time, the school was found to have given nearly $300,000 to the school\u2019s gender equity center and the LGBTQ Pride Center on campus.In the initial 43-page lawsuit, ADF alleged that the college\u2019s original student fee policy granted administrators \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d to deny students fees through a lack of a \u201cviewpoint-neutral\u201d policy in allocating funds. The ADF alleged that the policy was a violation of the group\u2019s first and fourteenth amendment rights and promoted viewpoint discrimination against the group.\u201cWhen Students for Life was denied funding to bring in a pro-life speaker, I was told that the policy was that funding was not available for any speakers,\u201d Apodaca said about the event. \u201cI found this odd because I knew that student fees were actually going to fund speakers through a system where the Student Government had discretion to fund or deny speaker requests.\u201dApodaca added that when he went to the student government for funding, the group was rejected as well.\u201cIf student groups are funded with student fees, it should be done on an equal basis, regardless of the viewpoint,\u201d Apodaca said.Apodaca also expressed optimism that the court case would have a profound impact on speech policies on campus universities in the future, stating \u201cother schools are now getting the message that when you try to restrict the exercise of Constitutional Rights, like the freedom of speech, there will be consequences\u201d and served as a reminder that universities are meant to be a marketplace of ideas and \u201cnot turn it into an intolerant assembly-line for only one viewpoint.\u201d\u201cWe are now looking into having our speaker come out to give his presentation to the student body\u2014using the funds from the settlement,\u201d Apodcaca added. \u201cFor all its talk about promoting diversity and inclusion without regard to belief, the University will now finally have the chance to practice what it preaches.\u201dFollow the Author of this article on Twitter:\u00a0@JesseStiller3Share this articleJesse Stiller Former Associate Editor, Daily CallerJesse Stiller is was Associate Editor for the Daily Caller, and now works for Check Your Fact.
