Danny McCormick, R-Oil City, speaks on his bill, HB813, concerning abortion during legislative session, Thursday, May 12, 2022, in the House Chambers of the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge, La. (Hillary Scheinuk/The Advocate via AP)\n\nHillary Scheinuk/The Advocate/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            A businessman turned state representative from rural Oil City, Louisiana, and a Baptist pastor banded together earlier this year on a radical mission. \n    \n\n            They were adamant that a woman who receives an abortion should receive the same criminal consequences as one who drowns her baby.\n    \n\n            Under a bill they promoted, pregnant people could face murder charges even if they were raped or doctors determined the procedure was needed to save their own life. Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,\u201d state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n    \n\n            \u201cNo compromises, no more waiting,\u201d Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. \n\nLouisiana House of Representatives\n\n\n\n            Only four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting\u2014 all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe need to take a deep breath,\u201d said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn\u2019t enough responsibility being placed on men. \n    \n\n            But in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law. \n    \n\n    Men at the helm\n\n\n            A faction of self-proclaimed \u201cabolitionists\u201d are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before. \n    \n\n            Emboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens \u2014 meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail us: watchdog@cnn.com.\n\n\n\n\n            This year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state\u2019s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges \u2014 saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to \u201cspend some time\u201d in the Arizona \u201cpenal system.\u201d And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state\u2019s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.  \n    \n\n            While most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, \u201cabolitionists\u201d are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs \u2014 comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as \u201cslaughter\u201d and \u201cmurder\u201d to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nWhy a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas\n\n\n                            03:50\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n            Bradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the \u201cabolition\u201d bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges. \n    \n\n            An overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don\u2019t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement\u2019s current framing as being focused on \u201cfetal personhood\u201d and \u201cfetal rights\u201d as opposed to maternal rights.\n    \n\n            Eric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren\u2019t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be \u201cpro-life\u201d than women, they \u201care more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.\u201d\n    \n\n            The most restrictive bills, which don\u2019t include explicit \u201clife of the mother\u201d exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nRepublicans have unlikely allies in their fight to restrict abortion at the state level: Democrats \n\n\n\n\n            Those laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. \n\n\n            The Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected \u2014 as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men. \n    \n\n    Encouraging \u2018sacrificial behavior\u2019\n\n\n            Scott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed \u201cbetween a woman and her physician.\u201d \n    \n\n            He remembers watching the classic 80s movie, \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High,\u201d and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn\u2019t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about \u201cthe miraculous nature of life.\u201d Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n    \n\n            His daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a \u201ctrue family-values conservative,\u201d noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n    \n\n            One of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n    \n\n            \u201cSuccess depends on changing hearts and minds,\u201d he said. \u201cI liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.\u201d\n    \n\n            This comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: appropriating the word \u2018abolition\u2019 is particularly contemptuous,\u201d a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThat word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nYasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Herndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual \u201csacrificial behavior.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cIf a mother is in a life raft with a child and there\u2019s only enough food and water to save one, I\u2019m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman\u2019s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment. \n    \n\n            As part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the \u201cintentional killing\u201d of a fetus. \n    \n\n            That way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus. \n    \n\n            Gunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life.\n\nRebecca Blackwell/AP\n\n\n\n            Medical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion. \n    \n\n            Louise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are \u201cdisingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst\u201d and questioned why they \u201ccan\u2019t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cMost of these \u2018arguments\u2019 are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA billboard advertising adoption services targets pregnant women at a bus stop in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S., December 7, 2021. Picture taken December 7, 2021.  REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nEvelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nConservatives have pushed infant safe haven laws as an alternative to abortion. But few American women use them\n\n\n\n\n            An immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person\u2019s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm \u2014 if not destroy \u2014 the fetus. An \u201cequal attempt to save the fetus\u201d would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,\u201d she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care. \n    \n\n            Doctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient\u2019s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive. \n    \n\n            Stories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive.  In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother\u2019s health is at risk, even with so called \u201clife of the mother\u201d exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state\u2019s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. \u201cI\u2019m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,\u201d she wrote on Facebook the next day. \n    \n\n            Another Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state.\n\nBrook Joyner/CNN\n\n\n\n            Herndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother\u2019s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.  \n    \n\n            As chair of his county\u2019s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would \u201cstrengthen\u201d the rights of fetuses. \n    \n\n            After it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman\u2019s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n    \n\n            A heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment. \n    \n\n    No exceptions \n\n\n            Back in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama\u2019s legislature \u2014 a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.  \n    \n\n            When the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state\u2019s female governor signed it into law. \n    \n\n            A federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as \u201ctrigger\u201d laws and six-week \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills, weren\u2019t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned. \n    \n\n            This wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,\u201d said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. \u201cThe real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have \u2013 at least until recently \u2013 been outside the mainstream.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. \n\nJon Cherry/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            And in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent \u2014 one that touts the \u201cBig Lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn\u2019t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n    \n\n            \u201cEven a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,\u201d said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement\u2019s influence on US politics. \u201cSo who you are catering to if you\u2019re the Republican Party is changing.\u201d \n    \n\n            As a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party\u2019s nomination.\n    \n\n            During the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother\u2019s life is at risk. \u201cI don\u2019t give way to exceptions,\u201d said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature. \n    \n\n            Men running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. \u201cThere\u2019s no exception in my mind,\u201d former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn abortion rights demonstrator leads a chant outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., US, on Monday, June 27, 2022. A CBS News poll suggested that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court's decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, which is inflaming a partisan divide on display in comments by senior lawmakers. \n\nEric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nSome big-city district attorneys vow not to prosecute abortion cases, setting up legal clashes in red states\n\n\n\n\n            Mastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. \n    \n\n            While an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman\u2019s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing \u201clife of the mother\u201d exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions \u2014 as seen in several bills recently proposed \u2014 is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure. \n    \n\n            \u201cThat\u2019s going to make it more appealing to punish women,\u201d Ziegler said. \n    \n\n    \u2018Abolitionist, not pro-life\u2019\n\n\n            For pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the \u201cpro-life establishment\u201d is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion. \n    \n\n            He told CNN he doesn\u2019t think someone can be truly \u201cpro-life\u201d while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons. \n    \n\n            Gunter, who \u201cgrew up in church in diapers\u201d and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for \u201cpro-life\u201d candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. \n\nAustin Steele/CNN\n\n\n\n            That day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and \u201cmurder their children.\u201d One of them, Gunter said, couldn\u2019t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother. \n    \n\n            \u201cShe\u2019s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,\u201d said Gunter. \u201cThat day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married\u2026 (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I\u2019d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself  \u2018My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?\u201d \n    \n\n            After that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state \u2014 one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn\u2019t doing enough to outlaw abortion. \n    \n\n            Gunter\u2019s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing \u201cman caves\u201d and selling game room furniture. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. \n\nChris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n            Lawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now \u201cunapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.\u201d He did not respond to requests for comment. \n    \n\n            He and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe have\u2026 a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,\u201d T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly \u201cpro-life\u201d law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions \u2014 not just the medical providers. \u201cAbortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty\u2026they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.\u201d \n    \n\n            Hunter\u2019s group describes itself as \u201cabolitionist, not pro-life\u201d \u2014 echoing Gunter\u2019s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. \u201cWhile many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,\u201d Free the States writes on its website, \u201cabortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.\u201d Hunter told CNN this movement is not \u201cabout wanting to punish women or something silly like that,\u201d and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges \u2014 including fathers. \n    \n\n            \u201cPray for the legislators here,\u201d Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nSee where abortion access is banned \u2014 and where it's still in limbo\n\n\n\n\n            But this time, the prayers went unfulfilled. \n    \n\n            Inside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as \u201cpro-life,\u201d apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, \u201cmakes criminals out of women.\u201d Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far \u2014 including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn\u2019t exist if it weren\u2019t for in vitro fertilization (IVF). \n    \n\n            The bill never went to a full vote. \n    \n\n            It was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year. \n    \n\n            Momentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision.\n    \n\nWhat should we investigate next?
