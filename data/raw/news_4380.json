\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 November 2020\n\nUniversal access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) is one of the key components of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 5. Moreover, it is at the center of the SDGs as it contributes to the achievement of all the other SDGs. Sadly however, in Africa the SRHR goals are those that made little progress during the MDG era. Out of the eight MDGs, the goal of improving maternal health was the one that remained the furthest in terms of achieving targets; no country in the African Region achieved the target 5B on universal access to reproductive health. The SRHR goals therefore require more focus and attention as the continent launches into the SDG phase.\nTo facilitate the advancement of the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCAH) agenda across the Region, the RMNCAH Technical Advisory Group\u00a0has been set up with a key task of advising WHO AFRO on approaches to strengthen the design, dissemination, implementation, tracking and ensuring advocacy and accountability for regional policies and strategies related to RMNCAH.\u00a0\nThe mandate of the RMNCAH TAG will be to provide strategic advice to the Regional Director on how to support countries to accelerate progress towards attaining universal coverage to RMNCAH in the context of the SDGs and regional commitments in these areas.\u00a0The main objective of the meeting is to serve as the official inauguration of the RMNCAH TAG and to initiate a discussion on how the RMNCAH TAG can collaborate with WHO AFRO to accelerate progress in this area.\nAgenda of the meeting\nMembers of the\u00a0Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health Technical Advisory Group (RMNCAH TAG)\nMeeting Virtual Background Image\nSlideshow - Welcoming Members of the RMNCAH TAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp and services\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nGeneral inquiries\n\n\nWHO country offices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO Offices\n\n\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\n\n\nWHO European Region\n\n\nWHO Headquarters\n\n\nWHO Region of the Americas\n\n\nWHO South-East Asia Region\n\n\nWHO Western Pacific Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRss Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
