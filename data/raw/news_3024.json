While all of the chalk messages were positive and loving towards other students and the preborn, both USM staff and students acted in a very pro-abortion manner as they washed the messages away \u2014 despite USM being a Catholic institution. Here\u2019s what happened:\u00a0\u00a0\nAt 6:30 a.m. on a Tuesday, the USM Students for Life members came together to chalk messages throughout the campus. The messages included \u201cAdoption is an Option,\u201d \u201cLife Comes in All Sizes,\u201d and \u201cWomen Need Love, Not Abortion.\u201d Despite the group\u2019s loving and care-centered intentions with chalking the messages, all messages removed from the sidewalks within just two hours of their appearance.\u00a0\n\nGuest post by USM Students for Life Vice President Landry Murley\nBoth students and staff members emerged from the Learning Commons, carrying watering cans filled to the brim and Swiffer mops, and proceeded to scrub away the pro-life messages. This scene closely mirrored other biased efforts through social media and news platforms to censor and silence the pro-life message. Our stance is one of truth that many are knowingly quashing in favor of maintaining peace in the face of the loud and violent pro-abortion minority. \u202f\u00a0\nIt is sad that, despite being a nationally recognized\u202fCatholic institution, the University of Saint Mary has engaged in direct efforts to silence the pro-life message and therefore stand against the Catholic Church\u2019s public stance on abortion. Not only this, but the school has violated the four core values the institution was founded on: community, justice, respect, and excellence.\u00a0\n\n\nHow many millions of preborn children are missing from our communities? Where is the justice for the preborn, the women, and the families whose desperate situations are taken advantage of by the abortion industry every day? Where is the respect for the freedom of speech of the pro-life movement at the University of Saint Mary? Where can excellence be found in promoting falsehoods over the revealed truth of God \u2014 that life is sacred and should be protected?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe were astounded alongside our fellow group members to witness such angry acts against our loving and compassionate pro-life messages. To see our university cave to the angry outcries of a few loud voices instead of defending the preborn was a knife to the heart. Clearly, the University of Saint Mary favors secular teachings and viewpoints on the topic of abortion and is unashamed to make this stance clear to its faculty, staff, and students.\u202f\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Artificial Womb Technology Is Coming To Fix Underpopulation \u2014 But What If We Just Stopped Aborting Our Babies?\n\n Post Views: 1,540\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
