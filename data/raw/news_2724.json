Such procedures constitute about 96% of legal abortions in Poland, which already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.On Wednesday, pro-choice activists called a \u201cwomen\u2019s strike\u201d that attracted over 400,000 people to protests in over 400 towns and cities across the central European nation.Polish hospitals begin turning away women seeking abortionsRead moreJust hours before Friday\u2019s protest, Andrzej Duda, Poland\u2019s right-wing president, announced what he described as a \u201clegislative solution\u201d to the political crisis, proposing that terminations in instances where birth defects are terminal would be allowed. Terminations of foetuses with conditions such as Down\u2019s syndrome would be banned, however.View image in fullscreenA protester in Warsaw on Friday bears the words: \u2018I will not be living coffin\u2019. Photograph: Robert Pastryk/Zuma Wire/Rex/ShutterstockStrongly criticised by Poland\u2019s medical and legal establishments, Duda\u2019s intervention did little to quell the anger that has left the government and its de facto leader, PiS founder Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, reeling.On Friday, tens of thousands of protesters gathered at points across the city, chanting \u201cI think, I feel, I decide\u201d and anti-PiS slogans.The protests, held as the government introduces ever-stricter restrictions in response to a sharp rise in coronavirus infections and fatalities in recent weeks, have been characterised by humorous slogans and placards and the engagement of Poles in their teens and early 20s.View image in fullscreenPro-choice protesters in Warsaw on Friday evening.

According to the Polish police, several of those arrested were carrying knives and batons.Earlier this week, Kaczy\u0144ski made an address to the nation calling on his supporters to defend churches from the protests, after services were disrupted and in some instances churches defaced during protests last weekend. Some have blamed the PiS leader for implicitly encouraging far-right groups to attack protesters.How Poland\u2019s far-right government is pushing abortion undergroundRead moreOn Friday night, having gathered in the centre of Warsaw, tens of thousands of protesters marched north to the leafy suburb where Kaczy\u0144ski lives, only to be blocked off by hundreds of riot police.\u201cI just spoke to a young woman who told me that she is 24, and that she has done nothing for the last six days except protest,\u201d Maja Wojcikowska, one of the protest\u2019s organisers, told broadcaster TVN. \u201cThere is an incredible energy, we are not going to waste it.\u201dExplore more on these topicsPolandAbortionWomenEuropeCatholicismHealthReligionnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Third night of protests in Poland after abortion ban takes effect29 Jan 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Poland to implement near-total ban on abortion imminently27 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Poland delays abortion ban as nationwide protests continue3 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
