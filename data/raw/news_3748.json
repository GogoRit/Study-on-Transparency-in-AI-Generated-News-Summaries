The legislation is scheduled for reading on April 15 or 16, 2020 as the country remains under a COVID-19-related state of emergency that bans group gatherings.\r\n\r\nThe bills under consideration were originally introduced in March 2018 and October 2019, and have since been stalled or not moved forward under the Parliament elected in November 2019. Both were met by street protests.\n\u201cGiven its track record of undercutting the rule of law, it is fitting that the government would move to pass abusive laws when the public demonstrations that have met these laws before are prohibited,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe Polish government\u2019s focus during the pandemic should be to protect people\u2019s health and rights, not diminish them.\u201d\nThe \u201cStop Abortion\u201d bill would amend the criminal code, eliminating legal access to abortion in cases of severe or fatal fetal anomaly, further limiting what is already one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws. The bill was introduced in March 2018 and supported by high-level politicians of the ruling conservative Law and Justice party. Its approval by a parliamentary committee led to mass protests, but the bill stalled as conservative parliament members requested a Constitutional Tribunal ruling on the legality of permitting abortion in cases of severe anomaly that threatens a fetus\u2019 life.\nThe \u201cStop Pedophilia\u201d bill would amend the criminal code to criminalize \u201canyone who promotes or approves the undertaking by a minor of sexual intercourse or other sexual activity.\u201d People and organizations providing sexuality education or information on sexual and reproductive health and rights, including teachers, outreach workers, authors, and health care personnel, fear the bill could land them in prison for up to three years for doing their jobs. Parliament approved the bill during a first reading in October 2019, and it could expire if not considered by the newly elected parliament before mid-May, but had seen no progress until now.\nBoth bills are \u201cpopular initiatives,\u201d requiring 100,000 signatures for parliamentary consideration and were originally introduced in 2018 and 2019 but then stalled before the pandemic. They are drafted and backed by right-wing groups, including the conservative, anti-abortion, and anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture. Both bills were submitted for this week\u2019s session by Elzbieta Witek, parliament speaker, a member of the ruling conservative Law and Justice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107, PiS).\nUnder Poland\u2019s current law, abortion is only legal to safeguard the life or health of women, in situations of severe or fatal fetal anomaly, or if a pregnancy results from rape or another criminal act such as incest. Even when abortion is legal, multiple barriers limit women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access in practice, including widespread invocation of the \u201cconscience clause\u201d that permits medical providers to refuse care based on personal or religious belief. Laws restricting or criminalizing abortion do not reduce or eliminate women\u2019s need for abortion, but rather drive them to seek abortion through means that may put their lives and health at risk. A group of UN experts previously called on Poland\u2019s parliament to reject the \u201cStop Abortion\u201d bill.\nPoland\u2019s government has blocked efforts to provide adolescents with comprehensive sexuality education that is consistent with international standards. Rather, its\u00a0\u201cPreparation for Family Life\u201d curriculum\u00a0spreads misinformation that can have negative long-term health impacts, perpetuates harmful stereotypes about gender roles and sexuality, and promotes an anti-rights and anti-LGBT agenda. The ruling Law and Justice party has misrepresented comprehensive sexuality education and efforts to advance gender equality as attacks on \u2018traditional\u2019 family values and threats to children, using such arguments to undermine women\u2019s and LGBT rights groups. In November, the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing the \u201cStop Pedophilia\u201d bill\u2019s introduction.\nOther government efforts to further restrict sexual and reproductive health and rights have been met by public protest, including mass demonstrations beginning in October 2016 that became known as #CzarnyProtest (Black Protest) and #StrajkKobiet (Women\u2019s Strike), which led to rejection of a bill that would have enacted a total abortion ban.\nIn recent weeks, the government also introduced criminal code amendments, ostensibly to facilitate COVID-19 response, including significantly increased criminal penalties for people living with HIV who knowingly expose others to the infection, raising potential maximum prison terms from three years to eight. Criminalization of people with HIV violates rights and undermines efforts to curb spread of the infection and ensure access to treatment and often targets vulnerable and minority groups, including LGBT people.\nSince Law and Justice came to power in 2015, Poland\u2019s government has attempted to roll back women\u2019s rights, including through smear campaigns, systematic defunding, and other attacks on women\u2019s rights organizations and activists.\u00a0The ruling party\u2019s crusade against so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d has gained traction and been used to galvanize support for measures that target women\u2019s and LGBT rights and smear women\u2019s and LGBT rights activists.\nIn the past five years, the Polish government dominated by Law and Justice has actively undermined the rule of law and eroded the independence of the judiciary, and interfered with media freedom. It has refused environmental activists entry to Poland to attend United Nations climate talks. In 2016, parliament rejected a bill that would have increased protection of marginalized groups and identities by including gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and age as potential grounds for \u201chate speech.\u201d Organizations working on women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights, and migration have faced harassment.\nPoland\u2019s Parliament should reject the Stop Abortion and Stop Pedophilia bills and uphold sexual and reproductive health and rights in accordance with international law. This includes the right to access safe and legal abortion and to receive accurate, evidence-based information about health and sexuality.\nThe European Commission and other EU member states should make the best possible use of tools available, including the Article 7 procedures, to address the Polish government\u2019s policies on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Article 7 under the Treaty of the European Union provides for preventive action and possible sanctions, including suspension of a member state\u2019s voting rights within the Council of the EU if that country violates the EU\u2019s founding values, such as the rule of law.\n\u201cUndermining access to abortion and comprehensive sexuality education doesn\u2019t protect anyone, and only raises the prospect of dire health consequences for Poland\u2019s people,\u201d Margolis said. \u201cThe chaos and anxiety surrounding COVID-19 shouldn\u2019t be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia Poland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 8, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nEurope: Abortion Curbs Endanger Women, Girls in Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2020\n\n          Letter\n        \n\n\nNGOs Letter to EU General Affairs Council Concerning Rule of Law in Poland and Hungary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cViolence with Every Step\u201d\n\n\nWeak State Response to Domestic Violence in Tajikistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 8, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nEurope: Abortion Curbs Endanger Women, Girls in Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2020\n\n          Letter\n        \n\n\nNGOs Letter to EU General Affairs Council Concerning Rule of Law in Poland and Hungary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
