Jennifer Walker of Brave Public Relations, which represents the theater, said it will be offering refunds for ticket holders. \nThe comedian joins a number of celebrities who have spoken out about the ban including Jordan Peele, Gabrielle Union, and Tracee Ellis Ross.  \nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images for MTV\nPolitician and author Stacey Abrams, who ran against Georgia\u2019s Republican governor Brian Kemp during the 2018 gubernatorial election, has also been vocal about her opposition to the bill.\n\u201cI grew up in a religious family. I grew up believing that the right to an abortion was wrong. And I was wrong,\u201d she said in a video for NowThis News. \u201cEvery woman should have a choice and that\u2019s what we should remember.\u201d\nTOPICS:\u00a0  Tiffany Haddish\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
