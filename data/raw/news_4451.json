All proceeds from the song\u2019s sales benefited the Yellowhammer Fund, a reproductive justice organization based in Alabama. In this exclusive op-ed for Rolling Stone, Shires elaborates on why reproductive rights mean so much to her.\nI am not a baby-killer. I have never killed a baby. I have had cells removed from my body by a doctor. But no matter what the accusatory asshats on Facebook would have you believe, I am not chopping up and dismembering anyone.\u00a0\nI am not a monster \u2014 not by any definition. But sometimes I think it\u2019d be cool to have tentacles, wings, 10 rows of teeth, and talons. Ol\u2019 Monster Shires with her unmatched strength and fearsome jaws would have you bowing at her mighty autonomy.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYep, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m a 38-year-old woman, baptized into three different churches, and I believe that I have the right to decide what I do or do not do with my body. I am capable of rational decision-making, much like a crow.\u00a0 And Christ, even birds get to decide. Yes, Ol\u2019 Monster Shires is a bird-watcher.\n\n\nSometimes women become pregnant, and they don\u2019t want to be pregnant. Maybe they aren\u2019t ready to have more children, they can\u2019t afford another child, or maybe there\u2019s something wrong with their health or the health of the developing fetus. There are so many reasons. But the reasons that I chose to have an abortion are personal, and they are mine. They aren\u2019t for strangers or trolls to dissect. They aren\u2019t for anyone on this earthly plane to judge. God alone will judge. But here we are.\nI believe in God. I believe God gave women the ability to terminate pregnancies long before men started negotiating our right to do so. The herbs have been here all along.\u00a0 Advances in science and medicine have made terminating a pregnancy far safer than it was a few hundred years ago, but women have always been able to control our reproductive systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEditor\u2019s picks\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvery Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is not a social issue. My abortion did not affect my neighbor\u2019s quality of life. My right to a safe abortion can be granted at no cost to the members of my community or my fellow American citizens. My choice does not change their lives. For this reason, I believe it is not the role of the federal or state government to deny us the right to make our own reproductive choices. Rather, it is the government\u2019s charge to protect this right from any agency that might attempt to revoke it. The highest court in the land agrees with me, at least for now.\nI have a child. She\u2019s five. This past summer, she became a bird-watcher, too. After she saw a bird purposefully push an egg out of its nest, she asked, \u201cWhy did the bird do that?\u201d I told her the bird could have done that for a lot of different reasons. I started listing them off. Then I said, \u201cMommy was pregnant a long time ago and didn\u2019t want to be pregnant, so she called a doctor to help her not be pregnant anymore.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTrending\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCheech & Chong Return for One 'Last Movie'\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActor and Drag Star Shangela Accused of Multiple Sexual Assaults\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA ChatGPT for Music Is Here.

She accepted it as a part of the normal things that can happen in life. I also let her know that the most important thing is that the choice belongs to the person who is pregnant and no one else.\u00a0\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want her to have the same right that I had. I don\u2019t want it to be as hard for her to get an abortion as it was for me. The procedure took 10 minutes, but before I could have it done, I had to answer invasive questions and jump through hoops for weeks. I don\u2019t want it to be cruel or barbaric. I want it to be safe. I don\u2019t want her to wind up stuck with a partner who isn\u2019t right for her, or in a life that she never planned on. I want her to have children only if and when she wants to have children. I want her to be free, as even the birds of the air are free.\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\tAbortion,\n\n\n\n\tAmanda Shires\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMusic\n\n\n\n\tMusic Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJelly Roll and Lainey Wilson to Perform at 2024 CMT Awards\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCMT Awards 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nJon Blistein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSufjan Stevens' Musical 'Illinoise' Will Open on Broadway in April\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMake Some Noise\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nLarisha Paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pretenders Plot Summer 2024 North American Tour\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nLarisha Paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSZA, Tyler, the Creator, and Blink-182 to Headline Lollapalooza 2024\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLolla 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nJon Blistein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBig & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Craig Morgan Lead New 2000s Country Cruise 'Boots on the Water'\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCome Aboard...\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nJoseph Hudak \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRead more\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Latest\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJelly Roll and Lainey Wilson to Perform at 2024 CMT Awards\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCMT Awards 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t30 mins ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSufjan Stevens' Musical 'Illinoise' Will Open on Broadway in April\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMake Some Noise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t37 mins ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pretenders Plot Summer 2024 North American Tour\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrump Throws Tantrum After Failing to Post Bond in NY Fraud Case\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tUnpaid \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe digital daily newsletter\t\t\n\t\n\n\nA Cultural Force ThatTranscends Generations \n\n\n\nEnter your Email\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSubscribe\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Go to PMC.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMost Popular\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBill Maher Fires CAA After Oscar Party Snub (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Colbert Says CBS Asked Him Not to Show Kristen Stewart's Rolling Stone Cover; Stewart Says 'F--- You' to the Homophobic Haters\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRose Hanbury Just Broke Her Silence on the Prince William Affair Rumors\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKobe Bryant's Parents Face Backlash After Putting Championship Ring On The Auction Block\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou might also like\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITV Ratings Champ \u2018Trigger Point,\u2019 Season 2, Rolled Out by All3Media International to Major Territories (EXCLUSIVE)\u00a0\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t3 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThree Key Takeaways From Ozempic and Zepbound Executives on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s \u2018Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution\u2019\u00a0Special\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t3 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Best Yoga Mats for Any Practice, According to Instructors\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t5 days ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSara Kiener\u2019s \u2018The Shawl\u2019 Ode to Stevie Nicks Is a Vimeo Staff Pick Premiere \u2014 Watch\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t3 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJ.P.
