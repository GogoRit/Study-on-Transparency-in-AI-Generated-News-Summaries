In addition to providing answers to expectant parents, the site offers a wealth of other resources: advice about how to improve fertility, a due-date calculator, and even a hotline for pregnancy questions. For those seeking medical expertise about all things gestation-related, the American Pregnancy Association seems to be a one-stop shop. The group describes itself as \u201ca national health organization committed to promoting reproductive and pregnancy wellness through education, support, advocacy, and community awareness.\u201d\nBetter yet, it seems to be committed to science. \u201cThe Association believes that research is the foundation to significant reproductive discoveries,\u201d the site says. Indeed, the group is cited as a source by many respected medical institutions, including the Cleveland Clinic, Los Angeles\u2019 Cedars-Sinai, Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Maryland\u2019s Johns Hopkins HealthCare. The New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN have included its advice in articles. The official website about women\u2019s health at the US Government\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services links to the American Pregnancy Association as a resource for those seeking information about pregnancy tests. The Office of Child Welfare recommends that parents considering adoption peruse\u00a0its list of potential questions to ask adoptive parents.\n\u201cThe Association believes that research is the foundation to significant reproductive discoveries.\u201d\nSo comprehensive and widely known are the\u00a0organization\u2019s offerings that it\u2019s easy to overlook the section about unplanned pregnancies, where the tone is decidedly different\u2014fewer facts, more feelings. \u201cIf you\u2019re researching your options, you probably need to talk,\u201d the page says, offering a hotline number. \u201cThere will be no judgment, no guilt, only a friendly caring person ready to listen and talk.\u201d Actual information about abortion is hard to find, and what the site does provide is sandwiched between warnings. \u201cConsider the impact the procedure may have on your future,\u201d the site advises.\nHere\u2019s another thing it doesn\u2019t mention: The American Pregnancy Association isn\u2019t the dispassionate medical authority it might appear to be. Rather, it\u2019s the brainchild of a Texas-based pro-life activist named Brad Imler, and it\u2019s rife with medically inaccurate information\u2014on both abortion and other reproductive health topics. The site hawks unproven blood tests, infertility treatments, and products purported to support the pregnant person and developing fetus. The American Pregnancy Association presents all of its information and products as evidence-based and medically accurate\u2014but nowhere can one find its activist foundations or learn that it doesn\u2019t have a single medical professional listed on its staff of a handful of people.\nThis veneer of medical expertise isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in the anti-abortion movement. Over the last few decades, pro-life groups have built a robust network of crisis pregnancy centers designed to look like doctors\u2019 offices, complete with ultrasound equipment and available nurses. The purpose of these offices is to dissuade people from getting abortions, yet the staff and marketing materials rarely mention this\u2014crisis pregnancy centers\u2019 misleading messaging has been the focus of several recent court cases. The American Pregnancy Association is set up like a virtual version of these crisis pregnancy centers, attracting expectant parents with its promises of need-to-know information\u2014then gently leading them through an experience subtly laid out to discourage abortion at all costs. It\u2019s a highly successful design: Even the pro-choice think tank the Guttmacher Institute lists the American Pregnancy Association among its sources for information about fetal development.\nIn the coming years, much of the battle over reproductive rights could play out online: As more states move to criminalize the termination of a pregnancy, trusted clinics are closing, and creating an information vacuum, says Sylvia Guendelman, a University of California, Berkeley, reproductive health scholar. \u201cPeople are going to go online to look for the information because they want the information,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is a pro-life movement that is trying to systematically disinform people.\u201d \u00a0\nLast month, I traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, to learn about how Brad Imler had parlayed his experience as a crisis pregnancy hotline worker into creating the website of the American Pregnancy Association. Early on a Tuesday morning, I arrived in the lobby of a Hyatt Regency hotel to pick up my badge for the 51st\u00a0annual conference of the pro-life group Heartbeat International. The hundreds of attendees standing in line with me were buzzing with anticipation; they had signed up for sessions including \u201cWhy Not Birth Control\u201d and \u201cHealing a Feminist Culture.\u201d Almost all of them were women; the few men in attendance all seemed to be leaders\u2014keynote speakers, presenters, panelists.\nAt 9 a.m. sharp, 70 other attendees and I took our seats in a conference room and listened intently as Imler, a genial, middle-aged man with an easy laugh, told a few gentle jokes about Jesus and then got down to business. This day-long session was called \u201cThe Abortion-Minded Caller.\u201d The business-casual-clad women in the audience, most of whom worked at crisis pregnancy centers, would learn how to turn abortion seekers into clients, an art that Imler had perfected over the last 25 years. \u201cWhen she calls or comes into your center, that\u2019s a divine appointment,\u201d Imler told them, almost whispering. \u201cGod has chosen you to work with her.\u201d\n\u201cWhen she calls or comes into your center, that\u2019s a divine appointment. God has chosen you to work with her.\u201d\nImler recounted how, as a college student in the 1980s, he had paid for his girlfriend\u2019s abortion. So racked with guilt was he in the days that followed that he promised God he would do \u201canything, anytime, anywhere for the cause of life.\u201d A decade later, with a Ph.D. in psychology and a master\u2019s degree in social work under his belt, Imler took over the American Pregnancy Helpline, one of the first hotlines set up to convince pregnant people not to have abortions. Over the following years, he honed his skills of persuasion and strategies of engagement.\nThe audience took notes as Imler doled out his top tips. Ask open-ended questions to get her talking. The correct answer to \u201cDo you do abortions?\u201d is not \u201cno\u201d\u2014at least not at first. It\u2019s \u201cSo you\u2019re seeking information about abortion, how have you confirmed your pregnancy?\u201d If she mentions abortion again, the response should be \u201cWhich risks of abortion concern you the most?\u201d Impress upon her the need to come into the office for an ultrasound or other tests because \u201cthe more medical you are, the more respected you will be.\u201d\nThe truth was that some parts of the conversation were just tricky and did not lend themselves to empathic evasion. Eventually, you had to deliver the bad news that your clinic wouldn\u2019t actually be performing the abortion that the caller was seeking. Members of the audience debated strategies for delicately dropping this bomb. \u201cWe have a service called \u2018pre-termination,\u2019\u201d offered one. \u201cI like that terminology,\u201d said Imler, nodding approvingly. Another attendee wasn\u2019t so sure; she thought it sounded deceptive.\nAfter lunch, we split into pairs to do a role play. My partner was a friendly older woman from New Jersey who admitted to me that the exercise made her nervous, in part because she felt self-conscious about her accent\u2014she usually took calls in her native Spanish. I played the role of the counselor first and dutifully went through the script that Imler had taught us. I was doing pretty well until the part where I was supposed to let the caller know that the clinic wouldn\u2019t actually perform an abortion, but\u00a0I would still try to\u00a0persuade her to come in for an ultrasound. \u201cAh, well, abortion might be a choice that you make down the road,\u201d I ventured, \u201cbut before doing that, you\u2019re going to need to, uh, get some more information.\u201d\u00a0\nMy partner did a better job when it was her turn to play the clinic worker. \u201cIt will be very beneficial for you to get an ultrasound for free,\u201d she told me kindly. \u201cWe can counsel you on additional procedures, so you might know more about the rules. We can do a pre-termination consultation. Would you like to do that?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that sounds really good,\u201d I said.\nMy partner smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s set up an appointment for you, my dear.\u201d\nWhen Imler took over the American Pregnancy Helpline as a young Christian social worker, he said, the hotline served about one caller a day. \u201cI wrestled with God, and I confess to you this was pride,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018God, can\u2019t you use me for something more?\u2019\u201d\nGod answered his prayers, giving him the idea for a website that would work like the hotline, but reach many more people. In 2003, the American Pregnancy Association was born. Just a few years later, \u201cWe were number one for pregnancy symptoms, signs of pregnancy. Anything that was related to \u2018Am I pregnant?\u2019 we were number one.\u201d He looked at the crowd. \u201cAnd we had 800,000 women a month on our pregnancy-symptoms page using our zip code search to find you.\u201d\u00a0\nImler ran the American Pregnancy Association until 2019, when he stepped down to found a Christian adoption agency. The group has a new president now, a marketing veteran named Lynn Handley, who said in an email that Imler is no longer involved with the group. Its website is still going strong: According to its nonprofit tax filings, in 2021 more than 6 million people visited the website in a single month\u2014impressive, especially considering the group\u2019s modest budget of just shy of $400,000 in revenue, almost all of which came from the corporate sponsors whose products the site featured. In a 2021 study, a group of public health researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the American Pregnancy Association was the second most common website in Google searches for information about the abortion pill, second only to Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe greatest challenge in engaging with abortion-minded callers on a hotline is that simply memorizing a script won\u2019t really work. Each situation is unique, and there is no way to predict the conversational twists and turns. The American Pregnancy Association website offers a neat solution to this phone problem, expertly leading users down a carefully curated path. Click on the \u201cunplanned pregnancies\u201d section, and you\u2019ll be directed to a page advertising a support group called Embrace Grace. \u201cGoodbye fear, hello joy,\u201d the accompanying text says. The page on options for unplanned pregnancies gently encourages users to consider parenting and adoption before considering \u201cthe final option.\u201d The site implores those considering abortions to first ask themselves questions like \u201cIs this \u2018choice\u2019 for convenience\u2019s sake?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I know about the potential negative emotional impact of having an abortion?\u201d and \u201cAm I aware of the relationship between abortion and breast cancer?\u201d (It doesn\u2019t mention that scientists agree that there is none.)\nFor the persistent few who still want to know about abortion, there\u2019s a page on the topic that seems straightforward enough, listing the types of procedures along with their risks, including \u201cproblems breathing\u201d from anesthesia, infection, scarring, and \u201caccidentally putting a hole in the uterus with one of the instruments used.\u201d At no point does the site indicate the frequency of these terrifying outcomes\u2014which, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, are all rare. The risk of damage to the uterus, bowel, or bladder during a surgical abortion is less than one in 1,000 even during the second trimester, about half that of dying from an appendectomy.\u00a0\nShould someone be among the increasing number of people who opted for a medication abortion, the site says, it\u2019s still possible to change things even after the first pill has been ingested. It touts a new and medically dubious procedure called abortion pill reversal that involves taking a high dose of the pregnancy hormone progesterone. Most medical groups don\u2019t endorse this protocol; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that its safety and efficacy \u201care not based on science and do not meet clinical standards.\u201d The American Pregnancy Association admits that the abortion pill reversal \u201cis not necessarily FDA approved\u201d but notes, somewhat cryptically, that \u201cit is still used without legal issues.\u201d\nSprinkled throughout the site are endorsements for products masquerading as expert pregnancy advice. In the fertility section, readers are encouraged to purchase a special ovulation monitor, while elsewhere they can find an at-home test for sperm viability. The page on gender prediction is actually a thinly veiled ad for yet another new test, boasting,\u00a0\u201cWith a small blood sample, now you can determine if pink or blue is in your future with 99.5% accuracy!\u201d The section on nutrition during pregnancy offers a page hawking an ice cream line called Nightfood, whose manufacturers claim it\u2019s specially designed to satisfy the nocturnal cravings of pregnancy, plus: \u201cIt\u2019s sleep expert and crave monster approved, and now American Pregnancy Association recommended. Place an order today!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s sleep expert and crave monster approved, and now American Pregnancy Association recommended. Place an order today!\u201d\nLynn Handley, the current president of the American Pregnancy Association, said in an email that the products recommended on the site \u201care not required to be FDA approved as they are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease,\u201d and that \u201ca nurse and executive team review testing results, case studies and other data before we consider endorsing or including a product in an article.\u201d Handley noted that the abortion-pill reversal drug that the site recommends \u201cis based on protocols to support pregnancies\u201d and has \u201cbeen a standard protocol for decades\u201d when a woman experiences a miscarriage or is going through IVF. (The key difference that Handley doesn\u2019t mention is that in the case of miscarriage and IVF, the progesterone protocol has been studied\u2014while in the context of abortion pill reversal, it has not.)\nPut simply, the American Pregnancy Association omits key statistics, offers medically questionable advice, and hawks products\u2014while being richly rewarded with robust web traffic and links from premier health institutions and the federal government. All this would be unsettling enough on its own, but it also plays an important role in a much bigger ecosystem of online health disinformation. Taylor Agajanian, a disinformation researcher at the University of Washington, saw parallels with the thriving anti-vaccine movement. The activists she studies exaggerate the frequency of rare side effects, insist on the efficacy of unproven Covid treatments like ivermectin, and use their platform to sell supplements, essential oils, and other wellness products. These tactics are extremely effective at reaching people who are \u201cactually very scared,\u201d says Agajanian. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what they are being told is going to help them.\u201d\nAnd there are likely a lot of them, says Betsy Pleasants, one of the UC-Berkeley researchers who studied the prominence of the American Pregnancy Association in Google search results. \u201cThe implications of that are pretty substantial when you think about the number of users that might be accessing and interacting with the information,\u201d she said. Not to mention how they\u2019re interacting with the information. In the wake of Texas\u2019 recently enacted \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d which prohibits abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, there was a flurry of media coverage about the precise point at which human cardiac activity begins. One of the most commonly cited sources in the local press?\u00a0The American Pregnancy Association.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the loudest and most disruptive pro-lifers receive the most national attention\u2014the protesters outside of clinics, for instance, or the legislators narrowing the window within which a pregnant person can end a pregnancy. But there is a quieter and more intimate part of the movement, too\u2014one that has the potential to profoundly affect countless individual lives. That is Imler\u2019s specialty: The part that\u00a0takes place in hotline phone calls, in crisis pregnancy center offices, and, in late-night Google searches.\nAt the end of the training day, some intrepid audience members volunteered to do role plays in front of the whole group. One young woman hammed it up as a self-obsessed mom of two who didn\u2019t want to ruin her figure by getting pregnant again. She had great comic timing. Though this took place at the end of a seven-hour training, the audience was full of energy, calling out suggestions to the woman playing the counselor, and roaring with laughter. When the session was over, the ladies spilled out of the room, sizzling with conversation, and maybe even a sense of purpose and belonging. They exchanged contact information, some planning to meet up for drinks later, others promising to stay in touch after the conference ended.\n\u201cThe big buses and things that have pictures of aborted fetuses, and the \u2018you\u2019re going to hell\u2019 and all of this, I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\nThis softer, user-friendly approach to anti-abortion activism is Imler\u2019s preferred style. He told us that he attends the conference of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists every year and that he is dismayed by the lurid tactics of some of the anti-abortion protesters he sees there. \u201cThe big buses and things that have pictures of aborted fetuses, and the \u2018you\u2019re going to hell\u2019 and all of this, I can\u2019t stand it,\u201d he told the trainees. Instead, he believes in engaging with the \u201cother side,\u201d the pro-choice movement. \u201cI personally don\u2019t even think they\u2019re enemies. I want to have conversations with them.\u201d\nApparently, reporters fall into a different category. When I reached out to Imler a few days after the conference to see if he\u2019d be up for a phone call, he was decidedly against the idea. In response to my questions about his history with the American Pregnancy Association, he demurred and suggested I reach out to Lynn Handley. She told me in an email, \u201cPeople find APA because they have a question, \u2018am I pregnant,\u2019 \u2018how do I get pregnant,\u2019 \u2018is this bleeding normal?\u2019 When they search a question on Google or other search engines one of our source-cited articles may appear.\u201d The overall goal of the site, she wrote, \u201cis to provide unbiased information about all considerations, including abortion methods and side effects, as well as other options.\u201d She added, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree they are entitled to that information?\u201d\nJust before Imler stopped responding to my emails entirely, he returned one of my messages with something that read like a very short personal mission statement. The centerpiece of his work was \u201cfiguring out her \u2018What ifs\u2019 and what can be done to meet them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaking sure she has all the information she needed in making her decision is my focus.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by students at UC Berkeley\u2019s Investigative Reporting Program and Human Rights Center in collaboration with Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting: Eleonora Bianchi, Elizabeth Moss, and Eliza Partika\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for news you can trust?\n\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n\nAN IMPORTANT UPDATEWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming up short on donations month after month.
