If I want to stand naked in front of people, I will do it, because it\u2019s my choice.\u201d\n\nMicula\u2019s friend had just come from physiotherapy following a double mastectomy and wanted to encourage other protesters by showing her tattooed chest. Theirs is among many taboo-breaking acts by furious women in Poland in the past weeks.\nThe upheaval began when Poland\u2019s constitutional court, packed with loyalists of the conservative ruling party, ruled Oct. 22 to ban abortions in cases of congenital fetal defects, even if the fetus has no chance of survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoland already had one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws, and the ruling would mean that the only legal reasons for abortion would be rape, incest or if the woman\u2019s life is in danger.Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ruling party leader and Poland\u2019s most powerful politician, had said he wanted even nonviable fetuses to be carried to birth, so they can be given a baptism, a name and a burial. The rage of Polish women, and many men as well, erupted onto the streets across the country, growing into the largest protest movement in the three decades since communism fell.\n\nProtesters at first disrupted Masses, shouted obscenities at priests and spray-painted the number of an abortion hotline on church facades. Those early provocative tactics were largely dropped after they triggered a backlash in a society where many cherish Catholic traditions.They continued their protests on the streets, however, refusing to be cowed by the authorities or by the pandemic.\u201cMy water has broken. I am giving birth to a revolution,\u201d said one sign at a protest in Warsaw on Nov. 18, expressing a view held by an increasing number of protesters.The interior minister recently warned that the government would not tolerate \u201ca revolution made by force against the constitutional organs of the Polish state.\u201d Police have been increasingly detaining and charging protesters, and in some cases using tear gas and other force. Still, amid the massive social upheaval, the government has not formally implemented the court ruling and has spoken of coming up with a new law. But reproductive rights activists say that hospitals are already refusing to carry out abortions of congenitally damaged fetuses.\n\nThe governing party\u2019s attempt to ban abortion, with the use of a court packed with loyalists and during a pandemic, seemed excessively cruel to 21-year-old Nina Michnik, a student of Arabic studies and philosophy. \u201cThey did it in this critical moment when everyone was scared of the pandemic,\u201d said Michnik. She described feeling extremely lonely and fragile when the court ruling came down.\u201cThey caught us in this very sensitive moment,\u201d Michnik said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were so angry.\u201dWhile she was stuck at home by the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, Michnik had stopped the boxing workouts she loves. After the protests erupted, she began working out again and joined a group that scans protests for far-right troublemakers.The recent protests have certainly become a political awakening for Polish youth, but older Poles also have taken part. They are led by the Women\u2019s Strike, a group of female activists, but many men have also joined in. What began as a revolt against an abortion ruling has become a larger struggle for democracy and human rights.\n\nBefore the court ruling, the people on the front lines of Poland\u2019s culture war had been LGBT rights activists who were frequently denounced by government and church leaders as a threat to Poland\u2019s culture and families. Those grievances have now been woven together into one larger struggle against a government that the protesters hope to eventually bring down. Rainbow flags are held high at all the abortion protests.Gabe Wilczynska, 19, has so far this year joined rallies for LGBT rights, racial justice in the U.S., and against sexual violence. With political convictions shaped by having been raped by a boy in high school, Wilczynska, who identifies as a lesbian and as non-binary, has gotten five court citations for involvement in the recent protests. \n\nWilczynska\u2019s forms of protests have included dressing in a red handmaid costume to protest the government\u2019s \u201cattempts to control our bodies,\u201d and joining a group that has pasted slogans at night on city walls with messages including: \u201cMy uterus is not a coffin,\u201d and \u201cAbortion is a right not a favor.\u201dIn interviews, protesters often say they feel a connection with the women of neighboring Belarus, who have emerged as a driving force in an uprising against the regime of longtime authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.The decision to have weekly, rather than daily, protests, for example, was inspired by what is happening in Belarus, the goal being to keep people from getting worn down by daily protests, Micula said.Conscious of the global battles between authoritarian and democratic forces, some Poles are also putting faith in U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to encourage democracy and human rights.Micula said she is hopeful that a new, better society is being born now, her hope bolstered by the sight of young people dancing on the streets during the protests and their solidarity with each other. No matter what happens politically in the short term, in the longer term, \u201cwe are winning,\u201d she said. \u201cThe social revolution is already happening,\u201d she continued. \u201cSociety is changing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
