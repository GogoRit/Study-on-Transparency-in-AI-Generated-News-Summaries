By Abigail CovingtonPublished: Nov 18, 2022 7:30 AM ESTSave ArticleThe day I meet up with the comedian David Cross to talk about abortion rights, the country is reeling from the news that the Supreme Court intends to revoke them. It\u2019s April and less than 48 hours ago, Politico published a leaked draft of the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which finds the justices voting to strike down Roe V. Wade, the landmark case that made abortion legal in all 50 states in 1973. \u201cHow have the past two days been for you?\u201d I ask Cross as he flags down the bartender and quickly orders  a beer before anyone can notice him. We\u2019re at an Irish pub in Fort Greene, splitting a round of drinks ahead of a sold-out fundraising event for Abortion Access Front. The timing of all these events is coincidental, if surreal. \u201cWell, I've caught up on all my abortions,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI had four since the other day; I'm squeezing them in.\u201d Cross gestures toward a small two-top at the back of the bar. \u201cLet\u2019s sit over there.\u201d Cross is one of several male comedians that Abortion Access Front\u2019s founder, Lizz Winstead, asked to participate. In fact, he was the first person she approached. If you\u2019re familiar with Cross\u2019s stand up, it\u2019s easy to see why. His style is blunt, borderline indignant, and his material has grown increasingly confrontational in the past decade.If the baby was knocking on the fucking wall, I'd still say, \u2018You get to do whatever you want!'In 2016, the comedian made headlines when people repeatedly walked out of his overtly political Making America Great Again tour. Watch the MAGA Netflix special, which was recorded live at a sold-out pitstop in Austin, Texas, and you\u2019ll see an audience member abruptly abandon her seat after Cross does an impression of a pro-gun, Christian woman wondering why God allows America's innocent kids to be shot to death in school shootings. Cross was adamant about keeping the scene in the special. Speaking to Esquire at the time, Cross said, \u201cI stand by every single thing I said, and I can defend it.\u201d He\u2019s only grown more resolute in the post-Trump era, especially on the subject of abortion. Male stand-ups love tackling abortion. It\u2019s just the right amount of taboo. Nervy comedians like Anthony Jesselnik mine it for potentially controversial jokes; confrontational comedians like Bill Burr poke holes in prevailing opinions about it; social critic comedians like Louis C.K (who admitted to sexual misconduct in 2017 after multiple women came forward with accounts of unwanted sexual advances)  find humor in debating its merits. All of these approaches require an openness to both sides of the debate to earn the punchline. David Cross will have none of that. Like George Carlin in his later years, Cross\u2019s approach to abortion jokes is rooted in the irony and hypocrisy he sees at the heart of the pro-life argument. Earlier this summer, a clip about \u201cpro-life conservatives\u201d from George Carlin\u2019s 1996 special, Back in Town, went viral after the comedian Sara Schaefer circulated it on Twitter. \u201cIf you\u2019re pre-born, you\u2019re fine. If you\u2019re pre-school, you\u2019re fucked,\u201d joked a weary-sounding Carlin. View full post on YoutubeIn his most recent special, I\u2019m From the Future, Cross channels Carlin to take dead aim at the doubly flawed logic of anti-choice, anti-vaxxers. \u201cMy body, my choice,\u201d he says, in an outraged, redneck-y intonation. \u201cYour body, also my choice.\u201d And now for the punchline: \u201cHer body, especially my choice.\u201dBesides being true and funny, the joke is also earnest. Cross really cares about abortion rights. He is one of the 35% of Americans who believes abortion should be legal in any and all circumstances. \u201cIf the baby was knocking on the fucking wall,\u201d he tells me, \u201cI'd still say, \u2018you get to do whatever you want!\u2019\u201d I\u2019m surprised by how adamant he sounds. He seems angry\u2014angrier than me even\u2014and I want to know why he cares so much. After all, he doesn\u2019t have a uterus. He has had an abortion\u2014two, actually\u2014 and he says his life would be \u201cdramatically different\u201d had he not received the first one. The second one wasn\u2019t as consequential. \u201cIt\u2019d be slightly different,\u201d he tells me. To my surprise though, these experiences aren\u2019t why Cross cares about abortion rights, and he rejects my suggestion that they might be.Andrew H. Walker//Getty ImagesCross pictured with his wife, Amber Tamblyn.He also rejects my subsequent suggestion\u2014that perhaps he\u2019s motivated by all of the heart-wrenching and disturbing stories there are about the consequences that people who are refused abortions face. Emotional accounts are the backbone of political strategy, after all. Surely, Cross, who identifies as a feminist, was raised by a single mother, has two sisters, is married to the activist and author Amber Tamblyn, and whose daughter serves as the background image of his cellphone, can\u2019t help but get emotional when he thinks about the impact this might have on them, or any person with a uterus for that matter. But Cross says no, not really. This isn\u2019t about empathy. \u201cI'm going to say something that\u2019s going to make myself sound a little shittier,\u201d says Cross, without even pausing to reconsider. \u201c\u2026 but I\u2019m not thinking about that poor woman who had to drive 350 miles. I know that's a thing, and I feel empathy for that person, but that's an abstract image in my head.\u201d He took things a step further when he appeared on an episode of Abortion Access Front\u2019s weekly podcast, and told Winstead, the show\u2019s host, point-blank that the reason he\u2019s passionate about abortion rights isn\u2019t because \u201cI have daughters or grew up with women.\u201d So then, why\u2014if not because of his own personal experience or because he cares about the poor, stranded pregnant woman in Kansas, or because he\u2019s a feminist who has spent his entire life surrounded by women\u2014does David Cross give such a damn about abortion rights? This is about the outrage of illogical thinking.\u201cThis is about the outrage of illogical thinking,\u201d Cross says. \u201cI'm motivated by what, to me, is obvious and that is anti-hypocrisy.\u201d He tells me he developed an allergy to \u201cthings that make no fucking sense,\u201d at a young age. It started with religion and became more severe when he encountered the conservative, anti-feminist activist, Phyllis Schlafly, on the nightly news. This was in the early \u201870s when Congress came breathtakingly close to passing the Equal Rights Amendment. That is until Schafly, \u201ca sour, old bitch\u201d according to Cross, waged an all-out war against it and secured its defeat. The ERA\u2019s failure bamboozled a young Cross. \u201cReduce it to the headline, \u2018Will women create an amendment to ensure equality and equal pay?\u2019 You're like, \u2018Of course they will.\u2019 And then it didn't pass \u2026\u201d Cross recalls. \u201cI can look at it now as an adult and ascribe all the external things that were happening. But as a kid, it made no sense. Phillis Schlafly was just an enigma to me. I did not get it.\u201dFast-forward some 50 years, and Cross is still using the same principles of logic to define his politics. Just like he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around Schlafly being against the ERA, Cross cannot square the idea of a member of the party of personal freedom being anti-choice, and David Cross cannot stand that which he cannot square.  Mindy TuckerDavid Cross cannot stand that which he cannot square. And he cannot square the thinking behind anti-abortion activism. \u201cI don't want the government telling a person what they can and can't do with their own body. End of sentence. That's it.\u201d He once again sounds stern and pissed off, and in a sign of our increasingly dystopian politics, a little bit like a conservative railing against vaccine mandates. Of course, conservatives who oppose abortion but are otherwise passionate about personal freedom can always cite their religious beliefs as an explanation for what Cross and many others would consider political hypocrisy. Indeed, according to new data from the Pew Research Center, \u201chighly religious Americans\u201d make up the majority of Republicans who think abortion should be illegal in all cases. Cross\u2019s atheism spares him from having to make similar justifications. He see his pro-choice beliefs as a natural extension of his absence of faith. At the end of the day, Cross says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in God or any of the reasons for being against abortion.\u201d  Instead, he believes in science. Real science, he clarifies, not the \u201cpseudo-science\u201d that claims a fetus is a life. \u201cIt\u2019s a zygote,\u201d he says matter-of-factly toward the tail-end of a breathless tirade about so-called heartbeat bills and the people who mistakenly believe they\u2019re audible six weeks into a pregnancy. \u201cAnyway, even if it was a life, it wouldn\u2019t fucking matter.\u201d Cross drifts off, looking lost in thought. He sips his beer, \u201cNow,\u201d he says, the lilt in his voice noticeably lighter. \u201cIf the baby comes out and says, \u2018Hi.\u2019 Okay, that's diff\u2014you should have up to a week.\u201d Delighted by his own quick thinking, Cross cracks a sly smile while I laugh at the absurdity of the scenario he\u2019s just drawn. The thing is, I know he\u2019s joking. But in today\u2019s heightened political landscape, in which comedians are often persecuted for their opinions, whether they\u2019re real or not, I worry what might happen to Cross if and when the wrong person encounters his material and doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s kidding. All jokes aside, Cross is concerned, both for his family and his country. Before we go our separate ways, he tells me he thinks abortion could be the issue that divides the United States for good, and that he and Tamblyn have been considering their cut-off point, as in: how bad do things have to get before they pack up and move to Canada? Not for their sake Cross says, still insisting that an abortion ban wouldn\u2019t affect him personally, but for the sake of their daughter. They aren\u2019t there yet. Right now, he says, he and Tamblyn are trying to figure out \u201cthe best thing to do to ensure a better world for our daughter and our daughter's friends.\u201d If that\u2019s not empathy, what is?
