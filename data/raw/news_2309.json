A member of the Greek community and active as a pilates and yoga instructor on campus, Ally\u2019s death shook her community to the core. Mississippians, alum and students, have asked themselves since that day in July \u2014 How could this have happened at Ole Miss?\nSome of Ally\u2019s friends reported that Ally was pregnant with her alleged murderer\u2019s baby. Some of her community believes her denying the choice of abortion led to the murderous rampage of her on and off-again boyfriend.\u00a0It\u2019s been reported\u00a0that her own sorority sisters knew about her pregnancy, her choice to not abort, and the anger her alleged murderer felt that she was not planning on having an abortion.\nWhether or not this was the case for Ally or this was the motivation for her brutal murder, one thing is clear \u2014\u00a0the Ole Miss student body did not know where to send an unexpectedly pregnant student.\nJust miles from campus, a free, privately funded, confidential place for pregnant women offers life-saving services.\u00a0Pregnancy Center of Oxford\u00a0is a \u201cwarm caring, judgment-free environment\u201d to receive medical-grade pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and options counseling that is designed to look for red flags in relationships like abuse and coercion. No matter the choice a mother makes \u2014 for parenting, adoption, or abortion, there are confidential and free services for women in Oxford.\nThis is one of over 40 pregnancy centers like its kind across Mississippi, one that\u00a0saved American taxpayers $44 million in 2018.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of this tragedy, Ole Miss students Jack Dellinger and Lauren Moses were inspired to restart a pro-life group on campus that had died off in the last few years. The Ole Miss Students for Life exists to educate and dialogue with peers about abortion, provide resources to pregnant and parenting students, and empower the choice for life when their peers face unexpected pregnancies.\nSummer Farrell, the Executive Director of Pregnancy Center of Oxford comments, \u201cWe are so grateful that the chapter has been renewed, trained, equipped, and empowered to move forward and provide education to fellow students facing an unplanned pregnancy. We are grateful to Sarah Zarr, the Southern Regional Coordinator with Students for Life, for investing in the Ole Miss campus.\u201d\nAt a Mississippi Center for Public Policy panel discussion just a month after Ally\u2019s death, a question came from the audience regarding resources at Ole Miss for pregnant women on campus. This question was like a call to action for Jack.\n\u201cMy co-president and I have always been pro-life, but that tragedy was a wake up call to Lauren and me. It showed how abortion affects so many people around us. We just don\u2019t normally see it.\u201d\nSince then, the Ole Miss group has held campus events, had meaningful, peaceful dialogue with those who agree and those who disagree on campus. They\u2019ve had dozens of peers interested in joining their group.\nJust last month, the co-presidents attended the annual National Pro-Life March in Washington, D.C. This 47-year-old march was the largest ever, attracting over 225,000 people, with half of marchers estimated to be younger than 30 years old. President Donald Trump spoke at the event this year, becoming the first president to speak at National Pro-Life March.\nThe students then received apologetics and practical training for their group at the annual, National Pro-Life Summit, held by Students for Life of America, Live Action, Heritage Foundation, and Alliance Defending Freedom. They were joined by students from other campuses in Mississippi like Pro-Life MSU and Mississippi College Students for Life.\nLess than a year later, this brutal tragedy has ignited a fire in our state. Oxford as a community and Ole Miss as a student body are prepared to serve women in a crisis like Ally Kostial may have been. The hope of these students and the pregnancy center community is that students know where to send their friends facing unexpected pregnancies. Pro-Life students at Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Mississippi College, and the over 40 pregnancy centers sprinkled across our state are free market resources, providing help to those in need.\nBy Anja Baker\nRe-posted with permission from the Mississippi Center for Public Policy\n\n Post Views: 2,050\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
