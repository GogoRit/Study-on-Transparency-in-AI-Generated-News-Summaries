Many of the artists have not physically gone through an abortion procedure, but have a shared understanding that safe, accessible reproductive rights are absolutely necessary\u201d explained one of the exhibit\u2019s curators, Jasmine Wahi.  The show comes at a vulnerable time for reproductive rights in the U.S. More than 50 laws restricting women\u2019s reproductive rights were passed in 2019, while the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade is at the mercy of a Supreme Court with a conservative majority.The exhibit\u2019s organizers will contribute proceeds to super PAC Downtown for Democracy, which will divide and distribute the funds to voter education and advocacy and to Planned Parenthood PAC efforts in the upcoming 2020 elections. The first part of the exhibition will run through January 18 at the galarie Eva Presenhuber, and the second part will be displayed between January 21 and February 1 at Arsenal Contemporary.Must WatchIn This Together: Lemonade Stand for Racial Equality, Rosemary Ketchum Makes West Virginia HistoryBy signing up, I agree to the Terms and  Privacy Policy.Cookie SettingsNewsletterAccessibilityAdvertise With UsCareersContact UsCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationPressPrivacyTerms + ConditionsThis publication is a Vox Media network.\u00a92024 Vox Media, LLC.
