This is especially true for women. \u201cMedical training and the \u2018ivory tower\u2019 afford [doctors] a lot of unearned power and privilege in the exam room,\u201d says Anjana Sharma, MD, an assistant professor of family community medicine at the UCSF School of Medicine. \u201cDoctors need to own that power differential, learn trauma-informed care practices, and consider the power dynamics that existed even prior to the clinic visit.\u201d Self-advocacy \u2014 letting your doctors know that you have a human right to equal treatment and care \u2014 is one way that you can shift the power dynamic in your favor. It also means taking an active role in your health journey, ensuring confidence that you\u2019ll get the care you need and boost your satisfaction with the whole experience. Here\u2019s your pre-appointment checklist with 10 ways to advocate for yourself at the doctor\u2019s office, according to women who\u2019ve been there. Share on PinterestIllustration by Brittany England1. Do your research\u00a0Don\u2019t let comments about \u201cDr. Google\u201d stop you from looking into your symptoms. Doctors are only human \u2014 and sometimes they\u2019re wrong. Bridgette Hempstead, a two-time breast cancer survivor, experienced this firsthand nearly 25 years ago when her doctor told her Black women don\u2019t need mammograms because breast cancer doesn\u2019t affect them (!). After Hempstead firmly insisted on a screening and was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer, the doctor called her to apologize. She said she\u2019d been taught to believe that in medical school. While this happened decades ago, research shows that some medical students and residents still hold false beliefs rooted in centuries-old racist stereotypes (like \u201cBlack people\u2019s skin is thicker than white people\u2019s skin\u201d). This can have dire consequences, from disparities in pain treatment for people of color and women to death from preventable causes. That\u2019s why Hempstead founded Cierra Sisters, an organization that provides support, education, and advocacy for African American women\u2019s breast health. She recommends arming yourself with information. Trustworthy sources (like .gov, .org, and .edu sites) can help you figure out what might be going on and which questions to ask at your appointment. Then, if your doctor comes up with a conclusion that doesn\u2019t make sense to you, you can ask them to clarify why they believe what they do, request tests to rule out other possibilities, or ask about other treatment options.

Go doctor shopping\u00a0LaTasha Perkins, MD, a family physician in Washington, D.C., took it as a bad sign when her doctor failed to address that her pregnancy was high-risk due to her age. When she brought it up, her doctor dismissed her concerns and gave her a speedy rundown of potential issues. \u201cThat was not enough for me, so I immediately decided to find a new doctor,\u201d Perkins says. \u201cI did my research and found a Black female physician that was a better fit for me.\u201d Her advice: Know what you want and don\u2019t want in a doctor. With word of mouth and accessible info, you can learn quite a bit about doctors and their practices before you schedule an appointment. Visit their websites and check out their reviews. If the information you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t there, email or call their office to get answers. A few helpful resources: If you\u2019re LGBTQIA+, use the GLMA provider directory to find providers committed to maintaining an LGBTQIA+-friendly practice. If you\u2019re trans, you can use the directory from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) to find trans-affirming docs.If you\u2019re in a larger body, check out the Fat Friendly Health Professionals list. If you\u2019re looking for a psychiatrist who offers appointments online, here\u2019s our guide.Was this helpful?3. Request accommodations before your appointment\u00a0Tell your healthcare provider what you need from them and ask them to jot down your requests in your chart before you come in. Take it from Jenn Welch, a comedian and writer: \u201cFor a few years now, I\u2019ve given my doctors two pieces of information at the start of any appointment, and it\u2019s made my experiences at the doctor\u2019s so much better: I\u2019m in recovery, so please don\u2019t give me any narcotic painkillers, and I have PTSD from sexual trauma, so please let me know if you are going to touch me and talk me through whatever procedures you\u2019re going to do.\u201d Whatever your needs, be open about them so you can be present and make the most of your appointment. 4. Bring notes\u00a0Johannah Ruddy, a patient advocate and the co-author of Gut Feelings, spent about a decade battling severe GI symptoms and visiting a slew of doctors before she finally found a specialist who diagnosed her with a functional gastrointestinal disorder. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a situation where your doctor is dismissing your symptoms, it\u2019s easy to get flustered and blank on specific concerns,\u201d she says. The fix: Write it all down.\u201cA journal of your symptoms can help doctors identify patterns or clues, especially if you have a more chronic or hard-to-diagnose symptom,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s also a great way to maximize the little time you might have with a busy doctor.\u201d What to include in your journal: your symptoms, when they began, and how often they occur what makes your symptoms worse or better any factors that might impact your symptoms (such as your diet, medical history, medications you\u2019re taking, conditions that run in your family, or significant stressors in your life) questions you want to ask about your symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, additional therapies, and coping toolsany other concerns you want to address Was this helpful?\u201cDuring your appointment, be an active listener and consider taking more notes or asking if you can record the session to make sure you don\u2019t miss anything important,\u201d suggests Hempstead. You can also ask for copies of your health records for your own safekeeping, per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).5. Listen to your body\u00a0When Stephanie Chuang, founder of The Patient Story, was undergoing chemotherapy, she had a wonderful but incredibly busy medical team. She also learned that everyone is vulnerable to falling into cracks in the system. The port she had for chemo infusions and blood draws was supposed to be hassle-free, but it never felt right. She didn\u2019t want to seem like a \u201cdifficult patient,\u201d so she *timidly* asked for help \u2014 and was repeatedly met with disbelief. But she was right: Something was wrong. This became clear when a misfit needle caused her skin to tear and develop a serious, painful infection. \u201cI wish I had listened to my body and voiced my concerns more because only I live with my body,\u201d Chuang says. \u201cAs patients, we have to learn that our voice matters, that we don\u2019t need to try to be a \u2018good patient\u2019 who only listens, and that the only person who will always fight for us is us. I\u2019d encourage other women to feel confident in speaking their minds and asking all of the questions they feel are necessary.\u201d6. Lean on your support systemAnother important part of self-advocacy is surrounding yourself with people who can speak for you when you can\u2019t. \u201cSomeone can and should always step up,\u201d says Eva Woolridge, an award-winning photographer and public speaker based in Brooklyn. When Woolridge ended up in the hospital with painful ovarian cysts, her roommate advocated for her throughout the day. Woolridge\u2019s dad was also a key player in ensuring that her doctor didn\u2019t unnecessarily remove her ovary in light of a long history of doctors giving women of color hysterectomies without their consent. \u201cBeyond family and friends, connect with local and virtual community groups like churches, nonprofits, professional patient support and advocacy groups, and social workers for more help,\u201d adds Lauren Freedman, a patient advocate and host of the podcast \u201cUninvisible Pod.\u201d7. Don\u2019t settle for treatment you\u2019re not comfortable withWhen Amy Motroni, a certified baby and toddler sleep consultant, was trying to conceive with her husband 4 years ago, an infertility doctor pressured her to start in vitro fertilization (IVF) right away. But she knew she had other treatment options, like adjusting her hormone levels with medication she\u2019d taken in the past and tracking her cycle more closely. When her doctor told her he didn\u2019t think that would help, she continued to push for it until he agreed and wrote her a prescription. Three months later, Motroni was pregnant with her daughter. \u201cIt could have been a fluke or a miracle, but I am so glad I advocated for myself and tried it my way first,\u201d Motroni says. \u201cIf you have a gut instinct on something, speak up. Doctors know a lot, but they don\u2019t know your body or your history as well as you do.\u201d 8. Coordinate your care\u00a0\u201cWhen you\u2019re seeing a whole bunch of different specialists, they don\u2019t always talk, which can make the diagnostic process take much longer,\u201d says Isabel Mavrides, a Latina disability justice activist and organizer. After a serious spinal injury, surgery, and ever-worsening pain, Mavrides sped things up by speaking with her entire team of doctors to get them to communicate. After that, she got the scans and tests she needed and was diagnosed with a genetic condition they could begin to treat properly. 9. Get that second opinion\u00a0By the time Hempstead was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, it had spread to her lungs and liver. Her doctor told her she wouldn\u2019t live a year and refused to discuss or sign off on any clinical trials or experimental treatments. So, Hempstead fired that doctor and found a new one who provided her with high quality treatment options and rallied for her throughout her cancer journey. \u201cYou have a right to have a doctor that is on your team and that will fight for you,\u201d she says. It might take more than a second, third, or fourth opinion to get the answers you need, but keep fighting for the care that you deserve. 10. File a formal complaint if you feel you\u2019ve been mistreated\u00a0If you suspect that a medical professional is biased against you, has discriminatory practices, or isn\u2019t treating you with respect, report them and find another doctor. When Erica Hernandez\u2019s doctors dragged their feet on confirming her cancer diagnosis, she emailed the office to notify them that they were causing unnecessary stress with their lack of communication and she was filing a complaint. Shortly afterward, she finally got her diagnosis and started treatment. \u201cAsk to speak to the supervisor and see if they have a formal complaint process,\u201d says Hempstead. \u201cGo to the top \u2014 whether that\u2019s the CEO, a patient relations department for a hospital, or your governor and mayor for a state-run healthcare provider.\u201d No matter what level of apprehension you might have about your lack of knowledge regarding your healthcare journey, it\u2019s imperative that you require your doctor to work at your pace. The process is too important for you not to be fully involved and informed and get the level of care you expect. 13 sourcescollapsedChuang S. (2020). Personal interview.Freedman L. (2020).
