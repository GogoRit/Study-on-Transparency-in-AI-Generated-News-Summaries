There are 160 seats in Congress.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Chile takes \u2018first step\u2019 towards decriminalising abortionlist 2 of 4\u2018Letting women decide\u2019: Activists hail Benin abortion votelist 3 of 4The US war on abortion rights will harm women everywherelist 4 of 4Colombia: How will expanded abortion rights affect women?end of list\nThe legislation labels LGBTQ people \u201cabnormal\u201d and prohibits the prosecution of anyone who carries out a hate crime against the community. It declares a family as one involving a married man and woman, outlaws same-sex marriage, and restricts the ability of schools or other educational institutions to provide inclusive sexual education outside of the nuclear family.\nAbortion is already illegal in Guatemala \u2013 with the only exception being if a pregnancy threatens the mother\u2019s life \u2013 but the law also increases the penalty for women who undergo the procedure, whether induced by a doctor or due to a miscarriage.\n\u201cWith the increase in these restrictive policies and legal initiatives, they put the LGBT+ population and women in a situation of high risk,\u201d Homero Fuentes, a 33-year-old activist with LGBTQ rights group Visibles, told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cThese [initiatives and laws] allow hate speech to continue to be promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cThis materialises in a scenario of discrimination, of violence, and to the point of [violent] crimes.\u201d\nA protester holds a sign that reads \u2018No to the hate law\u2019 during a march on March 12 [Jeff Abbott/Al Jazeera]\nConservative nation\nA day after the law was approved, Guatemala\u2019s conservative President Alejandro Giammattei held a ceremony to declare the Central American nation \u201cthe pro-life capital of Iberoamerica\u201d. Congress had already declared March 9 \u201cthe day to celebrate family and life\u201d.\nGuatemala is a religiously conservative country that has largely resisted or undermined efforts to adopt progressive legislation.\nThe law was originally proposed in 2017 by Congressman Anibal Rojas Espino of the conservative VIVA Party. His proposal received a great deal of support from Evangelical Christians and was accompanied by 29,000 signatures from backers of the initiative.\nYet many elements of the current legislation \u2013 including elements that potentially threaten constitutional rights in Guatemala \u2013 led its previous supporters, including the conservative Family Matters Association, to raise concerns this time around.\nAmid that widespread condemnation, including from international human rights groups, Giammattei on March 10\u00a0threatened to veto the law, urging Congress to shelve it instead of forcing him to exert that presidential power.\nAhead of Giammattei\u2019s announcement, the opposition issued an official objection to block the legislation from reaching the presidency, arguing that it violated the country\u2019s constitution and international conventions. The law will come under review Tuesday.\n\u201cIt is a regressive law in every sense,\u201d Ligia Hernandez, a congresswoman with the opposition Movimiento Semilla (Seed Movement), told Al Jazeera. \u201cIt affects many people in this country. They are going to use this law to criminalise women, and to incite hatred.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s rights and LGBTQ activists say the new law has worsened a sense of fear [Jeff Abbott/Al Jazeera]\nSense of fear\nClaudia Rosales, who works with the Sexual and Reproductive Rights Consortium, a coalition of NGOs, said the law has worsened a feeling of fear that already prevailed among women in Guatemala.\nIn 2021, more than 80 percent of all assault complaints that women lodged with the public prosecutor\u2019s office went uninvestigated, daily newspaper Prensa Libre reported.\nThe country also recorded 709 femicides last year, according to data from the Mutual Support Group, known by the Spanish acronym GAM. The Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s office also documented at least 32 killings of members of the LGBTQ community in 2021, and at least nine killings since the beginning of 2022.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe as a woman,\u201d Rosales told Al Jazeera during a protest against the law outside of Congress on March 10.\n\u201c[Guatemala] does not protect women\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the day something happens to us, the justice system does not want to give an adequate, effective, and prompt response to the problems we face.\u201d\n\nRegional trends\nGuatemala\u2019s law runs counter to a so-called \u201cGreen Wave\u201d in the wider Latin America region in favour of decriminalising abortion, while marriage equality rights also have been witnessed in some countries, such as Chile. It also comes as the Giammattei administration has sought to grow closer with US Republican lawmakers.\n\u201cWe are permanently defending what little rights we have,\u201d Ada Valenzuela, director of the National Union of Guatemalan Women, told Al Jazeera about the prevailing atmosphere in the country.\n\u201cWomen in Guatemala we are facing a new inquisition,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is one that affects us all.\u201d\nBut backlash against the law, as well as Giammattei\u2019s veto threat, pushed the president of Guatemala\u2019s Congress, Shirley Rivera, to say lawmakers would check whether it is constitutional.\nThe legislation will come up for further debate on Tuesday, while more protests have been called for that same day, as advocates say their fight is far from over \u2013 even if this particular version of the law is ultimately halted.\nHernandez, the opposition politician, warned:\u00a0\u201cIt could be reborn at any time [under a new name].\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
