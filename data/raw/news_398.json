According to CNN, around 98 percent of legal abortions in Poland are conducted due to fetal defects.\nDunja Mijatovi\u0107, the human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, condemned the ruling and deemed it a \u201csad day for women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\u201cRemoving the basis for almost all legal abortions in Poland amounts to a ban and violates human rights,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling of the Constitutional Court means underground/abroad abortions for those who can afford and even greater ordeal for all others.\u201d\nThe decision prompted fierce protests in many cities. In the capital of Warsaw, protesters gathered outside the house of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of Poland\u2019s right-wing ruling party, holding signs that read, \u201cYou have blood on your hands.\u201d After protesters clashed with riot police, a Warsaw police spokesperson said on Friday that 15 people had been arrested and the police had filed 89 motions in court.\nMore protests are expected throughout the weekend. \u201cIn a few days, hell for women will begin in this country,\u201d reads the Facebook event description for a protest planned this weekend in the city of Gda\u0144sk, according to the Guardian.\nFurther restricting abortion isn\u2019t likely to be a popular move\nOver 100 conservative and nationalist lawmakers asked the constitutional tribunal last year to consider the legality of abortion in the case of fetal defects, something they\u2019ve framed as \u201ceugenic\u201d abortion.\nCritics say that the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party has undermined judicial independence and packed the constitutional tribunal with partisans who will rule in favor of its political programs.  \nPolitical analysts say that the timing of the decision might reflect that tribunal\u2019s desire to help buttress the PiS party\u2019s political interests, particularly at a time when its governing coalition with a smaller, hard-right party is in a state of crisis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s PiS trying to score points with the far right,\u201d Marta Lempart, an activist with Polish Women\u2019s Strike, a grassroots movement focused on abortion rights, told Politico Europe.\nThe court\u2019s ruling does not appear to be in sync with public opinion. \u201cAlthough Poland is one of Europe\u2019s most staunchly Roman Catholic countries, opinion polls suggest there is a clear majority against making the abortion law stricter,\u201d BBC reported.\nFormer Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk tweeted: \u201cThrowing the topic of abortion and a ruling by a pseudo-court into the middle of a raging pandemic is more than cynical.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s rights organizations in Poland say that the actual number of abortions performed every year is far larger than the official numbers show \u2014 many are conducted illegally within Poland or legally in neighboring countries. \nWhile the official number of abortions last year was 1,100, Lempart estimated that Poles conducted 100,000 to 150,000 abortions, either illegally within the country or across the border in neighboring countries with less stringent regulations on abortion. \nThe new ruling could push illicit abortions even further underground by making it an even rarer and more strictly regulated act \u2014 and that in turn could potentially make them more expensive.\n\u201cSafe abortion will effectively be accessible only to women who can afford it,\u201d Lempart told Politico Europe. \u201cOthers will look for cheaper and therefore more dangerous options.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
