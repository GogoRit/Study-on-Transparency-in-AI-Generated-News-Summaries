(AP) \u2014 Abortion will again be legal in Wyoming \u2014 at least for now \u2014 after a judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a ban that took effect a few days earlier.Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens\u2019 decision halts the ban amid a challenge in her court to a law that took effect Sunday. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the law despite earlier rulings by Owens that had blocked a previous ban since shortly after it took effect last summer.Owens put the new ban on hold after a hearing Wednesday in which abortion-rights supporters said the law harms pregnant women and their doctors and violates the state constitution. Owens suspended the ban for at least two weeks.The ban prohibits abortion at all stages of pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest that\u2019s reported to police, or to save a woman\u2019s life.\n\nAn amendment in the Wyoming Constitution says adults have a right to make their own health care decisions, so Republicans enacted a ban that states abortion is not health care. However, Owens said it\u2019s up to the courts, not lawmakers, to decide whether that\u2019s the case.\n\u201cThe state can not legislate away a constitutional right. It\u2019s not clear whether abortion is health care. The court has to then decide that,\u201d Owens said in an oral decision given at the end of an hourslong hearing.The judge did not weigh in on another new abortion law that\u2019s also being challenged in her court: Wyoming\u2019s first-in-the-nation ban on abortion pills. That law, signed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon on Friday, is not set to take effect until July 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo nonprofits, two doctors and two other women have sued to block Wyoming\u2019s broader abortion ban. While the new overall abortion ban says abortion is not health care, the new abortion pill ban suggests otherwise, John Robinson, an attorney for the abortion-rights supporters, argued. That pill ban allows \u201ctreatment\u201d for miscarriages and to save a woman\u2019s life, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cHow can abortion be health care in one statute prohibiting abortion and not the other?\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThat\u2019s medical treatment.\u201dEven Gordon, in allowing the overall abortion ban to become law without his signature, expressed concern it didn\u2019t resolve the constitutional question, Robinson noted.Special Assistant Attorney General Jay Jerde, however, told the judge that the Legislature is permitted to \u201cinterpret the constitution and that interpretation is entitled to significant deference from the court.\u201d He said it would be \u201calmost absurd\u201d to claim, for example, that the amendment would allow illegal treatments in Wyoming such as medical marijuana.Owens suspended a similar abortion ban in Wyoming in July, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending a nationwide right to abortion and leaving it to states to decide. After Owens\u2019 previous order, lawmakers wrote a new law to try to address her concerns.Wyoming has only one abortion provider, a women\u2019s health clinic in Jackson that only provides medication abortions but had been forced to stop after the state\u2019s broad ban took effect this week. \n\nIn Casper, the nonprofit Wellspring Health Access had been planning to open the state\u2019s only full-service clinic to provide surgical and medication abortions. Its opening was delayed by an arson fire in May 2022, and authorities on Wednesday announced a woman was arrested in the case. Lorna Roxanne Green, 22, of Casper, was scheduled to appear in federal court in Cheyenne on Thursday.The nonprofit\u2019s president, Julie Burkhart, welcomed Wednesday\u2019s court ruling.\u201cRegardless of how anti-choice legislators try to spin it, abortion is health care, and Wyomingites have a constitutional right to that care,\u201d Burkhart said in a statement.After an arson attack prevented that clinic from opening as planned last summer, organizers hoped to open it next month.Gordon said in a statement he was disappointed by the ruling but looked forward for the next chance for the state to defend the abortion ban in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
