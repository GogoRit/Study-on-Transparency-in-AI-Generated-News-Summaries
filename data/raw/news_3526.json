During the panel, representatives from the Archdiocese of Detroit encourages parishes to consider ways to reach out to mothers in need of support during an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nThe event was a bit cathartic for those who prayed, canvassed, advocated and politicked against Proposal 3.\nPatti Rose, president of Right to Life-Novi, lauded the efforts of those who spent weeks and months working against the proposal, despite coming up short in the final vote.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the Catholic Church, taking a very solid stand on this issue,\u201d said Rose, who is also a Holy Family parishioner. \u201cI need to point out that this wasn\u2019t a religious issue; it\u2019s a basic moral issue. We reached across lines and did a beautiful job, in my opinion.\u201d\nRose said Proposal 3 supporters outspent their opponents $45 million to $20 million, with a lot of money coming from out of state. Data also showed the \u201cno\u201d campaign did well with married couples who have children, but struggled among single people, those who live in urban areas, and college students.\n\u201cIn the end, they received 2.4 million \u2018yes\u2019 votes to our 1.8 million \u2018no\u2019 votes,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe sad part about that is there are 8.2 million registered voters in Michigan. So that means half of the voters had no voice in this. Instead, they voted and skipped that line, or they just didn\u2019t vote. I\u2019m looking at it as an opportunity to educate those people, grab their attention as potential allies the next time.\u201d\n \n\n\nPatti Rose, president of Right to Life-Novi, outlined various pro-life laws that are now in danger with the Reproductive Freedom Amendment's passage.\n\nKathleen Wilson, pro-life coordinator for the Archdiocese of Detroit, spoke about what parishes can do to help men and women choose life, but first stopped to reflect upon how far the pro-life movement has come since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, including Roe's monumental overturning this summer in the court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I would see Roe overturned,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cMaybe close your eyes for a moment and think about those who first helped you see the sanctity of your own life and the sanctity of the unborn. Who has labored in this vineyard, but maybe didn\u2019t live to see Roe overturned? They are part of your journey and why you want to be here today, to continue the work.\u201d\nMore than 50 parishes in the Archdiocese of Detroit are in the process of setting up Walking With Moms in Need programs, Wilson said, which provide information and resources for women who need assistance in carrying their pregnancies to term and caring for newborns.\nWilson highlighted various organizations present at Holy Family for the gathering, including Mother and Unborn Baby Care, the Knights of Columbus, Project Rachel, The Lennon Center, AAA Pregnancy Resource Center and Mary\u2019s Mantle, as bastions of the pro-life movement.\n\u201cIf you want to help, challenge yourself by asking, \u2018What is God calling me to do?\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWhat's one more thing I might be able to do? The first one is volunteering.\" \nWilson urged people to visit aod.org/walking-with-moms-in-need to learn what's being done in their parish or community, as well as to find volunteer opportunities.\n\"It will point you to a ministry that matches your skills. If you are an accountant, can you give an extra five hours a month?\" Wilson said. \"There are all sorts of jobs and tasks that can be done to help these centers.\u201d\n \n\n\nPro-life ministries across southeast Michigan had booths set up at the Walking With Moms in Need forum at Holy Family Parish in Novi, explaining the services offered to pregnant moms and mothers of infants and how volunteers can assist in pro-life efforts.\n\nEven after Proposal 3\u2019s passage, there is plenty left to do on the political and legal side of the pro-life movement, Rose said, particularly when it comes to advocating in the courts regarding the implementation of the language of the amendment to Michigan\u2019s constitution.\n\u201cWe are going to continue to fight for the unborn,\u201d Rose said. \u201cAs one of my pro-life colleagues said, \u2018If abortion doesn\u2019t stop, neither will we.\u2019 In some respects, we are reset to the days of Roe, where we are going to keep on keeping on, educating people, and doing what we do. So, let\u2019s see what we can do now.\u201d\nMany pro-life laws in Michigan are now threatened by the Reproductive Freedom amendment, Rose added, so it is up to pro-lifers to continue to advocate on measures such as partial-birth abortion, protections for infants born alive, and conscience rights for pro-life physicians.\n\u201cThis amendment is going to lead to an awful lot of lawsuits,\u201d Rose said. \n \n\n\nKathleen Wilson, who directs pro-life outreach for Archdiocese of Detroit, said parishes across the archdiocese are assessing the services, resources and ministries available to mothers in need in their areas and creating action plans to assist them.\n\nAfter a long, drawn-out campaign centered on abortion, Wilson said, women who have had an abortion might be re-living traumatic experiences, placing a greater emphasis on programs such as Project Rachel, a ministry providing healing for post-abortive women and men.\n\u201cStatistics tells us one in four men and women will have been affected by a prior decision related to abortion,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is a time for us to really extend God\u2019s mercy and forgiveness, to let people know there is hope and healing. Whatever parish you are in, make sure there is an advertisement for hope and healing after abortion.\u201d\nWilson said the pro-life work of the Archdiocese of Detroit continues regardless of the outcome of Proposal 3. \n\u201cOur hearts are heavy, but this is a time for us to really put our faith in action as we love and want to save the babies and love and save the mothers as well,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe want families to thrive together. We each have our own experiences and perspectives. We have to come together to work on this in our Families of Parishes, with all the different gifts and talents that have been given to us.\u201d\n \n\n\t\t\tShare:\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Copy Permalink\n Print\n\n\n\t\t\tSuggested reading\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nWhen it comes to changing hearts, prayer works, former abortionist tells volunteers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nSeminarians host 14th annual Dinner for Life to support those \u2018on the front lines\u2019\n\n\n\n\nProposal 3\nPro-life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nGospels hold clues for role of women, men in the Church, panel says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a hostile world, the vocation of Christians is to hope, pope says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPapal envoy asks prayers for peace, solidarity with victims of war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidates, catechumens take final steps on their journey to Catholic Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints Detroit\u2019s Bishop Battersby to lead Diocese of La Crosse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nLocal\nNational/World\nVatican & Pope Francis\nSports\nArts\nClergy Assignments\nObituaries\nEspa\u00f1ol\nArchives\n\n\nMedia\nVideo\nPodcasts\nGalleries\n\n\nVoices\nArchbishop Allen H.
