Eric Holcomb signed a near-total abortion ban into law, one of the state\u2019s largest employers said the new restrictions will hinder its ability to attract talent.\n\r\n\t\u201cGiven this new law, we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state,\u201d pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, said in a statement.\u00a0\n\r\n\tThe statement was the first comment Eli Lilly, which employs more than 10,400 people in Indianapolis, has made on the legislation.\n\r\n\t\u201cLilly recognizes that abortion is a divisive and deeply personal issue with no clear consensus among the citizens of Indiana,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite this lack of agreement, Indiana has opted to quickly adopt one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the United States.\u201d\n\r\n\tThe new law, which goes into effect Sept. 15, bans nearly all abortions. The only cases when abortions will remain legal are if the pregnant person\u2019s serious health or life is at risk; if there\u2019s a lethal fetal anomaly up to 20 weeks post-fertilization; and in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks post-fertiliziation.\u00a0\n\r\n\tLilly also joined other large employers, including Kroger and Amazon, in pledging to cover travel for reproductive services unavailable locally.\n\r\n\tIU Health, another of the state\u2019s top employers, said in a statement it would \u201ctake the next few weeks to fully understand the terms of the new law and how to incorporate the changes into our medical practice to protect our providers and care for the people seeking reproductive health care.\u201d\n\r\n\tIndiana was the first state to approve new abortion restrictions after the Supreme Court ruling in June overturning of Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\n\r\n\tThe ban also drew criticism from the Biden administration, which issued a statement Saturday morning.\u00a0\n\r\n\t\u201cThe Indiana legislature took a devastating step as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate women\u2019s constitutionally-protected right to abortion,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. \u201cYesterday\u2019s vote, which institutes a near-total abortion ban in Indiana, should be a signal to Americans across the country to make their voices heard. Congress should also act immediately to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe \u2013 the only way to secure a woman\u2019s right to choose nationally.\u201d\n\nContact WFYI education reporter Dylan Peers McCoy at dmccoy@wfyi.org.
