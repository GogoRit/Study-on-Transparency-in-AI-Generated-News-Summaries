It was his version against mine. It was hard.\u201d\nNow, 26, Kenia wants to make up for lost time. \u201cI got my family back and I don\u2019t want to stall. I want to keep studying, study English, perfect my cosmetology to be able to help my family,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenia was released Jan. 17, after serving almost nine years of her sentence. She was one of five women serving 30-year aggravated homicide sentences who President Nayib Bukele ordered released since Dec. 23 under pressure from the online human rights campaign.Morena Herrera, director of the nonprofit Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, which has been working to free women since 2009, said El Salvador\u2019s abortion ban doesn\u2019t punish all women, just those who are poor and can\u2019t afford good legal representation. \n\nPoor women, often with lower levels of education, have less access to health care and end up in the public health system where doctors and nurses are compelled to report suspected abortions.El Salvador has criminally prosecuted 181 women who experienced obstetric emergencies in recent decades. Since 2009, 62 women have been freed from prison with the help of women\u2019s rights collectives. Twelve remain in prison.The women spoke one day after Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court legalized abortion up to 24 weeks. A number of Latin American countries have loosened restrictions in recent years under pressure from organized women\u2019s movements pushing the issue through their countries\u2019 courts. \u201cWith an unjust law they criminalize us for being women, for being poor women,\u201d said Evelyn, a 34-year-old who spent 13 years in prison. \u201cI, like my friends, am innocent.\u201dKaren was 21 when she fainted alone in her grandmother\u2019s house while pregnant. She woke up in the hospital \u201chandcuffed to a gurney\u201d and was interrogated by police.Even in prison she felt the stigma as other inmates judged her for what she had been accused of doing. She spent seven years locked up and now yearns to make it up to her now 14-year-old son.\n\nElsy was a 28-year-old single mother working as a housekeeper when something went wrong with her pregnancy and she sought medical attention. Instead she was arrested on suspicion of having an abortion, tried and convicted of aggravated homicide. \u201cThey were 10 difficult years I spent in prison,\u201d Elsy said. \u201cI was far from my son, from my family. Now I want to continue forward to see my son grow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
