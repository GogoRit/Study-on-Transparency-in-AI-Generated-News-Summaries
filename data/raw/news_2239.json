Thorold News is not showing the graphic imagery within. Photo: Kate Turpin/Supplied\n\nSeveral Thorold residents are outraged after graphic pro-life-pamphlets were dropped in their private mailboxes.\nKate Turpin, a mother of three said she received the flyer on Monday morning, after seeing a person around high school age bolting away from her Thorold residence, seemingly after dropping it off.\n\"I saw the pictures and knew right away what it was. It was\u00a0disturbing,\" said Turpin to Thorold News.\n\"I have a newborn at home and am still recovering from labor and delivery, and two other kids who could have seen this among all the Christmas cards that are going around this time of the year. To see this in my mailbox was pretty awful, heartbreaking.\"\nTurpin stressed she thinks everyone has a right to their own opinion, but that dropping off unsolicited sensitive imagery is wrong.\"\nShe posted the front of the flyer in a local Facebook group to warn others and learned that many others had gotten the flyer in the mail in the last few weeks.\nSeveral people said they had seen young people walking door-to-door to drop off the flyer.\nIt was not immediately clear who distributes the flyers locally, but attributions on the flyer lead to Calgary-based Canadian Centre For Bio-Ethical Reform who previously has been criticized for distributing similar flyers in London, Ontario, earlier this year.\nThe distribution of flyers in that case led to local calls for action from the federal government against unsolicited graphic images.\nKate Turpin said she hopes other parents in the area are made aware of what might be hiding in their mailboxes.\n\"I would be glad if this can help someone to be prepared, and throw it away.\"\n\n\n\nTags:  \n\n\n\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\n\n\n0\nShares\n\n\n\n\n\nShare by Email\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\nShare via Text Message\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Local News\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Welland flag raising to mark International Francophonie Day\r\n             Mar 19, 2024 12:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Provincewide, home prices stop falling\r\n             Mar 19, 2024 11:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Jazz at the Lincoln Centre comes to Niagara\r\n             Mar 19, 2024 10:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReader Feedback \n\n\n\nSort \n\n\nOldest\nNewest\n\n\n\nShow\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author: Ludvig Drevfjall\nLudvig Drevfjall has been the editor of ThoroldToday since January 2020.
