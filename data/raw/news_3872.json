That\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want an unplanned pregnancy to stand in the way of her career goals. \n\u201cPregnancy by choice, not by chance,\u201d community health volunteers often emphasize, with the goal of empowering youth to make informed decisions.\nMany women in Maryland County, Liberia\u2014where Comfort is a high school senior\u2014have already had at least one child by the time they\u2019re her age and often have another on the way. The average age for bearing the first child is 18.4 years old, and about 40 percent of women ages 15-19 have already given birth.\nComfort does not yet want to have a child, which is why she was intrigued when she learned about a youth-friendly center (YFC) that provides family planning services. The center also provides condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV. \n\n\nLewis Kruger Jr. (left) interacting with a community health volunteer in front of the youth friendly center at Pleebo Health Center in Maryland County, Liberia. Photo by Marian Roberts/PIH.\n\nA Partners In Health (PIH) community outreach event introduced Comfort to the clinic, which is held in PIH-supported Pleebo Health Center. \n\u00a0\u201cI decided to inquire more about the services so that I can concentrate on my education and finish school to become an accountant,\u201d says Comfort.\nImpressed by the staff\u2019s strict confidentiality and anti-stigmatization policies, Comfort has continued to regularly visit the clinic.\nIt\u2019s a social space, too, which was one of the goals when developing the clinic. \n\u201cWhenever I come to the center, I meet other girls of my age to interact with,\u201d says Comfort. \u201cWe are able to freely ask the midwife all the questions and myths we hear in the community for clarification.\u201d\nPIH and the Liberian government have established and supported the youth-friendly centers through the United Nations Population Fund\u2019s Empowered and Fulfilled (E&F) program funded by the Swedish government. These centers are helping to eliminate barriers to care and education, giving Comfort and other Liberian youth the opportunity to stay healthy and enrolled in school, and to realize their full potential.\nSince 2018, YFCs have responded to the unique challenges and unmet needs of adolescents and have helped reduce the high rates of teen pregnancy in the four southeastern counties of Liberia\u2014Maryland, Grand Kru, Grand Gedeh, and River Gee.\n\n\nLewis Kruger Jr. (left), a registered midwife, giving Comfort Cheebo (right) her Depo-Provera injection at the youth-friendly center in Pleebo Health Center, Maryland County, Liberia. Photo by Marian Roberts/PIH.\n\nPIH supports seven YFCs in Maryland County by training staff and volunteers and supplying reproductive health commodities, ultimately supporting sexual reproductive health and family planning services for more than 17,425 adolescents.\nMinistry of Health employee Lewis Kruger Jr., a registered midwife, runs adolescent sexual reproductive services at Pleebo Health Center\u2019s YFC.\u00a0 \n\u201cI run the facility from Monday to Saturday, and I can boldly say it has contributed to the reduction of teenage pregnancy in Maryland,\u201d says Lewis, who provides care to about 30 clients each day. \u201cAnd I am happy that due to the community sensitization and integrated counseling sessions, it has increased the utilization of sexual health and family planning services by the youth.\u201d\n\n\nPrograms\n\nChild Health\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul's Promise\nAs we mourn the passing of our beloved Dr. Paul Farmer, we also honor his life and legacy.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBending the Arc\nMore than 30 years ago, a movement began that would change global health forever.
