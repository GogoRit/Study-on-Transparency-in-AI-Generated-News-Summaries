Some pro-choice advocates try to argue it is, citing a law in Numbers 5:11-31 and claiming it prescribes abortion as a punishment for adultery. Jimmy Akin explains why that\u2019s incorrect.\n\nTranscript:\nCaller: I\u2019m a pro-life devout Catholic and I have a tendency to try to defend the faith with non-pro-life people, and someone came back at me and said that there was a prescription in the Old Testament under Numbers 5:11-31 that says that abortion is okay. I wanted to know if you could elaborate on that a little bit more? What gives the pro-abortion people the\u2026using the scripture as though it is a prescription for abortion?\nJimmy Akin: To really know why a pro-abortion person would cite this passage, you\u2019d have to ask the individual pro-abortion person, because if the answer is gonna vary from one pro-abortion person to another. I can\u2019t claim to speak for them all, but I can at least briefly comment on I think where the mistakes get made.\nSo if you look in Numbers chapter five, we have a law that deals with what happens if a husband becomes suspicious that his wife has been committing adultery. And this is a law that is based on the cultural conditions at the time and the the state of development that the Israelites had achieved, and they were still in some ways fairly primitive in terms of their walk with God. They\u2019d only just begun walking with God and so God hadn\u2019t fully revealed his will to them. He was working with them kind of where they were.\nAnd this is something that Jesus talks about, how, you know, Moses gave them certain laws regarding divorce, not because God approves of divorce, but because their hearts were hard. And this is the same exact kind of thing: what do you do when you\u2019ve got a jealous husband? Well, the instructions are that the husband\u2019s supposed to take the wife to a priest, and so this is mitigating what the husband might otherwise do if he just took matters into his own hands. It\u2019s like, \u201cNope, you can\u2019t just deal with it yourself, you\u2019ve got to bring her to the priest,\u201d so there\u2019s an outside observer who\u2019s getting involved that will mitigate the situation.\nAnd then, in keeping with the justice systems of the time, they use what\u2019s known as \u201ctrial by ordeal.\u201d And trial by ordeal is where a person is subjected to some ordeal, and if it\u2019s God\u2019s will, the person passes through the ordeal and is to be treated as innocent; but if the person doesn\u2019t pass through the ordeal, that\u2019s going to be taken as a sign that the person was guilty and they\u2019ll be treated as legally guilty.\nIn this case, part of what the priest is prescribed to do is write the charge against the woman on a piece of papyrus or something, and wash the ink off into some water, and also take some of the dust from the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water\u2014so this is holy dirt, it\u2019s dirt from God\u2019s presence there in the tabernacle\u2014and then the woman drinks this after taking an oath in front of the priest. And if she\u2019s guilty of adultery, God may cause certain bodily effects to happen to signify her guilt; but if not, she gets to be treated as innocent.\nNow there are two common areas where, in my experience, people who are pro-abortion have misused this passage. The first concerns the nature of what the woman drinks. It\u2019s portrayed as if it\u2019s an abortifacient, something that will kill the child. This is clearly not the case. Water with a little bit of dust and ink in it is not an abortifacient. And it\u2019s clearly not meant to be an abortifacient, because if she\u2019s innocent\u2014let\u2019s say she\u2019s pregnant by her husband\u2014well, it\u2019s not going to kill the child. It wouldn\u2019t kill any child, because a little water with a little bit of ink and dust in it is not an abortifacient, period.\nThe second has to do with a non-literal translation of what it says the bodily effects are going to be. Literally, what it says is that if she\u2019s guilty, that her thigh will waste away and her abdomen swell. And sometimes people translate this as if she will miscarry, but that\u2019s not what it says literally. And so that\u2019s, I think, the second source of making a mistake in this passage. It doesn\u2019t actually describe a miscarriage. Certainly it does not do so clearly. What it does say is: if she\u2019s innocent, then her abdomen will not swell and her thigh won\u2019t waste away, and she will be able to conceive children.\nSo it looks to me, based on what it literally says, that if she\u2019s guilty of adultery, she may become unable to conceive children, she may become infertile due to the effects that have been described; but those effects are not a miscarriage, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s in view here. So the passage does not presuppose that she\u2019s pregnant at all, just that she\u2019s committed adultery\u2014or, that\u2019s the question to be decided. So I would say there are several mistakes being made by people who would try to use this passage as a warrant for abortion.\nAlso, this whole situation, as a trial by ordeal, is putting the whole issue in God\u2019s hands. So even if this passage said \u201cAnd if she\u2019s pregnant due to adultery, she\u2019ll miscarry,\u201d which it does not say, that would be something that\u2019s put in God\u2019s hands, God having the power of life and death. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve got the power of life and death and can kill people on our own.\nDid you like this content?
