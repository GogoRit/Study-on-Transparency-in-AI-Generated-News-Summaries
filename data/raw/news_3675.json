Wade was overturned. It was a decision that sparked protests across the nation.\u00a0\nAnd on Saturday, the organization\u00a0Pro-Life Wisconsin held a rally on the front steps of Wisconsin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Capitol to advocate for the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1849 abortion ban and let women know that abortion is not the only option.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, because of our 1849 abortion ban, there are no abortions being performed in Wisconsin and we want to keep it that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\u00a0Anna Demeuse, communications director at Pro-Life Wisconsin.\nThis marks the second Pro-Life Wisconsin Rally. Organizers said\u00a0they chose Madison for the rally location because they hoped the organization could reach women that normally wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear from an anti-abortion\u00a0group.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know Madison, we are going to have a lot of people that disagree with us here but it is important to get our message out and to get resources out to women to let them know that abortion is not their only option,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Demeuse.\u00a0\n(Spectrum News 1/Cody Taylor)\n\nThe rally took place during Madison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 market, a weekly event that draws in hundreds of guests from throughout the city and many people, including Navaeh Richardson, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but to stop and see what was going on.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that the issue is disgusting that it is even up for debate whether women can have control over their own bodies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richardson.\u00a0\nAs a young woman, Richardson said this is an issue she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very passionate about.\nBut the message that Demeuse and her organization were trying to spread was also met with counter protesters.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think everybody in the state of Wisconsin should be able to control their own fertility so that means they need to be able to choose when they can have a child and when they choose to end a pregnancy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kim Gasper-Rabuck, an abortion rights advocate.\u00a0\nGasper-Rabuck said she will not rest until women like her have a choice over their own bodies again.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are here to say that Roe V. Wade should be the law of the land, and we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to stop protesting until everyone has access to abortion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gasper-Rabuck.\u00a0\n(Spectrum News 1/Cody Taylor)\n\nRichardson seemed to agree.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really think advocation is really important, but more than anything, I think everybody needs to mind their own business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richardson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just do not think it is even a political issue. I think that politics have absolutely no place in an issue like this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nGasper-Rabuck said if you are someone who wants to have an abortion but live in a state like Wisconsin, you should call Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are two fake clinics in Madison. They are acting like they provide women with medical services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they do not and they are very unsafe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gasper-Rabuck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake sure that you are speaking to Planned Parenthood or another very reputable organization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nDemeuse, on the other hand, asks that if you have abortion facilities in your state, you go outside the business and pray.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still women that are seeking abortions in Wisconsin and we want to still meet those women and let them know that there are people here to help them in their life affirming choice to choose life for their baby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Demeuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            Certifications\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n            Spectrum News App\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
