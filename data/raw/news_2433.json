Read our\u00a0privacy noticeKanye West has shared a series of previously unseen photographs of his children after facing backlash over a now-deleted anti-abortion tweet.On Wednesday, the rapper shared a screenshot of a Google search on Twitter, that asked: \u201cWhat does a six month fetus look like?\u201dAlongside the image, West wrote: \u201cThese souls deserve to live\u201d.However, West quickly deleted the tweet after fans heavily criticised his anti-abortion stance. \u201cNo man should be able to control what a woman does with her body,\u201d tweeted one person.Another added: \u201cDoes he not understand that serious pregnancy complications can require inevitable late-term abortions?\"RecommendedWhy Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t actually a billionaire yet West deleted the tweet and then shared photographs of his four children with his wife, Kim Kardashian West.The rapper\u2019s anti-abortion tweet comes after West described himself as \u201cpro-life\u201d in an interview with Forbes, published on Wednesday, shortly after announcing his presidential bid.\u201cI am pro-life because I\u2019m following the word of the Bible,\u201d he told the publication.West also criticised US abortion service Planned Parenthood, saying: \u201cPlanned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil\u2019s work.\u201dHis comments have been condemned by Planned Parenthood.Nia Martin-Robinson, who is director of black leadership and engagement at the organisation, told the Daily Mail: \u201cBlack women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available.March for Women's Lives: History in picturesShow all 201/20March for Women's Lives: History in

offensive and infantilizing.\u201dThe singer's wife, Kim Kardashian West, has previously expressed her pro-choice views, having met with the president of Planned Parenthood in an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2017.\u201cThe perception of Planned Parenthood is that it is an abortion clinic; that is nothing what it is like,\u201d she said on the programme.\u201cHearing that first hand [women\u2019s stories] really made it real for me,\u201d she added in a subsequent Instagram post announcing her support for the organisation.In his Forbes interview West also indicated that he would
