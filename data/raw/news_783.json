when the exceptions are the only way to enable a woman to have an abortion in many states.\n\n\nAugust 08, 2022 at 10:00 AM\n 5 minute read\n\n\nCommentary\n\n                   \n

even for the life of the mother, many others who oppose abortions generally insist that there be some exceptions. This latter group has a major problem, which is only beginning to surface: how to write an abortion ban that does not run afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s very strong rejection of criminal laws that are so vague that those subject to them cannot determine whether they have crossed the line from lawful to criminal.\nThe Supreme Court has made it clear, time and again, that the Due Process Clause precludes the government from enforcing vague criminal laws. As Justice Antonin Scalia ruled in 2015 in\u00a0Johnson v. United States:\u00a0\u201cOur cases establish that the Government violates this guarantee by taking away someone\u2019s life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\u201d The \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine applies not only to the question of whether the accused has committed a crime, but also to whether a sentence enhancement applies, in that case because of the real uncertainty as to whether the defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis content has been archived.
