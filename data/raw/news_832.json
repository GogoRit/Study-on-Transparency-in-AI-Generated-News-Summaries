Whitmer appointed Bolden to replace Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack.\nAttorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson were also sworn in for their second terms Sunday.\n\u201cFour years ago, I stood before you all and declared that it was a new day for democracy here in the state of Michigan. And indeed, it was,\u201d Benson said.\nBenson took a victory lap for carrying out the 2020 and 2022 elections, implementing new legislative districts drawn by an independent commission, and moving branch offices to an appointment system that she says fulfills her 2018 campaign promise of a 30-minute guarantee.\nBut Benson warned that \u201cwe are in an era of misinformation and bad actors continue to spread lies about our democracy to advance their own agendas. They seek to silence your voices and diminish your ability to hold your government accountable.\u201d\nBenson said she would spend the next four years fighting to \u201cre-center our political discourse on the facts and the truth.\u201d\nWhitmer wore a hot pink coat and mittens representing the state\u2019s lower and upper peninsulas during the inaugural address.\nThe governor asked the audience what makes a Michigander, listing things like pointing to their hometowns on their hands, having the peninsulas and Great Lakes on their cars, clothes and jewelry, and knowing that the Lions are on their way up. (\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a Super Bowl,\u201d Whitmer joked.)\n\u201cBut what makes a Michigander? It\u2019s not any of those things I just mentioned,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s our underdog spirit and our championship swagger. We are tough and we never shy away from hard work. Michiganders are competitive. Even if you count us out, look down on us, or fly over us, I promise you: we will defy your expectations.\u201d\nWhitmer referenced several notable figures who hail from Michigan, including \u201ca rapper from 8 Mile who taught us to lose ourselves in the moment. Sojourner from Battle Creek, born into slavery, who fought for liberation and women\u2019s equality. Her last name was her legacy \u2013 Truth. A genre-defining singer from Detroit who told us that we all deserve a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. A young man from Saginaw, born without sight, whose voice lifts our souls\u201d and \u201canother from Iron Mountain who became one of the greatest basketball coaches to ever do it.\u201d\nBut Whitmer also acknowledged the millions of people whose stories people might not be as familiar with, including \u201ccenturies of Anishinaabe, who fought to preserve their culture and defend the Great Lakes that define us\u201d and \u201cgenerations of families who migrated here\u201d and \u201cbuilt the middle class and the automobile with their bare hands.\u201d\n\u201cThey saw our spectacular peninsulas as places of possibility. They came with nothing, looking for something,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Michigan is at its best: A beacon for anyone who has been counted out or left behind. The embodiment of hope, defined by hard work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWhitmer calls for gun control, repealing abortion ban in 2nd inaugural address\nby Andrew Roth, Michigan Advance January 1, 2023\nWhitmer calls for gun control, repealing abortion ban in 2nd inaugural address\nby Andrew Roth, Michigan Advance January 1, 2023\n Gov.

Whitmer appointed Bolden to replace Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack.\nAttorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson were also sworn in for their second terms Sunday.\n\u201cFour years ago, I stood before you all and declared that it was a new day for democracy here in the state of Michigan. And indeed, it was,\u201d Benson said.\nBenson took a victory lap for carrying out the 2020 and 2022 elections, implementing new legislative districts drawn by an independent commission, and moving branch offices to an appointment system that she says fulfills her 2018 campaign promise of a 30-minute guarantee.\nBut Benson warned that \u201cwe are in an era of misinformation and bad actors continue to spread lies about our democracy to advance their own agendas. They seek to silence your voices and diminish your ability to hold your government accountable.\u201d\nBenson said she would spend the next four years fighting to \u201cre-center our political discourse on the facts and the truth.\u201d\nWhitmer wore a hot pink coat and mittens representing the state\u2019s lower and upper peninsulas during the inaugural address.\nThe governor asked the audience what makes a Michigander, listing things like pointing to their hometowns on their hands, having the peninsulas and Great Lakes on their cars, clothes and jewelry, and knowing that the Lions are on their way up. (\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a Super Bowl,\u201d Whitmer joked.)\n\u201cBut what makes a Michigander? It\u2019s not any of those things I just mentioned,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s our underdog spirit and our championship swagger. We are tough and we never shy away from hard work. Michiganders are competitive. Even if you count us out, look down on us, or fly over us, I promise you: we will defy your expectations.\u201d\nWhitmer referenced several notable figures who hail from Michigan, including \u201ca rapper from 8 Mile who taught us to lose ourselves in the moment. Sojourner from Battle Creek, born into slavery, who fought for liberation and women\u2019s equality. Her last name was her legacy \u2013 Truth. A genre-defining singer from Detroit who told us that we all deserve a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. A young man from Saginaw, born without sight, whose voice lifts our souls\u201d and \u201canother from Iron Mountain who became one of the greatest basketball coaches to ever do it.\u201d\nBut Whitmer also acknowledged the millions of people whose stories people might not be as familiar with, including \u201ccenturies of Anishinaabe, who fought to preserve their culture and defend the Great Lakes that define us\u201d and \u201cgenerations of families who migrated here\u201d and \u201cbuilt the middle class and the automobile with their bare hands.\u201d\n\u201cThey saw our spectacular peninsulas as places of possibility. They came with nothing, looking for something,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Michigan is at its best: A beacon for anyone who has been counted out or left behind. The embodiment of hope, defined by hard work.\u201d\n    \n    \n        \n\t\t\t\n            GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n        \n        \n            SUBSCRIBE\n        \n    \n    \n\t\n\n\n Michigan Advance is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
