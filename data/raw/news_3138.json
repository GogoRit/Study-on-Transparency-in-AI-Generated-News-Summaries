/PRNewswire/ --\u00a0(EWTN) \u2013\u00a0Prudence Robertson has been named as the host of EWTN Pro-Life Weekly,\u00a0a weekly current affairs program focusing on the broad range of life issues. The appointment was announced by Michael P. Warsaw, EWTN Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Robertson comes to the show after serving three years with the national pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List). EWTN Pro-life Weekly was created in 2016 as a co-production of EWTN News and the SBA List. She replaces the program's founding host, Catherine Hadro, who has moved into a new role as an EWTN News contributor.\u00a0 Robertson has been featured in numerous national media outlets including AXIOS, The Daily Caller, Washington Times, and The Federalist, among others. \n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy education and work...have instilled in me a desire to fight for what's right by conveying the truth in love.\n\nPost this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrudence Robertson has been named as the host of EWTN Pro-Life Weekly, a weekly current affairs program focusing on the broad range of life issues. The appointment was announced by Michael P. Warsaw, EWTN Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Robertson comes to the show after serving three years with the national pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List). EWTN Pro-life Weekly was created in 2016 as a co-production of EWTN News and the SBA List.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a spokesperson for the Susan B. Anthony List, Prudence frequently appeared as a guest on EWTN Pro-Life Weekly, bringing her deep knowledge of pro-life issues to the show,\" Warsaw said. \"She also worked behind the scenes with members of Congress, state legislators and governors, and helped provide the show with the top-notch guests for which it is known. Notably, as a graduate of the Franciscan University of Steubenville and a serious Catholic, Prudence brings a deep knowledge and love of the faith to the show.\"\n\nSBA List Vice President of Communications Mallory Quigley also commented. \u00a0\"In her role at SBA List, Prudence connected with movers and shakers in pro-life advocacy and excelled at communicating a winsome pro-life message in the media,\" said Quigley. \"Prudence truly knows the pulse of the pro-life movement and will hit the ground running as host. Our team is so proud of all she accomplished at SBA List and is excited to continue working with her and the EWTN Pro-Life Weekly team to bring vital stories and analysis to millions of EWTN viewers worldwide.\"\nRobertson paid tribute to her predecessor is responding to the announcement of her appointment. \"As founding host of this one-of-a-kind show, Catherine Hadro filled a need in Washington, D.C. and across our nation to report on the top pro-life news for five incredible years. The strong foundation she has laid began a legacy that I hope to carry on as the show's new host, especially as the Dobbs abortion case before the U.S. Supreme Court could result in a springtime where American laws are modernized to better reflect the humanity of unborn children.\" \"My education and work up until this moment have instilled in me a desire to fight for what's right by conveying the truth in love. This show has been a light in the world of media since its founding, and I hope to continue to carry that light, through the intercession of Christ and His Mother, so we can continue to change hearts and minds and save precious lives.\"The EWTN News host comes by her pro-life convictions naturally. She was raised by her parents and is the oldest of four children. Her sister closest in age was adopted from Vietnam when the two of them were just six months old. One of the first things she remembers watching on TV as a young girl was The Rosary with Mother Angelica on EWTN. Robertson says being a part of the Network founded by Mother Angelica is a dream come true and a blessing.
