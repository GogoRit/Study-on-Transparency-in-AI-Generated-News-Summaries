The month of January is National Sanctity of Human Life Month (also called Celebration of Life Month). It offers the chance for reflection on the value of all life and of all children \u2014 including the unborn.\u00a0Bomberger, who is adopted, praised the parents who took him into their home years ago and embraced him as their own. \"My mom and my dad are the most amazing people I\u2019ve known,\" he said.  He added that his \"birth mom experienced the horror and violence of rape\" \u2014 and that he, Bomberger, is the product of that rape. He is grateful, he said, to have been given the chance at life and to have been welcomed into a loving, compassionate family that includes twelve siblings, nine of whom were adopted from neglectful, abusive, or poverty-ridden situations.  \"None of us would've been better off dead,\" he said. \"We're better off loved.\"  DEM SENATOR WARNS OF \u2018REVOLUTION\u2019 IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNEDIn January 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued the first proclamation marking the third Sunday of January as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. Calling the right to life \"the first of our unalienable rights\" and \"endowed by our Creator,\" Reagan specifically chose the anniversary of Roe V. Wade \u2014 Jan. 22, 1973 \u2014 to celebrate the sacredness of life at all stages. This year's Sanctity of Human Life Day is two weeks from now \u2014 on Saturday, Jan. 22, 2022.  Ryan Bomberger of The Radiance Foundation in northern Virginia. He praises his \"loving, compassionate\" parents who adopted him and gave him a home and a chance. He told Fox News Digital, \"Faith shapes the way I think and the way I create.\" (The Radiance Foundation)  The foundation Bomberger co-founded shares pro-life articles and videos via its website; produces a podcast, \"Life Has Purpose\"; and holds an array of events that share the message of life's preciousness as well as the profound costs of abortion to society.\u00a0\"Faith shapes the way that I think and the way I create,\" said Bomberger. \"Instead of joining our culture today in looking through the broken lens of race, the broken lens of class, the broken lens of \u2018fill-in-the-blank\u2019 \u2014 as a Christian, I want to look through the breakthrough filter of Christ.\"\"The circumstances of our conception don\u2019t define the condition of our worth.\" \u2014 Ryan Bomberger to Fox News Digital  \"I am literally the 1 percent that is used 100 percent of the time to justify abortion,\" he said. \"I was conceived in rape, but I was adopted in love.\"\u00a0    The Radiance Foundation spreads hopeful messages on billboards; to date it's created over 500 of them. \"With these billboard campaigns, mainstream media can choose to ignore them, but people passing by them will see them. They\u2019re exposed to them,\" he said. \"It\u2019s one way to circumvent those who control the narrative.\"\u00a0Bomberger's wife, Bethany, co-founded The Radiance Foundation along with him \u2014 and experienced dramatic circumstances herself.\u00a0Before they met, she left an abusive relationship only to learn later that she was pregnant.\u00a0    At the time, \"she felt a sense of shame that, as a teacher in the inner-city Philadelphia schools, she herself was in the [very] place\" that she hoped her own students would not occupy, Bomberger said.But she held firm, saw herself through the pregnancy, and gave birth to a daughter. \"That little girl radically and beautifully changed her life,\" said Ryan Bomberger. \"Her name is Radiance \u2014 we call her Rai Rai. We named the foundation after her.\"The Bomberger family today includes three other siblings as well, two of whom were adopted. \u00a0  The Bomberger family. Ryan and wife Bethany are in the center; their children surround them. The mainstream media really \"doesn't know what to do with me,\" said Ryan Bomberger. \"I'm brown, adopted, passionately pro-life \u2014 and I'm an adoptive father.\" The family believes in James 1:17: \"Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.\" (The Radiance Foundation)  \"We all have a God-given purpose,\" Bomberger told Fox News Digital, \"and we have inherent worth not given to us by man, woman, or governmental institution. We\u2019re called to love one another \u2014 and when you love someone, you don\u2019t want to see any harm come to them, whether they\u2019re in the womb or out of the womb.\"    \"We emphasize love over anything else,\" he said. \"Identity politics are not going to help us regard human dignity any better \u2014 but loving one another does.\"Pro-abortion groups and mainstream media really \"don't know what to do with me,\" added Bomberger. \"I\u2019m brown, adopted, passionately pro-life \u2014 and also an adoptive father.\"  Ryan Bomberger speaks to a crowd during one of his events. \"It matters how our elected leaders regard life,\" he said.\u00a0 (The Radiance Foundation)  Nearly a year ago, President Donald Trump issued what is, at this point, the most recent presidential proclamation about the Sanctity of Human Life \u2014 on Jan. 22, 2021 (it was Trump's fourth such proclamation while he was in the White House).\u00a0Trump affirmed that \"every human life is a gift to the world. Whether born or\u00a0unborn, young or old, healthy or sick, every person is made in\u00a0the holy image of God.\"  TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES PRO-LIFE COALITION  Official observances of the Sanctity of Human Life have been consistent during Republican administrations since 1984, but both the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations declined to issue any such proclamations. Then, in 2021, after President Joe Biden took office, the Biden administration also declined to issue a proclamation \u2014 instead affirming support for abortion rights.\"It matters how our elected leaders regard life,\" said Bomberger. \"Think of civil rights legislation. It happened because political leaders had the spine to change the status quo.\"  Bomberger comes back to the personal: \"I am the tangible example before their eyes of something that is easier to reject in the abstract. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to be that testament of courage of a birth mom. The circumstances of our conception don\u2019t define the condition of our worth.\"    SENATE PRO-LIFE CAUCUS CHAIRMAN RAILS AGAINST BIDEN ABORTION EXECUTIVE ORDERSHow can each of us, in our own lives, affirm life at all stages in our local communities and neighborhoods?\u00a0Start with churches \u2014 then support pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and the women and families there who need help, Bomberger suggested. His foundation also works with college students throughout the year to share important pro-life information \u2014 which counters, he said, \"the culture of death on campus.\"  Bomberger says he is encouraged by all others, no matter where they are, who share the passion for the sacredness of life at all stages.\u00a0  \"We meet warriors in Portland, Seattle, Dallas,\" said Bomberger, who lectures nationwide. \"We may be a remnant \u2014 but the remnant is mighty.\"TEXAS PRO-LIFE CHARITIES RESPOND TO ABORTION-LAW FALLOUT    He said this as well: \"Many may feel alone in their stand for life, especially on college and high school campuses, in their workplaces, or even at church. But courage doesn't need a crowd. It needs a conscience. And that compassionate strength changes everything.\"\u00a0GET THE FOX NEWS APP HERE\u00a0  The National March for Life takes place in Washington, D.C., this year on Jan. 21, 2022.
