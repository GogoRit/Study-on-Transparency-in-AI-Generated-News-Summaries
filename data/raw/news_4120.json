Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Tuesday scrapped proposed changes in the\u00a0abortion\u00a0law that would have made\u00a0Spain\u00a0one of the most difficult countries in Europe in which to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.Susana Vera/Reuters\u00a0Access to abortion in Spain is sacrosanct. The procedures are free \u2014 covered by the public national health care system \u2014 and allowed up until the 14th week of pregnancy for any reason; until the 22nd week with a doctor\u2019s note; and sometimes after 22 weeks if there are issues with either the fetus\u2019 or the mother\u2019s health.Since abortion\u00a0become legal in 1985, right-wing politicians have periodically made feeble attempts to limit or ban access to it. Each time it happens, though, the action is met with strong pushback from the public.But this past January, shortly before the country went into a three-month lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Spanish government\u00a0banned a nonprofit organization, Women on Web, which for 15 years has\u00a0offered\u00a0medically approved\u00a0information\u00a0about abortions in 22 different languages, along with contraceptives and abortion pills.Related:\u00a0Centuries ago, Spanish writers challenged gender norms and barriersThe organization\u2019s website has two main parts. The \u201cI had an abortion\u201d section aims to normalize or destigmatize abortions through the real-life stories of those who have had them. The second, and arguably most important, part is the \u201cI need an abortion\u201d section. Women on Web will mail the pills for a medical abortion to anyone who needs them and provides the needed medical consultation online with a strong emphasis on protecting users\u2019 privacy.Leticia Zenevich, a human rights lawyer representing Women on Web, says\u00a0issues with censorship are not new. What is new is that Spain is the first country in Europe to block the site and one of the few countries to block Women on Web that also deems abortion a protected right.\u00a0The Spanish government has now joined the ranks of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Korea, Iran, Poland, Indonesia and Brazil in forcibly blocking access to a website that, according to its founders, empowers women to make their own health care choices.There are many reasons someone might choose to go through a site like Women on Web, and over the last 15 years, more than half a million people have used the service. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, 90 million women (5% of the global population) live in a country where abortion is outright banned, no matter the circumstances. Another 359 million (22% of the global population) live in a country where abortions are only allowed if the mother\u2019s life is in jeopardy. Even in countries where abortion is legal, there are numerous other barriers that could prevent someone from going to their doctor such as distance or wanting to protect their privacy. No matter the reason, Zenevich says women must have the option to choose what is right for them.Related:\u00a0In\u00a0Spain\u00a0after lockdown, soccer resumes for men \u2014 but not for womenAccording to Zenevich, Women on Web didn\u2019t receive any warnings that their site would be blocked. They only noticed something was wrong after Spain went into quarantine in March when they saw the number of users there decrease by 63% compared to the same month last year. At the same time, neighboring countries like France and Italy were seeing a notable increase in users as they, too, faced lockdowns from the coronavirus pandemic.Women on Web partnered with a local cyberactivist who confirmed the site was down in Spain.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know who blocked us. We had to go to the UN special procedures to pressure them to know what was going on because there was no due process of law. We were just blocked overnight.\u201dLeticia Zenevich, human rights lawyer representing Women on Web\u201cWe didn\u2019t know who blocked us,\u201d Zenevich said. \u201cWe had to go to the UN special procedures to pressure them to know what was going on because there was no due process of law. We were just blocked overnight.\u201dZenevich says they had no idea if the censorship was from private actors, internet service providers, or the government.Related:\u00a0From Minneapolis to Madrid, racial profiling, harassment cost livesSilvia Aldavert, a coordinator at the Association for Reproductive and Sexual Rights in Barcelona, says this wasn\u2019t a good move on the Spanish government\u2019s part.\u201cCensoring this website isn\u2019t very strategic, it\u2019s meaningless,\u201d Aldavert said. \u201cAnd also very symbolic because you are censoring a website of an organization that has had a very important history.\u201dEspecially, she adds, because there are still dozens of other websites, including a few mirror sites of Women on Web, where you can still easily buy the same drugs.In an email to The World, a press person for Spain\u2019s Health Ministry said that the site was blocked because Women on Web provides medication that is not authorized in Spain without a prescription. They say taking these pills without a doctor present is dangerous and not justifiable in a country where, they claim, there are no legal barriers to abortion.Yet the two medications that Women on Web mails out \u2014 Mifepristone and Misoprostol \u2014 are the same drugs used in Spain for medical abortions.Aldavert says\u00a0there are in fact many barriers for women accessing abortion in Spain \u2014 for example, undocumented women don\u2019t have access to the public health care system, and teenagers under 18 must have parental permission. But legal barriers are just the tip of the iceberg. Some women might need to keep it secret from their family or from an abusive partner, which was exacerbated during the nationwide lockdown. Or, they might face mobility or travel obstacles like having to travel long distances, not having a car or not being able to afford or access public transportation.A study conducted by the World Health Organization found that between 2010 and 2014, roughly half of the 55.7 million abortions that took place were considered unsafe. While WHO classifies medical abortions without supervision to be unsafe, they said that if women access the pills through a telemedicine service like Women on Web, it is classified as a safe abortion.\u201cAs an institution, your obligation is to give information to women, never to censor. The problem is not that sites like this exist, but rather that women aren\u2019t informed about their basic rights surrounding abortions.\u201dSilvia Aldavert,\u00a0 Association for Reproductive and Sexual Rights\u201cAs an institution, your obligation is to give information to women, never to censor,\u201d Aldavert said. \u201cThe problem is not that sites like this exist, but rather that women aren\u2019t informed about their basic rights surrounding abortions.\u201dRelated:\u00a0The first talking film made by a woman in\u00a0Spain\u00a0resurfacesAldavert says that at the Association for Reproductive and Sexual Rights, they have to clear up misconceptions or false information about abortions with their patients every day.\u201cIt shows that this information isn\u2019t reaching many women,\u201d Aldavert said. \u201cIf the government really wanted to stop women from using these kinds of sites, they would create a comprehensive campaign to educate the public.\u201dThere has never been that kind of educational campaign from the Spanish or regional governments, Aldavert says.While this can be a problem for anyone facing an unwanted pregnancy, it is particularly challenging for migrants, those who don\u2019t speak the language or those who don\u2019t understand or have access to the country\u2019s health care system. Zenevich says that in 2019, Women on Web received requests in 22 different languages in Spain alone.Aldavert says that she doesn\u2019t believe this was an intentional move to suppress abortion rights, but rather a political response to local news outlets warning about the online sale of abortion pills. But, she says, this is part of a bigger trend all over Europe and the United States where abortion rights are slowly being chipped away by blocking sites or introducing clauses like that of \u201cconscientious objectors,\u201d doctors who deny abortion services based on moral, religious or personal grounds. This can be particularly tricky as some public hospitals in Spain operate in partnership with the Catholic Church.\u201cIf the government really wanted to keep women from ordering pills online, they should fill the gaps and ensure no one in Spain would even be in a situation where they need to order a pill online,\u201d Aldavert said.\u00a0Sign up for our daily newsletterSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Email AddressEmail AddressSubscribeI have read and agree to your Privacy Policy.Related ContentWhy an international court struck down Costa Rica\u2019s IVF banSurrogacy advocates fear pope\u2019s position will create stigmaAs India becomes the world's most populous nation, engaging men in family planning \u2018will be a game changer'Abortion is illegal in Malta.
