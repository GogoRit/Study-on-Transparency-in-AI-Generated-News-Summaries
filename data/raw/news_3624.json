She touts her efforts to be the first state to command kids back to school and to keep Iowa \u201copen for business,\u201d as Iowans were filling hospital beds and clinging to life on ventilators.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIowa recently surpassed 10,000 coronavirus deaths. That\u2019s as many people as live in Carroll, or Fort Madison. It amounts to approximately 315 deaths per 100,000 Iowans. \nBy comparison, Minnesota and Wisconsin both have higher vaccination rates and took a sensible, science-based approach to managing the pandemic. They also had a lot fewer deaths per capita than Iowa (MN: 239 deaths per 100,000, and WI: 259 deaths per 100,000).\nIf Iowa had the same COVID death rate as Minnesota, approximately 2,351 Iowans would still be enjoying our beautiful fall colors. If Iowa had the same death rate as Wisconsin, approximately 1,771 Iowans would be looking forward to celebrating the upcoming holidays with their loved ones.\u00a0\nOur \u201cpro-life\u201d governor\u2019s reckless MAGA approach has taken a deadly toll. Early on she got in bed with the anti-vaxxers and spread misinformation about masks and social distancing while celebrating the freedom to stay unmasked and unvaccinated. \nIt appears Reynolds has washed her hands of COVID, hoping that it will just disappear. Sadly, Iowa continues to experience about 25 preventable coronavirus deaths a week because of our low vaccination rates. No flags ordered to half-staff in remembrance of Iowa\u2019s pandemic victims. \nThe governor continues to fail at her number one responsibility to keep Iowans safe. Vote her out!\u00a0\n\nTop image: Iowa State Medical Director Dr. Caitlin Pedati (left) and Governor Kim Reynolds pose with President Donald Trump during an Oval Office visit on May 6, 2020.

You identify numbers to represent Iowa deaths. Add to that number of Iowans who continue to ail from COVID. That represents thousands of friends and family members affected by her gross negligence.   Perhaps DeJear can ask audiences in the coming weeks-\u201chow many of you have had loved ones hospitalized, or seriously ill, or lost to COVID\u2019.\u201d How many of you are comforted that  Reynolds could have, should have done more.  \niowaralph \u00a0Thu 27 Oct 12:42 PM \n\n\nComments Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nJoin the Community\n\n\nSubscribe to Evening Heartland\n\n \n\nMembership & Support\nBecome a Sustaining Member\nSupport using Venmo\nSupport using Patreon\nSupport using Paypal\nReaders can support independent journalism and help cover reporting costs, such as public records requests, by contributing here.
