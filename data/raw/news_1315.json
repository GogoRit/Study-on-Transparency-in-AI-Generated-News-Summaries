In some states, courts are embroiled in an on-off battle that can see abortion banned in a state one day, unbanned the next, and back off the table two weeks later.Doctors are on the frontlines of this chaotic landscape, fearful of running afoul of ever-changing law, in some cases struggling to provide life-saving care. In most cases, doctors have stayed in abortion-restrictive states, because despite restrictions on their medical practice, they have ties to their patients, their communities, their families.But others have decided to leave. What do they leave behind? In a country where, according to an analysis from the March of Dimes, nearly half of all counties lack a single obstetrician, what care will remain? And what do their predicaments tell us about what it is like to work in reproductive health in much of the US?Here are five of their stories.Alireza Shamshirsaz, 48Alireza Shamshirsaz had a house in Houston, Texas. In the backyard was a small pool, where his kids learned to swim. He met his wife in Texas, built his family there, and felt it was his home. But after Texas passed its six-week abortion ban late last year, a decision he faced at work would sour things for him.A couple whose pregnancy was not going to be viable came to him for care, but because of Texas\u2019s abortion ban, he had to send them hundreds of miles away.The mother was 21 weeks pregnant with identical twins, which shared one placenta. One of the twins was almost certainly going to die, which would most likely have killed the other twin without intervention.Shamshirsaz wanted to use a selective, lifesaving procedure: by stopping the blood flow to the unhealthy twin, he could save the other\u2019s life.In Texas, he didn\u2019t have that option.\u201cThey were just crying, crying in the middle of my office,\u201d says Shamshirsaz.View image in fullscreenDr Alireza Shamshirsaz near the hospital he works at in Massachusetts. He is one of the many US doctors who have decided to leave their states because of abortion bans. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianThe worst bit for him was knowing how urgent the situation was.\u201cThey needed to get all the way to the east coast or west coast before they would find a doctor who could help them, and they needed to do it in the next 24 or 48 hours. Even in the best scenario I don\u2019t think 99% of people could have made that trip in the time they had,\u201d he says.Shamshirsaz doesn\u2019t know what happened to the couple, but their case deeply affected him.\u201cMost people don\u2019t have the option to travel to other states. The rich people can travel,\u201d he says, but others can\u2019t.Waiting is the new norm in abortion-restrictive states: even in cases where foetal survival is an impossibility, doctors often must wait to intervene until  the last moment, at huge risk to pregnant people.\u201cIf we wait to the edge, we have more near misses. In medicine, when you have too many near misses, eventually, you actually miss. That means ending up with a dead mother,\u201d says Shamshirsaz.Shamshirsaz now works in Boston. Since Roe fell, he is relieved not to be in an abortion-restrictive state surrounded by other restrictive states. But he fears for Texas.\u201cIf you can\u2019t do a termination, who will support these kids after the birth? Who will pay the bills they will need for medical care? Nobody. We destroy these families,\u201d he says.Catherine Romanos, 43When Catherine Romanos was 28, she fell in love with the idea being an abortion provider. In medical school, she signed up to train as part of a movement to get younger people trained in providing abortions, and after her first job at a Planned Parenthood, she decided to stick with it. She loved the way she was able to build trust with patients, supporting them at an intimate moment in their lives, sometimes soothing their shame.But in June 2022, Ohio\u2019s six-week ban went into effect. Romanos, now 43, went from working in a Dayton office that performed 40 to 50 abortions a day to seeing less than a handful of patients daily.\u201cI went from feeling really needed, to almost three months where I really couldn\u2019t do my job at all. It was very demoralizing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was worst for people answering the phones. They were taking hundreds of calls a week from people trying to figure out where they could go.\u201dView image in fullscreenDr Catherine Romanos poses for a portrait in Ohio. Romanos, an abortion provider, went from working in a Dayton office that performed 40-50 abortions a day, to seeing less than a handful of patients daily. Photograph: Maddie McGarvey/The GuardianThe day the Dobbs decision came down, Romanos ordered licenses to practise elsewhere \u2013 in Michigan and Illinois. Ohio\u2019s abortion ban has since been blocked.Nearby, Indiana\u2019s near-total ban is also on hold due to legal challenges. In November, Michigan will decide whether to protect abortion in its state constitution or to ban it using a 1931 law.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to plan your life when the judge\u2019s orders come in 14-day increments,\u201d says Romanos.Romanos sees the impact of these seesawing laws on her patients: in late September, she helped a Hoosier patient, who found out she was pregnant on the first day abortion was illegal in Indiana. In the time it took the patient to drive to Ohio, then back to Indiana for her mandatory 24-hour waiting period, and back to Ohio again for the abortion, the ban in Indiana had been temporarily lifted.\u201cIt\u2019s so insulting to her,\u201d says Romanos.Zevidah Vickery, 51Zevidah Vickery was never supposed to be an OB-GYN. She studied feminist theory, and thought she\u2019d be an academic or a sociologist one day. Then she started working as a medical assistant at an abortion clinic in Seattle, and everything changed.Her first cases were difficult. She saw patients forced to engage in sex work, leave their children with neighbors, or travel from Alaskan villages without support from their families to find an abortion provider .That\u2019s when she decided she on her career . \u201cI was just blown away by the courage and the desperation of patients,\u201d says Vickery. \u201cSuddenly, writing some feminist take on social phenomena seemed less immediately useful.\u201dView image in fullscreenDr Zevidah Vickery, former OB-GYN and current addiction specialist, in her home in Ohio. Photograph: Amber N Ford/Amber N Ford for The GuardianWhat followed was 15 years of study to be the kind of provider she dreamed of: Vickery took night classes in math, went to med school, and did another four years of residency and two more years in fellowship to become an expert in abortion and contraception.In 2020, she landed her dream job in Ohio as a full-time abortion provider who also taught students. She finally had weekends to herself, which meant she could spend time with her son.\u201cI loved the people. I loved the organization, I loved my boss,\u201d she says.Then, Vickery saw the leaked draft judgment suggesting the constitutional right to abortion would soon fall. She knew abortion bans would come quickly in Ohio, an already restrictive state. So she made a decision. After years of moving her son around for her career, she was going to stay put.\u201cI\u2019m his only family really,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move him any more,\u201d she says.Now, Vickery is a retraining to be an addiction specialist. She describes leaving the job she loved as a long process of mourning.\u201cIt really is exactly like grief. [I\u2019m doing] all of the things you have when you\u2019re grieving \u2013 like suddenly you\u2019re sobbing on your way home,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not married, my career is my husband. I invested everything into getting where I was.\u201dThe most difficult thing for Vickery to think about is what her patients have lost.\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough of us as it is,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even want to practice in red states any more. So it\u2019s not just the loss of one person who\u2019s an expert in abortion care. It\u2019s the ripple effect of that.\u201dLeilah Zahedi-Spung, 34Leilah Zahedi-Spung has spent her career zigzagging around abortion-restrictive states. She started out in Georgia, just before a 22-week abortion ban went into effect in 2019. She moved to Missouri later that year, when the state passed an eight-week ban (which didn\u2019t go into effect as Roe v Wade\u2019s protections still stood). Last year, she moved to Tennessee, where the state recently banned abortion without any exceptions. That was the last straw.Zahedi-Spung is exhausted. She is fed up with sending every patient who comes to her for an abortion out of state and wondering if she is putting their lives at risk. One patient she sent out of state had to travel in deteriorating condition. After crossing a border five hours away for care, the patient\u2019s kidneys had started to fail. The patient was OK, but Zahedi-Spung wished she could have intervened earlier.\u201cI am now complicit in a system that is making me harm people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a gut punch every time I have to tell someone, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, your foetus and this child you so desired is not going to survive outside of this pregnancy, because it has some awful anomaly. And there are no exceptions to the law in Tennessee, and you now need to travel out of state to get the care that you deserve.\u2019\u201dShe is a maternal foetal medicine specialist and is horrified by the number of women who will be forced to give birth \u2013 especially considering the states with the tightest abortion restrictions are those with the worst maternal mortality rates. (Tennessee ranks fourth worst in the country.)View image in fullscreenLeilah Zahedi-Spung at her home in Tennessee. Photograph: Kendrick Brinson/The Guardian\u201cThere\u2019s guilt that I\u2019m leaving patients in a community that I care about deeply,\u201d she says.But she looks forward to practicing in Colorado, where she will be moving. She feels relief to be starting over in a new state \u201cwhere I\u2019m not under a microscope. That someone isn\u2019t gonna turn me in to the cops, or show up at my house and arrest me for doing my job,\u201d she says.Anne Banfield, 44Anne Banfield is glad she left Elkins, West Virginia, in April 2022 to practice as an OB-GYN in Maryland. Shortly after she left, the state brought in a near-total abortion ban. She thinks often about the decisions she won\u2019t have to face now she doesn\u2019t live there any more. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about whether her patients will be able to access care or whether she can provide appropriate advice to them without running afoul of the law. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about them getting needlessly sick or maybe even dying from preventable issues.View image in fullscreenDr Anne Banfield poses for a portrait at her home in Maryland. Photograph: Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/The GuardianIn 2013, while she was still in West Virginia, she saw a patient in the emergency room who was 17 weeks pregnant when her water broke. The patient\u2019s partner, a US army vet, was out of the country while she grappled with terrible news: without a termination, her baby was unlikely to survive, and if it did, it would probably have significant problems. The patient was at risk of a life-threatening infection, kidney damage, even death.She was able to terminate the pregnancy with Banfield as her doctor. In a post-Roe America, she would have needed to travel out of state or wait until her own condition deteriorated.\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell [people] in a horrible situation, they can\u2019t receive the healthcare they need in their home state, because of the law,\u201d says Banfield.Having practiced in the state for almost 14 years, she still has friends working in West Virginia under the abortion ban. Every time one tells her about another patient they had to send across state lines, Banfield is relieved she no longer works there.But she worries about her two nieces and what the future will look like for them.\u201cI don\u2019t want them ever to be in a situation where they don\u2019t have choice,\u201d says Banfield.Now, her biggest concern is that people in the state she loves will suffer from avoidable conditions, and die avoidable deaths from ectopic pregnancies or haemorrhaging because they would be scared to get treatment for a miscarriage that may fall under suspicion.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid your local emergency department is going to investigate you for a miscarriage, or to turn your information in to the police because of some crazy restriction in your state, then people are going to delay care. That scares me,\u201d she says.Explore more on these topicsAbortionRoe v WadeReproductive rightsUS supreme courtfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
