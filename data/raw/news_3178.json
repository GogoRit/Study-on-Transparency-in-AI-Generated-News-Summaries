Abortion is a marker of social inequality.\u201d\nAlliance VITA is an association in France that provides support for women facing difficult or unplanned pregnancies and advocates for the protection of human life in public policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaroline Roux, the deputy executive director of Alliance VITA, said that it is \u201cnecessary more than ever that a real assessment of the causes, conditions, and consequences of abortion be carried out at national and European level.\u201d\n\u201cThis would be a real step forward that the French Presidency should offer to protect women,\u201d she said.\nFrance took over the presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first time in 14 years on Jan. 1. The Community of Sant\u2019Egidio, a Catholic group, has proposed a collaboration with Macron to promote the abolition of the death penalty worldwide during the French EU presidency.\nMacron called on Jan. 19 for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to be revised \u201cto be more explicit on environmental protection or the recognition of the right to abortion,\u201d in a speech to members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern France. \nIn the address, he noted that the charter has \u201censhrined the abolition of the death penalty throughout the Union.\u201d\nRoux said that the French president\u2019s comments about the \u201cabolition of the death penalty\u201d and the \u201crecognition of the right to abortion\u201d side by side show that \u201cEmmanuel Macron's intention is out of step.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAddressing the painful issue of abortion head-on, without prior debate, and without mentioning any policies of prevention and support, is to do violence to the many women who want society to help them avoid abortion, which is often carried out under pressure,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe abolition of the death penalty, recalled by the president in his speech, as well as the right to life are among the values inscribed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.\u201d\nThe EU charter recognizes the right to life but does not mention abortion. It states that \u201cEveryone has the right to life\u201d and \u201cNo one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacron\u2019s speech came on the same day that the French Senate again rejected a bill to extend abortion on demand beyond 12 weeks, the current legal limit on abortions in France.\nUnder current French law, abortions in the second and third trimesters are permitted only if two physicians certify that it is necessary to save the life of the mother, to prevent grave and permanent harm to her health, or the child has a severe and incurable illness.\nThe French Senate voted 202 to 138 to reject the bill for a legal extension of abortion from 12 weeks to 14 weeks on Jan. 19, according to Le Figaro.\nIn response to the vote, Brigitte Bourguignon, the French Minister of Autonomy, said that the government \u201cfiercely defends\u201d a right to abortion, adding that \u201cthe President of the Republic reaffirmed this commitment forcefully this very morning.\u201d\n\nMore in Europe\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland\u2019s controversial new hate crime law set to come into effect April 1\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe declaration of the President of the Republic shows an incoherent position, disconnected from the reality experienced by women,\u201d Alliance VITA said.\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nEuropean Parliament, \nFrance, \nEmmanuel Macron, \nAbortion in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney Mares is a Rome Correspondent for Catholic News Agency.
