Wade at the U.S. Supreme Court and so much arguing over abortion in the news.\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of why we went that direction,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere you\u2019ve unborn, young, or old, all of us are created by God and have value because of that. Kids even as young as kindergarten have already been exposed to these issues and they need to hear that God made them.\u201d \nBlakely said it wasn\u2019t just the kids that got involved; they had 50 adults participating and leading as well.\n\u201cIt really is a huge part of our church\u2019s ministry,\u201d she said.\n\u2018VBS is still going strong\u2019\nChristy Nance, the state Vacation Bible School Director, said VBS is just as vital a tool as it\u2019s ever been.\n\u201cEveryone is so excited!\u201d she said. \u201cVBS definitely still works! Parents seem to embrace the concept of Vacation Bible School without reservation. Kiddos love rotating through a variety of activities. Many VBS\u2019s are incorporating parents into VBS though adult Bible classes, or parenting classes that provide fellowship and connection to the church and its members.\u201d\nThe Rock Church in Ballwin where Nance is a member hosted a weekend VBS with 50 kids participating. They closed out the weekend Sunday morning with five children accepting Christ as savior. They also raised more than $300 for a school in Kenya.\n\u201cSmall, but mighty!\u201d Nance said.\nSome churches are just now returning to normal programs like VBS after two years off after COVID, she said.\n\u201cNumbers vary, but the joy and thankfulness to be doing VBS is strong,\u201d she said. \u201c\nThere have been so many reports of obstacles, illnesses, volunteer shortages \u2013 but VBS is still going strong! God is faithful!\u201d\nNance said she encouraged Missouri Baptist Convention churches to report their VBS work and results at vbs.lifeway.com. \n Comments\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n Historic rural church building, empty for five years, houses new Missouri congregation\n Hedger to step aside as MBC multiplying churches director, begin ministry with Ridgecrest, Springfield\n U.S. Supreme Court Justice Alito sounds alarm after Christians denied jury duty in Missouri court\n First Baptist O\u2019Fallon offers missions training, trips\n Christian teacher in Kansas City fired for biblical convictions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEthics\nDefend the sanctity of life with compassion, convictionBenjamin Hawkins Missourians must remain vigilant in protecting the life of the unborn, since Planned Parenthood and other pro-abortion groups are working hard to bring a culture of death back to our state.
