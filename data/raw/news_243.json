Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n      \n\n\n\n\nWhen Paige Alexandria found out she was pregnant, she wanted a medication abortion.\nBut she lived in Austin in 2016, three years after Texas passed abortion restrictions that drove more than half the state\u2019s clinics out of business. While many clinics were still open in Austin, they were so busy serving patients from other parts of the state that Alexandria couldn\u2019t get an appointment for three weeks.\nAlexandria called the clinic every day, hoping someone would cancel so she could get an earlier appointment. \u201cFor any person who is pregnant when they don\u2019t want to be,\u201d she told Vox, \u201cevery day feels like a year.\u201d\nNow, countless Texans are having a version of Alexandria\u2019s experience, wanting an abortion but uncertain when \u2014 or if \u2014 they\u2019ll be able to get one. Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that abortion did not qualify as essential health care during the coronavirus pandemic and ordered all procedures postponed unless the life of the pregnant person is threatened. The state was one of at least five to essentially ban abortion during the pandemic \u2014 a move that anti-abortion groups have championed but that abortion-rights groups have characterized as a ploy to exploit a public health crisis for ideological gain.\nAbortion-rights advocates have been fighting the bans in court, but on Tuesday, a court ruled that the Texas ban can go into effect, for now. That leaves Texas patients with a choice: Delay the procedure for an uncertain amount of time, or try to travel out of state during a pandemic to end their pregnancies.\nEven if they\u2019re able to travel, the current crisis has placed serious new obstacles in their way. In many states, an abortion requires multiple visits to a doctor \u2014 which could mean multiple exposures to the coronavirus in waiting rooms and other facilities. Meanwhile, the enormous economic toll of the pandemic has made it even harder for many low-income people to afford the procedure. \n\u201cFor our callers, expenses like groceries and rent are already difficult to obtain,\u201d Cristina Parker, communications director at the Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, which funds abortions in Texas, told Vox in an email. \u201cBut with the added instability of our economy \u2014 and with so many losing their jobs virtually overnight \u2014 paying out of pocket for an abortion can be next to impossible.\u201d\nFor Alexandria, the daily calls paid off. She was able to get an abortion after two weeks instead of three. But it was still too late for her to get a medication abortion; she had to get a surgical procedure, which was more expensive and required more time away from her two children. And today, she feels for those who are trying to end their pregnancies but are faced with fear, uncertainty, and delays.\n\u201cAbortion is essential,\u201d she says, \u201ceven during a pandemic.\u201d\nAt least five states have essentially banned abortion during the coronavirus pandemic\nAs coronavirus sweeps the country, many areas are placing restrictions on businesses and services deemed nonessential, as well as pushing back nonemergency medical care. In the midst of such moves, officials in several red states \u2014 including Texas, Ohio, Alabama, Iowa, and Oklahoma \u2014 categorized abortion as nonessential and ordered that clinics postpone procedures until the crisis is over. \n\u201cNo one is exempt from the governor\u2019s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement last week. \u201cThose who violate the governor\u2019s order will be met with the full force of the law.\u201d\nAbortion opponents argue that abortion is an \u201celective\u201d procedure and that providers should stop offering it and donate their masks and other protective gear to the coronavirus response.\n\u201cSomebody needs to tell the abortion industry there\u2019s a pandemic going on,\u201d Mark Harrington, president of the anti-abortion group Created Equal, said in a statement last week. \u201cAbortion is an elective procedure or they wouldn\u2019t call it a \u2018choice.\u2019\u201d\nBut providers and abortion-rights advocates say abortion is just as necessary now as it ever was. \u201cAbortion is essential health care,\u201d Dr. Ashley Brant, an OB-GYN in Ohio and fellow with the group Physicians for Reproductive Health, told Vox in an email. \n\u201cMany of my patients are experiencing fear,\u201d Brant said. \u201cFear of contracting Covid-19, fear of losing their jobs and income, and fear of not being able to support their families. They should not have to fear losing access to reproductive health care, too.\u201d\nAbortion-rights advocates say that opponents, and governors of states like Texas, are just using this moment to score political points. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how shameful it is to take advantage of this pandemic to just further shame women seeking abortion care,\u201d Kelsey Ryland, director of federal strategies at the abortion-rights group All* Above All, told Vox.\nAfter Texas and other states announced bans, clinics had to cancel or postpone appointments for many patients, as Ema O\u2019Connor reports at BuzzFeed.\nPlanned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and other groups supporting abortion rights filed suit in five states to allow abortions to go forward. And on Monday, federal judges in Texas, Ohio, and Alabama ruled in their favor, meaning that clinics in those states could stay open. But Texas appealed the ruling to the Fifth Circuit, which on Tuesday allowed the state\u2019s ban to take effect, at least for now. \nThat leaves Texas patients in limbo, facing the possibility that abortion may be banned in their state for weeks, months, or even longer. \nSince abortion becomes more expensive later in pregnancy \u2014 and since some states, including Texas, ban it after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation \u2014 the delay is likely to have serious repercussions for many.\nSome are already trying to travel out of state for the procedure, said Alexandria, who now works at the clinic where she got her abortion in 2016. Traveling at this time is especially difficult \u2014 some public transit routes have been reduced due to the pandemic, and contact with others during travel could increase patients\u2019 chances of exposure.\nThe bans are just one of many barriers to abortion access right now\nEven if patients can get to a clinic, they face a host of obstacles and concerns when they arrive. \nMany states require multiple in-person clinic visits for an abortion, even by medication. \u201cThis means that patients have to travel for care, sit in waiting rooms, and interact with multiple health care providers,\u201d Brant said. \u201cThis endangers families and communities and promotes spread of the virus.\u201d\nIn order to mitigate those risks, a group of 21 attorneys general is asking the Trump administration to lift restrictions on medication abortion so that it could be prescribed by telemedicine around the country. Given the administration\u2019s past embrace of restrictions on abortion, however, it is unlikely to agree.\nAnd the pandemic will only worsen obstacles that many people already face when seeking abortions, many reproductive rights advocates say. \u201cThings that were already hard like getting to the clinic for multiple visits, getting child care, could be nearly impossible right now,\u201d Ryland of All* Above All said. People who are low-income \u2014 the majority of abortion-seekers in America \u2014 may be facing job layoffs and more difficulty paying for an abortion than ever, she said.\nThe Hyde Amendment already prohibits the use of federal funding for most abortions, and Republicans insisted on Hyde Amendment language in the recent coronavirus stimulus bill to ensure that states and localities couldn\u2019t use the stimulus funds to help pay for abortions.\nAs someone who had an abortion, Alexandria knows what it\u2019s like to have to delay the procedure. For her, it wasn\u2019t just the added cost of the surgical abortion. Because she didn\u2019t have a ride to the clinic, she wasn\u2019t able to be sedated for the procedure, increasing her discomfort.\n\u201cIt was really just hard not being able to access care when I needed it,\u201d she said.\nBut now, as a patient counselor at a clinic, she says she also sees the ways that advocacy groups are trying to help people get abortions during this time, whether it\u2019s sending money to abortion funds in states affected by bans or booking hotel rooms for people who need to travel to get the procedure.\n\u201cEven though access looks really hard right now,\u201d she said, \u201cthere are so many people fighting right now to make sure that access remains a reality.\u201d\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
