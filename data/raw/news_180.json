Kim Reynolds delivers the Condition of the State speech, Jan. 14, 2019. \u2014 video still/Iowa PBSGov. Kim Reynolds called for adding an anti-abortion amendment to the Iowa Constitution in her Condition of the State speech on Tuesday.\u201cAs we begin 2020, I\u2019m focused on the overall wellness of all Iowans, in every part of the State, in all stages of life,\u201d the governor said early in her speech.  \n \n\n \nSign up for our free newsletter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS: The latest stories delivered right to your inbox (daily)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENTS: The Weekender every Thursday and updates from LV Tix and the LV Events App (1-3/week)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd when I say all stages of life, I mean to include the unborn. We must protect life by making clear, through an amendment, that our constitution does not grant a right to an abortion. It\u2019s time, and unfortunately it\u2019s necessary.\u201dAlthough the governor\u2019s speech contained a list of legislative priorities (changing the state\u2019s tax structure by raising sales tax while cutting income tax, which would make taxes in Iowa more regressive) and uplifting stories (the Osage Community School District\u2019s success in introducing students to computer programming; a large company that opened a daycare center for employees\u2019 children) such speeches always have, it contained only two calls for constitutional amendments.In addition to the anti-abortion provision, the governor repeated her intentions \u201cto amend our constitution so that it no longer bars felons from voting after they\u2019ve served their sentence.\u201d It\u2019s the second straight year the governor has called for the amendment \u2014 it was the most significant proposal in Reynolds\u2019 2019 Condition of the State address. \u201cOur founders gave us a process to amend the constitution, should the passage of time change our view,\u201d she said in her 2019 speech. \u201cLet\u2019s begin that process now. I believe Iowans recognize the power of redemption; let\u2019s put this issue in their hands.\u201d \n \n\nTo be adopted, an amendment must pass both chambers of the Iowa legislature in two consecutive sessions, then be ratified by a majority of voters in an election. Last year, the Iowa House of Representatives passed the amendment. The Senate didn\u2019t even bring it up for vote, despite the governor\u2019s repeated public statements that the amendment was a top priority. Late in the speech, the governor politely acknowledged the failure of the amendment to advance. I am grateful to the House for starting this process last year by approving the constitutional amendment with a strong bipartisan vote of 95 to two. I also appreciate the productive conversations we are having with senators, and I look forward to continuing to work with you to pass the amendment and craft an implementing statute that lets us avoid the confusion and lawsuits that have plagued other states\u2019 restoration efforts.The voting rights amendment was the only amendment Reynolds promoted in her 2019 speech. She did not mention abortion directly last year, but claimed credit for having \u201cprotected the sanctity of life.\u201d \n \n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the anti-abortion amendment will have trouble passing either Republican-controlled chamber of the Iowa legislature. In 2018, the so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat bill,\u201d which would have been the most restrictive abortion law in the United States, easily passed both chambers, despite having no support from Democrats. Gov. Reynolds signed it into law, but a state district judge issued an injunction preventing it from taking effect. The law was struck down by the same district court judge in January 2019. The judge based his ruling on a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood v. Reynolds, in which the justices ruled the state constitution affords a much stronger guarantee of the rights of women than the U.S. Constitution does. That decision lead to calls from hard-line anti-abortion groups for the sort of constitutional amendment Reynolds favors, which would basically prevent the Iowa Supreme Court from rely on its established precedents that guarantee a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion. Reynolds is currently in the process of selecting a new justice for the Iowa Supreme Court, to replace Chief Justice Mark Cady, who died in November. Last week, Acting Chief Justice David Wiggins announced he will retire in March. Reynolds will also appoint his replacement.\nWith these two appointments, Reynolds will have been responsible for naming four of the court\u2019s seven justices. During an appearance before a conservative Christian gathering in July, Reynolds boasted that \u201cthe tide is turning in Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court.\u201d She added, \u201cIn just two short years, we\u2019ve moved the needle from left to right. \n\nIf you're a fan, become a supporter\nAs an independent publication, we rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly\nAnnually\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital Supporter\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n$5.00 per month \n\n$50.00 per year \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSelect\t\t\t\n\nDigital supporters help cover hosting and development costs for littlevillagemag.com \u2013 a community resource with no paywalls. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Supporter\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEST VALUE\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n$10.00 per month \n\n$100.00 per year \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSelect\t\t\t\n\nLittle Village is available for free at over 800 Iowa locations, both urban and rural.

The problem is, it can be done. We have the ability to perform abortions therefore we have an obligation to make sure they are as safe as possible.  We do not need women dead on butcher tables or bleeding out on their way home or an preventable infection taking their lives.
