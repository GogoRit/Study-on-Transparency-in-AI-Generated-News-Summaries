Rolanda Hollis introduced a bill (HB 238) in the Alabama Legislature that \"would require a man to undergo a vasectomy within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.\"\nAs noted by The Associated Press, Hollis was \"fed up with her colleagues\u2019 attempts to outlaw abortion\" and introduced the bill to send \u201cthe message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies\u201d:\nAlabama lawmakers [in 2019] approved a ban on abortion unless the woman\u2019s life was in danger. A federal judge blocked the law from taking effect while a legal challenge plays out in court.\n\u201cYear after year the majority party continues to introduce new legislation that tries to dictate a woman\u2019s body and her reproductive rights. We should view this as the same outrageous overstep in authority,\u201d the Birmingham lawmaker wrote in a statement texted to The Associated Press.\nHollis said that doctors, and not legislators, are the ones to be consulted over surgery, medications and making the \u201cincredibly difficult decisions\u201d related to personal reproductive rights.\nAlabama was one of several states that [in 2019] attempted to enact new abortion restrictions in the hopes of getting the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\n\nSources\n\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"In Retort to Abortion Ban, Lawmaker Calls for Vasectomies.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 February 2020.\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Near-total Abortion Ban Signed Into Law in Alabama.\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 16 May 2019. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBy David Mikkelson\n\n\n\nDavid Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nSubmit a Topic\n\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\n\nHome\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nArchive\n\n\nRandom\n\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\nLatest\n\n\nTop\n\n\nFact Checks\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nAccount\n\n\nJoin\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nGame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Like Us on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n Follow Us on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1995 - 2024  by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
