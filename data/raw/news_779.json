The order was first reported by The Advocate.Louisiana abortion clinics received notice from the Louisiana Department of Health on Tuesday stating the trigger ban criminalizing most abortions went back into effect on Aug. 1. The law bans abortions even in cases of rape and incest. The only exceptions are for rare cases for medical emergencies to save a patient\u2019s life or when the fetus wouldn\u2019t survive birth.As of Monday, Louisiana\u2019s three abortion clinics had again stopped procedures. Clinics in Baton Rouge and New Orleans collectively canceled 120 abortion procedures planned for this week and began referring patients to clinics out of state, as far as Colorado.\u00a0Hope Medical Group for Women, a Shreveport abortion clinic and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said it was considering its next legal move.\u00a0\u201cWe are going to look at our options and take it further if we can,\u201d Kathaleen Pittman, the clinic administrator, said. \u201cIn the meantime we're not technically closed because we\u2019re manning phones to help these ladies get where they need to be if at all possible.\u201d\u00a0Johnson\u2019s order marks the third time Louisiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban has taken effect amid a legal battle over abortion access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case.\u00a0The judge\u2019s order was leaked to the press Monday morning before plaintiffs in the case were notified, causing confusion over when the abortion ban could actually be enforced.\u00a0The court battle over the ban is ongoing, and a final resolution could take months.This story has been updated to include additional information from the plaintiffs in this case. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanned, a new WWNO and WRKF podcast, is out now; subscribe here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNews\nLouisiana News\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRosemary Westwood\n\n\n                \n                    Rosemary Westwood is the public and reproductive health reporter for WWNO/WRKF.
