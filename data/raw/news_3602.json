(Photos by Daniel Meloy | Detroit Catholic)\n\n\n\n'Yes' on Proposal 3 has slim lead in the polls, but organizers remain optimistic three weeks out from critical election\nROYAL OAK \u2014 Michigan is three weeks away from voting on a proposed constitutional amendment that would override the state\u2019s abortion laws, making the procedure widely available and eliminating regulations.\nVolunteers across the state have been canvassing Michigan\u2019s neighborhoods and countryside, encouraging voters to vote \u201cno\u201d on Proposal 3. \nFaith leaders and legal experts have labeled Proposal 3 \u201cextreme,\u201d arguing it would take away parental consent laws for minors seeking abortion and allow for unqualified people, such as veterinarians and psychologists, to perform the procedure.\nCitizens to Support MI Women and Children, a grassroots coalition formed to oppose the measure, has been organizing canvassing efforts to get the word out to voters on the fence about the proposal. \n\u201cWe have thousands of people reaching out and getting involved in our campaign,\u201d Christen Pollo, spokeswoman for Citizens to Support MI Women and Children, told Detroit Catholic. \u201cIn every corner of the state, we are putting up yard signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls. People are engaged in our churches as well and getting involved in community groups. Our plan is to reach voters and reach every corner of our state with the reality of how dangerous Proposal 3 is before election day.\u201d\n \n\n\nPaula Dixon, left, and Peggy Stack of the National Shrine of the Little Flower Basilica in Royal Oak, canvass a neighborhood in opposition to Proposal 3. Canvassers are encouraged to visit supportmiwomenandchildren.org to sign up to canvass, give to the \"No on Proposal 3\" campaign and order yard signs.\n\nVolunteers are encouraged to visit supportmiwomenandchildren.org to learn more about the proposal, how they can donate to the \u201cNo on Proposal 3\u201d campaign and ways to connect with local volunteers to canvass.\n\u201cSomething I hear frequently is, \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be good at that (canvassing),' or \u2018I\u2019d be too scared,\u2019 but this is a moment to step out of our comfort zones and do everything we can to impact this proposal and make sure people are educated and vote no,\u201d Pollo said.\nVolunteers aren\u2019t expected to persuade voters at the door or get them to make a commitment to vote \u201cno.\u201d Canvassers are given a script of what to say, some follow-up responses and literature explaining what Proposal 3 is and why voters should reject it.\n\u201cWe train our volunteers big picture on how to have a good conversation with voters, and we have a script that goes a little more in depth on questions,\u201d said Adelaide Helwig, canvassing coordinator for Protect Life Michigan. \u201cWe ask voters where they stand on the issue and have a guided conversation centered around educating the voter on what Prop 3 will do. We found 70 percent of people we have a conversation with about Proposal 3 pledge to vote no.\u201d\nHelwig said canvassers focus on the specific language of Proposal 3, particularly how the amendment would \u201cinvalidate state laws conflicting with this amendment.\"\n \n\n\nFaith leaders and legal experts have criticized Proposal 3 for being \"too extreme,\" arguing it would overturn several already-established laws and make Michigan a state with almost no restrictions on abortion.\n\nHelwig said the broad scope of the amendment is the main reason why even voters who support some access to abortion should reject this specific proposal, especially since it would overturn existing laws most Michigan voters agree upon.\n\u201cMichiganders do not, by and large, support later-term abortions,\u201d Helwig said. \u201cEven if people who tell you they are strongly pro-choice, they think late-term abortions shouldn\u2019t happen or should be restricted. We\u2019ve also seen a lot of parents concerned about parental consent laws being revoked and children getting abortions without a parent\u2019s notice.\n\u201cEvery pro-life law or every law regulating abortion would be taken off the books,\u201d Helwig added. \u201cMost Michiganders are not in favor of that; especially allowing people who don\u2019t have a medical license to perform an abortion. This proposal essentially legalizes back-alley abortions.\u201d\nGetting out the vote\nErica Farley is a member of St. Anthony Parish in Temperance. She remembers collecting signatures for a pro-life initiative a few years back, and is committed to defeating Proposal 3.\nShe and her husband have been volunteering since Oct. 1 with Right to Life of Monroe County, going door to door and telling people about the dangers of Proposal 3.\n\u201cThe first week went pretty well; we went out three days, several hours at a time, usually grabbing subdivisions in the area and trying to get every house,\u201d Farley said. \u201cWe get fliers to every house when people are not home or not outside the house, but for people outside the house, we got pretty favorable responses. People were happy we were doing this.\u201d\nCanvassing efforts are usually one- or two-minute interactions, with the canvasser informing the voter about Proposal 3 and why they should vote \u201cno.\u201d\n \n\n\nPeggy Stack, right, speaks with a Royal Oak voter Oct. 14 about the dangers of Proposal 3. Canvassers are given a script by organizers and a list of homes to visit in an area. Canvassers aren't expected to debate voters, just let them know that Proposal 3 is on the ballot and how the radical proposal would change Michigan law.\n\nFarley said most interactions with voters have been supportive.\n\u201cI only had one person that was a little hostile to me,\u201d Farley said. \u201cShe asked if I was for or against, I said against, and she said get that thing away from me. I said OK, then she said, \u2018I\u2019m for women.\u2019 And I said, \u2018So am I, ma\u2019am.\u2019 That was the only negative one I had; most people were thanking us for being out and doing this.\u201d\nAside from a few conversations with people who identify as pro-choice but wanted to know particulars about the amendment, Farley said most canvassing is just to reminder voters the proposal is on the ballot, what the proposal would do, and why should they vote against.\nIt\u2019s not about having an argument, but about raising awareness, Farley said.\n \n\n\nJames Wilson of Royal Oak walks through his neighborhood to canvass against Proposal 3. Polling data shows support for Proposal 3 shrinking to 52%, down from 61% in early October. Citizens to Support MI Women and Children, a grassroots coalition formed to oppose the extreme measure, remains confident in the work of canvassers and volunteers who could turn the tide before election day.\n\n\u201cA successful encounter is when someone who was on the fence wants to hear what this is about,\u201d Farley said. \u201cThere was one gentleman who had no idea they were trying to put this on the ballot. I explained Proposal 3, and he said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want that.\u2019 And that was great, that was a success for me \u2014 informing someone of what they are really trying to do and having them make a good decision when they go out to vote.\u201d\nPollo said now is the time for voters, parishes, and volunteers to increase their efforts to defeat Proposal 3.\nAn Emerson poll released Oct. 18 showed support for Proposal 3 shrinking to just 52% among 580 likely Michigan voters \u2014 a decline from 61% in a Detroit News/WDIV-TV (Channel 4) poll released Oct. 4. Citizens to Support MI Women and Children are not discouraged by the polling data and think the race is winnable, Pollo said.\n\u201cI really want people to hear me loud and clear on this: We are optimistic,\u201d Pollo said. \u201cOur message is resonating with voters. There are so many things you could dive into on polling. Most the polling we see is nothing relevant to the question facing voters this November. Sometimes, polls are used to discourage people from getting involved, from doing more. We know this is winnable, and we can defeat Proposal 3.\u201d\n \n\n\nSt. John Fisher Chapel University Parish in Auburn Hills displays a sign opposing Proposal 3 for motorists along the busy Walton Boulevard. The parish hosted a \"blitz day\" Oct. 15, where organizers and volunteers met to plan for a day of canvassing against Proposal 3.\n\nDoor knocking training\nIn person door-knocking training will be offered at three locations Saturday, Oct. 22: \n1.)
