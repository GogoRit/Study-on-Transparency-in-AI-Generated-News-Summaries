Her House Bill 4006 would repeal Michigan's 1931 abortion ban.Joel Bissell | MLive.comBy Ben Orner | borner@mlive.comLANSING, MI \u2013 In their first days with control of the Michigan Legislature, Democrats targeted a major campaign promise: repealing the state\u2019s abortion ban.The 1931 law that prohibits abortion except to save the mother\u2019s life would be deleted from Michigan\u2019s penal code under House Bill 4006, a one-sentence piece of legislation introduced Thursday.The ban is already overruled by an abortion-rights constitutional amendment passed in November but is still on the books. The law made it a felony to administer an abortion before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade made it a constitutional right nationwide.After the court overturned Roe last summer, Michigan\u2019s ban would have gone into effect if it survived court challenges. But voters overwhelmingly passed Proposal 3 last fall, putting a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to abortion and other reproductive health actions into the state constitution.Go deeper: Props 1, 2 and 3 are in Michigan\u2019s constitution. What happens now?\u201cAffirming a person\u2019s right to abortion and reproductive freedom was Democrats\u2019 priority throughout the previous year and remains our priority today,\u201d lead sponsor and House Speaker Pro Tempore Laurie Pohutsky, D-Livonia, said in a statement.\u201cThe government does not belong in the exam room as people make private medical decisions. We must repeal old laws that no longer reflect the will of Michigan voters.\u201dHer repeal bill has 46 cosponsors, all Democrats.Along with the abortion ban repeal, Senate Bill 2 \u2013 introduced Thursday by state Sen. Erika Geiss, D-Taylor \u2013 would repeal a 1931 ban on contraception and abortion pills. It also has only Democratic cosponsors.HB 4006 is assigned to the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by state Rep. Kelly Breen, D-Novi. SB 2 is assigned to the Senate Health Policy Committee, chaired by state Sen. Kevin Hertel, D-St. Clair Shores.More on Dems\u2019 first moves in the majority:Stage set for tax cut fight as Michigan Democrats, Republicans unveil dueling plansCementing LGBTQ protections is a first order of business for Michigan DemocratsDemocrats say 700,000 Michigan households could save thousands under tax cut planScenes from the first day of session with Democrats in control of Michigan House and SenateIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
