But the United States was hardly the first country to codify women\u2019s suffrage, and barriers to vote persisted for some groups of U.S. women for decades. At least 20 nations preceded the U.S., according to a Pew Research Center analysis of women\u2019s enfranchisement measures in 198 countries and self-administering territories. Today, none of these 198 countries and territories bar women from voting because of their sex; some countries do not hold national elections.\nHere is a closer look at the history of women\u2019s suffrage around the world. This analysis focuses on when women in each country won the right to vote in national elections, not regional or local elections.\n\nHow we did this\nA century after U.S. women gained the right to vote, we conducted this analysis to find out when women in other countries were first enfranchised at the national level. The analysis is based on information about 198 countries and self-administering territories from government publications, historical documents from organizations like the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and news reports. For each country or territory, the year in which women received the right is based on the date this right was codified in a law or constitution or officially granted as part of a United Nations plebiscite. The analysis looks only at when women gained the right to vote in national elections, not in regional or local elections. In some cases, data about when these measures were passed is incomplete, contradicted in other publications or difficult to find, so this analysis is as complete and accurate as possible within our research limitations.\nSaudi Arabia and Brunei do not hold national elections, and Hong Kong and Macau do not participate in China\u2019s elections. In all four of these jurisdictions, women are able to vote in local elections.\nThe 198 countries and self-administering territories covered by this analysis are home to more than 99.5% of the world\u2019s population. They include 192 of the 193 member states of the United Nations (data for North Korea is not included), plus six self-administering territories: Kosovo, Hong Kong, Macau, the Palestinian territories, Taiwan and Western Sahara. Reporting on these territories does not imply any position on what their international political status should be, only recognition that the de facto situations in these territories require separate analysis.\n\n\nNew Zealand enfranchised its female citizens in 1893, making it the first nation or territory to formally allow women to vote in national elections. At least 19 other countries also did so prior to the U.S. passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, according to our analysis. These countries are spread across Europe and Asia, and about half first gave women this right while under Russian or Soviet control or shortly after independence from Russia. Russia itself extended the vote to women after demonstrations in 1917.\nIn at least eight additional countries, some women \u2013 but not all \u2013 gained equal voting rights in or before 1920.\nMore than half of the countries and territories we analyzed (129 out of 198) granted women the right to vote between 1893 and 1960. This includes all but six European nations. Some of the European nations that allowed universal suffrage after 1960 include Switzerland (1971), Portugal (1976) and Liechtenstein (1984). \u00a0\nIn other world regions, women secured the right to vote in national elections only after major cultural or governmental shifts. For example, 80% of the countries in Africa we analyzed granted citizens universal suffrage between 1950 and 1975 \u2013 a period of sweeping European decolonization for the continent (as well for parts of Asia and Latin America). Many newly independent nations adopted universal suffrage along with new governments and constitutions.\n\nBhutan, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are the most recent countries or territories to allow women to participate in national elections, although the picture is complicated. Bhutan and the UAE only established national elections recently. Bhutan shifted from a monarchy to a parliamentary democracy in 2007. The UAE allowed a small number of male and female citizens to vote in the country\u2019s first national elections in 2006. In Kuwait, the country\u2019s Parliament amended an election law in 2005; the change guaranteed women the right to vote and run for office.\nIn Saudi Arabia, women were enfranchised in local elections in 2015; the country does not hold national elections. South Sudan was established in 2011. It is not included among the most recent countries to give women the right to vote because women had this right starting in 1964, when the area was part of Sudan.\nAt least 19 nations \u2013 including the U.S. \u2013 initially restricted the right to vote for women of certain backgrounds based on demographic factors such as race, age, education level or marital status. Sometimes, decades passed before all citizens were enfranchised. In the U.S., for example, more than four decades passed between the ratification of the 19th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which took aim at discriminatory state and local restrictions intended to prevent Black Americans from voting.\nRestrictions like these weren\u2019t unique to the U.S. In Canada, for example, legislation in 1918 expanded suffrage to women, but it excluded Canadians from Asian Canadian and Indigenous backgrounds. Asian Canadians were not fully enfranchised until the 1940s, and Indigenous people could not vote until 1960.\nIn Australia, Indigenous women were not enfranchised until 1962, six decades after non-Indigenous women were able to vote. In South Africa, more than 60 years passed between when White women won voting rights in 1930 and when Black women won them in 1993, following the end of apartheid.\nWhen India first expanded voting rights to women in 1935, only those who were married to a male voter, or possessed specific literacy qualifications, could vote. Universal suffrage followed in 1950.\nSome countries also initially set a higher minimum age for women voters than for their male counterparts. In 1915, for example, Icelandic women over age 40 gained the right to vote. Five years later, the voting age for women was lowered to 25, in line with the requirement for men.\nLegal and cultural restrictions limited women\u2019s voter participation in some countries and territories even after enfranchisement. Ecuador, for instance, became the first Latin American country to grant women voting rights in 1929, but it only extended the franchise to literate Ecuadorian women, and voting was not mandatory for women as it was for men. A new constitution in 1967 made voting mandatory for literate women, and it wasn\u2019t until 1979 that the literacy requirement was dropped completely. Several other countries, such as Hungary and Guatemala, also imposed literacy requirements on women voters that were lifted later.\nMore recently, Samoa\u2019s government system allowed only those with chiefly titles, known as matai, to vote in parliamentary elections, effectively excluding women from the vote. The island nation adopted universal suffrage in 1990.\nIn some places, women were able to vote in local elections before they were enfranchised at the national level \u2013 or vice versa. In Switzerland, for example, women secured the right to vote in national elections in 1971 but had been able to vote locally in some cantons, or states, since 1959. But in another canton, Appenzell Innerrhoden, women were only given the right to vote in local elections after a 1990 federal court ruling.\nFew countries and territories have rescinded women\u2019s voting rights after initially granting them, but there are some notable exceptions. Afghanistan, for instance, was an early adopter of women\u2019s suffrage after winning independence from Britain in 1919. Government shifts and instability over the next almost 100 years resulted in women losing and formally regaining the right to participate in elections several times. Women have the right to vote in Afghanistan today, but there are still barriers in place that limit their participation.\nIn many countries, including the U.S., women often turn out to vote at higher rates than men.\u00a0American women have turned out to vote at slightly higher rates than men in every U.S. presidential election since 1984, according to a Pew Research Center analysis in August. The same pattern appears in other countries, too. A 2016 study of voting patterns in 58 countries by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found that women\u2019s voter turnout was higher than men\u2019s in 21 countries.\n\n\n\nTopics\nWorld ElectionsGender & PoliticsDiscrimination & PrejudiceWorld ElectionsGender & PoliticsGender Equality & Discrimination \n\n\nShare this link:       \n\n \n\n\nKatherine Schaeffer\u00a0 is a research analyst at Pew Research Center. \n\nPOSTS BIO EMAIL\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletterFresh data delivered Saturday mornings\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nshort reads | Mar 18, 2024Many in East Asia say men and women make equally good leaders, despite few female heads of government\n\n\nreport | Sep 27, 2023Women and Political Leadership Ahead of the 2024 Election\n\n\nfact sheet | Sep 27, 2023The Data on Women Leaders\n\n\nreport | Jul 12, 2023Republican Gains in 2022 Midterms Driven Mostly by Turnout Advantage\n\n\nfeature | Mar 28, 2023Fewer than a third of UN member states have ever had a woman leader\n\n\n\nTopics\nDiscrimination & PrejudiceGender Equality & DiscriminationGender & PoliticsGender & PoliticsWorld ElectionsWorld Elections\n\n\n\nMOST POPULAR\n18 in 10 Americans Say Religion Is Losing Influence in Public Life\n2More Americans are getting news on TikTok, bucking the trend seen on most other social media sites\n3What we know about unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S.\n4How Teens and Parents Approach Screen Time\n510 facts about the death penalty in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800Washington, DC 20036USA\n (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main\n (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax\n (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Topics\n\n\n\nPolitics & PolicyInternational AffairsImmigration & MigrationRace & EthnicityReligionAge & GenerationsGender & LGBTQFamily & RelationshipsEconomy & WorkScienceInternet & TechnologyNews Habits & MediaMethodological ResearchFull topic list \n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n Email Newsletters\n Instagram\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n YouTube\n RSS\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.
