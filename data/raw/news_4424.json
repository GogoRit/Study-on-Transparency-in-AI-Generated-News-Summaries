The women, peace and security agenda is anchored in human rights and this resolution could have turned back the clock on 20 years of progress.\u201cWomen in conflict-affected countries are suffering catastrophic impacts due to Covid-19. Any attack on this critical tool for advancing women\u2019s health and rights is dangerous and we\u2019re glad to see a diverse group of nations stand up for the agenda and its bold commitments to gender equality.\u201dThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the security council\u2019s resolution 1325, the first to recognise women\u2019s unique and disproportionate experience of conflict and demand their equal role in peace negotiations, operations and reconstruction. Since then nine more resolutions have been adopted.But there are huge gaps in implementation. The recent rollback on women\u2019s rights globally has made further progress difficult.Last year a resolution introduced by Germany to combat wartime rape was only passed when references in the text to sexual and reproductive health and rights were removed to suit the US.In a special session of the security council on Thursday, both the UK and Germany indicated they would not vote for Russia\u2019s resolution, introduced while it held the presidency.Both countries said they would not allow a retreat on women\u2019s rights.China, South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia joined Russia to vote for the resolution.Explore more on these topicsPeace and reconciliationWomen's rights and gender equalityRussiaUnited NationsEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUNRWA suspends aid to northern Gaza amid \u2018collapse of civil order\u201924 Feb 2024Brazil puts reform of UN at heart of its G20 presidency22 Feb 2024UN\u00a0chief urges donors to reconsider UNRWA funding withdrawal28 Jan 2024UN\u00a0secretary general says Israel\u2019s rejection of two-state solution is \u2018unacceptable\u201923 Jan 2024World faces \u2018heightened risk\u2019 of mass atrocities due to global inaction8 Dec 2023Washington faces UN showdown over fresh resolution for Gaza ceasefire7 Dec 2023UN\u00a0chief \u2018shocked\u2019 by \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 of comments in row with Israel26 Oct 2023UN\u00a0report: 80% of Gaza inhabitants relied on international aid before war25 Oct 2023Campaigners aim to lower support for China on UN human rights council8 Oct 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
