(CNS photo/courtesy FX Networks) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe anti-choice movement will have a field-day with this and exploit it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d These are words of Kate Michelman, former head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, spoken on the August 10, 1995 airing of ABC News Nightline. Michelman was lamenting the negative impact of the conversion of Norma McCorvey\u2014\u201cJane Roe\u201d of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision\u2014to the pro-life movement. Led into the movement by Evangelical preacher Flip Benham and fresh from the baptismal waters, Norma was now \u201con the other side\u201d and a traitor to the pro-choice cause.\nTwenty-five years later, Michelman\u2019s words are echoing in the mouths of nearly every pro-lifer: \u201cThe pro-choice movement will have a field-day with this and exploit it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d I am referring to fall-out of the movie AKA Jane Roe, which premiered on the FX network May 22. The movie, produced and directed by Australian film-maker Nick Sweeny\u2014whose credits include The Sex Robots are Coming and Transgender Kids Camp\u2014dropped like a bomb in the abortion wars. Despite disavowing her role in legalized abortion, and despite her attempts to actually reverse Roe v. Wade, the McCorvey of AKA Jane Roe is depicted as having faked her pro-life position. With help from ex-pro-lifer Robert Schenck, McCorvey accuses the pro-life movement of shamefully using and exploiting her as their \u201ctrophy.\u201d McCorvey says she only mouthed the pro-life line because she was paid by pro-lifers to do so.\nPrior to May 22, segments of the film were previewed to journalists, resulting in a barrage of sensational headlines, such as this one from the Daily Beast: \u201cJane Roe\u2019s Deathbed Confession: Anti-Abortion Conversion \u2018All an Act\u2019 Paid for by the Christian Right.\u201d The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and every secular media outlet in between has castigated the pro-life movement and declared that McCorvey was not genuinely against abortion after all. As Norma died in 2017, just months after her interviews with Sweeny, she is unable to confirm or refute the message of the film and the way her words are used in it.\nWith copious photos and videos, AKA Jane Roe deserves praise for an engaging and detailed story of Norma\u2019s difficult and stormy life. From literally the moment of conception her life was off to a rocky start, as Norma narrates over childhood photos: \u201cMy mother didn\u2019t want a second child. Me!\u201d Her upbringing was hellish, with an abusive, alcoholic mother and a father who abandoned the family. From the start she felt worthless and unwanted. Already at the tender age of 10, McCorvey experienced same-sex attraction and even ran away with a childhood friend with whom she had her first lesbian experiences. She married at the age of 16 and divorced by 17, but not before giving birth to a daughter she named Melissa. At various stages of her life she would be a drug addict, a drug dealer, and an alcoholic.\nNorma went on to have two other children out-of-wedlock. The second child was conceived in 1969, when Norma was 21. It was this pregnancy that led her to challenge the Texas law that banned abortion, resulting in the Roe v. Wade  decision. Norma sought to abort the baby at an illegal \u201cclinic\u201d she described as \u201cfilthy and cockroach infested.\u201d Too scared to go through with the abortion, she sought advice at a local adoption agency. Someone there put Norma in touch with two attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffey, who were looking for a plaintiff around whom they could build a case to advance a woman\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to abortion. In 1970, claiming that she had been raped, Norma signed the legal papers that set in motion litigation that would eventually end in the 1973 Supreme Court Justices\u2019 7-to-2 decision. Ironically, having placed the \u201cRoe\u201d baby up for adoption, Norma McCorvey never had an abortion. Years later, in answer to a reporter\u2019s question, Norma revealed that her story about being raped was a lie.\nA major emphasis of AKA Jane Roe is Norma\u2019s deep resentment toward leaders in the pro-abortion movement who, while all too willing to exploit her, found her an embarrassment. August 10, 1995, fresh from her conversion to Christianity and the pro-life movement, Norma lamented on Nightline that pro-abortion leaders, \u201cNever gave me the respect I thought I deserved.\u201d\nHer experience of being exploited and rejected is key to understanding Norma McCorvey, key to her deep need to be welcomed, and key to this film\u2019s accusation that pro-lifers exploited their \u201cbig fish,\u201d as Norma describes herself.\n\n\n\nSeveral years after the Roe v. Wade decision, Norma worked as a receptionist at a Dallas abortion center called A Choice for Women. This is where her conversion story begins. The movie introduces the Evangelical preacher Flip Benham, a member of Operation Rescue who regularly participated in protests at Norma\u2019s clinic. Flip is the film\u2019s only pro-life voice. With a flamboyant personality, exuding spiritual confidence, frequently carrying his Bible, his speech laced with a Texas drawl, Flip fulfills the pro-abortion movement\u2019s idea of a typical anti-abortion activist. It was easy for Sweeny to capitalize on this stereotype; footage is shown of Flip, with the converted Norma at his side, burning a rainbow flag, a copy of Roe v. Wade, and the Koran.\nFlip, after opening up an Operation Rescue office directly next-door to A Choice for Women, befriended Norma. Because he reached out to her, Norma reexamined her position on abortion, resigned her job at the clinic, and in 1995 was baptized in a backyard swimming pool by Benham himself. The pro-abortionists were stunned and demoralized by Norma\u2019s betrayal. For the next 25 years she publicly repudiated her role in Roe v. Wade, and lent her efforts to a lawsuit seeking to reverse the Court\u2019s decision.\nSo begins the last 20 minutes of the film. Primping before the camera and taking several deep breaths as if getting ready for the big moment, Norma announces: \u201cThis is my death-bed confession.\u201d\nSweeny initiates the dialogue by asking: \u201cDid they use you as a trophy?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, I was the big fish,\u201d Norma replies.\nSweeny asks: \u201cWould you say that you used them?\u201d to which Norma responds: \u201cWell, I think it was a mutual thing. I took their money, they put me in front of the cameras and tell me what to say and that\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201d\nSweeny asks for an example, at which point Norma launches into a short, canned, pro-life speech lamenting her part in Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nAgain, Sweeny prompts Norma with a statement: \u201cIt was all an act.\u201d Norma does not make this statement\u2014it is from the mouth of the film\u2019s director.\nNorma responds: \u201cYeah. I did it well too. I\u2019m a good actress. Course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d\nAt first hearing, it seems Norma is affirming that her pro-life commitment was nothing more than an act. However, the context of this dialogue is not about her pro-life commitment, but about how she was prepped for speeches at pro-life events at which she appeared. The uneducated, unpredictable Norma was primed for her appearances; Schenck states that Norma was coached for fear that, at the time of her conversion, she was not 100 percent pro-life. Indeed, in the Nightline interview following her baptism, Norma expressed support for abortion in the first trimester. But this was very early in her spiritual and pro-life journey. In 1997 she appeared on Father Frank Pavone\u2019s EWTN Defending Life program. Pavone brings up her early support for abortion in the first three months and asks if she now believes that some abortions are OK. To this Norma responds, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d and explains how she came to support the right-to-life of every unborn child, declaring: \u201cAbortion is not right at any time.\u201d\nSweeny then tries to support the contention that Norma was paid for her anti-abortion advocacy by panning over a series of 990 documents for Roe No More\u2014a group with which Norma was associated\u2014to give the impression that indeed she was paid a whopping sum of $456,911.00. But when one looks carefully at the shot, the sum on the form is seen to be income to the group over a period of years, and it is by no means clear that the money was paid to Norma herself. Indeed, she is only one of three directors indicated on the documents. The attempt to prove pro-lifers paid Norma exorbitantly comes off as contrived.\nIndeed, if pro-lifers may be accused of paying Norma to \u201cact,\u201d the AKA Jane Roe filmmaker may be accused of doing the same thing. In May 2016 Norma sent a text message referencing the interviews she\u2019d been doing with the Australian Sweeny to Father Pavone\u2014a text that he saved. In the text, a screenshot of which I have seen, Norma tells him that a film crew is coming to make a movie: \u201cI\u2019m interviewing with a company out of New York via Australia. I\u2019m very happy doing it. I charged of course so I\u2019ll have some bucks at the end, so happy bout that.\u201d Apparently, when the filmmaker pays Norma, she tells the truth, but when pro-lifers supposedly pay Norma, she\u2019s just faking it.\nIn the film Norma seems to make several disturbing statements in support of abortion. First, she says: \u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine. It\u2019s no skin off my ass. You know that\u2019s why they call it \u2018choice\u2019! It\u2019s your choice.\u201d The short clip hangs in the movie as if it dropped in. No dialogue precedes it\u2014it\u2019s an isolated statement, troubling of course, but without context.\nFather Pavone, a personal friend of Norma\u2019s for more than 20 years, said to me: \u201cHer comments about women having choice are very consistent with the view she often discussed with us that God gave us free choice (indeed, as Rev. Flip Benham once pointed out to Norma from Deuteronomy 30), and that women must make choices. However, she also believed that some choices were wrong, including abortion, and spoke that clearly in word and deed for decades.\u201d\n\n\n\nLater in the film, seated in a diner, Norma remarks: \u201cRoe versus Wade helps save women\u2019s lives,\u201d giving the impression she supported the Court ruling. The context of the statement is also left unidentified. At another point, Norma is shown on the night of the 2016 presidential election. She expresses support for Hilary Clinton, and exhibits disdain for Donald Trump. She states: \u201cRoe will not be tampered with. They can try, but it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Finally, she calls Evangelical preachers \u201cassholes\u201d who \u201cact like God sent them to preach the gospel.\u201d\nThese \u201clast\u201d words of Norma are at the very least baffling and gravely disconcerting. However, most disturbing of all is the role Reverend Robert Schenck plays in this movie. The ex-pro-lifer is masterfully put to use by Sweeny to corroborate that the pro-life movement exploited Norma and paid for her advocacy, and that she was not genuinely opposed to abortion. Without him, Norma\u2019s so-called \u201cdeath-bed confession\u201d could not be so easily exploited by pro-abortionists. Indeed, when all is said and done, AKA Jane Roe is really as much Schenck\u2019s movie as it is Norma\u2019s.\nSchenck, active in Operation Rescue, worked closely with Benham and other Evangelical leaders and came to know Norma soon after her conversion. But in May 2019 Schenck announced in the pages of the New York Times that he \u201cnow supports Roe v. Wade.\u201d Schenck is presented in the film as the voice of conscience and integrity. \u201cWhat we did with Norma was highly unethical,\u201d he says. \u201cThe jig is up.\u201d If pro-lifers had their trophy in Norma McCorvey, the pro-abortionists have theirs in the Reverend Schenck.\nWithout Schenck, Norma\u2019s apparent pro-abortion statements could be more easily dismissed or excused as the final, cynical outbursts of an elderly, sick woman used and abused all her life. It is Schenck who actually drives the narrative that Norma was exploited and gives Norma\u2019s statements a credibility they would otherwise not have. More than the emotionally volatile Norma, whose whole life was full of ambiguity, inner conflicts, and contradictions, it is Schenck who is responsible for providing this pro-abortion movie the gravitas it needs to discredit the pro-life movement. Schenck stated in his New York Times piece that his new-found support for Roe v. Wade is motivated by a compassion for poor women who need access to abortion. After Norma is shown stating that \u201cRoe versus Wade helps save women\u2019s lives,\u201d the movie cuts back to Schenck who says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more with Norma. Unless you can put yourself in the mind of a woman facing a pregnancy she is not ready for, you cannot pronounce what she must do.\u201d\nAlso troubling is Schenck\u2019s constant employment of the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d in his accusations that pro-lifers exploited Norma. By the use of the term \u201cwe\u201d the entire pro-life movement is unfairly discredited. Since Schenck now supports Roe v. Wade it is fair to conclude he participated in this movie to obstruct the goals of the pro-life movement. Pro-lifers have every right to call Schenck to responsibility for his part in this film.\nNorma is presented as having feigned her pro-life opposition for the money. Thus, it was absolutely incumbent on Sweeny to confront Norma with the avalanche of evidence that shows her right-to-life position, to all appearances, was sincerely held, evidence accumulated over decades. The fact that this evidence is never displayed and Norma is never asked to comment on it is the film\u2019s greatest flaw and a grave injustice to the pro-life movement. When Norma went on a Rachel\u2019s Vineyard retreat and sobbed tears of remorse, was that faked? When she wrote the poem \u201cEmpty Playgrounds\u201d and asked the aborted unborn for forgiveness, was that faked? When she converted to Catholicism in 1998, was that faked? When she spent time and energy to reverse Roe v. Wade though court litigation, was that faked? The movie leaves these questions unanswered. If Sweeny had asked such questions and Norma replied, \u201cYes, all faked,\u201d Sweeny would have taken full advantage of that response. Perhaps Sweeny did confront Norma with the evidence and didn\u2019t like the answer.\nNo matter what Norma appears to be saying in AKA Jane Roe, the evidence is there that in the years Norma fought against abortion, her opposition was genuine. Those who knew her well, and spent days in her company, have vouched that she was a true pro-lifer.\n\n\n\nOther than Flip Benham, no other pro-lifers who knew Norma well are given a voice in this film. No one was interviewed to present a reaction to Norma\u2019s statements; indeed, that Norma never repudiated her pro-life stance is affirmed by the statement her daughter Melissa released upon her mother\u2019s death. In it she thanked all those who expressed gratitude \u201cfor the example Mom gave them in standing up for life and truth. Though she was the Jane Roe of\u00a0Roe v. Wade, she worked hard for the day when that decision would be reversed.\u201d\nOn the very day Norma died, Father Pavone, together with Janet Morana, executive director of Priests for Life, called her. In the last moments of her life, her pillow draped with a rosary, Pavone and Morana say that Norma told them in a feeble voice, gasping for breath: \u201cI want you guys to promise me to never back away from undoing the decision I was a part of.\u201d\nThose are the real last words of Norma.\n\n\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

And this is what Pro-Lifers do, we propose faith, hope, and love via ceaseless encouragement, a safe place to stay, food, financial help, fellowship, support etc.; not out of self-righteous judgement; but rather, there but for the grace of God go I.\nYour article was painstakingly honest and fair to both sides. Norma\u2019s life seemed to reflect a constant bouncing from one side of the road to the other and God, I suspect, would have her land where He wanted her too in the end. \u201c In the last moments of her life, her pillow draped with a rosary, Pavone and Morana say that Norma told them in a feeble voice, gasping for breath: \u201cI want you guys to promise me to never back away from undoing the decision I was a part of.\u201d In the meantime, I will go back to proposing life at all stages.\nThank you for your great courage, clarity, and charity.\nGod Bless,\nJim Gill\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRay Neary\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 30, 2020 at 8:42 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThank you for an extremely well-written article that captured the woman whose company I was in on several occasions. \u201cMiss Norma\u201d I considered a friend. In fact, she prayed and joined my wife and me in our dining room while on her first trip ever to the Boston area. She and I drove to many of the historical sites the next day, and it elicited child-like awe from her.\nHaving taught adolescents for 3 decades as an educator, I had encountered numerous personality types.  Her troubled background was real, and she was seeking to be respected as a human worthy of it. She had been invited by us to address Right To Lifers, and she did so to over 800 of them \u2013 answering all questions. The Boston Globe refused to cover her visit. This woman, although hardly polished or eloquent was sincere and knew she had been used by Weddington and Coffee, but stressed the fact that she never had aborted any child. I met Norma again at the March For Life and stayed in e-mail contact.  She was never anything but sincere with us, and we know she is with the Lord now.  Rest in Peace, Miss Norma, and we give thanks to you for being our friend and His servant!\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMatt C.

Very disheartening, yet a hope-filled finish.\nTo go slightly off topic. I\u2019ve been a street-side grunt in the abortion wars for forty years, and this story, although sad, still pales to the every day upsetting reality of how our current Church has abandoned the unborn with our two-faced leadership giving their lip service with a rare pro-life platitude while supporting conventional globalist visions of anti-populationist reproductive polices that the whole world recognizes as de-facto indirect support of abortion. When the Catholic Church now gives support for abortion, and no one in authority speaks out forcefully against the Catholic Church giving this support, how will the \u201cglobalists\u201d in the Church be called to an accounting for the effects on the \u201cglobal social ethos\u201d and the millions more that will be slaughtered from affecting such moral entropy? What do concerned Catholics say about a pope who frequently and obviously compromises with the spirit of the world what advances these secularist values?\nI\u2019m not a historian, but I\u2019ve read a couple of hundred books in history. I do not know of a stranger moment in all of history than witnessing a former playboy President standing up for Catholic pro-life values on a global stage against a pope aligning himself with many of the world\u2019s most anti-Catholic forces. We live in Orwellian times.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMonica Migliorino Miller, Ph.

If she lived a lie, she\u2019s no better or worse than McCarrick or Clinton, and certainly no worse. She spoke to a priest while on her deathbed, according to the article. For her sake I hope she received absolution and viaticum prior to departure. I hope we all will, too.\nI feel especially sorry for those who, in fact, exploited and abused her throughout her life and caused it to take the shape it did, from her parents to the maker of that last \u201cDocumentary\u2026\u201d\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsoljerblue\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 30, 2020 at 9:52 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nWhatever the bonafides of \u201cAKA Jane Roe\u201d and its creators \u2014 suspect at best, to my mind \u2014 the film should be seen as what it really is, a desperate push-back against a growing trend of revulsion at the monstrous crime of abortion-on-demand.  The very idea that a crime of this magnitude is called \u201cpro-choice\u201d makes my gorge rise each time I hear it.  Where is the \u201cchoice\u201d for the most defenseless among us \u2014 the unborn child murdered in the womb because the society-at-large finds he or she an inconvenience? \u201cPro-choice\u201d is a theory built on a lie that spawned a multi-billion dollar slay-for-pay cartel. No half-assed \u201cdocumentary\u201d taking advantage of a conflicted, dying woman can change that truth.
