And in California, voters were on track to overwhelmingly pass a measure to enshrine into the state\u2019s constitution the right to an abortion and contraception.\u201cVermont voters made history tonight,\u201d said the Vermont for Reproductive Liberty Ballot Committee, which campaigned for the amendment, according to local news. All votes had not yet been counted at 11pm ET, but the yes campaign was leading by 77% to 22%.\u201cVermonters support reproductive freedom in all four corners of the state \u2026 and they believe that our reproductive decisions are ours to make without interference from politicians,\u201d the committee said in a statement.In Vermont, the outcome was always expected, in a New England state so pro-choice that even the Republican governor backed Proposal 5. The proposal, brought by pro-choice advocates, means the constitution now determines that an \u201cindividual\u2019s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one\u2019s own life course\u201d.California\u2019s Proposition 1, meanwhile, was positioned as a direct response to the US supreme court\u2019s decision that overturned decades of established access and thrust the country into turmoil. Voters\u2019 decisive support for Prop 1 will further enhance the state\u2019s reputation as a haven for reproductive care just as restrictions \u2013 and political divisions \u2013 deepen across the country.The state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom \u2013 who won re-election on Tuesday with a large majority \u2013 joined in the celebrations at a Prop 1 rally.Gavin Newsom speaking now at Proposition 1 rally, which is poised to pass by a huge margin to enshrine right to abortion in California constitution: \u201cWe affirmed we are a true freedom state.\u201d\u2014 Ashley Zavala (@ZavalaA) November 9, 2022\n\u201cGovernor Newsom made it clear that he wants California to be visible as a haven for people seeking reproductive healthcare and Proposition 1 is part of that,\u201d said the constitutional law professor Cary Franklin, who also serves as faculty director of the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles. \u201cIt will get media attention and people will be made more aware that California is a place they can go.\u201dThe measure had been expected to easily pass, and analysts said support for reproductive rights could draw even more women and young people to the polls, which could play positively for Democrats in California\u2019s conservative pockets.These wins deliver more blows for Republicans who are increasingly finding that, when put to a vote, Americans frequently do not agree with a sweeping agenda to dismantle abortion rights.So far, the anti-abortion movement has relied on judges, state houses and Republican lawmakers to curtail reproductive rights.But since the supreme court dismantled the constitutional right to abortion on 24 June, pro-choice advocates are increasingly looking to ballot initiatives as a way of shoring up rights. The anti-abortion movement suffered a huge blow over the summer when Kansas \u2013 a usually reliably red state \u2013 slammed down a proposal brought by the Republicans, looking to confirm there was no right to abortion in the state constitution.View image in fullscreenSupporters in Michigan listen to early voting results indicating the passage of Proposal 3, a midterm ballot measure that enshrines abortion rights, in Detroit. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersIn Michigan the mood was already jubilant at the yes campaign\u2019s watch party before they called the result, with voters screaming loudly, banging on tables and whooping in support of local voters, doctors and speakers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood.\u201cMy name is Nicholas, and I live in Ingham county,\u201d one campaigner took to the stage to say. Speaking about him and his girlfriend, he added: \u201cWe knocked on over 1,500 doors and walked over a hundred miles, talking to neighbors who \u2013 like the rest of us here \u2013 agree this is a fundamental right,\u201d to screams and cheers.Nicole Wells Stallworth, executive director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan later added: \u201cWe are living in a time like no other. The US supreme court did something they have never done: They reversed Roe. They tried it. And as such, we needed a campaign like none other. This campaign turned out to be just that.\u201d1:50Inflation, jobs and abortion: why US citizens are voting in the midterms \u2013 videoThe biggest surprise was in Kentucky, where voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion. That referendum was brought by a Republican-dominated legislature expecting a win, who earlier this year imposed a near-total ban on abortions.The key sponsor of the abortion ban and the ballot proposal, former congressman Joe Fischer, was running for a judicial seat on Kentucky\u2019s supreme court this election \u2013 which he has not won.For the meantime, Kentucky\u2019s abortion ban will remain in place. But Fischer\u2019s loss is more good news for pro-choice campaigners: as the ban is being challenged in the state supreme court on 15 November. And although judges are generally not supposed to be swayed by public opinion, the victory will certainly, in theory, make it harder for the sweeping ban to stand up in court.Madeline Dyer, a former counselor for abortion patients at one of the two remaining clinics in Kentucky, EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center, which has had its doors shuttered since 24 June, said it was a relief to finally have the result over with.\u201cIt\u2019s a little surreal, I\u2019ve been so consumed by worrying about this amendment for months,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m elated Kentuckians used their voice and showed politicians that they don\u2019t want a ban on abortion. We\u2019re showing we care for each other. It\u2019s such a heart-warming reassurance \u2013 because when it really comes down to it, it\u2019s just not popular, to have an outright ban on abortion,\u201d she said.Rachel Sweet of Protect Kentucky Access said the outcome was a \u201chistoric win\u201d against \u201cgovernment overreach\u201d into the personal medical decisions of Kentuckians.Explore more on these topicsAbortionUS midterm elections 2022US politicsVermontRoe v WadeCalifornianewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyNew\u00a0York congressman-elect admits lying about college and work history27 Dec 2022Kyrsten Sinema goes independent days after Democrats secure Senate majority9 Dec 2022Republicans scrape back control of US House17 Nov 2022\u2018It\u2019s powerful\u2019: how John Fetterman\u2019s hoodie won the popular vote in Pennsylvania11 Nov 2022The\u00a0winner of the midterms is not yet clear \u2013 but the loser is Donald Trump9 Nov 2022Democrats beating expectations as John Fetterman wins crucial US Senate race \u2013 as it happened9 Nov 2022US\u00a0midterm elections results 2022: live15 Nov 2022Future of Congress hangs in balance as many races still too close to call9 Nov 2022The\u00a0future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections8 Nov 2022\u2026\u2026 commentsMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
