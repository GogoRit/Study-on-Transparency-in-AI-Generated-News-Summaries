This disaster drives us to reflect on the values and meaning of life and treasure them more.\u201d\nThe encyclical,\u00a0The Gospel of Life,\u00a0is \u201cmeant to be a precise and vigorous reaffirmation of the value of human life and its inviolability, and at the same time, a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God: respect, protect, love and serve life, every human life!\u201d said Cardinal Tong, citing\u00a0Evangelium Vitae.\nCardinal Tong also explained that the fourth Pro-Life Day was postponed to 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of our Lady, because its original day - the feast of the Visitation - fell on 31 May 2020, which was also Pentecost Sunday.\nCovid-19 and the culture of death\nCardinal Tong noted that, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some countries adopted some policies and attitudes that treated the pandemic lightly \u2013 like the common flu or by handling it with the approach of \u201cherd immunity.\u201d These attitudes, he said, \u201cdevalued our vulnerable brothers and sisters,\u201d caused us to \u201cneglect our responsibility to care for our brothers and sisters properly,\u201d and intensified the impact of \u201cthe culture of death.\u201d\nContrasting this with the encyclical\u00a0Evangelium Vitae,\u00a0Cardinal Tong said that St. John Paul II invited us to contemplate the meaning of life, its greatness and fantasy, respecting that everyone has a right to life. This reflection should, in turn, lead us to \u201cdo good\u2026love and care for others,\u201d as the value of a person is not determined by any categories but \u201csimply because he/she is a person irrespective of any disability or incapability.\u201d\nHe hailed the sacrifice of many priests who, in spite of infection rates, continued to visit coronavirus patients often at the risk of getting infected themselves. They live our Jesus\u2019s words, he said, \u201cno one has greater love than this, to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends\u201d (John 15: 13).\nPromoting a\u00a0new culture of life\nTo foster a new culture of life, the Cardinal stressed on the importance of obeying God\u2019s commandment: \u201cThou shall not kill.\u201d Obedience to this commandment, he further explained, includes not being angry with our brother, preaching the Gospel of life and supporting \u201call the programmes, organizations and teachings that promote the values of life and serve the gospel of life.\u201d\nIn this regard, human life is to be respected and treated as \u201ca gift from God, sacred and inviolable\u201d from conception to the time of natural death. Consequently, abortion and euthanasia are \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d as the value of life is based on giving and accepting love with the understanding that \u201cthe conjugal acts of married couples are oriented to the procreation of life.\u201d\nImportant also is \u201cthe formation of conscience,\u201d noted the Cardinal, especially as \u201cour societies and mass media today are deeply influenced by \u2018the culture of death.\u2019\u201d He pointed out more education needs to be done to nourish a \u201ccorrect conscience\u201d in the face of a culture that causes \u201cconfusion between good and evil, precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life.\u201d\nThe role of family\nCardinal Tong highlighted the important role of family as a \u201csanctuary of life\u201d and the place \u201cwhere the couple welcomes a new life \u2013 the gift of God.\u201d\nThe family is also a \u201cplace for daily individual and family prayers, to live out the gospel of life and for the special care of the elderly and the sick.\u201d In these capacities, he noted, the family has an \u201cindispensable role in fostering the culture of life.\u201d\nScience, technology in service of human life\nCardinal Tong said that science and technology can be used in the \u201cservice of human life and its integrity,\u201d insisting that advancements in biotechnology need to be understood in order to be used \u201cfor the promotion and protection of life.\u201d\u00a0\nIn this regard, he acknowledged the role of the Bioethics Resource Center of the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Theology and Philosophy, the Diocesan Pastoral Commission for Marriage and Family, and Catholic schools which identify \u201clife\u201d as one of their core educational values. He also recommended the Creighton Model Fertility Care System for couples who are having difficulties in achieving pregnancies and natural family planning services for couples preparing to have children.\nPointing out that contemporary society is torn between a \u201cculture of life\u201d and a \u201cculture of death\u201d, Cardinal Tong called for critical thinking that is \u201ccapable of discerning true values and authentic needs\u201d to build a culture of life.\nIn conclusion, he urged everyone to \u201clove and respect every human life, walk forward patiently and courageously, to foster \u2018the culture of life\u2019 which is the fruit of truth and love.\u201d\n\nThank you for reading our article.
