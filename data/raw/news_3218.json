Jackson Women\u2019s Health\u00a0Organization that \u201cthe Constitution does not confer a right to abortion\u201d returned \u201cthe authority to regulate abortion \u2026 to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d\nThat effort will be more complicated than when the court took that authority away 49 years ago in 1973.\nAccording to the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, the three-decade trend of declining abortions in the United States is over, primarily because a majority of abortions are by chemicals, rather than surgery.\nKilling a child in the womb no longer requires traveling to an abortion clinic, but can be accomplished without even leaving home with a two-drug combination approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000.\nAfter\u00a0the Dobbs decision, President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0vowed to keep this new trend going by protecting access to chemical abortion pills approved by the FDA.\nAbortion advocates, of course, prefer the misleading term \u201cmedication abortion.\u201d The\u00a0Cambridge Dictionary, however, defines \u201cmedication\u201d as \u201cmedicine \u2026 used to improve a particular condition or illness.\u201d The \u201ccondition\u201d in pregnancy is simply the existence of a living human being. Abortion destroys, rather than improves, that condition. When, as every drug commercial states, \u201cused as directed,\u201d abortion chemicals will kill and then expel an unborn child from the womb.\nSuch poisons are no more \u201cmedication\u201d than the chemicals used in lethal injections in capital punishment.\nDr. Bernard Nathanson, founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League and later a pro-life advocate, once said that fewer women would have abortions if wombs had windows. So, here\u2019s a peek into what happens during a chemical abortion.\nThe first pill, mifepristone, blocks progesterone, a natural hormone necessary for pregnancy. The lack of progesterone cuts off oxygen and nutrients, starving the child to death. Mifepristone results in the death of the child in 75% of pregnancies when it\u2019s used.\nMifepristone is approved by the FDA for use up to week 10 of pregnancy. At that stage, a child\u2019s heartbeat is detectable and his or her brain and lungs are forming. The child already has a clearly identifiable human shape.\nIf the first chemical does not kill the child, the second (misoprostol) will, stimulating uterine contractions and expelling the dead child.\nAbortion chemicals, however, do not simply kill a child in the womb. Women die, and hundreds experience serious adverse drug experiences, every year. For that reason, the FDA instituted in 2007 a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which involves more restrictions than otherwise required for FDA-approved drugs.\nThis is the point where the politics of\u00a0abortion\u00a0make casualties of children and women. Abortion advocates once emphasized the relationship between a woman and her doctor. In Roe, the Supreme Court said that \u201cthe attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient\u2019s pregnancy should be terminated.\u201d\nThe shift from surgical to chemical abortion, however, will steadily remove doctors from the picture and leave women isolated.\nLast December, for example, the FDA removed a critical Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy \u00a0requirement\u00a0that mifepristone had to be dispensed by a health care provider in person. The chemical may now be prescribed through telehealth appointments and shipped by mail without any face-to-face interaction between a woman and her doctor.\nIn response, 19 states have prohibited chemical abortion through telehealth, and some have introduced legislation that would ban the practice entirely. The power of states in this new area, however, is unclear. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said that states \u201cmay not ban mifepristone based on disagreement with the FDA\u2019s expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.\u201d\nThere will no doubt be litigation, however, over the broader effect of the FDA\u2019s conclusion about safety and efficacy.\nIn Mississippi, for example, a manufacturer of generic mifepristone, GenBioPro, has already sued the state based on the claim that FDA regulations take precedence over the state\u2019s ban on telehealth dispensing of the drug.\nWhile issues like these complicate states\u2019 effort to combat abortion drugs, Congress can and should step in. Congress creates executive branch agencies and gives them authority to implement federal legislation.\nAbortion drugs not only kill babies in the womb, and can harm their mothers, but are isolating women and undermining the necessary relationship between patients and doctors.\nIn the 118th\u00a0Congress, pro-life legislators must tackle this problem and limit the damage.\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
