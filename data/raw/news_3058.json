Newsroom, Dec 19, 2022 / 01:00 am\nA pro-life novena invites the faithful to ask for the intercession of the Holy Innocents \u2014 the baby boys who are, today, recognized as the first martyrs and as pro-life patron saints.\nWhile they did not know Jesus, they died in his place.\nThe novena \u2014 a prayer repeated for nine consecutive days \u2014 can be said at any time of the year. But Catholics are encouraged to begin the prayer on Dec. 19 in order to finish it by the feast day of these little saints, Dec. 28.\nNovena to the Holy Innocents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Father,\n\u201cBy their wordless profession of faith in your Son, the Holy Innocents were crowned with life at His birth.\u201d Knowing how precious they are to you and how similar they are to the millions of innocent lives lost through abortion, we call on them to join in our prayer:\n1. That all our elected leaders, legislators, and judges may come to acknowledge the humanity of every child in the womb and enact laws and policies to defend them, we pray: Lord, hear our prayer.\n2. That everyone throughout the world may be given the light to see beyond all doubt the uniqueness and full humanity of every child who has ever been conceived, we pray: Lord, hear our prayer.\nFor these intentions and in union with the Holy Innocents, we pray as the Lord Jesus taught us: \u201cOur Father, who art in heaven \u2026\u201d\nFeast of the Holy Innocents, post-Communion prayer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichele M. Taylor, the associate director for communications for the Florida Catholic Conference (FCC), told CNA that this particular novena was a joint effort of the state pro-life coordinating committee of the FCC in 2009.\nA version of the Holy Innocents novena is sometimes misattributed to Bishop Jaime Soto of Sacramento. In a comment to CNA, he spoke about its relevance today.\n\u201cLife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness should not be denied to those deemed disposable by a throwaway society,\u201d he said. \u201cI urge all of us to be the persistently joyful messengers of the gospel of life and the hopeful companions both children and their mothers need.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of the Holy Innocents appears in the Gospel of Matthew.\nAfter Jesus\u2019 birth, King Herod the Great of Judea \u2014 named \u201cking of the Jews\u201d by the Roman Senate \u2014 learned of this \u201cnewborn king of the Jews\u201d from the Magi. Troubled by the news, he deceivingly asked the Magi to report back to him Jesus\u2019 location \u201cthat I too may go and do him homage.\u201d But a dream warned the Magi not to return to Herod.\nSt. Matthew (2:16\u201318) records what happens next.\n\u201cWhen Herod realized that he had been deceived by the Magi, he became furious. He ordered the massacre of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had ascertained from the Magi,\u201d the Gospel reads. \u201cThen was fulfilled what had been through Jeremiah the prophet: \u2018A voice was heard in Ramah, sobbing and loud lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be consoled, since they were no more.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nHarrison Butker addresses family life, gun violence, Taylor Swift, and more in far-reaching interview\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nNovena, \nFeast of the Holy Innocents, \nprolife2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
