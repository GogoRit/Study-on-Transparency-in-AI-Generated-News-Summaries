This kind of acquittal by association requires the worst kind of revisionist history, and as the\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0court did in 1973, Donley and Lens construct a fake version of America\u2019s \u201cacceptance\u201d\u2014even respect\u2014for abortion, while urging the rest of us to fully abandon sound judgment and common sense. \u00a0\nThe authors argue that the line between abortion and pregnancy loss \u201chas always been blurry,\u201d and that the two experiences are \u201cmore alike than people think.\u201d They note that the drugs and procedures used in abortions can be utilized after a miscarriage. They claim the \u201cstigma and isolation,\u201d as well as the prevalence is similar for both.\nThey also cite social mores surrounding pregnancy at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption. It\u2019s an era likewise analyzed by the Supreme Court in\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0to determine that abortion was not, in fact, rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition nor was it an essential component of ordered liberty before finally doing away with Roe v. Wade.\nBut in analyzing that history, the authors reach a different conclusion, saying there was \u201clittle moral blame\u201d\u00a0placed on women who took steps to end a pregnancy.\n\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d they argue, \u201cdoing so was a respected method of spacing out pregnancies so that a mother could take care of her children.\u201d To call abortion a \u201crespected\u201d method of birth control is specious at best and engages in the kind of historical fiction Justice Harry Blackmun relied upon to justify Roe from the start. What\u2019s more, they cite for this proposition a\u00a0book\u00a0on the history of miscarriage\u2014not abortion\u2014in America.\u00a0\nThese faulty premises assume we cannot tell the difference between an intentional ending of an unborn life, and the spontaneous loss of an unborn child. They also assume we do not know we are being lied to when we are told abortion was a common and respected birth control method in early America.\nOf the jaw-dropping conclusions cribbed from their forthcoming law review article, Donley and Lens propose a suggested \u201ckey\u201d to resolving the tension between miscarriage and abortion\u2014something they claim has singularly benefitted the pro-life movement by providing a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to fetal personhood and widening the divide between miscarriage and abortion.\nThat key, they claim, is to recognize \u201csubjective, relational fetal value,\u201d which empowers abortion advocates to terminate their unwanted pregnancies and still give those who grieve a miscarriage a shoulder to cry on while their ideological commitments remain fully intact.\nThis kind of moral equivalence is despicable\u2014and denigrates those who have lost an unborn child to miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn their forthcoming law review article, the authors take their cue from the realm of\u00a0tort law, examining jury awards for wrongful death or negligence claims when a defendant\u2019s conduct causes a loss of pregnancy.\nLike calloused actuaries, Donley and Lens\u00a0argue\u00a0that the \u201csubjective and variable loss suffered in pregnancy loss is at the center of every tort claim where the plaintiff alleges that defendant\u2019s tortious conduct caused the miscarriage or stillbirth. Even though pregnancy loss researchers stress that the extent of the loss after miscarriage and stillbirth \u2018is not truly measurable,\u2019 tort law requires a jury to do so.\u201d\nThe authors use this principle in their associated\u00a0essay\u00a0to conclude that this subjectivity is fundamentally at odds with the pro-life notion of \u201cequat[ing] a fertilized egg with a breathing baby from the moment of conception for every pregnancy\u201d and if we \u201cground fetal value in the pregnant woman\u2019s attachment and commit to defending her conception of the pregnancy, we can recognize loss without threatening abortion rights.\u201d\nHow attached was the mother to the pregnancy? What did she believe about it? How great is her suffering? A fetus is a child if you want the pregnancy. It isn\u2019t if you don\u2019t.\nThey accuse the \u201canti-abortion movement [of] realiz[ing] that it could weaponize grief after pregnancy loss to suggest the callousness of abortion and to promote the concept of fetal personhood.\u201d Grief doesn\u2019t need to be weaponized. It\u2019s powerful enough.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nI miscarried on Mother\u2019s Day, 2008, one of the roughly\u00a020% of American women who do.\nAfter two reassuring ultrasounds showing a normally developing baby roughly the size of a prune with a strong and steady heartbeat, I woke up one morning bleeding and in excruciating pain. Because I didn\u2019t miscarry completely, I required a procedure called a\u00a0dilation and curettage\u2014the one and only similarity between my miscarriage and an abortion. The minute my eyes opened in the surgical recovery room, I burst into sobs. Even now, 14 years hence, I feel that loss.\nIn their law review article, Donley and Lens aver that \u201cevery person\u2019s loss will be valued differently based on their individual relationship with the potential child.\u201d They approximate miscarriage to a kind of loss that can be valued by a jury, involving some monetary calculation of the kind required for damages awards in tort cases\u2014as though this allows them a way to acknowledge the miscarriage in concrete terms\u2014without acknowledging the underlying humanity of the lost child.\nThis is sloppy legal analysis and even sloppier moral reasoning. My loss was not \u201csubjective\u201d or conceptual. Mothers are not capable of relationships with \u201cpotential\u201d children. To argue otherwise is a flight of fancy, and a pernicious one at that. My loss was objective. It had a heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t the first time liberal scholars have employed a line of creative\u2014albeit shoddy\u2014logic to support a right to kill an unborn child. Roe v. Wade proved it. But properly interpreting and applying the Constitution as the Supreme Court did in Dobbs should be non-fiction.\u00a0\nDonley and Lens have simply engaged in yet another fantastic and heretical exercise on their way to arguing for abortion on demand. Real intellectual courage requires a defense of the right to kill an unborn child on its own merits alone. Tragically, the thin veneer of law and history the authors use to camouflage abortion\u2019s horror diminishes the significance of any category of pregnancy loss, including mine.\nDonley and Lens reach a range of shockingly defective conclusions in an effort to liken abortion to miscarriage, thinking that in this way, they\u2019ve cleverly avoided the personhood question. But their essay does hold one kernel of truth:\n\nThe abortion-rights movement has at times widened the divide between abortion and pregnancy loss by minimizing focus on the fetus, to ensure that the pregnant person\u2019s interest can never be outweighed. That has allowed many in the movement to avoid the difficult question that pregnancy loss raises: What was lost?\n\nWhat, indeed. For women like me who\u2019ve lost a child to miscarriage, the answer is abundantly clear.\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
