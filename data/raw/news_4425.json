Progress on women's rights has not been as rapid as hoped following a landmark UN women's summit 25 years ago [Johannes Eisele/AFP]Published On 2 Oct 20202 Oct 2020United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday against a recent pushback on gender equality and women\u2019s rights and urged people to fight back as the United States condemned China and the world body for \u201cthe murder of millions of baby girls\u201d.\nWorld leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, took part in a virtual UN General Assembly meeting on Thursday, 25 years since a landmark World Conference on Women in Beijing, where then-US First Lady Hillary Clinton declared that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4UN reports 35 percent increase in people affected by South Sudan violencelist 2 of 4Israel asks ICJ not to order new measures over looming famine in Gazalist 3 of 4UN says acute malnutrition spreading fast among children in Gazalist 4 of 4Why are one-fifth of the world\u2019s migratory species facing extinction?end of list\nWhile Guterres did not specify who was wary of\u00a0women\u2019s rights, he said: \u201cNow is the time to push back against the pushback \u2026\u00a0Women\u2019s full human rights and freedoms are fundamental to peace and prosperity on a healthy planet.\u201d\nAt the 1995 conference, 189 countries agreed to make a priority the \u201cfull and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex\u201d.\n\u201cTwenty-five years after the Beijing Declaration, equality should be a given. But we still have a long way to go,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cGet on board. Let\u2019s work together to really target the Beijing goals. The faster, the better.\u201d\nChina\u2019s President Xi Jinping said China would donate $10 million more to UN Women, and proposed another world meeting on gender equality for 2025.\n\u201cWe need to eliminate prejudice, discrimination and violence against women and make gender equality a social norm and moral imperative observed by all,\u201d Xi said in a prerecorded video.\nEthnic Uighur women wave East Turkestan flags during a protest against China in Istanbul on October 1. The US accused China of subjecting Uighur women to abortion and sterilisation [Murad Sezer/Reuters]\n\u00a0\nBut US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos condemned the treatment of women in Venezuela, Cuba and Iran, and saved her harshest criticism for China.\n\u201cThe worst violator of all in both scope and scale is the host of the conference we commemorate today,\u201d she said in a video statement.\n\u201cSince 1995, the Chinese Communist Party has been responsible for the murder of millions of baby girls through brutal population controls on industrial scale, unfortunately with the support (of) UN agencies. We call on the UN to stop ignoring and enabling these atrocities.\u201d\nThe United Nations and China\u2019s UN mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US statement.\nDeVos specifically took aim at Beijing\u2019s operations in its far western Xinjiang region, which some rights groups and politicians in Washington have said could amount to genocide, and condemned practices of sterilisation, abortion and birth control she said had been forced on Uighur women.\n\u2018Question of power\u2019\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron expressed concern at the slow progress over the past 25 years during which long-agreed international language on women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health and rights has become a point of contention.\n\u201cIn 2020, the Beijing Declaration would have no chance of being adopted,\u201d Macron said. \u201cEverywhere, women\u2019s rights are under attack, as are human rights, from which they are inseparable.\n\u201cProgress achieved by great efforts is being undermined even in our democracies, starting with the freedom for women to control their own bodies, and in particular the right to abortion,\u201d he said, also pointing out inequalities in schooling, pay, domestic work and political representation.\nUS President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has led a push at the UN against promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights for women because it sees that as code for abortion, and has opposed such language in UN resolutions.\nTrump told world leaders at the UN General Assembly last week that his administration is advancing \u201copportunity for women\u201d and \u201cprotecting unborn children\u201d.\nEven there, women were noticeable by their absence, with only nine women among the speakers from some 190 countries.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel urged the world to do more to achieve equality for women [Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters]\nGuterres said that while progress had been made since Beijing, its ambitious vision had not been fulfilled.\n\u201cOne woman in three still experiences some form of violence in her lifetime. Every year, 12 million girls marry before the age of 18. In some parts of the world, levels of femicide \u2013 the killing of\u00a0women\u00a0\u2013 could be likened to a war zone,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWorldwide, on average,\u00a0women\u00a0have just 75 percent of the legal rights of men,\u201d Guterres said.\nFrance and Mexico committed to hosting an international forum on women\u2019s rights in Paris next June \u2013 a meeting that was scheduled for July of this year but was cancelled due to the pandemic.\nSource: News Agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
