Supreme Court Justice and gender equality hero Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Friday, Sept. 18. Her death is a painful loss for our country. She was a fierce and unapologetic warrior for equality, and her achievements are endless. As we mourn we\u2019re also embracing our gratitude for her service to our country.\n\n\nCherishing RBG\u2019s Legacy\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg committed her life to protecting the rights, freedoms, and health of people across the country \u2014 in particular women, communities of color, and others whose voices too often go unheard. She was a true trailblazer who inspired millions of girls and women to fight through sexism and discrimination to make American a better place to work, to live, and to love.\u00a0\nHer powerful words over the years, including her razor-sharp dissents, helped push our nation toward freedom and opportunity for all. Her spirit, values, and words will be deeply missed.\u00a0\nA Modern Revolutionary\nSome revolutionaries shook up a society with anger burning and guns blazing. Others studied hard, knocked down an unfair system one peg at a time, and spoke truth to power while wearing a lace collar. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\u00a0\nShe got two mottoes from her mother, Celia Bader (who marched for women\u2019s suffrage):\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBe independent,\u201d take care of yourself without being financially beholden to a man, and\n\n\n\u201cBe a lady,\u201d don't allow emotions like anger to be so consuming they get in your way.\n\n\nWhen Ruth Bader Ginsburg saw anything repugnant \u2014 like systemic discrimination \u2014 she would get straight to work. It wasn\u2019t easy. Over decades, Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a slew of indignities. But she harnessed courage and resolve to strategically break down America\u2019s sexist, unethical laws and institutions.\u00a0\nTo honor the Notorious RBG, we\u2019ve collected our seven favorite facts about her life and her legacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7) RBG was defiant in the face of entrenched sexism in college and law school.\nMost colleges didn\u2019t accept women in the 1950s, and Ruth Bader was one of the first to break the gender barrier. At Cornell University, she was sexually harassed by a professor, who offered answers to a test in exchange for sex. She confronted him: \u201cI went to his office and I said, \u2018How dare you? How dare you do this?\u2019 And that was the end of that.\u201d\u00a0\nAt Harvard Law School, she and the eight other women in her class of more than 500 students were ogled, ignored in the classroom, excluded from the library, and asked by the dean how they could possibly justify taking a seat away from a man. But that hostile environment didn\u2019t stop her.\u00a0\nShe fought it with brain power and superhuman physical endurance. She was so obsessed with the law that she\u2019d regularly stay up until dawn studying. She\u2019s still known for being able to work until 3 a.m. and live on just two hours of sleep.\u00a0\nWhile she was kicking butt at the top of her classes, she was also taking care of her young daughter and sick husband. Martin (Marty) Ginsburg contracted testicular cancer and had extensive radiation therapy, which kept him from going to his own law school classes. So, RBG organized his friends to attend his classes, worked through their notes with Marty, and typed up Marty\u2019s papers \u2014\u00a0all while doing her own schoolwork on top of it.\u00a0\nShe tied for first in her class from Columbia Law School in 1959. She also was the first person to become a member of both the prestigious Harvard Law Review, and the Columbia Law Review \u2014 one of many of her unprecedented feats. She proved to those elite schools that a woman could succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6) RBG\u00a0showed the world what a partnership looks like in a husband-wife relationship.\nRuth Bader met Marty Ginsburg while they were both at Cornell University, and they forged an equal partnership from the beginning. He learned to cook so she didn\u2019t have to. Later, he lobbied for her seats on the Court of Appeals in D.C. and on the Supreme Court. And he gave up his law firm in New York to follow her to Washington \u2014 a shocking move at the time. Here\u2019s how she put it at her 1993 Senate confirmation hearing:\n\n\nI surely would not be in this room today without the determined efforts of men and women who kept dreams of equal citizenship alive. I have had the great good fortune to share life with a partner truly extraordinary for his generation. A man who believed at age 18 when we met that a woman\u2019s work, whether at home or on the job, is as important as a man\u2019s. I became a lawyer when women were not wanted by most members of the legal profession. I became a lawyer because Marty supported that choice unreservedly.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5) RBG won a whopping five cases before\u00a0the Supreme Court \u2014\u00a0and they all advanced the Constitutional protection of equal rights for all\u00a0Americans.\nAs smart and accomplished as Ruth Bader Ginsburg was, no law firm would hire her after she graduated from law school. Law firms slammed the door in her face time after time because they only hired men. She realized that \u201cbeing a woman was an impediment.\u201d\u00a0\nAs Ginsburg navigated the legal working world in the 1960s, she saw how thousands of state and federal laws were treating women as second-class citizens. At that time, most states\u2019 laws allowed employment termination for pregnancy, and let banks deny credit to women without a male co-signer. The Supreme Court had rejected every challenge to laws that treated women worse than men.\nAll this gender discrimination fueled Ginsburg\u2019s drive for social justice. In the early '70s, she\u00a0followed the strategy of NAACP civil rights lawyer and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who helped dismantle Jim Crow laws case by case over many years \u2014\u00a0leading to Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which outlawed racial segregation in schools in 1954. Like Marshall, Ginsburg centered her arguments on the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which says all persons should be treated equally under the law.\nThroughout the 1970s, Ginsburg led the ACLU\u2019s Women's Rights Project, for which she argued and won five landmark gender equality cases before the Supreme Court. As she said in the 2018 documentary RBG: \"I knew that I was speaking to men who didn't think there was such a thing as gender-based discrimination, and my job was to tell them it really exists.\u201d\n\n\nThese cases set the foundation for the country\u2019s laws against sex discrimination, and helped eliminate being male as the criteria for employment, pay, and benefits:\n\n\nTwo cases in 1975 and\u00a01979 established the requirement that women serve on juries, recognizing that they should enjoy both the benefits and the responsibilities of our judicial system.\n\n\nThe vaunted woman's privilege viewed against history's backdrop simply reflects and perpetuates a certain way of thinking about women. Women traditionally were deemed lesser citizens.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, arguing before the Supreme Court (Duren v. Missouri, 1979)\n\n\n\nAn employment benefits case in 1973 required the U.S. military to equally distribute family-based benefits for service members regardless of sex.\n\n\nIn asking the Court to declare sex a suspect criterion, we urge a position forcibly stated in 1837 by Sara Grimke, noted abolitionist and advocate of equal rights for men and women. She said, \u2018I ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.'\n\n\u2014\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg, arguing before the Supreme Court (Frontiero v. Richardson, 1973)\n\n\n\nTwo cases in 1974 and 1975 threw out gender-based distinctions in survivors\u2019 benefits, granting widowers the same benefits as widows. RBG argued that while giving widows special treatment sounded nice, it wasn\u2019t. Withholding benefits to widowers devalued the work of their deceased wives.\n\n\nA gender line...helps to keep women not on a pedestal, but in a cage.\u00a0\n\n\u2014Ruth Bader Ginsburg, arguing before the Supreme Court (Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 1975)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4) At her confirmation hearings, RBG openly declared that abortion access is a constitutional right.\nAt her 1993 Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Ruth Bader Ginsburg showed what it looks like to uphold constitutional rights. Unlike recent Supreme Court nominees, she affirmatively declared the Constitutional right to safe, legal abortion. When Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) grilled\u00a0her about her views on abortion, she declared:\n\n\nBut you asked me about my thinking about equal protection versus individual autonomy, and my answer to you is it's both. This is something central to a woman's life, to her dignity. It's a decision that she must make for herself. And when Government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) RBG wrote the historic decision ruling that state-funded schools must admit women.\nIn 1996, Justice Ginsburg wrote the Supreme Court\u2019s majority opinion in United States v. Virginia, which ruled that the Virginia Military Institute\u2019s men-only admission policy violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause. Justice Ginsburg destroyed the Institute\u2019s argument that its program wasn\u2019t suitable for women. Instead, she wrote that: \n\n\n[G]eneralizations about \u2018the way women are,\u2019 estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description.\n\n\nThe school has admitted women since then, and \u2014\u00a0as Justice Ginsburg predicted \u2014 they have made the school proud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) RBG\u2019s dissent from the majority in Lilly Ledbetter\u2019s case led to the passage a fair pay law.\nIn 2007, Justice Ginsburg dissented in the ruling against Lilly Ledbetter \u2014\u00a0a tire factory employee who learned, decades into her tenure, that she was being paid much less than men in the exact same supervisory role: She\u00a0was making\u00a0$3,727 per month, while her male counterparts were making between\u00a0$4,286 and $5,236 per month.\u00a0However, she lost the case because\u00a0the Civil Rights Act had a statute of limitations for reporting on discrimination.\u00a0\nIn her scathing dissent, Justice Ginsburg wrote that gender discrimination can be hidden for a long time and \u201cthe ball is in Congress\u2019s court\u201d to change the rule. In 2009, Barack Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which extended the Civil Rights Act\u2019s statute of limitations and guarantees women equal pay for equal work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) RBG put the smack down on TRAP laws in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt.\u00a0\nIn the landmark Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt case in 2016, the Supreme Court \u2014\u00a0including Justice Ginsburg \u2014\u00a0ruled that two abortion restrictions in Texas were unconstitutional because they would shut down most clinics in the state and cause Texans an \u201cundue burden\u201d on access to safe, legal abortion. The case exposed the lie that anti-abortion politicians have been peddling for years: that it\u2019s somehow \u201csafer\u201d when the state imposes medically unnecessary, onerous targeted restrictions against abortion providers (TRAP) laws.\u00a0\nIn her concurring opinion to the majority, Justice Ginsburg wrote:\n\n\nGiven those realities [that keep abortion access out of reach], it is beyond rational belief that H.B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law \u2018would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions\u2019... When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners... at great risk to their health and safety.\n\n\nWith this historic decision, the Court reaffirmed the constitutional right to access legal abortion. This decision was a triumph for abortion access \u2014 a triumph reaffirmed this June, when\u00a0the Supreme Court struck down a medically unnecessary law that\u00a0would have made abortion virtually inaccessible in Louisiana.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTake Action: Our Rights, Freedoms, and Health Care Are on the Line\n\nFor the sake of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s legacy, we cannot let Trump appoint more anti-reproductive health, anti-equality judges. We need to get to work to preserve the ideals she spent her life defending. We need you.\u00a0\nJustice Ginsburg fought for us.
