Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\nFor Democrats running for office the year, the calculation is simple: They believe their position on abortion rights is popular, and the Republican Party\u2019s anti-abortion views are unpopular. Across multiple races, Democrats are running ads and holding events in the closing weeks of the campaign to highlight their support for abortion rights \u2014 and their opponents\u2019 opposition. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the Democrats\u2019 candidate for U.S. Senate, has held a series of \u201cRon Against Roe\u201d campaign rallies. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has launched new ads that say Republican Tim Michels would force a 12-year-old who is raped to give birth. Michels has long opposed rape and incest exceptions for abortion laws. As recently as June, Michels told WISN-TV that he opposed exceptions beyond cases where the mother\u2019s life was threatened. Last month, he backed away from that position, telling a conservative talk radio host that as governor he would not veto a law adding rape and incest exceptions. Democrats point out that the GOP-controlled Legislature has repeatedly declined to pass such a law. This week, Evers told reporters he wouldn\u2019t sign that bill anyway, saying lawmakers should codify Roe v. Wade\u2019s abortion protections.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Michels, it\u2019s a long-held view. In 2004, when he was running for U.S. Senate against Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, he addressed the issue in an appearance on Wisconsin Public Radio\u2019s regional talk show \u201cRoute 51.\u201d \u201cThis is the question that is always brought up, and it\u2019s one of these very, very extreme cases,\u201d Michels said of the rape of a 12-year-old. He said he couldn\u2019t think of a worse crime, and his heart would go out to anyone in that situation.\u201cBut I think in the end, what I would try and tell them is: There\u2019s a life in there, a life that was created by God. And if you carry that baby full term, there\u2019ll be 25 or 35 couples that will be there willing and ready to adopt that baby, and love it, and raise it as their own. So that\u2019s where my position is on this, and I make no apology for being pro-life.\u201dA Michels campaign spokesperson pointed to his recent statements on the issue and said the quote was nearly 20 years old. A spokesperson for Michels\u2019 opponent this year, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, said \u201cabortion is on the ballot in November.\u201dThe 2004 interview is a window into how different the world was in 2004 from the 2022 gubernatorial campaign. In 2004, Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established a right to abortion access, was the law. For both Feingold and Michels, the example of the 12-year-old girl was purely hypothetical.Neither of those things is true anymore. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision overturning Roe in June was a generational victory for social conservatives. Its effects in Wisconsin were immediate: The state reverted to its 1849 law banning abortions except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is threatened, and all abortion clinics in the state stopped performing abortions. \nNurse Susan Hedges prepares the clinic before patients arrive Friday, May 27, 2022, at Planned Parenthood\u2019s Water Street Health Center in Milwaukee, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nIts effects on Wisconsin\u2019s electorate are not yet known. Nationally, there is evidence from public opinion surveys that women have swung toward Democrats since the court\u2019s decision. And Democrats including Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson this year, have made the issue a centerpiece of their campaigns\u2019 appeals in the few weeks before the Nov. 8 midterm elections. That\u2019s because Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban, which includes no exceptions for cases of rape or incest, is not popular. In January, before most Americans were aware that the Supreme Court could overturn the right to abortion, the Marquette University Law Poll found that a broad, national majority supported Roe v. Wade. In Wisconsin polls from May through September, it found about two-thirds of voters believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Its September poll found more than 80 percent of Wisconsin voters believed the law should allow abortions in cases of rape and incest. In the Marquette poll released Wednesday, that number had risen to 83 percent.Interviews with independent voters reveal distrust of GOP on abortionAshley Koenen was a longtime Republican with close ties to the conservative movement, even working on Wisconsin GOP campaigns. The 36-year-old from Waukesha has considered herself an independent since 2016, though, and has either voted for third-party candidates or refrained from voting since then. \u201cThe Dobbs decision absolutely has affected how I will vote this year,\u201d she told WPR in an email. \u201cA divided government is the most realistic, best-case scenario for Wisconsin women, so I will be voting for Evers and (Wisconsin Attorney General Josh) Kaul. This is the first time I will vote for Democrats in state races, and I will do so without any hesitation.\u201dKoenen was one of more than 100 Wisconsin voters who told the Wisconsin Main Street Agenda project that abortion was her most important voting issue in the midterms. The project is a collaboration between Wisconsin Public Radio, USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin and the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about inflation and gas prices and taxes,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut none of that matters if I don\u2019t have ownership over my own body.\u201dFor Democrats, the votes of women like Koenen could be the difference between winning and losing in a closely divided state. WPR interviewed five women who, like Koenen, said abortion was their most important voting issue in the midterms and who all identified as politically independent or who leaned Republican. \u201cThe government should not be involved,\u201d said Jean Bartz, 35, of Baraboo, who ran for Assembly as an independent in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t want a politician making decisions that I should be making with my health care provider.\u201d That was a common theme among the women interviewed, and it echoes appeals made by Barnes and Evers. Michelle Johnson, 43, a single mom of three, said that \u201cmore than just abortion being medical care, it\u2019s also about people having the right to make their own choices in their lives.\u201dJill Receley, 71, of Cudahy, said she has a fiscally conservative streak that led her to identify with Republicans on tax and business regulation issues. But in recent years, she has tended to identify with Democrats, and the abortion ban has cemented those views.\u201cIf any woman in this state votes Republican, they are totally out of their minds,\u201d she said.\nJake Bodoh of Madison holds a sign during a protest for abortion access following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade on Friday, June 24, 2022, in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nAbortion issue divides Republicans, tooOf course, plenty of women disagree, and do intend to vote Republican. Johnson appears to be leading in the Senate race. Polls show the governor\u2019s race as a dead heat. In both cases, GOP candidates have support from tens of thousands of women who simply hold conservative political views, including on abortion.But small shifts can have big consequences. Republican Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point; Evers won in 2018 by just over that amount; and in 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won the state by less than 1 point.\u201cWe\u2019ve always known that we are up against polling,\u201d said Gracie Skogman, legislative director for Wisconsin Right to Life. \u201cWe are up against very serious differences of opinion.\u201dSkogman said anti-abortion activists are on the right side of public opinion when it comes to support for pregnancy resource centers and in advocating for health care coverage or paid family leave to accommodate pregnancies. But she acknowledged that political candidates like Michels have to respond to public opinion in other ways.\u201cThey\u2019re speaking the message that they believe resonates most with voters,\u201d Skogman said. \u201cOur job as pro-lifers is to message directly to the pro-life electorate, so that they have clear information on the positions of candidates.\u201dFor Democratic activists, the goal is to publicize areas where most voters disagree with Republican candidates. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who ran for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate this year, has launched a political action committee called Wisconsin Women Win that is all about trying to reach women who may not have been involved in politics before but who\u2019ve been activated by this issue. She discussed the PAC at a September campaign event with Democratic congressional candidate Brad Pfaff, who was touting his endorsements from abortion rights groups.\u201cFor me, it was about: What can we do to make sure that this issue doesn\u2019t leave the table?\u201d Godlewski said at the event. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow it to be an afterthought anymore.\u201d\nWisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski speaks to attendees during a protest in opposition to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade on Friday, June 24, 2022, in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nGodlewski said part of her group\u2019s work is in making sure women who care about this issue are registered to vote. In conservative Kansas, for example, new voters and a surge in voter turnout were enough to defeat a constitutional amendment that would have banned abortion there in August. Godlewski and other Democrats want to see a similar voting wave in Wisconsin, and they think politically independent women are the key.Historically, abortion is not an issue that has a particularly large gender gap, said political scientist Mary-Kate Lizotte of Augusta University. Lizotte studies gender differences in public opinion and is the author of a book on the subject. She said women tend to be more religious than men \u2014 they are more likely to tell surveys they pray or attend church services regularly \u2014 and for many, opposition to abortion is linked to religious beliefs. But a gender gap is detectable on the issue, she said, with women being slightly more likely to support abortion rights than men. And it\u2019s also an issue where there is an opinion divide within those who identify as Republicans.\u201cRepublicans in general are much more likely than Democrats to disagree with their party on overturning Roe,\u201d Lizotte said.For many voters, Lizotte said, it\u2019s likely that other issues \u2014 inflation, gas prices, crime \u2014 will be more important than the future of abortion access to their vote in November. It\u2019s unlikely that large numbers of Republicans will shift their votes this year because of the issue.But that doesn\u2019t mean the issue won\u2019t continue to reshape the electorate into the future.\u201cEven if they don\u2019t identify as pro-choice, or have always identified as weakly pro-life,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people who are not going to be in favor of a complete lack of (abortion) access.\u201d\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nAlluding to Trump, Biden calls out Republicans \u2018bragging\u2019 about abortion bans \n\n \n\n\n\nAs 2024 campaign winds up, Democrats knock Senate candidate Eric Hovde on abortion record \n\n \n\n\n\nIn Arizona, abortion politics are already playing out on the Senate campaign trail \n\n \n\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris voices support for abortion access at Wisconsin visit \n\n \n\n\n\nGOP bill would restrict abortions after 14 weeks \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
