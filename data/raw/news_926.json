There are no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.\nThat\u2019s a 60% drop from the month before.\n\nTexas News\nNews from around the state of Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntexas wildfires\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4 mins ago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLargest wildfire in Texas history 100% contained; $800,000 raised to help farmers, ranchers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 hours ago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupreme Court extends block on Texas law that would allow police to arrest migrants\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers note, though, that the number of abortions reported in August \u2014 over 5,400 \u2014 was higher than usual for that month, likely because clinics were rushing to get women in before the law took effect. So, they say, it\u2019s also useful to compare September\u2019s data to the same month a year earlier, which shows a drop of 51%.\nThe Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which released the September figures this month, is releasing data on abortions on a monthly basis.\nWHAT DID ABORTION PROVIDERS EXPECT?\nAbortion providers had predicted that the law would bar at least 85% of abortions in Texas since, traditionally, most women were at least six weeks into their pregnancy when they had an abortion. And figures from the state show that in 2020, only about 15% of abortions were done at less than six weeks.\nSo why wasn\u2019t there an even bigger drop in abortions in September?\nResearchers say a combination of factors were apparently at play, including women scrambling to schedule appointments as soon as possible rather than when it might be most convenient.\n\u201cWe see people coming to us before they\u2019ve even done a pregnancy test before they even know if they\u2019re pregnant because they\u2019re so afraid that they might be pregnant and they will be denied an abortion,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas.\nAlso, researchers say, the attention drawn to the new law resulted in an influx of funds to help women pay for out-of-state travel and medical fees.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see as many people being pushed further into pregnancy because they\u2019re trying to figure out how to pay for the abortion,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said.\nHOW MANY WOMEN ARE GETTING ABORTION PILLS BY MAIL IN TEXAS?\nThe number of Texas women who are going online to get abortion pills by mail from the overseas nonprofit Aid Access sharply increased after the law took effect, according to the study led by Aiken.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say to what extent exactly as a percentage the gap has been filled, but I think we can say that self-managed abortion has been important in filling it,\u201d Aiken said.\nThe study, published Friday in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open, found that Aid Access got 1,831 requests for the pills from people in Texas in September.\nDuring the first week of September, requests per day jumped to about 138 compared to a previous average of 11, the study said. Over the subsequent weeks in September, requests averaged 37 a day. Then, through December, the average was 30 per day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another demonstration of the fact that just because you restrict abortion, the need for abortion does not magically go away,\u201d Aiken said.\nThe study\u2019s authors, who note they can\u2019t determine if all the requests resulted in abortions, said it\u2019s likely the initial dramatic spike was due to confusion as the law went into effect and some who requested pills may have ended up going to a clinic.\nThough a Texas law banning the delivery of such abortion-inducing medication by mail took effect in December, experts say there would be difficulty in stopping providers and suppliers outside of the state and country.\nThe law says the person taking the pills obtained by mail isn\u2019t criminally liable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to be the one that orders the pills and uses the pills,\u201d said Sara Ainsworth, senior legal and policy director for If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice.\nShe added that \u201cit\u2019s unclear whether or not that Texas law could be used to go after somebody who mailed drugs into Texas from somewhere else.\u201d\nHOW MANY WOMEN ARE GOING TO CLINICS OUT OF STATE FOR ABORTIONS?\nAbortion clinics from states surrounding Texas have reported sharp increases in the number of patients from Texas since the new law took effect, so much so at times that residents of those states must seek abortions elsewhere.\nOne clue comes from a research letter published in JAMA looking at what happened when Republican Gov. Greg Abbott all but banned abortions for about a month in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nKari White, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, which studies the impact of reproductive health policies in Texas, said the research found that during that time the number of women going out of state increased to about 950 compared to about 160 previously.\nPlanned Parenthood said Thursday that from September through December last year, states surrounding Texas saw a nearly 800% increase in abortion patients from Texas. It declined to provide the actual number of patients that made up that increase.\nHOW MANY PEOPLE WHO SOUGHT ABORTIONS HAD TO GIVE BIRTH?\nThat\u2019s unclear, too. Comparing the usual number of births in Texas with the number of births this year may eventually shed some light.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a big unknown,\u201d White said, \u201cand we won\u2019t know it for some time.\u201d\nWHAT DO THE NUMBERS SAY ABOUT THE FUTURE?\nIn a ruling expected later this year, the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled a willingness to weaken or reverse the landmark Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing a right to an abortion, and more than 20 states already have laws on the books to ban or dramatically restrict abortion if it\u2019s overturned.\nRestrictions or bans in states surrounding Texas could mean residents would have to travel even farther.\n\u201cIt could be that Texas is just a taste of what\u2019s to come,\u201d said Rachel K. Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.\nMeanwhile, anti-abortion groups in Texas have been celebrating the lives they say have been saved by Texas\u2019 law, and anticipating the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\n\u201cOur impact is only just beginning,\u201d said Texas Right to Life spokeswoman Kimberlyn Schwartz.\n\nCopyright AP - Associated Press\n\n\nThis article tagged under:\nabortionTexas Abortion law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTrending Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStanley Cup\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWorried about lead in your Stanley?
