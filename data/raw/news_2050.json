supporters display protest signs as they gather to witness North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper vetoing the SB 20 legislation limiting most abortions to the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nJonathan Drake/Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            A federal judge on Saturday blocked two provisions of a near-total ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy from taking effect in North Carolina, saying that one of the provisions is unconstitutionally vague, while the other lacks medical evidence. \n    \n\nSenate Bill 20, dubbed the \u201cCare for Women, Children and Families Act,\u201d bans any licensed physician from performing abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It provides exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a \u201clife-limiting anomaly\u201d through 24 weeks.\n    \n\n            The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood and physician Beverly Gray jointly filed a lawsuit on June 26 challenging the bill before it took effect on July 1, arguing its restrictions on abortion access will \u201charm patients and impede health care professionals from providing care.\u201d \n    \n\n            In an order issued on Saturday, US District Judge Catherine Eagles halted the enforcement of a provision requiring surgical abortions administered after 12 weeks to exclusively take place in hospitals rather than abortion clinics. She said the plaintiffs showed the state legislature\u2019s \u201cabsence of any rational medical basis\u201d for the mandate, which was set to take effect on Sunday.\n    \n\n            \u201cThere is credible evidence, including at least one study, that second-trimester surgical abortions in outpatient facilities are safer than hospitals,\u201d Eagles\u2019 order states. \n    \n\n            The judge also blocked a provision that would require doctors to document the location of early pregnancies with ultrasound evidence before prescribing a medication abortion. In the injunction, her order says provision \u201cdoes not provide a clear standard by which providers can make this determination\u201d and is open to \u201cdiffering interpretations.\u201d Judge Eagles issued a two-week restraining order on that provision in July to allow for further review. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrators hold signs as North Carolina Republican lawmakers hold a vote to override Democratic Governor Roy Cooper's veto of a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after 12 weeks, in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S. May 16, 2023. REUTERS/Erin Siegal McIntyre\n\nErin Siegal McIntyre/Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge clears way for North Carolina 12-week abortion ban to take effect, blocks one provision of law\n\n\n\n\n            Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the ban on most abortions after 12 weeks before it was overridden by the GOP supermajority in May.\n    \n\n            The governor signed into law significant changes to the ban on July 29, saying the amendment was \u201cimportant to clarify the rules and provide some certainty.\u201d The state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature also made additional last-minute changes to the new abortion law by tacking them onto House Bill 190 \u2013 an unrelated measure focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services. \n    \n\n            CNN previously reported that legal filings from attorneys representing Republican leadership appeared to confirm the amendment was written to address a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, which flagged multiple inconsistencies and potential constitutional violations in the original text of the abortion law.\n    \n\n            Under the bill, an abortion could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines the procedure is necessary to avert a patient\u2019s death \u2013 \u201cnot including psychological or emotional conditions.\u201d It prohibits health care providers who object to abortion \u201con moral, ethical, or religious grounds\u201d from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.\n    \n\n    Plaintiffs praise court

Carolina governor signs bill adjusting new abortion law before it goes into effect\n\n\n\n\n            The plaintiffs challenging the law praised the judge\u2019s order on Saturday, saying the court\u2019s decision \u201crecognizes that abortion is health care and that there is no medical reason to deny even more patients access to this safe, compassionate, evidence-based care,\u201d reads a statement from Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.\n    \n\n            North Carolina ACLU Legal Director Kristi Graunke said the order is \u201cone step forward in fighting back against these harmful bans.\u201d \n    \n\n            North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein is listed as a defendant in the lawsuit but released a statement supporting the judge\u2019s order, saying \u201cwomen, not politicians, should be making these decisions.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThe law is not based in medical reality, and it was sloppily written,\u201d his statement continued.\n    \n\n            Erik Baptist, the lawyer for the defendants and senior counsel of Alliance Defending Freedom \u2013 a non-profit legal group advocating for abortion restrictions, said the bill amounted to \u201ccommonsense protections.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cWe will consider all legal options to further support North Carolina\u2019s unborn children and mothers, and the right of the General Assembly to protect its vulnerable citizens,\u201d Baptist said.\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Dianne Gallagher contributed to this
