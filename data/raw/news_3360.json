President Alejandro Giammattei announced on March 10 that he would veto the law, noting that it violated international treaties. While outrage around the bill is justified and should continue, the bill also serves to divert attention from the pernicious dismantling of the rule of law that the government and its allies are currently undertaking.\nThe far-reaching bill expands the criminalization of abortion and could subject women who have miscarriages to questioning by law enforcement authorities, or even prosecution. The new proposal defines abortion as the \u201cnatural or provoked death\u201d of an embryo or fetus. It establishes prison sentences of up to four years for women who \u201ccause their own abortion,\u201d and 10 years for women who seek an abortion. Under current law, abortion is legal in Guatemala only when the life of a pregnant woman or girl is in danger.\nThe proposal establishes that \u201cfreedom of conscience and expression\u201d protects people from being \u201cforced to share or participate in non-heterosexual conduct and practices.\u201d The vagueness of this article appears aimed at legally protecting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, such as in housing, employment or service provision. The bill defines \u201cfamily\u201d as \u201cfather, mother, and children,\u201d deliberately excluding the realities of diverse families; and explicitly bans same-sex marriage and unions.\nThe \u201cLife and Family\u201d bill represents an affront to comprehensive sexuality education as it bans schools from teaching about\u00a0 LGBT people and sexual and reproductive health rights, curtailing children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 rights to education, information, and health.\nThe passage of the bill, which had been stalled in Congress since 2018, is not just noteworthy for its flagrant violations of human rights, but also for its timing.\nIn recent days, Attorney General Consuelo Porras issued a new round of arrest warrants for anti-corruption prosecutors from her own office who had been investigating the president and other high-level officials. Some prosecutors have resigned or fled the country. New corruption allegations against President Alejandro Giammattei also surfaced last month.\nThese are just the latest in years of attacks on the rule of law that have left Guatemala\u2019s democratic institutions hanging by a thread. Since Giammattei took office in 2020, he has worked with Congress and Porras to block any remaining corruption investigations that implicated senior politicians, by attempting to remove the last few independent judges and packing the Constitutional Court.\nMoving the \u201cLife and Family\u201d bill forward now has left human rights activists scrambling to fight against backsliding on multiple important fronts. And this may very well be part of a pernicious strategy by conservative and corrupt officials at a time when corruption seems to be winning, even as the international community expresses concern and dissatisfaction.\nIndeed, the bill and other government initiatives appear to be designed to move the public debate in Guatemala away from the issues of corruption and judicial independence as they polarize the population on issues like abortion and LGBT rights. On March 9, a day after the Guatemalan Congress\u00a0 passed the bill, Giammattei took part in a Christian congress that declared Guatemala the \u201cpro-life capital of Ibero-America.\u201d\nAnd the \u201cLife and Family\u201d bill may not be the last one to be employed as a distraction tactic. Bill 5940, recently passed unanimously by a congressional commission, stigmatizes transgender people and limits information about their existence in schools. It also regulates information about trans people in media outlets.\nPresident Giammattei is right in saying that the \u201cLife and Family\u201d bill violates international law. His veto is a significant about-turn for a man who has a track record of supporting initiatives that threaten the rights of women and LGBT people. A risk remains that a two-thirds majority of Congress could overturn his decision. But whatever the ultimate outcome, the bill has already done harm by drawing attention away from endemic corruption and the erosion of the rule of law in Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Guatemala \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nGuatemala: Anti-Trans Bill Threatens Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Contribute to Society\u201d\n\n\nThe Need for Legal Gender Recognition in Tabasco, Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThey Can Harass Us Because of the Laws\u201d\n\n\nViolence and Discrimination against LGBT People in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nGuatemala: Anti-Trans Bill Threatens Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
