Rep. Tate was joined by her fellow caucus members, adding that a \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u009d vote for Amendment 2 would prevent state judges from so-called \"legislating from the bench.\"\nIt would also ban tax-payer money from being used for abortions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd keep state judges in their lane of interpreting the law and not inventing new laws and new rights that the constitution does not speak of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Representative Tate said.\nThe use of tax-payer money to fund abortion is already illegal under federal and state law, though. The Hyde Amendment bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. And Kentucky's House Bill 3, passed earlier this year, prohibits \"public agency funds\" from being used to pay for abortion services.\nThe District 27 representative says considerable money is being spent to \"misinform\" Kentuckians that Amendment 2 is a total abortion ban. There is only one exception under state law, and rape or incest are notably not exceptions under state law.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does not ban all abortions. There is an exception to preserve the life and health of a pregnant woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Tate said.\nConstitutional Amendment 2, found on the back of this year's midterm ballots, asks a yes or no question that reads as follows:\n\"Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?\"\nDemocratic State Representative Josie Raymond takes exception to the claims made by the Pro-Life caucus Thursday.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRemoving the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to rule whether the General Assembly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laws are constitutional is an attack of the separation of powers. It removes the checks and balances system that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to American government to the Kentucky State Government. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not doing this to any other laws passed by the General Assembly, just the complete abortion ban,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Raymond explained.\nRaymond is confident Amendment 2 will be voted down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis question is central to so many people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Raymond said.\nRep. Tate feels differently, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vote keeps out-of-state interests from exploiting us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLegislators are reminding voters to turn their ballots over and not overlook any ballot questions like the one for Amendment 2 stating a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstraight line vote\u00e2\u0080\u009d only elects candidates.\u00a0\n\nRelated Stories\n\nOpposing groups spending millions with high-stakes abortion amendment on the ballot\n\nMany Kentuckians going to Cincinnati for abortion services while it's legal in Ohio\n\nMidterms 2022: Five states have abortion on the ballot in November\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n            Spectrum News App\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
