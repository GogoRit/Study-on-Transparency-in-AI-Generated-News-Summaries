Wade decision creating a right to abortion, a growing number of liberal prosecutors throughout the country appeared determined to protect abortion anyway.\nTheir strategy? Refusing to do their job.\nAttorneys general in nearly a dozen states and the District of Columbia have joined locally elected prosecutors from states across the country in pledging not to prosecute those who provide or receive abortions if their state legislature criminalizes the procedure.\nThey join 68 prosecutors who published a\u00a0statement, dated October 2020, which characterizes seeking an abortion as a woman\u2019s \u201cpersonal \u2026 choice\u201d about \u201c[her] own health care\u201d and performing an abortion as \u201ctreatment\u201d by doctors.\nThe statement refers to abortion simply as an \u201cissue\u201d without mentioning, as even the Supreme Court did in Roe, the unborn child that an abortion kills.\nThirteen states have enacted laws to criminalize abortion if and when the Supreme Court reverses Roe. Five states have pre-Roe abortion prohibitions that would come back into effect as well, according to\u00a0The New York Times.\nWhether these laws are recent or long-standing, limited or broad, these prosecutors have already pledged not to enforce them before they have even gone into effect.\nTheir attempt to suggest legitimate reasons for such a blanket dereliction of duty is hardly persuasive. They claim, for example, that they lack resources to pursue such cases, but have no evidence to back that up because none of these laws is yet in effect.\nAnd even speculation about the resources that would be needed would not justify a blanket refusal to enforce any of these laws.\nThis is not the first time liberal prosecutors have refused to enforce laws they don\u2019t like. Many refuse to prosecute crimes ranging from\u00a0drug possession\u00a0to\u00a0prostitution\u00a0to\u00a0threats including domestic violence.\nIndeed, cities with rogue prosecutors have seen significant spikes in\u00a0crime, yet the district attorneys ignore the\u00a0pleas\u00a0of their constituents, favoring lawbreakers over the law-abiding.\nOn the abortion issue, prosecutors not only ignore laws that have been enacted by refusing to enforce them, but effectively argue that those laws should not have been enacted in the first place.\n\u201cNo matter what the law in Virginia says, I will not prosecute a woman for having an abortion, or for being suspected of inducing one,\u201d wrote Steve Descano, commonwealth\u2019s attorney for Fairfax County, Virginia, in a recent New York Times\u00a0op-ed.\nBy effectively neutralizing entire categories of laws, these rogue prosecutors are treating the lawmakers responsible for them\u2014and the people who elected them\u2014as though they simply don\u2019t exist.\nThey have single-handedly replaced our system of government\u2014with the separation of powers and elected legislatures\u2014with one of their own making. Prosecutors have discretion over how to perform the duties, including enforcing duly enacted laws in individual cases. Refusing to enforce entire categories of laws, especially before they are even in effect, looks more like a way of neutralizing the legislature\u2019s power to enact those laws. \u00a0\nAny middle-schooler (at least where civics is still taught) knows this. If prosecutors want to determine what our laws are, they should run for the legislature.\n\u201cThe Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion,\u201d wrote Justice Samuel Alito in the leaked draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. \u201c[Roe\u00a0v. Wade] and\u00a0[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]\u00a0arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d\nThat is where that authority belongs. This issue, therefore, is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. This isn\u2019t about politics or party. Demanding that prosecutors do their job is simply the rule of law.\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nCrime and Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL REPORT  Over an hour read\n\n\nTwenty-First Century Illicit Drugs and Their Discontents: Driving Down the Psychedelic Highway\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s Border Crisis Comes to the Suburbs\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  24 min read\n\n\nThe Myth of Mass Incarceration Remains Strong\u2014Despite All Evidence to the Contrary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
