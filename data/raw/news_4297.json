One key outcome of the meeting was its revelation that ending maternal deaths, gender-based violence and unmet family planning needs is affordable and within reach, but desperately needs more funding.\nkat-yukawa-754726-unsplash\nUnfinished business\nTwenty-five years ago, at the landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, world leaders committed to achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health for women and girls. Unfortunately, progress has stagnated over the years, and the proportion of women using modern contraception methods has increased by only 6% to 58% today. Still more than 800 women die every day from pregnancy-related causes, almost half of all pregnancies are unintended, and more than 230 million women in developing countries who wish to avoid pregnancy don\u2019t have safe contraceptives.\nMore than 8,000 people from 163 UN Member States, including two Population Matters delegates, participated in the event co-convened by UNFPA and the Governments of Kenya and Denmark. The Summit was particularly significant as it was the first major international meeting heralding the United Nations Decade of Action to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nDespite its title\u2019s reference to population and development, the Summit predictably but disappointingly didn\u2019t address the overarching population context.\u00a0 Discussions of the benefits of reducing population growth as a result of empowerment and family planning were almost entirely absent, even though the greatest beneficiaries would often be the vulnerable communities it focussed on.\nDespite this omission, the Summit represented a very positive affirmation on a\u00a0 global stage that empowering women and girls is key to achieving a healthy planet and a good quality of life for all:\n\n\u201cStrengthening our societies, growing our economies and combating climate change all depend on women and girls taking control over their bodies, their choices and their futures.\u201d \u2013 Dr Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director\n\nThe three zeros\nThe meeting had three key objectives: to obtain political reaffirmation of the ICPD Programme of Action within the context of the SDGs (due to be met by 2030), to build political and financial momentum to fulfil Cairo\u2019s unfulfilled promises, and to reinvigorate and expand the community of people necessary to push forward the ICPD agenda. It remains to be seen how effective the Nairobi Summit was at meeting these objectives. The 12 global commitments resulting from the event include three priority areas, nicknamed the \u201cthree zeros\u201d: zero gender-based violence and harmful practices, zero preventable maternal mortality, and zero unmet need for modern family planning by 2030. The total estimated cost of achieving these is USD $264 billion \u2013 less than a sixth of annual global military spending \u2013 yet the funding gap between what is needed and what has been promised remains huge at $222 billion.\n3 zeros ICPD25\nGovernments, the private sector and civil society must urgently mobilise to prioritise the advancement of the rights of women and girls. Without strong action over the next decade, the human and environmental cost will be far greater.\n\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nPost\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\nUnmet needs: conversations with the women left behind\n\nPopulation Matters\u2019 Director, Robin Maynard, summarises events at this month\u2019s Nairobi Summit on ICPD25, and recounts his experience of meeting\u00a0young women and their families in Africa\u2019s largest slum and surrounding\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThe most powerful action to save the planet is the most neglected one\n\nIn our latest blog post, our Digital and Communications Officer, Olivia Nater, writes that as well as being just and morally essential, achieving global gender equality would make an unparalleled\u2026\n\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Rights\n\nThe UN has projected that gender equality won\u2019t be achieved until the next century.
