Newsroom, Feb 27, 2022 / 12:50 pm\nIt is almost impossible for the religious sisters at the Our Lady of Guadalupe Convent in St. Louis to lose sight of the mission God has given them.\nThey see it plainly right across the street: a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic.\nThe convent is home to two members of the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity. The convent\u2019s purpose, set forth on the Archdiocese of St. Louis\u2019 website, is \u201cto provide a place of prayer and hospitality for pilgrims to whom to witness and pray for life outside of Missouri\u2019s last abortion facility in St. Louis.\u201d\nIn an interview with EWTN News Nightly, Sister Sue Anne Hall, who lives at the convent with Sister Delores Voigt, said the convent\u2019s daily work and prayer is directed by whoever happens to arrive at the front door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the doorbell rings, we go and answer it and take care of whoever is there. Our time of prayer is there in our daily life,\" Hall explained. \n\"Sometimes we have Mass scheduled at our place with one of the parishes in the St. Louis area and we invite them to come and pray with us to have an hour of adoration before Mass, and then we serve a luncheon after the Mass is over.\u201d You can watch the full interview in the video below.\n\nHall said she is constantly surprised by the stream of support her order receives from others, particularly how willing many are to dedicating a portion of their time toward praying outside of the abortion facility.\u00a0\nFrom the sisters' perspective, that effort seems to be paying off.\n\u201cWhen we first came, that [Planned Parenthood] parking lot was completely full of cars of employees; it is now empty,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThere are very few times that there's anybody parking in that parking lot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHall in particular cited the positive impact that young pro-life volunteers are having.\n\u201cThere are a group of young people who do counseling outside of Planned Parenthood that try to convince the person not to have the abortion, and sometimes they have the turnarounds that they would like,\u201d she said.\nAs for what others can do to protect the unborn and end abortion, Hall emphasized something basic, yet powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike Archbishop [Robert C.] Carlson said,\u201d she noted, \u201cIt's through prayer that this is going to end.\u201d\nYou can learn more about the Our Lady of Guadalupe Convent by listening to this recent episode of Catholic News Agency\u2019s CNA Newsroom podcast.\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPlanned Parenthood, \nFranciscans, \nPro-life advocacy, \nArchdiocese of St. Louis, \nEWTN News Nightly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeonardo Colon served as a digital media specialist for EWTN News until December 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\nOur mission is the truth.
