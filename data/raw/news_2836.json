(photo: Courtesy photos / Archdiocese of Milwaukee)\n\n\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith \nNation\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 As more and more women came seeking her out to pour out their grief after abortion, Vicki Thorn turned to the Lord in prayer, asking for guidance. Opening her Bible, the bereavement counselor read the passage that appeared before her from Jeremiah 31:15: \u201cRachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.\u201d\nBut it was the next verses that inspired Thorn to found Project Rachel in 1984: \u201cKeep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears \u2026 There is hope for your future, declares the Lord, and your children shall come back to their own country.\u201d\u00a0\nAt her funeral on April 30, at St. Catherine\u2019s Catholic Church in Milwaukee, pro-life advocates will bid farewell in this life to Victoria M. Thorn. In the course of nearly four decades, the Catholic wife and mother of six had transformed the pro-life movement with Project Rachel\u2019s message of compassion for post-abortive mothers and inspired both her own and the next generation of pro-life leaders.\u00a0\nThorn, 72, passed away without warning April 20, Easter Wednesday, from a massive heart attack. The suddenness of her death stunned Catholic pro-life leaders who remembered Thorn as a woman who embodied the heart of the pro-life movement itself and had so much more yet to give.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe really exemplified the compassion and true lack of judgment that the vast majority of pro-lifers have for women who have had abortions, or men who coerced abortions,\u201d said Mary Hallan FioRito, a Catholic legal expert in abortion law and policy. FioRito became good friends with Thorn in 1993, when FioRito became the Chicago Archdiocese\u2019s pro-life director. She explained Thorn recognized the coercive social and financial pressures experienced by women and girls who aborted their unborn children and the need to accompany them to a place of healing and reconciliation.\nThorn, a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life, played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of the pro-life movement with Project Rachel ministries, a diocesan-based network of specially trained clergy, counselors and laity who provide care for women (and later men) in need of healing from abortion.\u00a0\nThorn began the ministry out of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee\u2019s Respect Life Office in 1984, and from there Project Rachel spread over the next few decades to nearly every U.S. Catholic diocese.\nShe carried out her pro-life ministry with the support of her husband, William, and the firm conviction that God would provide for the work he set before her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cShe lived by God\u2019s providence,\u201d FioRito said, without worrying about the future, but instead focusing on today: \u201cMy job is what God has put in front of me every day.\u201d\nThorn\u2019s own relationship with Jesus Christ was deeply steeped in reading her Bible, and FioRito said she routinely consulted the Lord in prayer before making decisions.\u00a0\nIn this way, Thorn\u2019s discipleship led her to found the Project Rachel ministry, especially after discovering that many priests were desperate for guidance regarding how to help post-abortive women.\n\u201cVicki was personally, keenly interested in and aware of the need to do something with regard to providing some way to repair the damage done in the souls and lives of people who have had abortions,\u201d Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society of Human Life, told the Register.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTurner, a longtime friend of Thorn, said she met her at the 1987 Healing Visions Conference organized by the National Youth Pro-life Coalition, where they both gave presentations and which featured \u201cthe great lights of the early pro-life movement.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a very dynamic lady,\u201d Turner said. \u201cShe knew what was needed.\u201d\nTurner, a Catholic who had experienced abortion herself, became one the members of Thorn\u2019s Project Rachel teams that would make presentations in the dioceses. These presentations involved a canon lawyer, a psychologist, a post-abortive mother to give her testimony freely and safely about the impact of abortion, an OB-GYN doctor, and a pastoral-care expert who was not a priest in that diocese.\nTurner told the Register that, by the mid-1990s, she had made 40 Project Rachel presentations. She shared with participants how, when she returned to the Church for healing after abortion, she told the priest in the confessional, \u201cI want to be back at the Communion table, within the Communion of Saints, because there my child is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTurner said that Thorn was a sweet mother and sweet grandmother with a will of iron \u2014 a modern-day \u201cCatherine of Siena\u201d who championed a message of God\u2019s mercy for post-abortive women and men.\u00a0\nThorn\u2019s efforts, Turner said, led many priests to rediscover the reason they became priests. Project Rachel moved the U.S. bishops to give priests faculties to absolve women who had abortions and lift any potential state of excommunication associated with abortion.\u00a0\nBy the time Pope Francis had made this permission universal at the end of the Year of Mercy in 2016, the U.S. bishops had already made this the norm, thanks to Project Rachel, which today operates under the aegis of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\u00a0\nInspiring Pro-Life Leaders\nKathleen Buckley Domingo, executive director of the California Catholic Conference, told the Register that Thorn decisively changed the pro-life movement\u2019s national narrative and inspired pro-life leaders like her with Project Rachel\u2019s message of compassion.\u00a0\nAs a young Gen X pro-life advocate, Domingo felt uncomfortable with some of the harsh rhetoric or lack of empathy toward women who had abortions espoused by some pro-life leaders at that time. But Thorn\u2019s witness of compassion gave Domingo \u201cthe tools to have empathy in a way that I never would have had otherwise without her work.\u201d Today, she said, the millennial generation and following youth cannot imagine the movement any other way.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe completely changed the dialogue,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cShe taught us so much about how to understand people who are in really desperate circumstances, how to understand the choice that women make for abortion, how to understand where they're coming from, what happens when they make that choice, how to really help them heal, and why that\u2019s so critical.\u201d\nWhile Thorn is most well-known for the Project Rachel post-abortion ministry, she had turned her focus later in life toward how the pro-life movement could help women and girls steer away from the path that ended in abortion, particularly through teaching what she called the \u201cbiology of the theology of the body.\u201d In addition, in 2013, she presented a talk, \u201cA Christian Vision of Sexuality,\u201d at a conference marking the 25th anniversary of Pope St. John Paul II\u2019s apostolic letter on the dignity and vocation of women, Mulieris Dignitatem.\nJamie Rathjen, a FertilityCare practitioner and national board chairwoman of the Guiding Star pro-life health centers, encountered this part of Thorn\u2019s mission when she spoke at the 2014 \u201cGoing Natural\u201d pro-life conference organized in Dubuque, Iowa.\u00a0\nRathjen resonated with Thorn\u2019s presentations on the ill effects of hormonal contraception on women\u2019s bodies, choice of mate and the environment. Furthermore, Thorn demonstrated the importance of providing authentic sex education rooted in God\u2019s design and plan for human beings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe was somebody who really encouraged me,\u201d Rathjen said. \u201cShe had ways of communicating realities about our nature.\u201d\nThorn became a mentor to Rathjen, who established the Cedar Valley Guiding Star health center in Waterloo, Iowa. Thorn\u2019s influence can be seen in Guiding Star\u2019s sexual-education classes called \u201cIntro to Womanhood\u201d and \u201cIntro to Manhood,\u201d which Rathjen said are now providing two generations, parent and child, with the truth and dignity of their bodies in God\u2019s plan that they never received in school.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re really addressing the cultural root [of abortion],\u201d she said, adding that this is part of their plan to transform communities. \u201cMen and women don\u2019t understand the dignity of their own bodies. We\u2019re literally talking a lot about the things that Vicki talked about.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDoubling Down on Compassion\nThe landscape of abortion in the 21st century is changing. FioRito said that Roe v. Wade\u2019s likely fall will alter the legal landscape of abortion in the U.S. But she said the changes will likely accelerate a shift to medical abortion, where the majority of abortions will become self-administered RU-486 abortion pills at home.\u00a0\nThe trauma of these abortions is going to be greater, FioRito said, as women and girls who abort will see the aborted remains of their child before disposing them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese realities will challenge the pro-life movement. However, FioRito believed Vicki Thorn would call the pro-life movement to \u201cdouble down on that compassion\u201d and \u201cmeet these women with the extravagant mercy of God.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d want us to double down on the compassion.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated after posting.\n\n\nKeywords: \nvicki thorn\nproject rachel\npeter jesserer smith\n\n\n\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith Peter Jesserer Smith is a staff reporter for the National Catholic Register.
