Dar'shun KendrickBy Becca Andrews | bandrews@reckonmedia.comDar\u2019shun Kendrick, a Black lawmaker in the Georgia statehouse, is calling out her state out on what she calls its \u201cpro-life\u201d hypocrisy.Kendrick recently filed a bill dubbed the Georgia Pro-Birth Accountability Act, essentially making the state financially responsible for all pregnancies in which abortion care was desired, but unattainable because of Georgia\u2019s six-week ban. Pregnant people would be compensated by the state for the full spectrum of medical care during and after pregnancy.The state would also be on the hook for burial expenses, should a pregnant person die in childbirth, as well as any disability that results from the pregnancy. As for expenses postpartum, the state would be expected to pay for the child\u2019s expenses through the age of 18, including funds to be set aside for college.Is this bill mostly symbolic? Yes. Is it worthy, searing social commentary? Also yes.\u201cIf we want to say we are a pro-life state, then we need to put our money where our mouth is, that means childcare, that means the mother\u2019s expenses. That means helping raise the child from birth to age 18 and not just caring about the nine months that they\u2019re in the womb,\u201d Kendrick told Capitol Beat News Service. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where the priorities lie, because if we do have a surplus, if we continue to have one, there\u2019s no reason that we can\u2019t fund this.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time Rep. Kendrick has put forth legislation that speaks truth to power. In 2019, after Georgia\u2019s initial attempt to ban abortion at six weeks gestation, Rep. Kendrick, along with a group of Black female Democratic lawmakers, introduced a bill to amend the state code to require men 55 and older to \u201cimmediately report to the county sheriff or local law enforcement agency when such male releases sperm from his testicles.\u201dThe bill, of course, didn\u2019t gain traction, but it did certainly start a conversation.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
