The bill would guarantee the right to health universally and comprehensively, including for women, adolescents, and girls, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people. It also would guarantee access to sexual and reproductive health care, and provide comprehensive services based on scientific evidence.\nThe bill\u2019s approval by the assembly represents a great accomplishment by the many women's rights organizations that supported the initiative.\nIn a country where every day, 7 girls below the age of 14 become mothers and the maternal mortality rate is 41.1 per 100,000 births, the new code could dramatically improve the lives of all Ecuadorians by increasing access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services. For example, it prohibits delaying emergency health care for any reason, including conscientious objection. This is an important step toward eliminating barriers to reproductive health care and ensuring that healthcare services are provided on a nondiscriminatory basis, in compliance with international law and some specific recommendations made by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health. The bill still lacks clear guidance on non-emergency situations, where timely access to care is also urgent and unregulated conscientious objection might cause delays inconsistent with Ecuador\u2019s human rights obligations.\nThe code reiterates the duty of healthcare professionals to respect medical confidentiality, including in cases of obstetric emergency. This is crucial in a country where Human Rights Watch has found nearly three out of four abortion prosecutions where files can be accessed are triggered by a healthcare provider reporting a patient to the police.\nThe code also reinforces the country\u2019s prohibition on conversion therapy, already contained in the Criminal Code, which bars any attempt to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. The new health code also provides protections for intersex children, including a prohibition on offering or performing medical procedures that violate the personal integrity of any person who has not reached puberty, except when the child\u2019s health or life is at risk.\nPresident Len\u00edn Moreno has a chance to improve the health and lives of all Ecuadorians. He should join the majority of the legislative assembly and sign this bill into law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Ecuador \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nHealth LGBT Rights Women's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nArgentina: Legalize Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 28, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nVenezuela: A Police State Lashes Out Amid Covid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Contribute to Society\u201d\n\n\nThe Need for Legal Gender Recognition in Tabasco, Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWe Must Ask for What Is Already Ours\u201d\n\n\nAfro-descendant Women and Access to Land in Alto Mira y Frontera, Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nArgentina: Legalize Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 28, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nVenezuela: A Police State Lashes Out Amid Covid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
