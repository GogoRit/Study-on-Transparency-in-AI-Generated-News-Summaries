The controversial video has since been taken down. (Photo: courtesy of TikTok)\nWINDSOR TERRACE \u2014 TikTok, a short-form video-sharing platform that is used by millions, is under fire for a video that went viral showing a presumably pregnant girl laughing and dancing at a Planned Parenthood in California. \nThe 20-second video, posted by user @cpcake21, has multiple segments. In the first cut, a girl called \u201cAshley\u201d is standing in front of a mirror, when her friend, who is taking the video, asks Ashley how she feels. At the time, the friend is holding a positive pregnancy test.\nThe next cut shows Ashley and her friend in a car in a parking lot in front of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Pasadena, Calif. The shot after that shows a couple waiting in the clinic. Ashley and her friend appear to be mocking them.\nThen, the video shows Ashley dancing in the waiting room at the clinic. The video doesn\u2019t show any graphic images, but it does include a close-up shot of an ultrasound. That was the last shot in the video. The video doesn\u2019t indicate if Ashley had an abortion. \nThe title of the video is \u201cAbortion time! Take 2,\u201d suggesting this was Ashley\u2019s second abortion attempt.\nThe video, which has been deleted, has been viewed millions of times and has received hundreds of thousands of likes, according to one report.\nThe casual, even joyful, tone of the video drew widespread criticism from conservatives and pro-life advocates.\n\u201cWhere did we go so wrong as a society for this young woman to think that what she\u2019s doing is okay?\u201d asked Cathy Donohoe, the president of Queens-based pregnancy resource center The Bridge to Life. \u201cI had a hard time watching the whole thing. We need to reach these young women\u2019s minds and hearts. If we reach them, God will enter. Young women need to know that they are being deceived by Planned Parenthood. Women deserve better than abortion.\u201d\nMichael Shoule, a parishioner at American Martyrs, Oakland Gardens, sees the harm of the video, but also the good that can come out of it. \n\u201cMy sixth-grade daughter is very familiar with TikTok and my seventh-grade son to a certain extent. She has not seen this video yet. As a parent I am very conscious of what my children see on social media in general and in particular those apps that target younger audiences. In this specific case I am saddened by the possibility that this is something that is real and happening way too often,\u201d Shoule said.\n\u201cAt the same time I think it might be a blessing in disguise that a video like this gets posted because it gives me the opportunity as a parent to have another teaching moment with my children and to talk to them about the truth of when life begins and how important it is to respect life. It is also a chance to remind them that we are not here to judge the girls in the video or anyone else for that matter. Only to pray for them,\u201d he said. \nCharlie Kirk, president and founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative advocacy group, asked on Twitter, \u201cWhat happened to \u2018abortions should be safe, legal and rare?\u2019 Now they\u2019re celebrated and streamed on social media.\u201d \nTikTok\u2019s community guidelines state the platform is \u201csimply NOT the place to post, share, or promote\u201d anything that includes \u201charmful, dangerous, graphic, shocking or violent content.\u201d\nTikTok, an app that was launched in 2017, is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese internet technology company that was founded in 2012.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood and TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\nTags: abortion, American Martyrs - Bayside Queens, pro-life, The Bridge to Life Login here to comment\nShare this article with a friend.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername or Email\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nRemember Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue with GoogleContinue with Facebook\n\n \n\n\nPrevious National News Story Next National News Story\n\n\n\t\t\tOne thought on \u201cViral Abortion Video Draws Pro-Life Outrage\u201d\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nPerson says: \n\nFebruary 9, 2021 at 11:35 pm \n\n\nAbortion kills 2 beating hearts.  Had a friend threaten to kill herself when she had her first baby, but she didn\u2019t.   The second pregnancy, she had an abortion.  Emotionally, she couldn\u2019t handle it and shot herself in the head.\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\nYou must sign in to leave a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tablet Headlines Delivered Daily\n\n\n\nCatholic Headlines Widget Signup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\r\n        *\n\n\n\n\nYour email will be used to send you The Tablet newsletter.
