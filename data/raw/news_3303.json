Wade.\nRoe v. Wade\u2014the Supreme Court decision that mobilized generations of pro-life activists and shaped evangelicals\u2019 political engagement for half a century\u2014has been overturned.\nMillions have marched, protested, lobbied, and prayed for the end of the landmark abortion rights ruling. After 49 years, and more than 63 million abortions, the time has come.\nChristian leaders called the ruling \u201conce unthinkable\u201d and marked today as \u201cthe day we have all been waiting for\u201d and \u201cone of the most important days in American history.\u201d\n\u201cWe hold that Roe and Casey must be overturned,\u201d wrote Justice Samuel Alito for the majority. \u201cThe Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.\u201d\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision was 6 to 3, with Chief Justice John Roberts concurring with the majority. The opinion of the court closely resembled an Alito draft leaked last month.\nThe decision is the result of a trio of conservative justices appointed during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.\nEvangelicals have been the religious group most opposed to abortion and most eager to see Roe overturned. While abortion was never evangelicals\u2019 only issue, in the voting booth it often outweighed all other concerns. Some supported Trump despite moral misgivings in hopes he would deliver on his promise to appoint justices that would finally overturn Roe and the subsequent Supreme Court decision that affirmed abortion rights, Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\nThe political calculation appears to have paid off. The three new justices joined Alito and Clarence Thomas in a bold decision saying the court got it wrong.\n\u201cThis day belongs to the many people who have labored long and hard to make it happen\u2014and to President Trump, who deserves our thanks for keeping a promise I did not think he would keep,\u201d said Matthew Lee Anderson, a Christian ethicist and Baylor University religion professor.\nEd Whelan, an EPPC senior fellow, referred to the ruling as the \u201ccrowning achievement of the conservative legal movement.\u201d\nThe majority opinion reflected the arguments of evangelical and Catholic pro-life groups who filed friend-of-the-court briefs. Strategically, many focused less on arguments for fetuses\u2019 humanity and right to life, and more on the problems with the legal reasoning behind Roe.\u201cRoe was wrongly decided and poorly reasoned,\u201d wrote the attorneys for Americans United for Life. \u201cNumerous adjudicative errors during the original deliberations\u2014especially the absence of any evidentiary record\u2014have contributed to making Roe unworkable. \u2026 There is a constant search for a constitutional rationale for Roe, and the Court has yet to give a reasoned justification for the viability rule.\u201d\nThe attorneys for the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) made the same point: \u201cAs a matter of the Constitution\u2019s text and history, it is no secret that Roe is not just wrong but grievously so. Roe was roundly criticized as wrong the day it was decided, it has been robustly opposed both within and outside the Court ever since, and no sitting Justice has defended the merits of its actual reasoning.\u201d\nThe Dobbs case considered the constitutionality of a 2015 Mississippi law barring abortions after 15 weeks, a more restrictive ban than allowed under Roe. The state\u2019s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women\u2019s Health, sued officials with the state health department including Thomas Dobbs. Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) served on the state\u2019s legal defense team.\n\u201cMississippi asked the Court to overturn Roe because that case was egregiously wrong and had no basis in constitutional text, structure, or history. Additionally, Roe\u2019s changing standards have long been unworkable, which is why so many pro-life laws ended up in court,\u201d said Kristen Waggoner, general counsel for ADF. \u201cIt also failed to account for changing science, which demonstrates that life begins at conception.\u201d\nHow Roe was decided\nThe court\u2019s decision in 1973 was based on the argument that fetal life does not have constitutional protection. Lawyers in the case pointed out that traditionally, rights are understood to begin at birth. The 14th Amendment, for example, extended citizenship to all those \u201cborn \u2026 in the United States,\u201d not those conceived within the nation\u2019s borders. A fetus, similarly, is not allowed to own property.\nThe judges said, however, that the state did have a compelling interest in protecting fetal life. But that compelling interest had to be balanced with a woman\u2019s right to privacy.\u201cPrivacy\u201d is never mentioned in the Constitution, but the Ninth Amendment says that rights not mentioned in the Constitution are not to be denied by default. And the 14th Amendment guarantees legal due process, which the court said indicated a right to privacy, including the right to make decisions about abortion without state interference\u2014at least up to a certain point.\nThe justices debated that point. After some internal back and forth, they settled on fetal viability.\nThe author of the landmark decision, Justice Harry Blackmun, viewed Roe v. Wade as a careful compromise.\n\u201cThe Court does not today hold that the Constitution compels abortion on demand,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt does not today pronounce that a pregnant woman has an absolute right to an abortion. It does, for the first trimester of pregnancy, cast the abortion decision and the responsibility for it upon the attending physician.\u201d\nAs historian Daniel K. Williams has noted, however, Blackmun was wrong. Roe accepted none of the arguments of the pro-life movement and delivered a decisive win to abortion rights advocates. The decision forced 46 state legislatures to rewrite their abortion laws, bringing them into line with what had been, until then, the most liberal abortion laws in the nation.\nMost evangelical Christians at the time saw it as an appalling decision, disregarding the unalienable right of life.\u201cThis decision runs counter not merely to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,\u201d CT argued in 1973.\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, the Assemblies of God, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the Presbyterian Church in America, and other denominations all passed pro-life resolutions in the decade after Roe.\nIn their influential book Whatever Happened to the Human Race?, evangelist Francis Schaeffer and pediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop called abortion the \u201cfirst and crucial issue,\u201d the \u201ckeystone\u201d to protecting the dignity of human life.\n\u201cWe implore those of you who are Christian to exert all your influence to fight against the increasing loss of humanness\u2014through legislation, social action, and other means at your disposal,\u201d they wrote in 1979. \u201cIf we do not take a stand here and now, we certainly cannot lay any claim to being the salt of the earth in our generation.\u201dThe movement almost achieved victory in 1992. Five abortion clinics and one independent doctor sued Pennsylvania for its restrictions on abortion, including a mandatory waiting period and notification of a spouse or parent. At the time, eight of the nine justices had been appointed by Republicans, though at least three of them were known to support abortion rights.\nOn the eve of the decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist drafted a 5-to-4 majority opinion overturning Roe.\nThen at the last minute, Justice Anthony Kennedy switched sides. He joined Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David Souter to craft a compromise that would allow states to regulate abortion to some extent\u2014but also uphold the validity of Roe. They got the two more liberal justices, Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, to sign on.\nThough it may have been conceived as a \u201ccompromise,\u201d the 5-to-4 decision in Casey was in fact a reaffirmation of the core claim of Roe\u2014while almost entirely abandoning the legal reasoning. The court decided that it was crucial to recognize the precedent set by Roe, adhering the legal doctrine of stare decisis.\nQuestioning the authority of precedent\nEach of the three newest justices raised questions about this standard in the oral arguments in Dobbs in December.\n\u201cIn thinking about stare decisis, which is obviously the core of this case, how should we be thinking about it?\u201d Barrett asked.\nThe Catholic justice acknowledged the benefits of a system that builds on precedents but argued that \u201cpart of our stare decisis doctrine [is] that it\u2019s not an inexorable command and that there are some circumstances in which overruling is possible.\u201d She rattled off multiple examples, including one civil rights case and one LGBT rights case.\nRoberts seemed to search for a way to modify the previous rulings and perhaps set a different standard for how much abortion could be regulated without actually rejecting a constitutional right to abortion. The attorneys on both sides, however, indicated they thought the case was all or nothing.\n\u201cI read your briefs,\u201d Alito said to the attorney defending Roe and Casey. \u201cYour briefs [say] that the only real options we have are to reaffirm Roe and Casey as they stand or to overrule them in their entirety. You say that \u2018there are no half-measures here.\u2019 Is that a correct understanding of your brief?\u201dShe agreed it was. And Alito, soon after the hearing, started drafting a bold decision overturning Roe and Casey completely.\n\u201cOverruling a precedent is a serious matter. It is not a step that should be taken lightly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn this case, five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the \u2018workability\u2019 of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance.\u201d\nThe decision does not criminalize abortion, but sends the question of regulation back to the states, where voters and legislatures will decide when a woman can and can\u2019t choose to terminate a pregnancy. Some states have passed \u201ctrigger laws\u201d putting restrictions into effect immediately.\n\u201cFor too long, the Roe and Casey decisions have allowed our nation to turn a blind eye to the plight of those who have no voice\u2014to view these lives as a burden instead of a blessing. While this ruling is a significant step toward establishing a true culture of life, the issue of abortion will now be sent back to the states,\u201d said Chelsea Sobolik, director of public policy for the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC).\n\u201cWe must continue to use our time, talent and treasure to protect the preborn, care for their mothers, and advocate for state laws that protect them both.\u201d\nAs the decision released Friday morning, evangelical leaders referred to it as one of the most significant days in the country\u2019s history.\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful to God for this historic day...a day to celebrate life,\u201d said Doug Clay, general superintendent of the Assemblies of God. \u201cNot to gloat, but to rejoice and give thanks to the Lord of life. To continue our efforts in creating a culture of life in the communities we serve.\u201d\nFocus on the Family said, \u201cAfter 50 years of fighting for the unborn, our prayers have been answered.\u201d The Christian Medical and Dental Associations called it a \u201cmuch-needed victory for life and for healthcare.\u201d And the head of the ERLC declared, \u201ca new chapter in the pro-life movement begins.\u201dExperts indicate the ruling will immediately result in a 10 to 15 percent reduction in the number of abortions. Long term, the impact is less clear.\n\u201cWe do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today\u2019s decision,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cWe can only do our job \u2026. We therefore hold the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.\u201d\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n[ This article is also available in \r\n\t\t\tespa\u00f1ol,\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587,\u00a0and \r\n\t\t\t\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587. \t]\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionDobbs v.
