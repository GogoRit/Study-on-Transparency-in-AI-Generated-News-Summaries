Sue Glick said Tuesday, especially in areas where they struggle to receive primary care.Glick, who sponsored the state\u2019s abortion ban, called the bill \u201ca furtherance of the bills we heard this summer.\u201d\u201cWe have individuals who have been referred to their primary physicians or to a primary physicians. Many of them don\u2019t go to the doctor, they can\u2019t afford it or they don\u2019t have access,\u201d she said before the 28-20 vote. \u201cThis is an effort to give care to individuals who need it. It\u2019s an effort to help these individuals have healthy families at their time.\u201d\n\nIf approved by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, pharmacists could be reimbursed for their services to Medicaid patients. They would also be able to object to prescribing the medications under \u201cethical, moral, or religious grounds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge approves new murder charges against man in case of slain Indiana teens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Gov. Eric Holcomb signs proclamation condemning antisemitism while vetoing bill defining it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dangerous tornadoes in Ohio and Indiana, survivors salvage, reflect and prepare for recovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrescriptions, however, cannot last more than six months, and pharmacists cannot prescribe a contraceptive to a woman after twelve months \u201cunless the woman has been seen by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant\u201d in the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you are against abortion, you ought to be for contraceptives,\u201d Republican Sen. Vaneta Becker said before voting for the bill.To opponents who want birth control to only be prescribed by physicians, the bill is \u201cunequivocally lowering the standard of care,\u201d Republican Sen. Tyler Johnson said Tuesday. The emergency medicine doctor also questioned whether access to birth control would decrease abortions in Indiana.State legislatures across the U.S. have introduced at least 30 bills related to birth control access this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy earlier this year signed a law that would allow women in the state to receive some hormonal contraceptives without a prescription. That law goes into effect in May. While the Indiana legislature seeks avenues for contraceptive access, the state\u2019s abortion ban remains on hold pending a decision from the Indiana Supreme Court. Abortion clinic operators filed a lawsuit against the ban, which has not been enforced since September.But the drive for pharmacist-prescribed birth control has cropped up in Indiana before this year \u2014 most recently this summer, when Democratic Rep. Rita Fleming introduced an amendment with such language into a spending bill for low-income women and children that lawmakers advanced alongside the abortion ban.That amendment fell short by one vote.\u201cWe were awfully close then,\u201d Fleming told the Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cI think the good of providing this for women in a safe manner is incredibly important.\u201d\n\nA House committee earlier Tuesday also unanimously approved a bill that could allow long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices, to be transferred between Medicaid patients, something that is currently prohibited.If a Medicaid patient does not return for an insertion appointment after 12 weeks for a device they requested, a medical provider could reissue that contraceptive to a different patient, under the bill, which now goes to the full House.Providers do not typically keep the implant devices on the shelf because of their high costs, leaving \u201cthousands of dollars of these unclaimed,\u201d Democratic Sen. Shelli Yoder, the bill\u2019s author, said Tuesday.\u201cHealth care providers are only able to recoup that cost after it\u2019s inserted or implanted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing they can do is wait. And if they expire, they throw them away.\u201d___This story was first published on April 11, 2023. It was updated on April 14, 2023, to correct the type of access to birth control in the Indiana bill. It would be available with a pharmacist\u2019s prescription, not over the counter.\n\n___Arleigh Rodgers is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
