former vice president Mike Pence speaks during a Celebrate Life Day rally outside the Lincoln Memorial on June 24, 2023 in Washington, DC.\n\nAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Former Vice President Mike Pence said abortion should be banned when a pregnancy is not viable, according to the Associated Press. \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. I don\u2019t apologize for it,\u201d Pence told the AP in a recent interview. \u201cI just have heard so many stories over the years of courageous women and families who were told that their unborn child would not go to term or would not survive. And then they had a healthy pregnancy and a healthy delivery.\u201d\n    \n\n            A Pence adviser told CNN that the former vice president\u2019s position still allows for exceptions for life of the mother.\n    \n\n            Pence strongly opposes abortion and has been perhaps the most outspoken Republican candidate about the issue as many of his GOP rivals have avoided staking out a clear position on abortion.\n    \n\n            During a CNN town hall in Iowa last month, Pence said he supports a federal abortion ban including exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. He also backs federal legislation limiting the procedure and has called on other 2024 GOP candidates to support a 15-week national abortion ban. \n    \n\n            Pence told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer back in March that he would support legislation restricting abortion to six weeks of pregnancy. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law in his state that banned abortion at six weeks while President Donald Trump has suggested the legislation was \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d\n    \n\n            Clinicians use ultrasound results and measure pregnancy hormone levels in order to determine \u201cwhether a pregnancy is viable beyond the first trimester,\u201d according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\n\n            Pregnancies that are deemed unviable regardless of gestational age include tubal ectopic pregnancies and early pregnancy loss, according to the ACOG, which can be deadly for the pregnant person. There are cases, such as \u201cgenetic or isolated structural abnormalities in which essential structures do not develop properly,\u201d in which survivability is poor and patients may choose to end their pregnancies or give birth with palliative care options, the ACOG notes.\n    \n\n            Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, several women have shared their harrowing stories of trying to obtain medically necessary abortions in states that have greatly restricted the procedure. One Texas woman told CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Cohen that she nearly died after her water broke four months into her pregnancy, putting her at high risk for a life-threatening infection. Doctors in Texas had to wait until the woman was sick enough so they felt legally safe to terminate her pregnancy and then bring her to the ICU after she started developing symptoms of sepsis.\n    \n\n            A Christian conservative, Pence views the \u201ccause of life\u201d as \u201cthe calling of our time.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cAs your President, I will always stand for the sanctity of life and I will not rest and I will not relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the land,\u201d he said in his presidential campaign announcement last month.\n    \n\n            Pence has called for more support and resources for women in crisis pregnancies and advocated for adoption as alternatives to abortion.\n    \n\nCNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan and Christian Sierra contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
