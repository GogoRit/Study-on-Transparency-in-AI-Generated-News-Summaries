(AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Saturday blocked two portions of North Carolina\u2019s new abortion law from taking effect while a lawsuit continues. But nearly all of the restrictions approved by the legislature this year, including a near-ban after 12 weeks of pregnancy, aren\u2019t being specifically challenged and remain intact. U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles issued an order halting enforcement of a provision to require surgical abortions that occur after 12 weeks \u2014 those for cases of rape and incest, for example \u2014 be performed only in hospitals, not abortion clinics. That limitation would have otherwise taken effect on Sunday. And in the same preliminary injunction, Eagles extended beyond her temporary decision in June an order preventing enforcement of a rule that doctors must document the existence of a pregnancy within the uterus before prescribing a medication abortion.\n\nShort of successful appeals by Republican legislative leaders defending the laws, the order will remain in effect until a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and a physician who performs abortions challenging the sections are resolved. The lawsuit also seeks to have clarified whether medications can be used during the second trimester to induce labor of a fetus that can\u2019t survive outside the uterus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe litigation doesn\u2019t directly seek to topple the crux of the abortion law enacted in May after GOP legislators overrode Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto. North Carolina had a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks before July 1, when the law scaled it back to 12 weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law, a response to the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down Roe v. Wade, also added new exceptions for abortions through 20 weeks for cases of rape and incest and through 24 weeks for \u201clife-limiting\u201d fetal anomalies. A medical emergency exception also stayed in place. \n\nOn medication abortions, which bill sponsors say also are permitted through 12 weeks of pregnancy, the new law says a physician prescribing an abortion-inducing drug must first \u201cdocument in the woman\u2019s medical chart the ... intrauterine location of the pregnancy.\u201d Eagles wrote the plaintiffs were likely to be successful on their claim that the law is so vague as to subject abortion providers to claims that they broke the law if they can\u2019t locate an embryo through an ultrasound because the pregnancy is so new. \u201cProviders cannot know if medical abortion is authorized at any point through the twelfth week, as the statute explicitly says, or if the procedure is implicitly banned early in pregnancy,\u201d said Eagles, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama.And Eagles wrote the plaintiffs offered \u201cuncontradicted\u201d evidence that procedures for surgical abortions \u2014 also known as procedural abortions \u2014 after 12 weeks of pregnancy are the same as those used for managing miscarriages at that time period. Yet women with miscarriages aren\u2019t required to receive those procedures in the hospital, she added.Republican legislative leaders defending the law in court \u201chave offered no explanation or evidence \u2014 that is, no rational basis \u2014 for this differing treatment,\u201d Eagles said in her order. \n\nAbortion-rights advocates still opposed to the new 12-week restrictions praised Saturday\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe applaud the court\u2019s decision to block a few of the onerous barriers to essential reproductive health care that have no basis in medicine,\u201d said Dr. Beverly Gray, an OB-GYN and a named plaintiff in the case.A spokesperson for Senate leader Phil Berger, one of the legislative defendants, said Saturday that Eagles\u2019 order was still being reviewed.Lawyers for Republican legislative leaders said in court documents in September that the provision requiring the documentation of an intrauterine pregnancy was designed to ensure the pregnancy was not ectopic, which can be dangerous. And \u201cNorth Carolina rationally sought to help ensure the safety of women who may require hospitalization for complications from surgical abortions,\u201d a legal brief from the lawmakers read.\n\nState Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, abortion-rights supporter and 2024 candidate for governor, is officially a lawsuit defendant. But lawyers from his office asked Eagles to block the two provisions, largely agreeing with Planned Parenthood\u2019s arguments. Stein said Saturday he was encouraged by Eagles\u2019 ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
