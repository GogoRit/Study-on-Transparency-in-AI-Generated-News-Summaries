Included below are the four spiciest pro-choice memes, and four spiciest pro-life memes. I\u2019ve given each of them my own spiciness rating and broken down why they fail/succeed on an objective level.\n\nPRO-CHOICE MEMES:\n\n\nIt is incredibly evident that this pro-choice meme is theologically incorrect, and the creator of the meme has little understanding of Christianity. Firstly, it is true that God has granted all human beings free will, which permits individuals to make their own choices, and yet, human beings have the capacity to sin. Simply because one has the capacity to make a choice does not make the action moral. Morality is not subjective. Secondly, God\u2019s word in Jeremiah 1:5 clearly states, \u201cBefore I formed you in your mother\u2019s body, I chose you.\u201d God creates all humans and attributes them innate purpose before they\u2019re born. The \u201cGod\u201d mentioned in this meme is not the true God of Christians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this meme, \u201ccomedian\u201d Morgan Murphy claims that just like having children, abortions are not for everybody, implying that abortions could be for some people (when really, they shouldn\u2019t be for anybody). Some people are not ready to become parents yet, but continue to engage in sexual lifestyles that can result in the creation of children. The murder of their children, by means of abortion, is simply viewed as a collateral damage. Unfortunately, abortion is being promoted as a means of back-up birth control, since sex is no longer viewed as a procreational act. Murphy may be granting that killing is not \u201cfor everybody,\u201d but in doing so, reduces the debate to a question of abortion\u2019s palatability, instead of objective morality. You may not want children, but there are many families that do. Adoption is the loving option. Interestingly, this meme is admitting that abortion eliminates children from society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me introduce you to the epitome of disturbing pro-abortion memes, compliments of\u00a0Dank Pro-Choice Memes\u00a0(which puts out gruesome baby-hating content to their 16,000 followers). The creator is claiming that when a woman faces an unexpected pregnancy, the child in her womb is simply a \u201cmistake\u201d that should be disposed of. The meme also has the effect of discouraging women from mourning the loss of their aborted children, by telling women not to be emotionally attached. This is detrimental to women who have had abortions since grieving is a natural human phenomenon, especially after the loss of a child. The smiling woman in the meme conceals the fact that abortion causes women to suffer psychologically. No human being is a mistake and abortion is not a simple and \u201charmless\u201d procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, morality is objective. If something is believed to be immoral, we, as Christians, have an obligation to fight for justice. This is like saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like slavery, don\u2019t own a slave.\u201d This is not about whether we like a particular human rights abuse or not! The real \u201chard pill to swallow\u201d is accepting that abortion is immoral, not just a matter of preference. Furthermore, women do not need abortion since abortion is never medically necessary. Check out the\u00a0Dublin Declaration on Maternal Healthcare, which is signed by over one thousand medical professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRO-LIFE MEMES:\n\n\nMany pro-abortion advocates completely dismiss basic biology and embryology in order to maintain their positions. Embryology textbooks\u00a0tell us\u00a0that, \u201cIn that fraction of a second when the chromosomes form pairs, the sex of the\u00a0new child will be determined, hereditary characteristics received from each\u00a0parent will be set, and a new life will have begun.\u201d Scientific facts cannot be dismissed and truly prove, time and time again, that fetuses are human beings and are alive. Of course pro-choicers wouldn\u2019t be happy to be reminded of that! For more quotations from medical textbooks stating that life begins at fertilization,\u00a0see this collection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis meme demonstrates how pro-choicers often resort to ad hominem fallacies, or attacks on one\u2019s character. The use of insults instead of valid arguments only creates divisiveness within debates. Identity politics has become incredibly prominent within our society and promotes an ideology in which a person\u2019s identity makes their argument more or less valid. Morality, however, does not magically change depending on one\u2019s identity. Who a pro-lifer is \u2013 whether they\u2019re a good person or not \u2013 is actually irrelevant to the question of whether abortion is right or wrong.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHistorically, the elimination or oppression of a group of people begins first with their dehumanization. By claiming that some humans lack personhood, it becomes much easier to exploit and eliminate them. It is (literally) a slide into darkness and destruction. The truth is that all human beings are persons, regardless of their race, ethnicity, level of development, etc.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll living things are made up of one or more cells; that is a biological fact. The definition of a clump is \u201ca compacted mass or lump of something,\u201d which is incredibly broad and can describe almost everything that is matter. Therefore, if all living things are made up of cells and can be categorized as \u201cclumps,\u201d then all human beings are \u201cclumps of cells.\u201d Moms are just somewhat larger and more complex clumps of cells than fetuses. So what?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated 'Youth Blog' Pages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[PF_SubMenu]\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\nContact\n\nNational Headquarters & Provincial OfficesOttawa Bureau\n\n\n\nResources\n\nGet InvolvedPress RoomStorePastors CornerElectionsRole of GovernmentPolicy & LegislationPetitionPregnancy HelpAbout UsAdopt Your MP\n\n\n\nFundraisers\n\nDonate\nReal Estate For Life\nProducts\nCoins for Life\nChristmas Cakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nNational Headquarters & Provincial OfficesOttawa Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Resources\n\nGet InvolvedPress RoomStorePastors CornerElectionsRole of GovernmentPolicy & LegislationPetitionPregnancy HelpAbout UsAdopt Your MP\n\n\n\nFundraise For CLC\n\nDonate\nReal Estate For Life\nProducts\nCoins for Life\nChristmas Cakes\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Campaign Life Coalition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
