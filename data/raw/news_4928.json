Williams is \u201cpro-life with an asterisk\u201d; Monica Sparks calls herself a \u201cwhole-life Democrat\u201d; and the Rev. Robert L. Schenck was anti-abortion most of his life but has had a change of heart.\nThese answers came in response to a question by moderator Jane Kamensky, the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, on how each of the four panelists at a Thursday discussion on abortion and reproductive rights defined their own positions.\nThe event, hosted by the Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics, aimed to bring together a range of voices to discuss perhaps the most complex and contentious topic of our times \u2014 made even more heated by the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade \u2014 as part of the Civil Disagreement Series. Danielle Allen, Safra Center director and James Bryant Conant\u00a0University Professor, offered an introduction before panelists wrestled with issues that ranged from body autonomy to the definition of personhood.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m talking about abortion, I\u2019m never just talking about abortion,\u201d said Mutcherson, a Rutgers Law School co-dean, bioethics professor, and abortion rights supporter. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all the issues that surround when, why, and how somebody decides to terminate a pregnancy.\u201d\nMore to the point, said the mother of two, she belongs to the reproductive justice movement, which was started in the \u201990s by Black women who were frustrated by mainstream reproductive rights organizations. She said the movement supports three tenets: the right of every woman to decide if she wants to have a baby, her right to decide to not have a baby, and the right \u2014 once she has a child \u2014 to be able to raise that child in a safe and healthy environment without fear of violence.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m talking about abortion, I\u2019m never just talking about abortion. I\u2019m talking about all the issues that surround when, why, and how somebody decides to terminate a pregnancy.\u201d\nKimberly Mutcherson, Rutgers Law School co-dean\nWilliams, a University of West Georgia history professor, is author of the 2015 book \u201cDefenders of the Unborn\u201d about the evolution of the anti-abortion movement. He said he counts himself a backer with an asterisk because he opposes the movement\u2019s current alliance with the political right. As a historian, he said, \u201cI\u2019m particularly interested in why we arrive at particular views.\u201d\nSparks, an anti-abortion (or as she calls herself, \u201cwhole-life\u201d) Democrat, recently won re-election as a Kent County Commissioner in Michigan. While saying that \u201cmore than one in three Democrats are pro-life,\u201d she rejected the simplicity that label may imply. Instead, she asked, \u201cWomb to tomb, how can we support women?\u201d\nSchenck, founder of the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute, recounted how his views on the issue evolved. An evangelical minister, he spent more than 30 years in the anti-abortion movement Operation Rescue. However, a late-in-life doctoral program \u201cchallenged all my assumptions and presumptions,\u201d he said, when his research lead him to seeing similarities between his own activist religious movement and one that supported the Nazis. (Bonhoffer was an influential European moral theologian and Nazi dissident who was ultimately executed by Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.) This discovery led him to believe that such decisions should only be made by the women involved.\nWith Williams\u2019 focus on changes in the anti-abortion movement, the history of the dispute came into the discussion. As a historian, he noted how opponents of abortion rights have increasingly focused on legal strategy, and he decried \u201cthe type of punitive laws that are being passed today.\u201d\nThis history sparked one of the more confrontational exchanges when Sparks cited the early 20th century birth control activist Margaret Sanger. Noting that Sanger supported the racist pseudoscience of eugenics, Sparks described abortion as \u201crooted in racism,\u201d with the goal \u201cto erase the weak and feebleminded, which were African Americans, which were Latinos, which were people of color.\u201d\nMutcherson contested both the depth of this history and its implications. \u201cAbortion didn\u2019t start with Margaret Sanger,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are deep traditions in African societies and in Black American society to terminate pregnancy or \u2018bring on\u2019 periods.\n\u201cThe idea that abortion is this thing that was foisted on Black communities deprives us of our agency,\u201d she argued. \u201cIt deprives us of the ability to be decision-makers, and particularly of Black women to be decision-makers.\u201d\n\u201cPart of respecting the personhood of the woman and her dignity is respecting that a woman knows this question in a way that a man can never know.\u201d\nthe Rev. Robert L. Schenck\nThe discussion shifted to definitions of personhood, often a staple of arguments around abortion. As Williams pointed out, such definitions are tricky. The anti-abortion movement, he noted, says \u201chuman personhood cannot be separated from human life.\u201d\n\n\nMore like this\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nSchlesinger adjusts plans for Roe v.

Making personhood conditional on autonomy, for example, raises questions about the rights of the disabled.\nSparks picked up on this line of reasoning, arguing for the right to life throughout the life cycle: \u201cDo we start with the blastocyst or the embryo or the fetus?\u201d she said. \u201cThe child, the adult, or the senior? All of those are stages of being a human being.\u201d\nBoth Schenck and Mutcherson demurred from restricting a discussion of abortion to any straightforward definition. \u201cPersonhood, for me, doesn\u2019t end with autonomy,\u201d said Schenck. \u201cIt ends with the individual who is closest to the experience.\n\u201cAs a man I will never know this subject \u2014 this experience \u2014 in the way a woman does. Part of respecting the personhood of the woman and her dignity is respecting that a woman knows this question in a way that a man can never know.\u201d Explaining how he \u201chad to leave my fantasy of what it means to be pro-life,\u201d he said, \u201cI have come to the conclusion that \u2026 I have to respect her humanity and dignity in making that decision.\u201d\nMutcherson said the issue is more complex than simply defining personhood. \u201cPregnancy is not neutral,\u201d said the scholar, noting that motherhood has made her \u201cmore pro-choice.\u201d Decrying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe V. Wade, in particular Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s assertion that carrying unwanted children does not constitute a substantial burden, she described the dangers of pregnancy as well as the physiological changes it brings. She also widened the focus to look at the toll unwanted pregnancies as well as the criminalization of abortion take on families and communities.\n\u201cThese are nuanced and complex issues,\u201d she concluded. \u201cWhen we try to flatten these out, we are never going to get good answers.\u201d Sparks added: \u201cIt\u2019s on us to keep having these discussions.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tShare this article\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail article\n\n\n\nPrint/PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might like\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nIt may be neither higher nor intelligence\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReligious scholars examine value, limits of AI\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nBolsonaro, Trump election cases share similarities, but not rulings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFormer Brazilian judge, legal scholar says deciding who can be blocked from running is perilous, fraught\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nDark concerns over upcoming vote in world\u2019s largest democracy\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocial scientists discuss controversial Indian prime minister Modi, rise of right-wing populism, erosion of political journalism\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tArts & Culture\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo what exactly makes Taylor Swift so great?\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExperts weigh in on pop superstar's cultural and financial impact as her tours and albums continue to break records.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCampus & Community\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the first day of Christmas \u2026 we partied like it was 1499\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChurch historian traces celebration\u2019s path from wild revelry through Puritan\u2019s progress to Hallmark holiday\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHealth\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 20-minute workout\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPressed for time?
