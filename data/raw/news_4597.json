Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska introduced the legislation as an amendment to the WHPA, which Democrats\u2019 preferred to codify abortion rights. Both Republicans have supported abortion rights in the past, but voted no on the WHPA.\u00a0\nThe failure of the WHPA was expected.\u00a0 It needed 60 votes to move forward in the evenly divided 100-seat Senate, and received 46 votes in support. An impetus for the push to enshrine abortion rights are two cases before the Supreme Court that could weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that guaranteed abortion rights up to fetal viability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Sen. Patty Murray warned ahead of the WHPA vote that \u201csometime in the next few months, we will, very likely, see the historic reversal of a fundamental right Americans have known for nearly 50 years regarding one of the most personal decisions any individual can make.\u201d\nCollins and Murkowski said in a statement provided to The 19th that the aim of their legislation would be to codify the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in Roe v. Wade and the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, while preserving states\u2019 rights to enact abortion-related statutes that comply with those rulings.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Idaho and Oklahoma expected to be first states to pass Texas-inspired six-week abortion bans\n                \n\n\n\n                    Majority of abortions in 2020 were via medication, new data analysis shows\n                \n\n\n\n                    The 19th Explains: 15-week abortion bans may become law in three states. What does that mean?\n                \n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur legislation would enshrine these important protections into law without undercutting statutes that have been in place for decades and provide basic conscience protections that are relied upon by health care providers who have religious objections to performing abortions,\u201d Collins said.\u00a0\nOne concern that Collins and Murkowski cited is language in the WHPA related to a 1993 law meant to protect religious freedom. The WHPA states that except as specified, it \u201csupersedes and applies to the law of the Federal Government and each State government,\u201d including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That law \u201cprohibits any agency, department or official of the United States or any State (the government) from substantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of religion.\u201d\nMore generally, the two senators said they wanted to debate and revise any \u201cextraneous and over-reaching provisions.\u201d\nLawmakers have different notions of what it means to \u201ccodify Roe v. Wade.\u201d The protections originally established in 1973 have been narrowed in subsequent decades, thanks to Planned Parenthood v. Casey and subsequent abortion rights cases.\u00a0\nDemocrats say the WHPA would codify Roe; but some Republicans, including Collins and Murkowski, say it would go further. Mary Ziegler, an abortion law expert at Florida State University, said that whether the WHPA is broader than Roe is hard to say, but it \u201cdefinitely goes further than what is allowed under current abortion doctrine.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization regarding a 15-week abortion ban.\u00a0\n\u201cThe [WHPA] definitely frames the issue more as a matter of reproductive justice and definitely disallows more restrictions than the current interpretation of Roe/Casey,\u201d Ziegler said.\u00a0\nBut at the same time, she added, \u201cother people have a very different understanding of what Roe is \u2014 and the original Roe decision arguably looks different from what the court has interpreted it to mean.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what congressional action on abortion rights could look like moving forward.\n\u201cAs presently constituted, Congress isn\u2019t going to do anything. That\u2019s pretty clear \u2026 there\u2019s going to be an open question about whether Dobbs changes that,\u201d she added.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden says he supports changing Senate filibuster rules to protect abortion rights\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats in statehouses look to ensure abortion rights as future of Roe v.
