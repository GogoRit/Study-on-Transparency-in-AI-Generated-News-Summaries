(Rebecca S. Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014 Abortion opponents and supporters of reproductive rights filled a State Capitol hearing room Thursday to voice often emotional opinions about three bills that would either ban or further restrict abortion rights.\nThe proposals come as the U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that allowed pregnant women the right to choose whether to end or continue a pregnancy.\nIn reaction, dozens of proposals have been introduced in state legislatures across the country, including in Nebraska, to prepare for the possibility that states will again get to determine whether to permit abortion or not.\n  State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston\u00a0(Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\nThree bills have been introduced in Nebraska:\n\nLegislative Bill 933, the Nebraska Human Life Protection Act. The legislation would ban abortion in the state if Roe v. Wade is overturned, enabling legislation is passed by Congress, or if the U.S. Constitution is amended.\n\n\u00a0The so-called \u201ctrigger\u201d bill was introduced by State Sens. Joni Albrecht of Thurston and Mike Flood of Norfolk. It was picked by the Speaker of the Legislature, Lincoln Sen. Mike Hilgers, as his priority bill. Fifteen other senators have signed on as co-sponsors of LB 933.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for the voiceless, we truly are,\u201d Albrecht said, pointing out that there have been about 200,000 abortions in Nebraska since the Roe ruling.\nOpponents said LB 933 would force many women either\u00a0to obtain expensive abortions out of state or bear children they may not be emotionally or financially able to care for.\u00a0\n\u201cNebraskans should be able to make their own decisions about what\u2019s best for them. This is not a place for government,\u201d said Nyomi Thompson of the Omaha-based group \u201cI Be Black Girl.\u201d\u00a0\n  State Sen. Julie Slama of Sterling\u00a0(Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\n\nLB 781, the Heartbeat Bill. Introduced by Sterling Sen. Julie Slama, it has 22 cosponsors. It has not been prioritized, which means it may not be debated this year.\n\nLB 781 would block an abortion if a fetal heartbeat could be detected by an ultrasound, which Slama said begins six weeks after conception.\u00a0\nA doctor who provided an abortion in violation of LB 781 would be guilty of a felony. That is unlike the Texas \u201cheartbeat\u201d law, which allows citizens to file civil lawsuits against violators.\nSlama distributed pictures of an adult\u2019s heart and that of a fetus at 33 days after contraception, saying the fetal heart was \u201cvery much the heart of a person.\u201d\nOpponents argued that a fetal heart is not fully developed by the sixth week, and the sounds detected are not a true heartbeat. Many women, critics said, are not aware that they are pregnant by the sixth week.\n\n\u00a0LB 1086, the Chemical Abortion Safety Protocol Act. It was introduced by Lincoln Sen. Suzanne Geist and five cosponsors. Kearney Sen. John Lowe has made it his priority bill.\n\n  State Sen. Suzanne Geist of Lincoln\u00a0(Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\nThe bill would ban the mailing of chemical abortion pills, which account for 70% of the abortions in the state, according to Geist.\n\u00a0LB 1086 would ban the use of so-called \u201cmedical\u201d abortions after seven weeks of pregnancy, the point at which Geist said that complications increase and require a doctor visit before they could be dispensed.\nCurrently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows medical abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nDr. Deborah Turner of Planned Parenthood said so-called medical abortions are \u201cincredibly safe and already over-regulated.\u201d She said they provide a private and less invasive end to a pregnancy than a surgical procedure.\u00a0\nThe Judiciary Committee heard several tearful stories from women about their experiences with abortion, both the trauma of ending a pregnancy, and, among supporters of reproductive rights, the relief of postponing raising a family. Religion was cited as a reason to ban abortion, as well as to retain abortion rights.\nThe committee took no action on the three bills after a hearing that continued into the evening. Sen. Steve Lathrop of Omaha, the chairman of the committee, said afterwards that he would confer with sponsors of the two prioritized bills about whether they want to seek a committee vote on their proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPros and cons of banning or restricting abortion aired in marathon public hearing\nby Paul Hammel, Nebraska Examiner February 24, 2022\nPros and cons of banning or restricting abortion aired in marathon public hearing\nby Paul Hammel, Nebraska Examiner February 24, 2022\n LINCOLN \u2014 Abortion opponents and supporters of reproductive rights filled a State Capitol hearing room Thursday to voice often emotional opinions about three bills that would either ban or further restrict abortion rights.\nThe proposals come as the U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to strike down Roe v.
