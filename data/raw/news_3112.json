The problem is, it doesn\u2019t work. Tim Barnett explains why.\n\nTranscript\nOriginal TikTok Video:  As a pro-choice woman, one of my favorite arguments against the idea of life at conception, or life at fertilization, or life before first breath\u00a0is, let\u2019s pretend there are two buildings that are on fire. One is a daycare that has five children in it. Another is a fertility clinic that has hundreds of thousands of fertilized eggs in it. The fire truck arrives, and there\u2019s only one available. Where should they point the water? Where are we sending the water from the hose? To the daycare with five kids? Or to the fertility clinic with hundreds of thousands of potential lives? What are we putting out first? You know we\u2019re putting out the daycare. If you were actually pro-life, that would be an impossible decision. Six lives versus a hundred thousand.\nTim:  I want you to notice something. According to Mrs. K, this hypothetical situation\u2014this moral dilemma\u2014is supposed to be an argument against human life beginning at conception. The problem is, it doesn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s actually pretty easy to see why. Just ask, how does choosing to save one human being over others prove that the ones left behind are not human?\nLet\u2019s just change the illustration. Imagine again that there are two fires, and I have to choose between saving my five-year-old daughter, Allison, and Mrs. K and her family. Guess who I\u2019m saving every time? My daughter. Sorry, Mrs. K. But notice how choosing to save my daughter in this situation doesn\u2019t prove that Mrs. K is not a valuable human being. That\u2019s because my decision doesn\u2019t determine Mrs. K\u2019s status as a human being. Likewise, my decision to choose to save the kids in the daycare over the embryos in the lab doesn\u2019t determine the status of the embryos. Simply put, our behavior doesn\u2019t tell us when life begins. Science does.\nSecond, notice how choosing to save my daughter over Mrs. K and her family doesn\u2019t mean I made the right decision. After all, saving more lives is arguably morally better than saving fewer, but emotions have a way of overriding reason. Clearly, my inconsistency in this decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that Mrs. K is a valuable human being. In the same way, a pro-lifer choosing to save the screaming kids in a burning building over the thousands of embryos in test tubes may be super inconsistent, but their inconsistency doesn\u2019t change the scientific fact that they\u2019re all humans.\nThis hypothetical proves nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\nDoes the Fertility Clinic Illustration Disprove the Value of Human Embryos?\nBioethics\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWANT TO BE A STRONGER AMBASSADOR FOR CHRIST?\n\t\t  Let us equip you through our signature publications, videos, articles, and other mentoring tools.
