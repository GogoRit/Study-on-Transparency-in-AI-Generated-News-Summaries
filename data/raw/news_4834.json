In the mid-1990s, McCorvey had made a public religious and political conversion. She was baptized on television in a backyard swimming pool; she wore overalls and came out beaming. She declared herself newly pro-life and spent the last two decades of her life crusading against the ruling her own case had made possible.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut in \u201cAKA Jane Roe,\u201d premiering Friday on FX, McCorvey turns to the camera with an oxygen tube dangling from her nose and tells director Nick Sweeney, \u201cThis is my deathbed confession.\u201dShe never really supported the antiabortion movement, she tells Sweeney, in a scene filmed in 2017. \u201cI took their money and they put me out in front of the camera and told me what to say, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cIt was all an act?\u201d the director asks.\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cI was good at it, too.\u201dThe revelation comes 60 minutes into the 80-minute documentary. By minute 70, McCorvey has died, succumbing to illness, leaving the people she knew on both sides of the most polarizing cultural debate in America slack-jawed and stunned.McCorvey never had an abortion. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that. By the time the Supreme Court handed down its decision, she\u2019d been forced to carry out her pregnancy; the child had already been adopted.It was her third time giving birth. One daughter had been primarily raised by McCorvey\u2019s mother; McCorvey placed a second child for adoption. McCorvey strung together low-paying jobs in Texas and at various points struggled with substance abuse; she wasn\u2019t prepared to become a parent. Her desperate circumstances were what made her a suitable plaintiff. If she\u2019d had money to travel to a locale where abortion was already legal, her attorneys wouldn\u2019t have been able to argue that the current state-by-state solution placed an impossible burden on their client.AdvertisementSo \u201cRoe\u201d didn\u2019t help McCorvey, but it helped other women like her, and one evening, a Dallas abortion provider named Charlotte Taft was holding a public event at her clinic when a petite, curly-haired woman approached her and said, \u201cI\u2019m Jane Roe.\u201dThe abortion rights movement had the law on its side now. Its supporters didn\u2019t need a public face. \u201cBut she put herself out here to say, here I am,\u201d Taft says in an interview.McCorvey\u2019s life had been hard. Her mother hit her. As a girl, she ran away with a female friend, and when they were caught kissing, she was sent to reform school for punishment. She escaped a marriage to a man who she said abused her and found a long-term partner in Connie Gonzales, but the 1970s and \u201980s weren\u2019t always welcoming times for lesbians. Now, though, there was a movement that saw her as a hero. She was offered speaking engagements \u2014 local ones at first, and then she met famed feminist attorney Gloria Allred, and the engagements became national. She was funny and vulgar and had the wry, weary wit of an early Roseanne Barr. When a reporter at a news conference asked how much money she made as a maid, she shot back: \u201cWhy? Anybody here need a good housecleaning?\u201dAdvertisementIn the early 1990s, a new tenant moved in next to the abortion-related nonprofit where McCorvey volunteered. It was a branch of Operation Rescue, the prominent antiabortion group helmed by a minister who took a special interest in McCorvey.\u201cWhen I think about Norma, one of her yearnings in life was to be good,\u201d says Taft. \u201cBeing the poster child of the pro-choice movement \u2014 she got to be a hero, she got to meet celebrities, she got to have applause and give speeches. But with them, they told her she was finally good.\u201dRob Schenck, then a leader in the antiabortion movement in Washington, D.C., remembered opening an email in 1995 from a professional acquaintance in Texas. Norma McCorvey had been saved, the email said. She would be on their side, now.\u201cI regret now that I thought this,\u201d Schenck says in an interview. \u201cBut Norma was the equivalent of a world-class trophy.\u201dAdvertisementMcCorvey\u2019s conversion was a cinematic story, a morality play, and who you thought was good or bad depended entirely on what you thought of abortion. McCorvey was either bad then became good, or she was good and then became bad.\u201cThe thing is, we want our stories to be tidy,\u201d Taft says. \u201cAnd humans aren\u2019t tidy.\u201dMcCorvey certainly wasn\u2019t.Something that abortion rights activists might not realize: In the 1980s when McCorvey was on their team, she would sometimes call Taft late at night. Usually she\u2019d been drinking, sometimes she was introspective, occasionally she seemed to regret the starring role she\u2019d played in America\u2019s morality play. \u201cThe playgrounds are all empty, and it\u2019s because of me,\u201d Taft says McCorvey said one night.Something that antiabortion activists didn\u2019t realize: In the 1990s, when McCorvey was on their team, she would still tell evangelical leaders that she supported a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy in the first trimester \u2014 the procedure that accounts for the majority of all abortions. \u201cWe managed that by saying she\u2019s a brand-new convert; she needs time to mature in her faith and in her understanding of the pro-life ethic,\u201d Schenck says. \u201cWe thought, just give her a little time and she\u2019ll mature.\u201d Eventually, they got her to stop saying it publicly, but they didn\u2019t know whether she\u2019d actually changed her mind.AdvertisementThe activists on both sides who knew her found her charming \u2014  and found her maddening. She rewrote stories into fantasies. She could be mercenary, and always needed money. Maybe the best word for her was \u201csurvivor,\u201d multiple people decided independently. After a rough life, she\u2019d now do whatever it took to survive. At one point in the FX documentary, she chuckles that she\u2019s always \u201clooking out for Norma\u2019s salvation and Norma\u2019s [butt].\u201d At times, she seemed to be exactly what their movements needed. At times, she seemed hellbent on complicating an issue that they found to be absolutely simple and clear.This made her the perfect Jane Roe, the perfect figurehead of the abortion issue, because it wasn\u2019t simple for a lot of people. Antiabortion activists with accidental pregnancies suddenly find themselves calling Planned Parenthood, convinced that their situations are exceptional. Pro-choice women who terminate pregnancies can move through unexpected grief. At various points in her life, Norma McCorvey represented the issue in all of its complexities and untidiness.This also made McCorvey a difficult Jane Roe, because movements want their heroes to be pure.AdvertisementNick Sweeney wasn\u2019t sure that McCorvey would agree to his documentary. She\u2019d been turning down interview requests for years or demanding payment, which is journalistically unethical (Sweeney says he gave her a \u201cmodest licensing fee\u201d to use her family photos and personal video footage in the documentary).He thinks she agreed to participate because she knew she was nearing the end of her life and because Sweeney hadn\u2019t approached her with an agenda. He didn\u2019t want to make an abortion rights or antiabortion film; he simply wanted to know about her as a person. \u201cThere\u2019s a temptation to reduce her to something like a trophy or an emblem, but it\u2019s important to know there was someone who was a real person,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cPeople on all sides wanted her to be the person that suited their aims, and in a lot of ways, she just wanted to be herself.\u201dDoes Sweeney believe that McCorvey was telling the truth in her bombshell revelation that she was just faking it for the antiabortion movement? Yes. But does he also believe that she had experienced a sincere religious conversion? Yes.AdvertisementDid he ask her whether she regretted anything about her choices over the past 20 years? Yes. And what did she say?\u201cShe said no.\u201dThere\u2019s a scene in the documentary when the clip of McCorvey\u2019s revelation is played back for all of the other participants, one by one. Robert Schenck, Charlotte Taft, Gloria Allred \u2014 they all hear McCorvey say, \u201cI took their money and they put me out in front of the camera and told me what to say.\u201dOne by one, they all gasp.\u201cIt felt like such a betrayal,\u201d Taft says in an interview. \u201cThe stakes were so high.\u201d\u201cSeeing it was shocking to me,\u201d Schenck says in an interview. \u201cNot because of what it revealed about her, but what it revealed about me and the movement. She forced me to be honest with myself.\u201dThe antiabortion movement had used her, he thinks now. They\u2019d used her image, and her story, and her regret, and they\u2019d shaved off all the rough edges, turning her into a perfect poster girl instead of a person.AdvertisementWhich is so easy for people to do with abortion. Get so caught up in scrambling for the moral high ground, you forget about the women underfoot.In recent years, Schenck has had his own reckoning with abortion. He used to be an absolutist: no exceptions, no excuses, no justifications. In recent years, his position has softened; he understands why some people\u2019s life circumstances might make abortion the best option for them. And he\u2019s grown disillusioned about the public debate around abortion.\u201cRealizing how much the political leaders on both sides had exploited the issue \u2014 that seemed to be very problematic, morally and ethically,\u201d Schenck says. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to celebrate abortion; I still think it represents a tragedy and a failure. But I think the human realities around it make it understandable.\u201dSo, what to make of Norma McCorvey? Maybe she works best as a symbol of a different kind of struggle \u2014 personal, not political. It\u2019s the struggle that comes with trying to reconcile our untidy, doubt-ridden, trophy-seeking inner monologues with the roles we inhabit in America\u2019s morality play.In the end, McCorvey seemed to make a sort of peace with the legacy of Jane Roe. \u201cWomen have been having abortions for thousands of years,\u201d she says near the end of the documentary.\u201cIf it\u2019s just the woman\u2019s choice, and she chooses to have an abortion, then it should be safe. Roe v. Wade helped save people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.
