Prove it\nChurches, parishioners urged to 'walk with moms' during bishops' year-of-service initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBy Linda Reeves\t\t\t\t\n\n  Photographer: Via respectlifemiami.org/walking-with-moms This is the archdiocesan logo for Walking with Moms in Need, an effort to get parishes and parishioners involved, or at least much more aware of, the Respect Life Ministry and the resources available to help women and families in need. \nMIAMI | If a pregnant mom showed up\r\nat your parish asking for help, would anyone know where to send her? What about\r\na whole family in need? Where they could get baby food or diapers? Counseling?\r\nParenting classes?\nMaking sure every parishioner knows\r\nthe answers \u2014 or at least where to find them \u2014 is the reason the archdiocese's\u00a0Respect Life Ministry has launched a local version of the U.S. bishops' \"Walking\r\nwith Moms in Need: A Year of Service\" initiative.\nTied to the 25th anniversary of\u00a0Evangelium Vitae, St. John Paul II\u2019s encyclical on the sanctity of life, Walking\r\nwith Moms in Need began here in July and will conclude Oct. 31, 2021. The finale\r\ncelebration will coincide with the National Congreso\r\npro Vida, or Congress for Life, to be hosted by the archdiocese\r\nOct. 29-31, 2021, and coordinated by the Secretariat of Parish Life.\n\u201cEvery\r\nabortion is a tragedy,\u201d said Archbishop Thomas Wenski. \u201cWe need to make sure\r\nthat no woman feels that abortion, which is a bad choice, is their only choice.\r\nWomen who resort to abortions come from all walks of life, all races, all\r\nreligions, but for the most part, women who have abortions are poor, young and\r\nunmarried.\u201d \n  Photographer: ANA RODRIGUEZ-SOTO | FC Rebecca Brady was appointed archdiocesan director of the Respect Life Office in November 2019. She is now spearheading the ministry's Walking with Moms initiative, which runs through October 2021. \nRebecca Brady, director of the archdiocese\u2019s Respect Life Ministry,\r\nis heading up the local Walking with Moms in Need. \u201cFirst and foremost,\r\nthis is a pastoral initiative,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt has nothing to do with\r\npolitics. It is not about fundraising. It is a year of service. Helping moms in\r\nneed is something everyone can get on board with.\u201d\nThe goal is to get pastors and parishioners\r\ninvolved in respect life efforts by assessing, expanding, sharing and\r\ncommunicating resources where women can get help. If all goes well, parishioners\r\nwill be better informed so they will know where to refer women in need. But\r\nwomen sitting in the pews will also know that they can turn to their Catholic church for help and a friend. \n\u201cWe are asking participants to look at what\r\ntheir parish has and what the parish is doing and to look in the community and\r\nsee what is available for moms,\u201d said Brady. \u201cDoctors, hospitals, maternity\r\nhomes, housing programs, counseling.\u201d\nAll\r\nthe information collected by the parishes will be organized and added to their\r\nlocal database. The parish information will also be shared and added to the archdiocese\u2019s\r\ninventory of resources to better serve people seeking help. \nA\r\nmajor aspect of the project is identifying any gaps in services so they can be\r\naddressed. Team members are asked to keep their eyes open for any programs,\r\nservices, ministries that are missing in their communities, and then brainstorm\r\nand develop a solution.\n\u00a0\n'NUDGE\r\nFROM THE TOP'\n\u201cWe\r\nare excited about this initiative,\u201d said Angela Curatalo, assistant director of\r\nthe archdiocese\u2019s Respect Life Ministry. \u201cThe reason I am so excited is because\r\nit is basically exactly what we have been hoping for in our meetings, a little\r\nnudge from the top to get our parishes more active.\u201d\nBrady said parishes can participate\r\nin the initiative in their own unique way and at their own pace. Those who want\r\na step-by-step approach to the year of service can follow a guideline her\r\noffice developed, with a schedule, timelines and phases. \nPhase one, happening now, asks pastors\r\nto announce Walking with Moms in Need at the pulpit and through parish\r\ncommunications. Parishes are also asked to form teams and identify a team\r\nleader. \nAt Nativity Parish in Hollywood, that would be Mary\r\nVrancik, who has been involved in respect life ministry over 20 years,\r\nincluding as her parish's respect life representative for the past five years.\r\nIn all, 75% of the parishes in the archdiocese have a representative.\n\u201cWe already have our core team together and had our first\r\nmeeting last week,\u201d Vrancik told the Florida Catholic in August. \u201cWe are\r\nlooking forward to the many possibilities that this initiative may provide for\r\nwomen in need.\u201d\nPastors are also encouraged to talk\r\nto their flocks about \"Evangelium Vitae\" or \"The\r\nGospel of Life.\" The encyclical, the 11th of St. John Paul's pontificate,\r\nforthrightly condemns abortion and euthanasia, the major attacks on human life\r\nat its beginning and end.\nIn September, the second phase began.\r\nParish teams are being asked to complete an inventory of their community and parish\r\nresources. They also are invited to visit the Respect\r\nLife Pregnancy Help Center nearest to their parish, to meet the staff\r\nand learn about the various programs offered. \u00a0\nThe\r\narchdiocese\u2019s five centers are located in various sections of Broward and Miami-Dade\r\ncounties. They offer numerous services including pregnancy testing, ultrasound,\r\npost-abortion healing, counseling and material assistance. For two years, staff\r\nat the centers walk side-by-side with moms who have chosen life, assisting with\r\nany needs. \nBrady said the centers have continued\r\nto operate during the pandemic in creative ways, providing resources, pregnancy\r\nservices and educational and parenting programs online in English, Spanish and Creole.\nThe centers provide beacons of hope\r\nfor many in the archdiocese, an area where the number of abortions continues to\r\nrise.\n\u00a0\n \n'NUMBERS ARE HIGH'\n\u201cFlorida\u2019s numbers are high,\u201d said Brady.\r\nShe noted that in 2019, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties had a combined 25,000\r\nrecorded abortions, according to a health agency statistic. \nShe noted that nearly 70% of her\r\nclients are over the age of 30 and about 30% percent are in their 20s. Nearly\r\n40% are Hispanic, 36% are Haitian and 15% are African American. Nearly 30% are\r\nCatholic and 50% are Protestant.\nIn November, phase three begins, with\r\nparish teams finalizing their work and providing their findings to the Respect\r\nLife Office. The following month, phase four, parishes are scheduled to present\r\ntheir plans for addressing any gaps that they find in services, ministries or\r\ninitiatives. Those plans will be launched in January 2021 and evaluated in July\r\n2021 as part of phases five and six. \nThe project ends at phase seven, when\r\nparticipants will come together at the Congreso pro\r\nVida in Miami to reflect on their hard work and accomplishments in\r\nsupport of human life. \nEdwar\u00a0Aguilera, a member of the Knights of Columbus Council\r\n16980 and a parishioner at San Isidro in Pompano Beach, volunteered to help his pastor, Father Wilfredo Contreras, with the year of\r\nservice. \nHe and his family volunteered, he said, because \u201cwe love life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nTo learn more about Walking with\r\nMoms in Need, contact the archdiocese's Respect Life Ministry at 954-981-2922,\r\nor 954-981-2901, or visit www.respectlifemiami.org/walking-with-moms.\nFor information on the Pregnancy Help Centers of the archdiocese, go to: www.pregnancyhelp.me; or call the nearest center:\nSouth Broward: 954-963-2229\nCentral Broward: 954-565-0229\nNorth Broward: 954-977-7769\nSouth Dade: 305-273-8507\nNorth Dade: 305-653-2921 and 786-452-0266.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature NewsCatholic school eighth graders explore faith and science at Greater Love ConferenceArt at St. Joseph ChurchLivestream: Requiem Mass for the ForgottenCheers to beer and Lenten reflectionsCabrini: patroness of the indomitableA \u2018Lions\u2019 Den\u2019 for the Mighty LionsArchbishop honored for his dedication to Catholic education6 Pierced Hearts Sisters profess final vowsHomiliesWe invoke the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete to stand beside youYou are helping to bring people to JesusEl testimonio del cristiano hoy es dar testimonio de la esperanza \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nArchdiocese of Miami\n9401 Biscayne Boulevard\nMiami Shores, FL 33138\n(305) 757-6241\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nCatholic Links\nNews Widget\nJob Openings\nRSS - Archdiocesan News\nE-Library\nWebmail\n\n\nFAQs\nLooking for a Church?\nMarriage Preparation\nSacramental Records & Certificates\nAnnulment Information\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by  | E-system\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply\n\n\n\n\n"
