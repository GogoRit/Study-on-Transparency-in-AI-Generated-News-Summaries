Malta is the only other EU country to have an outright ban on abortion.\nSpeaking to MaltaToday, a spokesperson for the commissioner said the speech delivered in the European Parliament was explicitly focused on Poland\u2019s situation. \u201cThe debate, as well as its focus, was decided by the European Parliament,\u201d they said.\nBut Dalli\u2019s reluctance to speak out on the issue of abortion in Malta has been criticised by Women Health and More (Wham), a website focusing on the lives of women living on the Maltese islands.\nAuthor and activist Emily Galea commended Dalli\u2019s speech on Poland in response to the country\u2019s recent enforcement of a proposed Bill that bars women with non-viable pregnancies from seeking terminations. However, Galea highlighted that Dalli\u2019s \u201cown home country\u201d Malta was omitted despite having more restrictive laws.\n\u201cWhile this speech is indeed both commendable and truthful, one cannot help but notice the complete omission of the Commissioner\u2019s home country, Malta, which is the last remaining member of the European Union with a blanket ban on abortion,\u201d Galea wrote.\nRecently, Poland put into place\u00a0a proposed bill that bans up to 98% of abortions \u2013 with the country having some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.\nDalli\u2019s speech focussed on the importance of sexual health and the right to receive high quality, reproductive health care.\nHowever, Malta currently has the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. Unlike in Poland, Maltese women cannot even seek a safe abortion in rape or incest cases.\n\u201cUnlike Poland, in Malta, even when the pregnant person's life is at risk, one cannot obtain an abortion, legally. In fact, there is no circumstance under which a person can legally seek an abortion in Malta,\u201d Galea pointed out. She added that women in Malta continue to order medical abortion pills online and struggle to seek surgical abortions overseas.\nOver 200 women reached out to British charity Abortion Support Network since it expanded its services to Malta in 2019. \u201cWe helped 75 people in 2019 and 126 people in 2020. The increase was likely due to an increased awareness of ASN and the help we provide and the added pressure Covid-19 placed on people in Malta with unintended or non-viable pregnancies,\u201d founder Mara Clarke said.\nMalta\u2019s first Family Planning Advisory Service (FPAS), launched in August 2020, also saw 203 contact them in their first six months to seek out advice on reproductive options.\nStill, at a European level there is continued radio silence with Dalli\u2019s spokesperson saying the Commission\u2019s position on sexual and reproductive health and rights remains unchanged, from a legal perspective. \u201cLegislation in this area is up to the Member States. Strong women\u2019s rights are an asset and an achievement the whole of Europe must be proud of. We should push forward, not backwards,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nLast year, Dalli reaffirmed her \u201ccommitment to ensuring women and girls have access to health and medical care, including sexual reproductive rights.\u201d However, she\u00a0later stated that\u00a0she would respect member states in their choice of abortion legislation.\nAt a European level, Malta\u2019s newest Labour MEP, Cyrus Engerer, has been the only politician to break ranks with traditional abdications surrounding support for reproductive rights. Back in 2020, Engerer supported a resolution condemning the new restrictive abortion laws in Poland. He was the only Maltese MEP to vote for the resolution.\nMore recently, Nationalist MEPs David Case and Robert Metsola did not vote on a resolution which assesses the progress made in women\u2019s rights over the past 25 years. The reason for this, they told this newspaper, was because they said that as always, they voted against any amendments calling for abortion to be mandated in member states.\nThe Maltese public itself remains unconvinced. A survey by MaltaToday back in 2019 found that 97.2% disagreed with unrestricted abortion at whatever stage of the pregnancy, with only 1.4% favouring complete liberalisation.\nA majority of 45.5% disagreed with abortion if the mother\u2019s life is in danger, and 78.5% also disagreeing with abortion in the case of rape. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of a content series called Ewropej.
