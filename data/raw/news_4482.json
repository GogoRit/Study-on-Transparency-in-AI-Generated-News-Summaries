continent, we would never have heard the phrase: \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights are Human Rights.\u201d\n\n\nBy\nLisa Levenstein\n\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When First Lady Hillary Clinton took the stage at the Beijing Women\u2019s\u00a0Conference\u00a0of 1995, the world\u00a0listened.\u00a0She spoke\u00a0with\u00a0passion and\u00a0purpose:\u00a0\u201cIf there is one message\u00a0that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights\u00a0are women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s rights are human rights once and\u00a0for all.\u201d It was a triumphant moment for Clinton, whose speech drew praise from across the aisles\u00a0and around the world.\u00a0Yet the media failed to\u00a0tell the world\u00a0that\u00a0women\u00a0in the global South\u00a0were the ones who\u00a0had invented the slogan.\u00a0Few people heard about\u00a0the international\u00a0feminist\u00a0networks who had been educating government officials and spreading ideas about women\u2019s human rights long before Clinton\u00a0became interested in the topic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nClinton never claimed she\u00a0invented the phrase \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are\u00a0human rights,\u201d but many people assumed that\u00a0she had. The First Lady\u2019s speech\u00a0attracted the public\u2019s attention. The international feminist movement did not.\u00a0Yet without\u00a0the\u00a0ingenuity of feminists from the\u00a0Global South and\u00a0networks of committed activists on every continent who had spent years theorizing about\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0human rights,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0would never have\u00a0spoken those words.\u00a0It was\u00a0the\u00a0global\u00a0feminist\u00a0movement\u00a0that\u00a0brought\u00a0the\u00a0campaign for women\u2019s human rights\u00a0to the United Nations,\u00a0to\u00a0nonprofit organizations like Amnesty International, and to\u00a0ordinary\u00a0people\u00a0around the world.\u00a0They even taught the First Lady herself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe\u00a0long\u00a0history of advocacy around \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d features activists from the\u00a0Global South and women of color in the US.\u00a0For instance, in 1945,\u00a0at the founding of the United Nations,\u00a0Latin American feminists\u00a0played a critical role in trying to advance \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d into the category of human rights.\u00a0And after World War II,\u00a0when\u00a0the US\u00a0Black freedom movement often deployed human rights arguments,\u00a0Pauli Murray, the attorney, feminist, and civil rights advocate, argued specifically that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are a part of human rights.\u201d\u00a0What changed at the end of the 20th\u00a0century\u00a0was that\u00a0a far-reaching and expanding global feminist\u00a0movement\u00a0began to collectively use the idea that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d to advocate for change at the United Nations and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\nThat movement\u00a0gained steam\u00a0in\u00a0the 1980s, when women\u00a0in different parts of\u00a0the world\u00a0began to question why the majority of human rights advocacy focused on male political prisoners.\u00a0A 1981 issue of\u00a0Human Rights Quarterly\u00a0featured a collection of articles that explored\u00a0what it would mean to\u00a0advance\u00a0calls\u00a0for\u00a0women\u2019s human rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOn the grassroots level, when women\u00a0involved in anti-dictatorship efforts in Latin American countries joined human rights movements that focused on male political prisoners, they also began to ask why these movements did not address violations against women. Mothers who had organized during Argentina\u2019s \u201cDirty Wars\u201d to demand the return of their children and grandchildren (whom the regime had \u201cdisappeared\u201d) started to assert their rights as humans rather than as women.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, women from different parts of the world began to criticize the male bias implicit in definitions of war crimes that excluded rape and other forms of sexual torture.\u00a0Some\u00a0asked why women who had been \u201ctrafficked\u201d did not qualify for the refugee status and asylum typically given to male victims of human rights violations.\nWhat changed at the end of the 20th\u00a0century\u00a0was that\u00a0a far-reaching and expanding global feminist\u00a0movement\u00a0began to collectively use the idea that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d to advocate for change at the United Nations and beyond.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nAll of these efforts\u00a0critiqued\u00a0narrow male-centered definitions\u00a0of human rights\u00a0and called for a broadening of\u00a0the\u00a0framework\u00a0to include violations against women.\u00a0And as\u00a0women in these movements\u00a0increasingly\u00a0exchanged ideas with one another\u00a0at\u00a0meetings and conferences held in different parts of the world,\u00a0they gave\u00a0support and momentum to\u00a0one another.\u00a0They were part of a\u00a0burgeoning\u00a0global\u00a0feminist movement\u00a0that was\u00a0propelled in large part by\u00a0activists\u00a0from the global South. During the 1980s and early 1990s, that movement\u00a0grew\u00a0in strength\u00a0through events such as the\u00a01985 UN World Conference on Women in Nairobi.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe slogan \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d first appeared\u00a0on many activists\u2019 radar around 1988, seven years before Clinton took the stage in Beijing. A Filipino women\u2019s coalition called Gabriela launched a \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights are Human Rights\u201d campaign as part of their protests against the dictatorship of Ferdinand E. Marcos. The slogan caught on, not because it came out of left field, but because it perfectly encapsulated an ongoing conversation\u00a0among women human rights advocates from different countries.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt took a worldwide movement to promote the slogan and bring it to the international stage.\u00a0In the early 1990s, at several\u00a0international\u00a0meetings and conferences, women from around the world plotted\u00a0a\u00a0collective\u00a0strategy\u00a0to\u00a0advance\u00a0women\u2019s human rights\u00a0at\u00a0the local and\u00a0global\u00a0levels.\u00a0A key funder and organizer was\u00a0longtime US feminist\u00a0Charlotte Bunch\u2019s Center for Women\u2019s Global Leadership\u00a0(CWGL) at\u00a0Rutgers University.\u00a0Bunch and her network\u00a0recognized that feminists from the\u00a0Global South were leaders in the advocacy work around women\u2019s human rights. She\u00a0also\u00a0knew that there\u00a0had been a long\u00a0history of US feminists acting imperiously on the global stage, dictating strategy and assuming they know best.\u00a0The\u00a0CWGL\u00a0sought to enact a different form of global\u00a0feminist\u00a0interaction, one in which US activists listened and learned from people\u00a0from other nations\u00a0and in which representative from countries around the world plotted strategy together as activists in \u201cparallel movements.\u201d\nThe lesson for today is clear:\u00a0political figures rarely dream up or enact radical ideas\u00a0alone.\nGender-based violence was\u00a0experienced by women in every single country\u00a0yet\u00a0not taken seriously as a human rights violation\u00a0anywhere, these women\u2019s rights advocates observed.\u00a0They recognized that\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0individual\u00a0experiences varied considerably, both\u00a0within and among nations. Yet\u00a0they\u00a0concluded\u00a0that everyone would benefit from\u00a0a push to\u00a0expand\u00a0international human rights frameworks to include\u00a0women\u2019s experiences.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, this burgeoning women\u2019s human rights\u00a0network\u00a0joined several others international feminist campaigns in setting their sights on\u00a0the United Nations.\u00a0Journalists expected feminist activity to resemble the sit-ins and demonstrations of the 1960s and 1970s. They were not prepared to cover it happening at the UN.\u00a0Yet in 1993, at the\u00a0Second UN World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna,\u00a0feminists\u00a0organized a high-profile tribunal on women\u2019s human rights violations, lobbied government delegates, and presented a petition signed by half a million people from 124 countries, demanding recognition of women\u2019s rights as human rights. They left the conference triumphant.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe\u00a0Vienna declaration\u00a0affirmed \u201cthe human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights.\" The document also named gender-based violence as a human rights violation.\u00a0Activists from different parts of the world used the declaration to lobby their governments for new laws and policies that would protect those most vulnerable. And they built on the gains they won in Vienna when they negotiated the Platform for Action for the Beijing Women\u2019s Conference of 1995.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Hillary Clinton took the stage\u00a0in Beijing, she\u00a0had consulted feminist activists and\u00a0toured countries in the global South\u00a0where she\u00a0had\u00a0learned about women\u2019s human rights\u00a0struggles.\u00a0Her speech at the Beijing Conference\u00a0did not come out of thin air. It\u00a0reflected what she had learned from this\u00a0thriving\u00a0global feminist movement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe lesson for today is clear:\u00a0political figures rarely dream up or enact radical ideas\u00a0alone.\u00a0Social movements\u00a0must seize every opportunity\u00a0to school\u00a0government\u00a0representatives\u00a0and\u00a0pressure\u00a0them to\u00a0promote\u00a0shared prosperity and\u00a0justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa\u00a0Levenstein\u00a0is the\u00a0director of Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the University of North Carolina Greensboro and the author of\u00a0They Didn\u2019t See Us Coming: The Hidden History of Feminism in the Nineties.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal\nGender & Sexuality\nWomen, Peace, and Security\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Articles\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 21, 2020\n Under attack from all sides, where does feminism go next?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBy\nPardis Mahdavi\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n Pandemic patriarchy: regulation, access, and governance in reproductive rights\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBy\nAlison Brysk & Miguel Fuentes Carreno\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 8, 2020\n Between progress and backlash: protecting sexual rights and reproductive rights\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBy\nSofia Gruskin\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 21, 2020\n Business impacts on trans rights demand attention and action\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBy\nNora Mardirossian\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1/5\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with us\ninfo@openglobalrights.org\n\n\nSign-up for our weekly newsletter\nSubscribe\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nFran\u00e7ais\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nFran\u00e7ais\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "
