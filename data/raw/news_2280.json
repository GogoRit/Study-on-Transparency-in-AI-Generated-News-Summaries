Laura Lanese (R-Grove City).\n\n\n\n\n\nA national group of conservatives that oppose capital punishment has made Ohio the 14th state for its campaign to repeal of the death penalty. The group says the time is right to come to Ohio, which has been one of the leading states for executions.Republicans with Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty say it\u2019s inconsistent with pro-life views, is too expensive, and is a failed government policy riddled with errors and inefficiency.There are 35 Ohioans who\u2019ve signed onto the group Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, including former Gov. Bob Taft, former attorney general Jim Petro and former congressman Pat Tiberi. But only three are current officeholders who could propose or vote on a repeal.One is Rep. Laura Lanese (R-Grove City), the House majority whip.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to hear from the leadership at this state, and I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s got to start. And I do hear it among my colleagues. I just saw one of them in here a few minutes ago who\u2019s very passionate about this issue, and I do think we will see more conservatives getting on board with this,\" Lanese said.And longtime GOP strategist Michael Hartley said those who are and will be involved eventually are influential.\u201cI\u2019ll go to war with those folks any damn day, because all we do and have done is win in Ohio.\u201dRepublican House Speaker Larry Householder has said the cost has made him less supportive of the death penalty, and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has delayed executions since taking office, saying finding drugs are a problem.But prosecutors strongly oppose repeal and have argued against measures that would pull back on the death penalty, including a bill that would ban it for people who have severe mental illnesses.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nGovernment/Politics\nExecutionsDeath Penalty\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Kasler\n\n\n                \n                    Contact Karen at 614-578-6375 or at kkasler@statehousenews.org.\n                \n            \n\n\n                        See stories by Karen Kasler\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment/Politics\n\n\nCreator Of Death Penalty Law Says Ohio Won't Have Another Execution\n\n\n\nKaren Kasler\n\n\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a killer put to death in Ohio in 18 months.
