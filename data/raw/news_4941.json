Wade essentially invented a constitutional right to abortion-on-demand in the United States.1\nSince then, millions of Americans have sought to restore protection for the right to life of every person in culture and law.\nMany state laws are protecting women and restoring the dignity of both mother and child in policy; and every day, thousands of pregnancy centers are helping women and children facing difficult circumstances.\nRoughly half of Americans now identify themselves as \u201cpro-life,\u201d and strong majorities support commonsense policies to protect women from abortion\u2019s harms.\nNow more than ever, we need to explain why every human has the right to life and how abortion victimizes both mother and child.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be prepared to talk with friends, family, and co-workers about why we can protect the basic right to life and ensure the dignity and safety of all women.\nPeople should know and share the answers to these questions:\n1. What\u2019s wrong with abortion?\n2. What are the consequences of abortion?\n3. Why should government protect life?\nOffering Hope and Compassion to Women and Children \nEach year, millions of women face an unplanned pregnancy and difficult decisions under trying circumstances. Throughout the country, approximately 2,700 pregnancy centers provide counseling, information, and lifeaffirming options to women.2 Pregnancy centers offer:\n\nMedical Services. Many pregnancy centers provide free or low-cost pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, prenatal services, and referrals for pregnant women.\nInformation and Counseling. Pregnancy centers offer accurate information about pregnancy and fetal development, present available options, and empower women to make the best decision for their own health and their child\u2019s.\nContinued Support. In addition to meeting immediate needs through material support, pregnancy centers offer parenting classes and support groups for expectant mothers and fathers. Many centers also offer adoption information and referrals for birthmothers looking for loving families for their children.\n\n\nENDNOTES:\n1. Having invented a constitutional right to abortion, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade prohibited state restrictions on abortion before viability. While the Court stated that a State could impose restrictions on that right after viability, it provided that the State must permit exceptions designed to protect a woman\u2019s health. However, in Doe v. Bolton, a companion case that the Court said should \u201cbe read together\u201d with Roe, the Court defined this exception so broadly that it essentially swallows the rule. As Clarke Forsythe, Senior Counsel at Americans United for Life explains, \u201cWhere Roe prevented any prohibition on abortion before viability, the Doe \u2018health\u2019 exception eliminated prohibitions after viability as well.\u201d Clarke D. Forsythe, Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe v. Wade (New York: 2013).\n2. \u201cPregnancy Centers Stand the Test of Time,\u201d The Charlotte Lozier Institute, 2020.\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with abortion? \n\n    1 min read\n \n\n\n\nMore Questions & Answers\n\n    5 min read\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
