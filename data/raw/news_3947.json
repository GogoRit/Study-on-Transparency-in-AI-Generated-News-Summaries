I'm speaking at @thenewschool about how we can transform our world by achieving gender equality and ending discrimination against women &amp; girls.  https://t.co/iSK14y2sZz\n\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, UN Secretary-General\n\nantonioguterres\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women\u2019s inequality should shame us all in the 21st. \u00a0Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid\u201d, he said.\u00a0\nFor the UN chief, gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls remains an overwhelming injustice across the globe.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom the ridiculing of women as hysterical or hormonal, to the routine judgement of women based on their looks; from the myths and taboos that surround women\u2019s natural bodily functions, to mansplaining and victim-blaming \u2013 misogyny is everywhere\u201d, he said.\u00a0\nAt the heart of the issue is power, as male-dominated power structures underpin everything from national economies, to political systems, to the corporate world and beyond.\u00a0 But he pointed\u00a0out that patriarchy\u00a0also has\u00a0an impact on men and boys, trapping them in rigid gender stereotypes, declaring that a systemic change is long overdue.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential. \u00a0Our power structures have evolved gradually over thousands of years. One further evolution is long overdue. The 21st century must be the century of women\u2019s equality\u201d, he said.\u00a0\nMan-made problems, \u2018human-led solutions\u2019 \u00a0\nDismantling gender inequality will transform the world, the UN chief stated, and is critical to solving intractable global challenges such as conflict and violence, and the climate crisis.\u00a0\nIt also will help close the digital divide, lead to fairer globalization, and increase political representation.\u00a0\n\u201cThe opportunity of man-made problems \u2013 and I choose these words deliberately \u2013 is that they have human-led solutions\u201d, he said. \u00a0\nAs the UN turns 75 this year, the global body is taking greater action to support women\u2019s rights, he continued.\u00a0\n\n\n\nUNAMID/Albert Gonz\u00e1lez Farran\n\nUNAMID, in collaboration with the North Darfur Committee on Women, organised an open day session on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security (file photo).\n\nLast month marked the start of a Decade of Action to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at building peaceful, prosperous and inclusive societies while also safeguarding the planet.\u00a0\nThe Decade of Action is aimed at transforming institutions and structures, broadening inclusion and driving sustainability.\u00a0\n\"Repealing laws that discriminate against women and girls; increasing protection against violence; closing the gap in girls\u2019 education and digital technology; guaranteeing full access to sexual and reproductive health services and rights, and ending the gender pay gap are just some of the areas we are targeting\", he said.\nOn a personal level, the Secretary-General pledged to deepen his commitment to highlighting and supporting gender equality over the remainder of his mandate.\u00a0\nHe will take steps at the global level, such as advocating for change among governments that have discriminatory laws on their books, and within the UN, by strengthening work on the links between violence against women and international peace and security. \u00a0\n\u2018Transform and redistribute power\u2019\u00a0\n\u201cGender equality is a question of power; power that has been jealously guarded by men for millennia. \u00a0It is about an abuse of power that is damaging our communities, our economies, our environment, our relationships and our health\", said Mr. Guterres.\u00a0\n\u201cWe must urgently transform and redistribute power, if we are to safeguard our future and our planet. That is why all men should support women\u2019s rights and gender equality. And that is why I am a proud feminist\u201d.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENDER EQUALITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              LISTEN TO UN RADIO\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Equal rights cannot wait\u2019 on International Day of Women in Multilateralism \n\n\nAmid COVID-19 constraints, UN women\u2019s commission meets to push gender equality forward    \n\n\nUN Women\u2019s feminist roadmap tackles triple crises of jobs, care and climate\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nUN human rights chief warns of women\u2019s rights complacency25 February 2020\nWomenMichelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has warned against complacency on women\u2019s rights at an event marking the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration, a landmark agenda for the empowerment of women.\n\n\n\nTeenage girls' education, \u2018an indispensable foundation\u2019 for achieving development goals: Guterres11 February 2020\nWomenPromoting education for adolescent girls is an \u201cindispensable foundation for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d,\u00a0 Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres declared at the launch event of the Drive for 5\u00a0education initiative at UN Headquarters on Tuesday, hosted by the Irish Mission to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
