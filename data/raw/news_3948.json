UNICEF Snowflake Ball awardAfter the election, Perry was presented with the\u00a0Humanitarian Award at the 2016 UNICEF Snowflake Ball. Unsurprisingly, Clinton presented Perry with the prestigious award, and gave an emotional speech detailing Perry\u2019s passionate personality.\u00a0\u201cI have seen Katy\u2019s commitment to the causes that she believes in firsthand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to spend time with her. I know how deeply she cares about making our world a better place. She is serious about understanding the complex problems we face, and pulling people together to solve them. We need champions like Katy now more than ever. Her passion, her energy, and, yes, her voice \u2014 louder than a lion!\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerry later took to Instagram to thank her \u201chero\u201d Clinton, writing,\u00a0\u201cHillary helped me see that we\u2019re all in this together, no matter where we come from, what color we are, or what status and education we have or don\u2019t have. Hillary lit a fire inside of me that burns brighter and brighter every day, and that fire will NEVER be put out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSlowly, I am coming down from the beautiful cloud that was Tuesday night\u2019s @UNICEF Snowflake Ball. First and foremost, I am incredibly grateful to have received the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award from my hero @HillaryClinton. This award will be a constant reminder to get out of my bubble and back into the field to shine a light on issues that matter most, especially to illuminate the plight of vulnerable children who are living without basic human needs and rights. This honor is a starting line, not a finish line, for me, and I am excited for where my new ambition and purpose leads me! I was profoundly moved and thoroughly surprised when Hillary showed up to give me this award. I broke down and wept watching her take the stage. The last time I was in NYC was for Election Night. I left covered in a blanket of sadness and despair because for me, and I imagine others, the results triggered a lot of dormant fears and emotions to the surface. I feared that we were not ever going to see the light of justice or fairness. I felt vulnerable, confused and frightened like a child. From the outside it probably looks as though I\u2019ve always had a \u201cvoice.\u201d Truth is, I have never had one like I have found in the past year. I have a found a new voice, a more determined voice. I grew up sheltered, suppressed and kept silent for fear of giving the wrong answer. I would reveal my poor education. Or I was just scared. Hillary helped me see that we\u2019re all in this together, no matter where we come from, what color we are, or what status and education we have or don\u2019t have. Hillary lit a fire inside of me that burns brighter and brighter every day, and that fire will NEVER be put out. Feelings of despair still comes in waves, but now more than ever I am MOTIVATED to fight against social injustice and to promote equality and kindness as best I know how, through my art and influence. I am continually inspired by her strength and how she continues to rise like the Phoenix she is, every time. It\u2019s funny, sometimes people who disagree with me just say, \u201cShut up and sing.\u201d Boy, will I do so in a whole new way\u2026 next year.

Donation to Planned ParenthoodIn November 2016, a few days after Donald Trump\u2019s election,\u00a0Perry donated $10,000 to Planned Parenthood and encouraged her fans to support the organization after fearing that government funding will be taken from them.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood educated me on my body and my reproductive health, so that I could focus on my dreams and using my voice until I knew the timing was right for me to make a plan to have a family,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cSince then, I have been able to focus wholeheartedly on bringing messages of strength and becoming a voice for others. Without this education, I may have had a different life path.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s time to turn words into action??There are so many steps to take, but my first vow is to support organizations that may have their funding support taken from them in the future by the government. I am making a public donation to Planned Parenthood for the teenage me who made several visits to first a clinic in Santa Barbara and then Los Angeles, CA to educate myself on my sexual health, a subject I had little to no information on because of my sheltered upbringing. I had no idea how things worked down there, and had no idea how to make a plan for them. Planned Parenthood educated me on my body and my reproductive health, so that I could focus on my dreams and using my voice until I knew the timing was right for me to make a plan to have a family. Since then, I have been able to focus wholeheartedly on bringing messages of strength and becoming a voice for others. Without this education, I may have had a different life path. That is just my experience, but I know Planned Parenthood\u2019s broader range of services can sometimes be the only medical support low-income families ever see. I know what it\u2019s like to need help. I came from a lower- to middle-class family and never grew up with the option of health insurance. I remember having 13 cavities as a teenager, and the best option my parents could come up with was to try and take me to Mexico because we couldn\u2019t afford anything in California. I am grateful for and stand in support of Planned Parenthood for giving Katheryn Hudson the knowledge to plan, and for continuing to be a haven for women to learn all options for their future. Now, more than ever, we all need to protect and create safe places for each other. I hope I can help inspire you to make a gift as well, and become a member and an ally.

Campaign to raise money after\u00a0California wildfiresOver the past few years, California has been devastated by a number of wildfires, including one in Perry\u2019s hometown of Santa Barbara. In response,\u00a0Perry organized the \u201cWitness: Coming Home \u2013 A Benefit for the Community: Our Neighbors, Our Heroes\u201d concert, which donated all ticket proceeds to benefit victims Thomas Fires and subsequent flooding in the area.\u00a0\nA few months later, when more fires blazed through different areas of the Golden State,\u00a0Trump tweeted that \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests\u201d by authorities was the reason for several deadly fires. \u201cRemedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d he threatened.\nPerry quickly refuted, calling the tweet a \u201cheartless response.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis is an absolutely heartless response.

However, in January, she dined with Democratic hopeful and New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. According to\u00a0People, she chatted with Bloomberg about her candidate and policy beliefs.\u00a0\n11.

Their Royal Highnesses met supporters of The British Asian Trust, including @katyperry and @natasha.poonawalla. During the reception, it was announced that @katyperry will be a new Ambassador for the Trust\u2019s Children\u2019s Protection Fund for India.
