FACE Act now a key focus of Biden Justice Department since Roe v. Wade was overturned   \n      By\n      Brianna Herlihy  Fox News  \n      Published\n       September 26, 2022 3:45pm EDT  Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email  close      Video FBI arrests Catholic leader  Former assistant FBI director Chris Swecker on criticism facing the FBI and DOJ following an arrest of a Catholic leader. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, or FACE Act, is a law that ensures Americans' access to pro-life and pro-choice reproductive health services, and is now at the center of legal discussion since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u00a0    The FACE Act makes it a federal crime, with potentially steep fines and jail time, to use or threaten to use force to \"injure, intimidate, or interfere\" with a person seeking reproductive health services, or with a person\u00a0lawfully trying to exercise the\u00a0First Amendment\u00a0right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship. The FACE Act also prohibits intentional property damage to a facility providing reproductive health services or a place of religious worship.\u00a0The measure, passed by Congress with 17 Republican votes and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, was introduced in reaction to the increasing violence in pro-life protests in the 1990s.\u00a0  With the overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, the FACE Act is now a key focus for President Biden's Justice Department.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  On July 12, DOJ launched a reproductive rights task force, led by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, which the department says was formed to \"identify ways to protect access to reproductive health care in anticipation of the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey,\" according to DOJ.\"The FACE Act is not about abortions,\" DOJ states on its website. \"The statute protects all patients, providers, and facilities that provide reproductive health services, including pro-life pregnancy counseling services and any other pregnancy support facility providing reproductive health care.\"  When a draft opinion of the Dobbs case, which ultimately decided the overturning of Roe, was leaked, several crisis pregnancy centers across the country were attacked. Many of those attacks included arson and vandalism and were carried out by a radical pro-choice group called \"Jane\u2019s Revenge.\"\u00a0  Graffiti and red paint found at Washington, D.C., Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center.
