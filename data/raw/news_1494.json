Ron DeSantis (R) signed a bill Thursday that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, after the legislature passed the bill earlier in the day. The measure cuts off what has become a critical access point for abortion care in the South since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.ArrowRightDeSantis signed the bill late at night and released a photo just after 11 p.m. \u2014 a sharp contrast to how he celebrated a 15-week ban on abortion last spring with speeches and live media coverage at a church. The quiet passage underscored DeSantis\u2019s reluctance to talk about the bill as he tours the country touting other legislative achievements.The bill passed 70-40 in the House and was approved in the state Senate earlier this month. DeSantis wrote on Twitter Thursday night that it \u201cexpands pro-life protections and devotes resources to help young mothers and families.\u201dAdvertisementFlorida\u2019s existing law allows abortions up to 15 weeks of pregnancy, a time period in which the vast majority of abortions take place. The six-week ban \u2014 which includes exceptions for rape, incest, medical emergencies and \u201cfatal fetal abnormalities\u201d \u2014 outlaws the procedure before many people know they\u2019re pregnant.Patients from across the South have been traveling to Florida for abortions since the Supreme Court decision in June, which triggered abortion bans across the region. Over 82,000 people got abortions in Florida in 2022, more than almost any other state. Nearly 7,000 of those traveled to Florida from other states, a 38 percent increase from the year before.Those numbers have been an impetus for stricter restrictions, Florida Republicans say.\u201cI\u2019m going to fight,\u201d state Rep. David Borrero (R), one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said on the House floor Thursday afternoon. \u201cAs many sessions as it takes, as many votes as it takes \u2026 until every single person from the moment of conception to the casket has constitutional rights.\u201dAdvertisementBecause so many people live in Florida, a six-week ban there could put intense strain on clinics in states where abortion is still legal.\u201cIf people from Florida are now going to be flooding into the Carolinas and Illinois \u2026 that is taking spots that Alabamians and Mississippians need right now,\u201d said Robin Marty, director of operations at West Alabama Women\u2019s Center, a clinic that provided abortions before Roe was overturned. \u201cThat\u2019s a crisis that\u2019s going to ripple all across the entire country.\u201dThe bill will take effect 30 days after one of a few scenarios occurs \u2014 most likely, 30 days after the state Supreme Court issues a decision on the constitutionality of the 15-week ban that is already in effect. That decision is expected within the coming months.Abortion rights advocates described the ban as a political maneuver by DeSantis, who is widely expected to run for president and will need to win over the Republican base in a primary.Advertisement\u201cThese political moves have devastating consequences,\u201d said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates. \u201cGov. DeSantis\u2019s audition for the presidency doesn\u2019t define us as Floridians.\u201dIn a statement issued soon after the Florida ban passed, the White House emphasized that voters have come out again and again to support abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\u201cDespite this, Republican elected officials continue their work to dismantle our fundamental freedoms, including through attempts to ban abortion nationwide,\u201d said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, adding that the ban \u201cflies in the face of fundamental freedoms.\u201dMeanwhile, antiabortion groups celebrated the legislation as a major victory. The Florida ban passed less than 24 hours after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled to uphold strict restrictions on mifepristone, a key abortion drug.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s a great day to be pro-life,\u201d said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, a national antiabortion group. \u201cLife is a winning issue.\u201dFlorida Democrats have argued fiercely against the legislation, staging several protests in the lead-up to the bill \u2014 including one that ended in several top Democrats being arrested.House Democrats introduced dozens of amendments during debate, including one that would have added an exception for several pregnancy complications that have been impacted by abortion bans. The amendment would have explicitly allowed doctors to induce or perform an abortion if a woman presents at a hospital with pre-viable PPROM, a life-threatening health condition that can lead to severe hemorrhage or infection.Rep. Robin Bartleman (D), who proposed the amendment, discussed a story published in The Washington Post earlier this week about Anya Cook and Shanae-Smith Cunningham, who experienced pre-viable PPROM and were turned away from the hospital because of the state\u2019s abortion ban.Advertisement\u201cIf you know about Anya and Shanae who live in Broward county, you know that Anya had a much wanted pregnancy,\u201d Bartleman said. When her water broke at 15 weeks, she added, \u201cthe hospital decided to send her home and she delivered the fetus in a toilet, alone. She lost so much blood.\u201dRep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka (R), who sponsored the six-week ban, said the medical exception already included in the bill covered that kind of situation.\u201cIf anyone tells you differently, they are misinformed,\u201d she said, before the amendment was defeated by a vote of 33-80.The legislation also provides $25 million in annual state funding for crisis pregnancy centers, organizations that aim to dissuade people from getting abortions.Despite their baby\u2019s fatal fetal abnormality, the Dorbert family was denied the possibility of terminating their pregnancy early. (Video: Drea Cornejo/The Washington Post)Earlier this year, Florida Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book (D) and other Democrats had hoped that Senate President Kathleen Passidomo \u2014 a moderate Republican lawyer from Naples \u2014 would prevent the state from moving toward a six-week ban. Passidomo has appeared hesitant to implement a strict abortion ban, initially saying Florida should not go further on abortion until its state Supreme Court issues a ruling on the 15-week ban.AdvertisementBut Passidomo came around to the legislation earlier this year, voicing her public support for the six-week ban soon after it was introduced in early March \u2014 a move that shocked both Republicans and Democrats in Tallahassee.\u201cThis is what happens when you have no backbone to stand up to the scary GOP guy running for president,\u201d Book said in an interview with The Post.Abortion rights advocates say the Florida ban has flown largely under the radar, usurped by coverage of the abortion pill ruling issued by a Texas judge that withdrew FDA approval of mifepristone. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a temporary order late Wednesday allowing mifepristone to remain on the market, but reinstating strict restrictions on the drug.\u201cAll the blue states and coasts have focused on, \u2018Oh God, what if we lose access to mifepristone,\u2019\u201d said Marty, the director at the Alabama clinic. \u201cThey\u2019ve forgotten that the last safe place in the South is about to go down.\u201dAdvertisementAs the debate progressed on Thursday morning, the House temporarily called a recess when protesters tossed small round stickers down from the public gallery and then gathered outside the room yelling \u201cHands off our bodies!\u201d and \u201cStand up, fight back!\u201d Nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers joined the three dozen protesters in the lobby to chant and sing \u201cLean on Me,\u201d a song that has become an anthem for abortion bill protesters in Florida.The recess ended after 15 minutes. House Speaker Paul Renner said \u201cI appreciate all the passionate debate,\u201d but \u201cinside the chamber, I treat it like a courtroom, and we will have decorum.\u201dAfter the vote, abortion rights activists stood across the street from the capitol. Demonstrators said the outcome of the vote was inevitable, given the GOP\u2019s supermajority in the legislature. But they also said they feel more energized now because of all the support they\u2019ve been getting in the nearly two weeks that they\u2019ve been demonstrating in Tallahassee.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more thumbs up and support from people driving by,\u201d said Rhea Das, a woman\u2019s health nurse from Tallahassee. \u201cMost Floridians, and most Americans, don\u2019t want these kind of laws.\u201dHannah Knowles contributed to this report.U.S. abortion access, reproductive rightsTracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v.
