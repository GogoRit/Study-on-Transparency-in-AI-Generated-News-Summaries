And we wish that was a joke.In a recently released interview about the film, \"Unpregnant\" (possibly a shot at the pro-life film \"Unplanned\"?), one of the screenplay writers said she wanted to \u201cwrite an abortion road trip story [to] bring some humor and make people more comfortable with the subject of abortion.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf we could pull it\u00a0off,\u201d the other screenplay writer\u00a0added, \u201cit would be really something special.\u201d\u00a0Well, they did pull it off, and it will run on HBO Max this September.Abortion is not hilarious\u00a0The plot of \"Unpregnant\"\u00a0centers on a teenage girl who finds herself unexpectedly with child. Rather than turn to her \u201cJesus Freak\u201d Catholic parents for help, she decides on her own to obtain an abortion. But, there\u2019s a catch. The abortion laws in her state make that all but impossible. So, she enlists a friend to accompany her on the 1,000-mile journey to the nearest abortion clinic. Their escapades on the road make up the bulk of the movie, with the film documenting the \u201chysterical\u201d trials and tribulations of two teenagers traveling to end the life of a baby.When we first saw the trailer for \"Unpregnant,\" we both were shocked. Even those who support abortion have generally not treated it as a laughing matter. Most people have had the moral decency to recognize the seriousness of the decision for the woman, if not for the unborn child. \u201cSafe, legal, and rare\u201d was the pro-abortion rallying cry. Not \u201csafe, legal, and hilarious.\u201dUntil now. And one of the screenwriters explained why that is in the same interview.\u201cThis very easily could be a horror story,\u201d she said, \u201cbut laughter is a way of taking away fear and shame.\u201d'Greater level of desperation': As COVID-19 rages, pregnancy centers see surge in demandIn other words, the makers of this film want us to forget about the human tragedy at the heart of abortion. They want to mask it with laughter and wacky hijinks, so we don\u2019t see the heartbreak, tears, grief\u00a0and guilt that plague so many post-abortive women, not to mention the loss of innocent life that accompanies every abortion.For the people behind this film and many people within the pro-abortion movement, \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d is no longer the goal. The new goal is \u201csafe, legal, and no big deal.\u201d They don\u2019t want abortion to be a morally serious issue. They want it to have the moral weight of a dental filling.What\u00a0Christians should do in responseAs Christians, we can\u2019t just take this in stride. Human life matters. Human dignity matters. And Hollywood trying to undermine the sanctity of life with cheap comedic tricks should turn our stomachs. None of us would tolerate a movie that used laughter to try to erase the horror of racism or anti-Semitism. And we can\u2019t tolerate this movie either.So, what do we do?First, pray. Not just generically, but specifically \u2014 for the screenplay writers and producers behind \"Unpregnant\"; for the young women involved in the filming of the movie; for all the people who have backed it financially or are helping market the film. Pray for all of them. Ask Jesus to have mercy on them and change their hearts. Pray also for all who watch this movie. Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to them just how horrible its goals are. Above all, pray for every teenage girl and every woman who feels she has no choice but an abortion. Pray that no woman has to find out the hard way that abortion is no laughing matter.After you pray, act. Do something concrete to help your local crisis pregnancy center, maternity home\u00a0or homeless shelter. Invite a single mom to dinner or offer to babysit her kids from time to time. Ask around and find out if there\u2019s a woman in your parish or community who needs help navigating the\u00a0difficulties of an unexpected pregnancy. In some way, big or small, be the friend a woman in crisis needs.RNC 2020: Ordinary Americans make a positive, optimistic case for Trump and AmericaLastly, if you have a subscription to HBO or HBO Max, cancel it. Then, email the chief executive of Warner Bros., Ann Sarnoff, and tell her\u00a0why you are cancelling (support@hbo.com).Laughter is good. It can be food for the soul. Likewise, seeing the humor in a situation can keep us sane. But there is no humor to see in abortion, only sorrow. And to laugh in the face of such a loss \u2014 of life, of motherhood, of hope \u2014 isn\u2019t keeping our sanity; it\u2019s losing our humanity.Father Dave Pivonka, TOR, is the\u00a0president of Franciscan University of Steubenville.
