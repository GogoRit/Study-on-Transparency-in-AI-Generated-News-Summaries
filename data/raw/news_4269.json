Now, the reported\u00a0closing of maternity wards\u00a0in\u00a0Islamabad, the capital, and\u00a0Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa\u00a0province could exacerbate an already grim situation, especially for impoverished women and girls.\nLike other countries, Pakistan faces huge challenges providing essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health care, while responding to the pandemic. But restricting access to health care for already marginalized Pakistani women is not the answer.\nPakistani authorities say they need to close the maternity wards because staff members have been diagnosed with Covid-19. The\u00a0gynecology ward in Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar was closed\u00a0after 29 staff members tested positive for the virus.\nInstead of closing maternity wards and cutting off access to essential health care, the Pakistan government needs to do a better job protecting healthcare workers.\nAs of May 7, more than\u00a0500 Pakistani healthcare workers have been infected with Covid-19. Instead of doing everything possible to ensure protection for healthcare workers, Pakistani authorities have taken legal action and threatened force to silence doctors and medical workers expressing their concerns.\nOn April 6,\u00a0police arrested 150 doctors and medical staff\u00a0in the city of Quetta, Balochistan for protesting the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) after 13 doctors in the city tested positive for Covid-19. All those arrested were subsequently released. Doctors in Punjab province have been on symbolic\u00a0hunger strikes\u00a0to draw attention to their demands of PPE. The Punjab government responded with\u00a0police carrying batons.\nSexual and\u00a0reproductive healthcare, including pregnancy and birth care, is always an essential service and the staff providing this care are essential workers. They need to be kept safe through provision of adequate PPE and other measures such as creating conditions to isolate any patients with Covid-19 symptoms to prevent exposure for uninfected staff and patients.\nThe Pakistan government should act quickly to ensure that necessary measures are taken to safely reopen maternity wards and that sexual and reproductive health services continue to be available throughout the pandemic in a manner that is safe for both patients and staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAsia Pakistan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nCoronavirus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nHealth Women's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 27, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nAfghanistan: Women with Disabilities Face Systemic Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 22, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nProtecting Garment Workers During COVID-19 Crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 29, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cA Nightmare for Everyone\u201d\n\n\nThe Health Crisis in Pakistan\u2019s Prisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 27, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nAfghanistan: Women with Disabilities Face Systemic Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 22, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nProtecting Garment Workers During COVID-19 Crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
