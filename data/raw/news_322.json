Last year, several US states passed new laws which human rights watchdog Amnesty International claims \u201ceffectively ban abortion\u201d. As a result, writer-director Eliza Hittman\u2019s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which follows a 17-year-old\u2019s harrowing, soul-sapping attempt to terminate a pregnancy in New York City, feels even more timely than usual. Hittman\u2019s powerfully acted drama is an urgent message transmitted with the utmost simplicity.\n\u2018Never Rarely Sometimes Always\u2019 is available to stream online now. Credit: Alamy\nAutumn (played by newcomer Sidney Flanigan) is a high schooler living in Pennsylvania. Her life is fairly average: she goes to school and performs at talent shows; she eats at diners with her loving mum and domineering, traditional dad; she works at a grocery store with her cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), where both must put up with the creepy voyeurism of their manager. A bout of morning sickness compels her to see their small town family doctor, who administers a store bought pregnancy test. In an exchange with the doctor lies one of the film\u2019s welcome moments of levity, a prime example of Hittman\u2019s witty dialogue: \u201cA negative result could be a positive,\u201d she tells Autumn, \u201cbut a positive is always positive.\u201d The confusion is irrelevant, she\u2019s pregnant.\nUnfortunately for Autumn, Pennsylvania State law forbids minors under the age of 18 from proceeding with an abortion without their parents\u2019 consent. For obvious reasons, Autumn wants to keep this very personal matter to herself. So, with a bundle of dollar bills lifted from the store till and a hefty suitcase full of clothes, she and her cousin catch the Greyhound bus down to NYC, in one of the few states where parental consent is not required.\nAdvertisement Eliza Hittman\u2019s third feature is an emotional watch. Credit: Alamy\nThis is Hittman\u2019s third feature and is infused throughout with her \u2018less-is-more\u2019 mantra. Similarly to fellow festival darling First Cow, by director Kelly Reichardt, the film basks in bittersweet stillness. Cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart\u2019s camera knows exactly where the story\u2019s most emotional moments lie \u2013 and she expertly finds poignancy in the touch of hands, or in lingering on Flanigan\u2019s subtle expressions for just a few seconds too long. Parts of Hittman\u2019s last feature, Beach Rats, succumbed to melodrama, but Never Rarely Sometimes Always is never less than perfectly measured \u2013 a testament to her increasing maturity as a filmmaker.\nBolstering the emotional potency is the abundance of compassion in Hittman\u2019s directorial approach. No unnecessary judgement is bestowed on Autumn, and sex is treated with the normality it deserves. What the film does seek to highlight, via cat calls, unsettlingly forced kisses, and apathetic strangers, is the dangerously patriarchal world in which Autumn and Skylar live. But, again, Hittman\u2019s statement is not dogmatic, and it allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions. The strength of Hittman\u2019s voice adds weight to the stylistically sublime visuals. Never Rarely Sometimes Always is a beautiful, emotionally draining movie that\u2019s up there with 2020\u2019s best.\nDetails\n\nDirector: Eliza Hittman\nStarring: Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\nReleased: May 13 (VOD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMore Stories:\n\n\n\n \n\nGame Reviews\n\u2018Alone In The Dark\u2019 review: more trouble than terror in this disappointing reboot\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nReviews\n\u2018Queen of Tears\u2019 review: this K-drama as troubled as its tale of marriage\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTV Reviews\n\u2018Sand Land: The Series\u2019 review: one final masterpiece from \u2018Dragon Ball\u2019 creator Akira Toriyama\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLive Reviews\nRaye live in London: a simply sensational, career-defining performance\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nReviews\n\u2018Chicken Nugget\u2019 review: snack on this absurdist, bite-sized treat\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAlbum Reviews\nJustin Timberlake \u2013 \u2018Everything I Thought It Was\u2019 review: sullied superstar gets trapped in the typical\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Stories:\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next since 1952.\n\nJoin Our Mailing List\nSign Up Now >\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Notice\nTerms of Use\nDiscount Codes\nAdvertise\nContact\n\n\n\n    When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n  \n\n    \u00a9 2024 NME is part of NME Networks.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
