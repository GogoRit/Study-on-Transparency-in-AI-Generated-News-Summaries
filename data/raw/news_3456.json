Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization becomes law, we will enter a post\u2013Roe v. Wade world in which the laws governing abortion will be legislatively decided in 50 states.In the short term, at least, the abortion debate will become even more inflamed than it has been. Overturning Roe, after all, would be a profound change not just in the law but in many people\u2019s lives, shattering the assumption of millions of Americans that they have a constitutional right to an abortion.This doesn\u2019t mean Roe was correct. For the reasons Alito lays out, I believe that Roe was a terribly misguided decision, and that a wiser course would have been for the issue of abortion to have been given a democratic outlet, allowing even the losers \u201cthe satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight,\u201d in the words of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Instead, for nearly half a century, Roe has been the law of the land. But even those who would welcome its undoing should acknowledge that its reversal could convulse the nation.From the December 2019 issue: The dishonesty of the abortion debateIf we are going to debate abortion in every state, given how fractured and angry America is today, we need caution and epistemic humility to guide our approach.We can start by acknowledging the inescapable ambiguities in this staggeringly complicated moral question. No matter one\u2019s position on abortion, each of us should recognize that those who hold views different from our own have some valid points, and that the positions we embrace raise complicated issues. That realization alone should lead us to engage in this debate with a little more tolerance and a bit less certitude.Many of those on the pro-life side exhibit a gap between the rhetoric they employ and the conclusions they actually seem to draw. In the 1990s, I had an exchange, via fax, with a pro-life thinker. During our dialogue, I pressed him on what he believed, morally speaking, should be the legal penalty for a woman who has an abortion and a doctor who performs one.My point was a simple one: If he believed, as he claimed, that an abortion even moments after conception is the killing of an innocent child\u2014that the fetus, from the instant of conception, is a human being deserving of all the moral and political rights granted to your neighbor next door\u2014then the act ought to be treated, if not as murder, at least as manslaughter. Surely, given what my interlocutor considered to be the gravity of the offense, fining the doctor and taking no action against the mother would be morally incongruent. He was understandably uncomfortable with this line of questioning, unwilling to go to the places his premises led. When it comes to abortion, few people are.Humane pro-life advocates respond that while an abortion is the taking of a human life, the woman having the abortion has been misled by our degraded culture into denying the humanity of the child. She is a victim of misinformation; she can\u2019t be held accountable for what she doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to this argument, but I think it ultimately falls short. In other contexts, insisting that people who committed atrocities because they truly believed the people against whom they were committing atrocities were less than human should be let off the hook doesn\u2019t carry the day. I\u2019m struggling to understand why it would in this context.There are other complicating matters. For example, about half of all fertilized eggs are aborted spontaneously\u2014that is, result in miscarriage\u2014usually before the woman knows she is pregnant. Focus on the Family, an influential Christian ministry, is emphatic: \u201cHuman life begins at fertilization.\u201d Does this mean that when a fertilized egg is spontaneously aborted, it is comparable\u2014biologically, morally, ethically, or in any other way\u2014to when a 2-year-old child dies? If not, why not? There\u2019s also the matter of those who are pro-life and contend that abortion is the killing of an innocent human being but allow for exceptions in the case of rape or incest. That is an understandable impulse but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a logically sustainable one.The pro-choice side, for its part, seldom focuses on late-term abortions. Let\u2019s grant that late-term abortions are very rare. But the question remains: Is there any point during gestation when pro-choice advocates would say \u201cslow down\u201d or \u201cstop\u201d\u2014and if so, on what grounds? Or do they believe, in principle, that aborting a child up to the point of delivery is a defensible and justifiable act; that an abortion procedure is, ethically speaking, the same as removing an appendix? If not, are those who are pro-choice willing to say, as do most Americans, that the procedure gets more ethically problematic the further along in a pregnancy?Read: When a right becomes a privilegePlenty of people who consider themselves pro-choice have over the years put on their refrigerator door sonograms of the baby they are expecting. That tells us something. So does biology. The human embryo is a human organism, with the genetic makeup of a human being. \u201cThe argument, in which thoughtful people differ, is about the moral significance and hence the proper legal status of life in its early stages,\u201d as the columnist George Will put it.These are not \u201cgotcha questions\u201d; they are ones I have struggled with for as long as I\u2019ve thought through where I stand on abortion, and I\u2019ve tried to remain open to corrections in my thinking. I\u2019m not comfortable with those who are unwilling to grant any concessions to the other side or acknowledge difficulties inherent in their own position. But I\u2019m not comfortable with my own position, either\u2014thinking about abortion taking place on a continuum, and troubled by abortions, particularly later in pregnancy, as the child develops.The question I can\u2019t answer is where the moral inflection point is, when the fetus starts to have claims of its own, including the right to life. Does it depend on fetal development? If so, what aspect of fetal development? Brain waves? Feeling pain? Dreaming? The development of the spine? Viability outside the womb? Something else? Any line I might draw seems to me entirely arbitrary and capricious.Because of that, I consider myself pro-life, but with caveats. My inability to identify a clear demarcation point\u2014when a fetus becomes a person\u2014argues for erring on the side of protecting the unborn. But it\u2019s a prudential judgment, hardly a certain one.At the same time, even if one believes that the moral needle ought to lean in the direction of protecting the unborn from abortion, that doesn\u2019t mean one should be indifferent to the enormous burden on the woman who is carrying the child and seeks an abortion, including women who discover that their unborn child has severe birth defects. Nor does it mean that all of us who are disturbed by abortion believe it is the equivalent of killing a child after birth. In this respect, my view is similar to that of some Jewish authorities, who hold that until delivery, a fetus is considered a part of the mother\u2019s body, although it does possess certain characteristics of a person and has value. But an early-term abortion is not equivalent to killing a young child. (Many of those who hold this position base their views in part on Exodus 21, in which a miscarriage that results from men fighting and pushing a pregnant woman is punished by a fine, but the person responsible for the miscarriage is not tried for murder.)\u201cThere is not the slightest recognition on either side that abortion might be at the limits of our empirical and moral knowledge,\u201d the columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in 1985. \u201cThe problem starts with an awesome mystery: the transformation of two soulless cells into a living human being. That leads to an insoluble empirical question: How and exactly when does that occur? On that, in turn, hangs the moral issue: What are the claims of the entity undergoing that transformation?\u201dThat strikes me as right; with abortion, we\u2019re dealing with an awesome mystery and insoluble empirical questions. Which means that rather than hurling invective at one another and caricaturing those with whom we disagree, we should try to understand their views, acknowledge our limitations, and even show a touch of grace and empathy. In this nation, riven and pulsating with hate, that\u2019s not the direction the debate is most likely to take. But that doesn\u2019t excuse us from trying.Peter Wehner is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a senior fellow at the Trinity Forum."
