He said: \u201cWe have two parties with starkly different views on abortion, so that is going to be a major issue in the presidential campaign.\u201d\u2018An unprecedented wave of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws\u2019This week marks the 47th anniversary of the landmark US supreme court case Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion in the US and has been a target for conservatives since the religious right adopted abortion as a cause in the late 1970s.Hundreds of thousands of anti-abortion protesters will also gather in Washington DC on 24 January for the March for Life, the nation\u2019s largest anti-abortion protest. And the evidence of recent years shows they are successfully rolling back access to abortion across the US.View image in fullscreenAnti-abortion activists protest outside the supreme court during the March for Life in Washington DC, on 18 January 2019. Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Luis Maga\u00f1a/APLast year saw an unprecedented wave of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in decades, many blatantly unconstitutional. In 2019, so-called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d, which ban abortion at six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant, became law in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Mississippi. Alabama banned abortion outright.In one case, an extreme bill proposed in Ohio would have charged doctors with \u201cabortion murder\u201d if they did not attempt to \u201cre-implant\u201d an ectopic pregnancy. There is no such procedure in medical science, and ectopic pregnancies that form in the fallopian tubes are never viable. They do, however, threaten women\u2019s lives.None of these laws are in effect, as they directly contravene law set out in Roe v Wade. This is by design. Emboldened by Trump and funded by conservative Republican mega-donors, abortion opponents hope they can push the right-leaning supreme court to take up a case and overturn Roe, even though most of the public agrees abortion should remain legal.\u201cThe main takeaway is that the states will continue to be important players on abortion laws and regulation,\u201dsaid Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute.Clinics are shuttering in large numbers in the south and midwestThere will be an intense focus on the supreme court this spring, as it hears oral arguments in June Medical Services LLC v Gee. The case from Louisiana focuses on whether doctors should be required to obtain the right to admit patients to local hospitals and will have national implications.The right to admit patients to hospitals, called \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d, is meant to sound like it improves women\u2019s health. In fact, hospitals are already required to take all cases which come through the emergency department. Instead, admitting privileges often serve as an insurmountable hurdle for doctors who practice independently at abortion clinics, in effect closing their practices.If it is ruled constitutional, the regulation could shut down two of Louisiana\u2019s three abortion clinics, despite providing no measurable health benefits for women. Legal scholars were shocked the country\u2019s highest court was even hearing the case. It ruled on an identical law from Texas in 2016, finding the measures unconstitutional and an undue burden to women seeking abortions.\u201cThe breadth of the outcomes is really wide,\u201d said Cohen. The case could result in \u201ceverything from \u2018you can regulate a little more\u2019 to \u2018you can outlaw abortion\u2019. So there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what\u2019s coming in the future.\u201dBut if the case in the supreme court could decide the legal fate of abortion rights, a woman\u2019s ability to exercise her right is already in dire straits. Between 2011 and 2017, 4% of abortion clinics closed across the US. This modest change obscures a broader truth \u2013 clinics are shuttering in large numbers in the south and midwest and opening on the coasts, leading to expensive logistical nightmares for many women.\u2018We just have to keep on fighting\u2019Abortion is now central to America\u2019s culture wars, one of a number of divisive issues shaped by a hyper-partisan political divide. Trump has played a key role in widening the gulf \u2013 and attempting to exploit it for electoral gain.\u201cVirtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\u2019s womb right up until the moment of birth,\u201d Trump told a booing audience at a recent rally in Toledo, Ohio. That statement is false \u2013 but emblematic.Abortion is a repeat topic as Trump campaigns for re-election at rallies, where his rhetoric often goes beyond what even the anti-abortion movement could have hoped for from past Republican candidates.The truth about late-term abortions in the US: they're very rareRead moreTobias and other anti-abortion activists have worked diligently to spread news of Trump\u2019s \u201camazing work\u201d to the broader electorate. She mentioned a list of his administration\u2019s achievements that the movement holds in esteem, including remaking the federal bench with ideological judges and preventing foreign aid from being used to advise women on abortions.\u201cI\u2019m expecting more pro-life laws to be passed, and there will of course be more challenges in the court, but we\u2019re moving forward,\u201d said Tobias.View image in fullscreenPeople during a rally calling for abortion rights outside the US supreme court in Washington DC, on 21 May 2019. Photograph: Ting Shen/Xinhua/Barcroft MediaThat was not always the case. The Christian right only took up the mantle of abortion after Roe was decided and after the supreme court ruled against the segregationist policies of private Christian schools, many of which were founded to exclude African American students.Southern Baptists even supported abortion rights at their annual conference until 1976. Until Roe, abortion was seen mostly as an issue for the Catholic church, and it was predominantly Democratic states that opposed access to abortion and contraceptives.Now, most Americans \u2013 nearly 80%, according to Gallup polling \u2013 support legal abortion in at least some circumstances. However, abortion has historically been a motivating issue for conservative voters, less so for liberals. That has led to a virulent anti-abortion right, while the left has only begun to enshrine abortion rights in state law.Loretta Ross is a reproductive justice activist and expert who has worked not just for abortion rights but against pregnancy discrimination and maternal mortality. \u201cWe just have to keep on fighting the same way black people have to keep on fighting for voting rights for 400 years,\u201d she said.Some older feminists in particular fear abortion rights, which younger women have grown up with, have been taken for granted since Roe v Wade. Doctors such as Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, worry about a return to illegal and deadly procedures.\u201cUnfortunately, the young women today don\u2019t realize how bad it was,\u201d said Minkin. When she was attending Brown University in 1968, \u201cI knew of a young woman a couple years before me, she got pregnant during freshman week.\u201cShe was subsequently infertile \u2026 had an illegal abortion done, and couldn\u2019t get pregnant thereafter,\u201d said Minkin. There were, of course, even worse outcomes. One of Minkin\u2019s mother\u2019s friends had a sister, a flight attendant, who died from an illegal abortion.\u201cThere were very dark times with people dying having septic abortions and people being infertile for the rest of their lives,\u201d said Minkin. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to that. We really don\u2019t want to go back to that.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionHealthWomenUS supreme courtLaw (US)GenderWomen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
