(Kelcie Moseley-Morris/Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion overturning Roe v. Wade on June 24, the court did not complete its official judgment until today, meaning Idaho\u2019s trigger law banning nearly all abortions will now go into effect on Aug. 25.\nAccording to the text of\u00a0Senate Bill 1385, the trigger law takes effect 30 days after the U.S. Supreme Court issues its judgment returning the power to regulate abortion to the states.\nIdaho passed its\u00a0trigger law in 2020, making the act of abortion a felony. The law outlines affirmative defenses for rape, incest and to save the patient\u2019s life, which allows a person prosecuted for performing an abortion procedure to use those reasons as a defense. A rape or incest victim would also have to provide a copy of a police report to the physician who would perform the procedure, a process which can sometimes take weeks or months.\nPlanned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging the law on June 27, saying it violates a fundamental right to privacy outlined in the Idaho Constitution. That lawsuit came a few months after a similar challenge from Planned Parenthood over Idaho\u2019s Texas-style law that allows family members to file civil suits against medical professionals who perform abortions. Both cases were filed by Planned Parenthood Great Northwest and one of its abortion providers in Idaho, Dr. Caitlin Gustafson.\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe, the Idaho Supreme Court vacated its original plans for a hearing on the Texas-style law and decided to use the same date to hear specific arguments related to how that lawsuit and the challenge to the trigger law should proceed.\nThe hearing will include arguments over whether\u00a0the Idaho Supreme Court should pause enforcement of the trigger law pending the outcome of the case, whether a pause on the Texas-style law should remain in place pending the outcome, whether the two lawsuits\u00a0should be consolidated into one and whether both cases should be transferred to district court for further review.\nThe hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Aug. 3.

The Idaho Legislature passed a bill in 2021 criminalizing abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, when fetal cardiac activity can typically be detected by ultrasound.\nLike the trigger law, the language in that bill included a 30-day clock from a judgment issued by an appellate court ruling on a similar law. According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s petition to the court, that may have occurred on July 20, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban.\nBecause of the time constraints, Planned Parenthood has asked the court to intervene and pause implementation of the law, and to add the third lawsuit to the hearing scheduled on Aug. 3. Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood, said the organization would prefer to consolidate the three cases into one moving forward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s confusing to providers and to patients if all of those cases don\u2019t get ruled the same way or all together,\u201d Rodihan said. \u201cOur hope would be to simplify everything by ruling on them all at once.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIdaho\u2019s abortion trigger ban clock starts now \u2014 ban will take effect Aug. 25\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun July 26, 2022\nIdaho\u2019s abortion trigger ban clock starts now \u2014 ban will take effect Aug. 25\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun July 26, 2022\n Although the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion overturning Roe v.
