(AP) \u2014 Kentucky\u2019s debate over abortion access intensified Wednesday as the Democratic governor pounded away at his rival\u2019s longstanding support for the state\u2019s existing abortion ban shortly after Republican challenger Daniel Cameron had signaled new willingness to accept exceptions for rape and incest.Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s campaign tried to keep Cameron on the defensive with a pointed TV ad featuring a young woman from Owensboro who reveals her childhood trauma while slamming the GOP nominee.\u201cAnyone who believes there should be no exceptions for rape and incest could never understand what it\u2019s like to stand in my shoes,\u201d Hadley Duvall says in the ad coming out Wednesday on statewide TV.It\u2019s the latest salvo in a campaign that has gotten more contentious over hot-button social issues.Cameron and his allies have blasted Beshear for vetoing transgender bills \u2014 one that banned gender-affirming care for young transgender people and another that barred transgender girls and women from participating in school sports matching their gender identity. Both vetoes were overridden by the GOP-dominated legislature.\n\nCameron pushed back aggressively Wednesday against the Beshear campaign, while criticizing the governor for opposing a number of anti-abortion measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe lectures us on partisanship and unity, then runs disgusting, false attacks. I have said if the legislature were to bring me a bill with exceptions, I would sign it,\u201d Cameron said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuvall, now in her early 20s, looks directly into the camera and talks about having been raped by her stepfather when she was 12 years old. Duvall became pregnant as a seventh grader but eventually miscarried. The stepfather was convicted of rape and is in prison.The Associated Press does not normally identify sexual assault victims, but Duvall chose to be identified and has spoken out publicly about what she experienced and its connection to the debate over abortion.\n\nBeshear has gone on offense on an issue that anti-abortion Republicans long claimed as theirs in this largely conservative state. Cameron is challenging Beshear in one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched campaigns in 2023. Beshear\u2019s campaign turned up the pressure after Cameron appeared to back off from his entrenched position of supporting the state\u2019s abortion ban as currently written, with few exceptions.During a Monday radio interview, Cameron revealed that he would support amending the abortion law to add exceptions allowing for the termination of pregnancies caused by rape or incest.In a campaign statement later that day, however, Cameron appeared to try to mollify both abortion hardliners and people who support adding the rape and incest exceptions.\u201cDaniel Cameron is the pro-life candidate for governor and supports the Human Life Protection Act\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the current abortion ban, the statement said. \u201dBut if the situation in Kentucky were to change and the legislature brought him a bill to add exceptions for rape and incest, he would, of course, sign it.\u201d \n\nHis shift could be another indication that more Republicans see the abortion issue as a political liability since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a nationwide right to abortion last year. Since then, voters have protected abortion rights via ballot measures in several states, including Kentucky.Duvall said she doesn\u2019t think Cameron\u2019s shift is genuine. \u201cI want to ask him where he\u2019s been all along on the matter,\u201d Duvall said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cSeven weeks before an election is a little too late to change your views on something so intense.\u201dCameron\u2019s comments drew an avalanche of coverage in the Bluegrass State. A headline in the Louisville newspaper referred to Cameron\u2019s \u201cflip-flops\u201d on rape and incest exceptions. An opinion piece in the Lexington paper pointed to Cameron\u2019s \u201cconfusing views.\u201d Democrats derided Cameron\u2019s apparent shift as politically motivated, pointing to polling they say shows the race tilting in Beshear\u2019s favor. They recounted Cameron\u2019s defense of the abortion ban in court as the state\u2019s attorney general and his public pronouncements of support for the existing ban.\n\nBeshear\u2019s campaign doubled down Wednesday with the new commercial, which features Duvall addressing the Republican nominee directly.\u201cThis is to you, Daniel Cameron,\u201d she says. \u201cTo tell a 12-year-old girl she must have the baby of her stepfather who raped her is unthinkable. I\u2019m speaking out because women and girls need to have options.\u201dSince last year, Cameron had steadfastly defended the current Kentucky law that bans all abortions except when carried out to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life or to prevent a disabling injury. During a Republican primary debate in March, Cameron expressed support for the law as currently written.Cameron also touted his anti-abortion credentials more openly during the spring primary campaign. But since winning the gubernatorial nomination, Cameron and his allies generally have downplayed the abortion issue while focusing on other topics, including crime rates and transgender rights.\n\nBeshear, an abortion rights supporter, has consistently called the state\u2019s abortion ban an \u201cextremist\u201d law that he says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Kentuckians disagree with, pointing to the lack of exceptions for rape and incest. Cameron\u2019s campaign says Beshear accommodated abortion-rights groups by opposing a series of abortion measures, including one to ban abortions in Kentucky after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Beshear noted at the time that the 15-week ban lacked exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.The new ad continues Beshear\u2019s reelection strategy of tying Cameron to the abortion ban. A previous Beshear ad featured a prosecutor denouncing the law\u2019s lack of exceptions for rape or incest.Now Duvall is telling her own story.\u201cMaybe I can help other people find their voice,\u201d Duvall said. \u201cBecause I know when I was trying to find mine, I was trying to find other people like me that I could lean on, that I could ask about. It\u2019s not an easy thing to talk about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
