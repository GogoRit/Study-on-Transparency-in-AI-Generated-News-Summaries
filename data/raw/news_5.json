Oto, co mo\u017cesz zrobi\u0107. Kiedy zaczynamy? TERAZ! A NAJP\u00d3\u0179NIEJ WE WTOREK! #StopBarbarzy\u0144com #Piek\u0142oKobiet #PolskiePiek\u0142o #StrajkKobiet Wi\u0119cej na stronie @strajkkobiet pic.twitter.com/qrR3i7IuOe\n\u2014 Bo\u017cena Przy\u0142uska (@BozenaPrzyluska) April 12, 2020\n\nBoth bills take the form of citizen\u2019s initiatives, which are legislative proposals that, if they attract at least 100,000 supporting signatures, can be submitted to parliament for consideration.\nBecause they were submitted during the previous parliamentary term, the Sejm\u2019s rules require that they be reviewed no later than six months into the next one. In this case, the deadline is 12 May, making the parliamentary session starting on 15 April the final date for review. Three other citizen\u2019s initiatives on separate issues have also been added to the parliamentary agenda for the same reason.\nEffectively ending legal abortion\nThe first initiative, entitled \u201cStop abortion\u201d (Zatrzymaj aborcj\u0119) proposes to prohibit the termination of pregnancies due to foetal defects. This is one of the only three cases in which abortion is legally permitted in Poland, the other two being a threat to the mother\u2019s life or health, or pregnancy resulting from a criminal act.\nHowever, the diagnosis of birth defects is the justification for around 98% of the 1,000 or so legal abortions that take place in Poland each year, meaning that the proposed bill would almost complete end lawful terminations.\nA similar citizen\u2019s initiative in 2016 provoked mass \u201cblack protests\u201d by women, forcing the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to back away from it, despite having previously expressed some support for the proposal\n\nThe current legislation was submitted to parliament by Kaja Godek, a prominent pro-life activist, in November 2017 with the backing of 830,000 signatures. But, following further protests, it was delayed until the end of the parliamentary term in 2019.\nThe bill is slightly less extreme than the earlier 2016 proposal, in that it would not introduce jail sentences for women who break the law or fines for complicit doctors.\nProtesting in lockdown\nUnlike in previous years, mass street protests are impossible due to current restrictions designed to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, including limiting public gatherings to no more than two people. Women\u2019s rights groups have therefore encouraged alternative forms of dissent.\nThese include holding up posters and home-made banners while queuing outside shops, or displaying them while riding bicycles. Protests have also been held in cars, with one today in Warsaw blocking off the central Rondo Dmowskiego roundabout, with drivers honking horns and holding up signs in car windows.\n\n\n\n\nOpublikowany przez Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet\u00a0Pi\u0105tek, 10 kwietnia 2020\n\n\n\nOpponents of the legislation have also been putting up posters, banners and black umbrellas (a symbol of previous protests) in windows and on balconies. They have been encouraged to send emails to MPs calling on them to reject the bill on its first reading. Daily \u201ctwitterstorms\u201d between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. are also seeking to flood social media with posts, tagging leading politicians.\nIt is too early to say whether the PiS-controlled Sejm will decide in favour of considering the proposal \u2013 in which case it would be sent to committee for further work ahead of a second and third reading \u2013 or whether it will reject the project outright.\nSenior PiS figures have previously expressed public support for banning terminations due to birth defects, which they refer to as \u201ceugenic abortion\u201d. The party\u2019s chairman \u2013 and Poland\u2019s de facto leader \u2013 Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski said in 2016 that his party would \u201cstrive to ensure that even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is condemned to death, is severely deformed, will end in birth, so that the child can be christened, buried, given a name\u201d.\nYet the party leadership backed away from both proposed abortion bans in the last term, leading to criticism from religious conservatives. Critics included the head of Poland\u2019s Catholic episcopate, Archbishop Stanis\u0142aw G\u0105decki, who \u201cexpressed disappointment\u201d that PiS had not \u201cfulfilled its electoral promise to protect life from the moment of conception\u201d.\nPolityka weekly argues that a rejection of the proposal after its first reading is unlikely, as the only citizens\u2019 initiative to be ever rejected by PiS right away has been a bill to liberalise abortion rules.\nPresident Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has also expressed his support for banning \u201ceugenic abortion\u201d. Earlier this month, in an interview with Catholic weekly Niedziela, he again said that he would sign such a bill into law if it crossed his desk because he believes that \u201ckilling disabled children is simply murder\u201d.\n\n\nAbortion due to birth defects \"is simply murder\", says President Duda. \"I'm a strong opponent of eugenic abortion, killing children with disabilities.\"\nHe repeats his promise to sign any law making it illegal. Parliament will discuss such a bill next week https://t.co/gIyeYvCyWz\n\u2014 Notes from Poland ?? (@notesfrompoland) April 8, 2020\n\nProposals to tighten Poland\u2019s abortion law \u2013 which is already the strictest in the EU apart from Malta\u2019s \u2013 do not however have much public support, according to polls. An IPSOS survey conducted in 2018 found that only 11% of respondents supported stricter abortion rules, 44% were happy with the current law, while 38% said they would prefer more liberal access. Other polling has produced similar results.\nCriminalising sex education?\nOn Wednesday, parliament will also consider a second controversial citizen\u2019s initiative, entitled \u201cStop paedophilia\u201d. It envisions jail sentences for those who \u201cpropagate or approve of engagement by minors in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity\u201d while \u201cperforming activities related to upbringing, education, health care or care of minors\u201d.\nCritics argue that the wording of the law would effectively make it a criminal offence to teach sex education to minors. The organisation behind the initiative, Fundacja Pro, has publicly campaigned against sex education, which it says is a way of \u201cpreparing or perpetrating paedophile offences\u201d and \u201csexually corrupting children\u201d.\nThe European Parliament last year passed a resolution condemning the proposed law. However, the initiative met with a positive response from some PiS MPs upon first being discussed in parliament. They suggested increasing the maximum prison sentence for those violating the law from three to five years.\n\nEuropean Parliament condemns proposed \u201ccriminalisation of sex education in Poland\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, urged Poland\u2019s parliament to reject both bills, saying they could restrict women\u2019s rights to safe and legal abortions and children\u2019s rights to sex education, reports Reuters.\nThe issue of Poland\u2019s strict abortion laws has already attracted renewed attention amid the coronavirus lockdown. Restrictions on movement have limited access to illegal abortions, an estimated tens of thousands of which take place each year.\n\nIt has also made it more difficult for women to travel to neighbouring countries to secure abortions, with stricter border controls now in place and anyone returning to Poland from abroad required to enter two weeks of quarantine. Many also worry about delayed shipments of \u201cabortion pills\u201d, which are illegal in Poland.\nAs a result, doctors warn about a rise in \u201cback alley\u201d abortions. Aborcyjny Dream Team, a charity helping Polish women seeking abortions abroad, has reported double its usual number of callers. Nine out of ten callers asked about access to pills that are illegal in Poland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAbortion Without Borders\u201d initiative to help Polish women obtain terminations abroad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain image credits: Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria WilczekMaria Wilczek is deputy editor of Notes from Poland.
