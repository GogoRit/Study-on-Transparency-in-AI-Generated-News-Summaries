Pete Ricketts (R) told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday he hopes to work with the state\u2019s GOP-dominated legislature to pass a statewide abortion ban\u2014without exceptions for rape or incest\u2014if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, possibly joining several other states slated to ban abortion if the Supreme Court allows them to do so.\nNebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) speaks to the Conservative Political Action Conference at National ... [+] Harbor, Maryland on February 24, 2017.MIKE THEILER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nIf the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision is overturned, Ricketts intends to call a special session of the state legislature to pass an abortion ban, he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union anchor Dana Bash.\n\n\n\nRicketts\u2019 remarks came one month after an abortion \u201ctrigger law\u201d\u2014which would have automatically banned abortion if Roe is reversed\u2014failed in Nebraska\u2019s legislature by a vote of 31-15, two votes short of the 33-vote minimum to overcome a filibuster.\n\n\n\nThe bill was subject to eight hours of debate, during which Democratic lawmakers argued the law infringed on womens\u2019 bodily autonomy by banning abortion in practically all instances, the Nebraska Examiner reported.\n\n\n\nAsked if he would support legislation banning abortion even in cases of rape or incest, Ricketts replied on CNN, \u201cThey\u2019re still babies, too, yes\u2014they\u2019re still babies.\u201d\n\n\nRicketts said Nebraska Republicans were \u201chopeful\u201d Roe v. Wade will be overturned, but that they would have to wait before taking further steps.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nAlmost two weeks ago, Politico published a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, which holds that a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion is constitutionally protected. Thirteen states passed \u201ctrigger laws\u201d that would immediately ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is ended, while 16 states have passed laws that would protect abortion rights, according to the pro-abortion-rights Guttmacher Institute. Publication of the draft opinion\u2014which Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed is authentic but isn\u2019t necessarily final\u2014has led to renewed debate around abortion rights, which would largely return to the hands of state leaders in the absence of a national law protecting or banning abortion. Some Republican legislators are reportedly working to advance a national abortion ban if the GOP retakes control of Congress after the November midterms, though a few other Republican politicians have argued a national ban would run into constitutional problems and state bans would be more effective. A bill that would have codified national abortion protections failed in the Senate Wednesday 49-51, falling decisively short of the 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a filibuster, after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and all 50 Republicans voted no.\n\nFurther Reading\n\u201cHow Americans Really Feel About Abortion: The Sometimes Surprising Poll Results As Supreme Court Reportedly Set To Overturn Roe V.
