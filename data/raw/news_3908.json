It is therefore important for young people in the country especially girls to ensure that they are aware of their sexuality so as to prevent them from being abused and also to allow them to utilize friendly sexual reproductive health services,\u201d said Bolokonya.\nDr Kaunda Nkhuwi of Chikwawa District Health Office hailed the project saying it has helped to reduce sexually transmitted disease infection rate and unwanted pregnancies among the youth in the district.\nMbungu Manason, Chairperson for Ngabu youth network said GUSO Project has helped them to be able to question duty bearers on service delivery and has also increased meaningful youth participation at local level on top of enabling them to openly discuss sexuality issues among them and their parents.\nGUSO Project was being funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was being implemented by an alliance of local organizations namely; Centre for the Victimized Women and Children (CAVWOC), Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR), Coalition of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (COWLHA), Youth Net and Counseling (YONECO), Family Planning Association of Malawi (FPAM) and Centre for Youth Empowerment and Civic Education (CYECE).\nShare this:Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading... \n\n\n\n PreviousBishop Malasa\u2019s followers attack priests: Call Priest\u2019s wives poor prostitutes \n\nNext 20 people killed by lightning since onset of rains \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nKhonsolo ya Lilongwe igwiritsa K2.5 miliyoni kusamutsa pholo la mbendera \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMan gets 14 years in prison for raping girl, 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBBC suspends Gary Lineker for criticising British government \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFree dog vaccination and castration underway in Mzuzu \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTraditional leaders commit to raising education standards in Balaka \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBambo wina wadzikhweza ku Dowa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBushiri athandiza mwana odyetsedwa dowe wamuwisi \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThree Chinese nationals jailed over fraudulent marriages with Malawian women \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\n\n\nMALAWI24\n\n\n\nMalawi 24 is the leading independent online news publication for Malawi, providing breaking news, politics, entertainment, sports, views, investigative articles, in-depth analyses and daily news updates.\u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n Popular News \n\n\n\nKhonsolo ya Lilongwe igwiritsa K2.5 miliyoni kusamutsa pholo la mbendera\n\n\nMan gets 14 years in prison for raping girl, 6\n\n\nBBC suspends Gary Lineker for criticising British government\n\n\nFree dog vaccination and castration underway in Mzuzu\n\n\nJones Gadama challenges Kondwani Nankhumwa for Mulanje Central Constituency\n\n\nBushiri athandiza mwana odyetsedwa dowe wamuwisi\n\n\nChoirmaster arrested for raping child while her friends watched\n\n\nFAM ready to deliver a successful Four Nations Tournament\n\n\nDziko la Malawi likhala likukumbukira Matenda a TB ndi Khate pa 24 March\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture \n\n\n\nBusiness \n\n\n\nEducation \n\n\n\nEntertainment \n\n\n\nEnvironment \n\n\n\nHealth \n\n\n\nHot Gossip \n\n\n\nLilia's Weekly Dose \n\n\n\nLiterature \n\n\n\nMiracles \n\n\n\nMwanaMwa \n\n\n\nNational \n\n\n\nNo Holds Barred \n\n\n\nOpinion \n\n\n\nPolitics \n\n\n\nSatire \n\n\n\nSports \n\n\n\nTop News \n\n\n\nVacancies \n\n\n\nWeird News \n\n\n\nWorld News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalawi 24: The Leading Independent Online News Publication for Malawi\nContact Us\nEditorial Policy\nDonate\nMalawi Advertise\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9\n2024 | Malawi 24 - Latest News from Malawi and Around the World \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover more from Malawi 24\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType your email\u2026 \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSubscribe \n\n\n\n\n\nContinue reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%d\n\n\n"
