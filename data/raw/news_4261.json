First, we now have viable data which we know can make a difference to policy. Second, being part of a multi-country study has led to very interesting\nexchanges of experiences between teams. Third, I see members of our team going on to further research training with the help of the HRP Alliance, taking on new projects that can improve sexual and reproductive health for women across Guinea.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt is\u00a0encouraging\u00a0to see countries take on board the importance of ensuring a positive experience for women during childbirth.\u201d said\u00a0Dr\u00a0\u04e6zge\u00a0Tun\u00e7alp,\u00a0scientist at WHO and senior author\nof the study.\u00a0\u201cWe hope that\u00a0women in\u00a0Guinea\u00a0will reap the benefits of\u00a0this\u00a0new approach,\u00a0which\u00a0puts\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0wishes and preferences more at the\u00a0centre\u00a0of their care. It should not be forgotten either that evidence also suggests a positive experience at childbirth\u00a0may\u00a0lead\u00a0on to improved outcomes\u00a0for each woman and her child - in the immediate post-pregnancy period and far beyond.\u201d\u00a0Photo: Research and recommendations stakeholder workshop, Conakry, Guinea (2019)\n\n\n\nRelated\nPublicationsThe prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth (WHO Statement)WHO recommendations: intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experienceInfographics\nMany women experience mistreatment during childbirthYounger women were: 1.8 times more likely to experience physical abuseAlmost 34% of women who requested pain relief did not receive it\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew evidence shows significant mistreatment of women during childbirth\n9 October 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\nEastern Mediterranean\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\nWestern Pacific\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\nCyber security\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nPermissions and licensing\n\n\nPreventing sexual exploitation\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nReport misconduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\nPrivacy policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\u00a9\n\n2024\n\nWHO\n\n                       \n"
