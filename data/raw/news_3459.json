Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen lawyers for the state of Mississippi defended a state law banning abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy before the US Supreme Court in 2020, they suggested that the court did not need to overturn Roe v Wade to do so.One year later, the state\u2019s argument hinged on the question of ending Roe, rejecting precedent that could end constitutional protections for abortion and trigger a wave of laws that make it illegal in more than half the country.A lot can happen within a year. Longtime liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Donald Trump named her replacement Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to the Senate in record time before Mr Trump left office.But getting a case like Mississippi\u2019s in front of a conservative-majority Supreme Court to directly challenge legal abortion has been central to a campaign that was years in the making.A draft opinion signalling the end of constitutionally protected abortion access in America marks a victory for an anti-abortion movement that has reshaped right-wing politics and helped Republicans stack the federal judiciary with ideologically like-minded figures.RecommendedOklahoma\u2019s abortion providers are \u2018already living in a post-Roe world\u2019From activist rabbis to the Temple of Satan: Surprising tactics in the fight to preserve abortion rightsInside New Mexico\u2019s desperate battle to keep up with surging abortion demand as neighbouring states enact bansThe so-called \u201cpro-life\u201d movement \u2013 parallel to and in concert with a growing Christian right and conservative legal groups \u2013 has fuelled the Republican Party and waged a campaign to inform \u201csingle issue\u201d voters into a powerful base. The movement has helped draft state-level legislation to restrict abortion access and promoted anti-abortion figures across the judicial system, cultivating a conservative majority on the nation\u2019s high court to undo the ruling at the centre of its agenda.Should the ruling be finalised, it will be seen as a crowning achievement for a minority movement that has spent the last several decades focused on Roe\u2019s demise, despite growing consensus among Americans in support of protecting abortion access.\u201cIt is a victory, and it also poses the more difficult question about what\u2019s next,\u201d Florida State University College of Law professor Mary Ziegler, author of Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v Wade to the Present and forthcoming Dollars for Life: The Antiabortion Movementand the Fall of the Republican Establishment, told The Independent.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to be in the opposition than it is to be the person in a position to actually do something,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to see anti-abortion groups in the states give us a sense of, \u2018What does it actually mean to be pro-life?\u2019 Does it mean you just put people in jail for [performing] abortions or having abortions, or is there more to it than that?\u201dThe \u201cpro-life\u201d movementThe story at the centre of the conservative Christian movement has rallied right-leaning voters for years. But what became a concerted effort to politicise abortion in the wake of the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade developed from a conservative movement in fierce opposition to civil rights progress, one that galvanised conservative Christian groups without invoking race, according to scholars who have traced the history of the movement and its influence.\u201cThe anti-abortion movement has been remarkably successful at convincing observers that the positions individuals take on the abortion issue always follow in a deductive way from their supposed moral principles. They don\u2019t,\u201d Katherine Stewart, author of The Power Worshipers, told The New York Times.The federal government\u2019s targeting of religious-affiliated private schools evading racial integration in the years after the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v Board of Education decision in 1954 electrified movement leaders, conceding that \u201cdefending the tax advantages of racist schools wasn\u2019t going to be a viable strategy on the national stage,\u201d she said.Public polling and resolutions issued by religious organisations, including a 1971 plea from the Southern Baptist Convention to support legalising abortion in certain cases, largely maintained the importance of its access, regardless of \u201cmoral\u201d questions about its practise.But in the years leading up to the Roe ruling, conservative movement leaders began to shape an agenda that remains firmly within the American right, from the rhetoric around defining \u201clife\u201d to political platforms resisting federal authority, rooted firmly in Reconstruction-era grievances.View moreTen years after the landmark court decision in Roe v Wade, the US Senate failed to pass a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban abortion. In 1984, Americans United for Life convened a national conference to develop a strategy to overturn the ruling.Over the following decades, the movement spawned dozens of anti-abortion organisations and gained outsized influence within state legislatures, under direction of \u201cfamily\u201d-focused religious groups, while mobilising \u201cpro-life\u201d supporters in schools, outside abortion clinics, and in the streets of Washington DC.Meanwhile, the newly formed Federalist Society took aim at what it believed was the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cjudicial activism\u201d and began a decades-long effort to reshape the federal judiciary and the lawmakers behind it, transforming into a powerful presence in Washington with six current or former members on the Supreme Court.\u201cThe Christian right and the anti-abortion movement are obviously connected, but the anti-abortion movement is sort of its own thing \u2013 it\u2019s a truly single-issue movement in some ways,\u201d Ms Ziegler told The Independent. \u201cThe conservative legal movement, the Federalist Society, and sort of the \u2018elite wing\u2019 of the movement [is] distinct. There\u2019s a lot of overlap in the sense that all three of those constituencies want Roe overturned and have worked toward that goal for a while, but they\u2019ve sometimes had complicated relationships with one another. \u2026 Like most social movements, there\u2019s more complexity than that.\u201dThe Trump administrationPresident Trump, with a Republican-controlled Senate under Mitch McConnell and input from the Federalist Society, appointed 54 federal appellate judges in just four years \u2013 nearly as many as those appointed by Barack Obama but in just half the time. With his rapid appointments, the former president \u201cflipped\u201d the balance of several appeals courts through which major cases are reviewed before consideration in front of the Supreme Court.Mr Trump\u2019s appointments to the Supreme Court \u2013 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 are the most within any president\u2019s administration since Ronald Reagan, and the most by any one-term president.In 2019, then-Senate Majority Leader McConnell said \u201cthe most important decision\u201d in his political career was blocking efforts to fill a Supreme Court vacancy following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia during Barack Obama\u2019s administration.The Senate denied hearings for Mr Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland \u2013 now the US attorney general \u2013 for a record 293 days, arguing that the 2016 presidential election precluded any talk of a nominee. And just a few weeks after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, that vacancy was filled by his nominee, Neil Gorsuch.Mr McConnell abandoned the \u201crule\u201d in what were the final days of the Trump administration, with the Senate confirming Justice Barrett just 38 days before Election Day.RecommendedUS \u2018at serious risk\u2019 of GOP enacting national abortion ban, White House saysMs Ziegler, writing in The Atlantic earlier this year, said the GOP and Federalist Society \u201chave created a parallel community with its own norms and sources of validation\u201d in which Supreme Court justices \u201cmay not worry about losing legitimacy in one elite legal circle when they will be heroes in another.\u201dRoe v Wade\u2019s journey to get to the Supreme Court not only fulfills the \u201cChristian right\u2019s decades-long ambition of overturning Roe but very explicitly gives them license to enact the harshest regime they can imagine to defend what they claim are the biblical values of a Christian nation,\u201d according to Sarah Posner, author of Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump.\u201cIt creates a post-Roe world in which state legislatures feel more empowered to escalate their attacks not only on reproductive rights but on [LGBT+] rights as well,\u201d she said.The Mississippi caseIn 2018, Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic sued the state one day after passage of the Gestational Age Act banning abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy.A US district judge initially ruled in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization that the state has \u201cno legitimate state interest strong enough, prior to viability, to justify a ban on abortions\u201d before 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. An appeals court ruling upheld that decision, asserting that states \u201cmay not ban abortions\u201d.In Mississippi\u2019s initial filing with the Supreme Court in 2020, the state initially proposed three questions to the court \u2013 none of which mention Roe. One year later, the state\u2019s argument came down to a single question: \u201cWhether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.\u201dMississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch argued that \u201cthe conclusion that abortion is a constitutional right has no basis in text, structure, history, or tradition,\u201d a statement echoed in anti-abortion arguments and in Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s leaked opinion.\u201cToday, adoption is accessible and on a wide scale women attain both professional success and a rich family life, contraceptives are more available and effective, and scientific advances show that an unborn child has taken on the human form and features months before viability,\u201d Ms Fitch claimed in a filing with the court. \u201cStates should be able to act on those developments. But Roe and Casey shackle states to a view of the facts that is decades out of date.\u201dWhat the US Supreme Court leak means for Roe v Wade and abortion rights in AmericaA strategy to defend the law against Roe and Casey started years earlier. The anti-abortion Evangelicals For Life Conference in Washington DC in 2018, which featured speakers from the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), hailed a new legal strategy within state legislatures to reverse the Roe ruling.Days later, Republican legislators in Mississippi filed identical version of the Gestational Age Act, drafted by the ADF, to force abortion rights groups into a legal challenge that would eventually land at the Supreme Court.Justice Alito\u2019s opinionThe case at the centre of the 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey involved Pennsylvania\u2019s Abortion Control Act, which required abortion patients to wait 24 hours from their initial appointment, parental consent for minors seeking abortion care, and for patients to notify their spouses.Planned Parenthood was among opponents of the law who sued the state, arguing that law drafted unconstitutional restrictions against those protected by the Roe standard.Before the case reached the Supreme Court, Mr Alito \u2013 who was then a federal appeals court judge \u2013 argued that the law\u2019s spousal notification requirement should stay in place, writing that \u201csome married women are initially inclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands\u2019 knowledge because of perceived problems \u2013 such as economic constraints, future plans, or the husband\u2019s previously expressed opposition \u2013 that may be obviated by discussion prior to the abortion.\u201dThe Supreme Court ultimately rejected his argument and declined to use the case as a means to overturn Roe, with Justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter writing that \u201can entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe\u2019s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society and to make reproductive decisions.\u201d (AP)The ruling established the \u201cundue burden standard\u201d for laws restricting abortion access, holding that states cannot pass their own laws restricting abortion access except if such laws create \u201ca substantial obstacle\u201d for a patient to access care under the \u201cessential holding\u201d established by Roe.In 2005, Harriet Miers \u2013 nominated to the Supreme Court by then-president George W Bush following the retirement of Justice O\u2019Connor \u2013 withdrew her nomination.In her place, Mr Bush nominated Samuel Alito.Nearly 20 years later, Justice Alito authored the draft of the Dobbs ruling to overturn both Roe and Casey in an opinion that echoes several long-running talking points and legal arguments among anti-abortion movement figures and legal groups, according to Ms Ziegler.Justice Alito points to what he calls \u201can unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973,\u201d which critics have argued is both an ahistorical analysis and one that ignores the last five decades of abortion care.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disputed history about when was abortion viewed as a crime, what were the motives of the people who criminalized abortion in the 19th century \u2013 a lot of that is taken from the research done by anti-abortion scholars,\u201d Ms Ziegler told The Independent. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not to say that some of those scholars are completely wrong. It\u2019s that there\u2019s no nuance in the opinion. \u2026 \u2018People who are criminalizing abortion had no bad motives, and abortion [was] illegal throughout pregnancy everywhere\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s just not true.\u201dThe opinion also states that abortion rights are not \u201crooted in the Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d and not \u201cmentioned\u201d in the Constitution, therefore illegitimate, though that list, which even Justice Alito acknowledges, is extensive \u2013 including the right to obtain contraception or marry a person of another race or sex.\u201cThe opinion makes the argument that Roe v Wade distorted other aspects of American jurisprudence, that it didn\u2019t just mess up the rules on abortion, but it it messed up the way the law treats a lot of other topics, even procedural issues \u2026 what folks in the pro-life movement will call the \u2018abortion distortion\u2019 argument,\u201d according to Ms Ziegler.Abortion rights supporters demonstrate in New York City on 3 May.  (REUTERS)His argument suggests Roe has inflamed political divides, painting anti-abortion proponents as victims within a long-running culture war who \u201ccould no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views\u201d despite Republican dominance among state legislatures.Justice Alito\u2019s characterisation invokes the idea within the anti-abortion movement that \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with American politics somehow has to do with Roe \u2013 all of those are things that the pro-life movement has been working on at least since the \u201890s and sometimes since the \u201870s,\u201d Ms Ziegler said.The future of the movementMovement leaders now must wrestle with competing visions of what it means to be \u201cpro-life\u201d in an era without Roe, as Republican legislators emboldened by the potential end of constitutional protections for abortion care look to criminalise patients while gutting social safety nets, according to Ms Ziegler.\u201cDo they mean IUDs, birth control pills? What are they going to do about people who self-manage abortions? What are they going to do about people who travel out of state?\u201d Ms Ziegler said.\u201cI think that may be bad for the brand and the pro-life movement [if it] increasingly becomes the new mass incarceration movement,\u201d she told The Independent. \u201cThe stakes of that conversation are getting higher, because before it was kind of academic, where you could have the governor have one vision of what it means to oppose abortion, and you could have the legislature have another vision, and nobody really got anything, because it would be struck down as unconstitutional. But now, whoever wins actually gets to implement the policy.\u201dMore aboutAmy Coney BarrettMississippiroe v wadesamuel alitoDonald TrumpMitch McConnellanti-abortionabortion rightsJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/3How the \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement killed Roe v WadeHow the \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement killed Roe v WadeAPHow the \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement killed Roe v WadeAbortion rights supporters demonstrate in New York City on 3 May.
