Since joining Vox in 2018, her work has explored the rise of TikTok, internet aesthetics, and the pursuit of money and fame online. You can sign up for her biweekly Vox Culture newsletter here.\n\n\n\n\n\nDean Browning, a former commissioner in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, confused Twitter users on Tuesday when he replied to his own tweet claiming to be a gay Black man who voted for Trump. In reality, Browning is a white man who describes himself as a \u201cproud pro-life & pro-2A Christian conservative,\u201d as his Twitter photo and bio clearly illustrate. None of this makes sense, but don\u2019t worry, it will make even less sense soon.\nHere is what happened: On November 8, Browning tweeted, \u201cWhat Trump built in 4 years, Biden will destroy in 4 months\u201d \u2014 a standard sentiment percolating on the MAGA internet right now. On Tuesday, November 10, when another user argued that, actually, it was Obama who built what Trump takes credit for, Browning came back with a retort.\n\u201cI\u2019m a black gay guy and I can personally say that Obama did nothing for me, my life only changed a little bit and it was for the worse,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything is so much better under Trump though. I feel respected \u2014 which I never do when democrats are involved.\u201d \n\n\nDean Browning, former Lehigh County comissioner who seems to have forgotten to log into his burner account, was about 2,500 votes away from being the GOP's nominee in Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional district this year. pic.twitter.com/ftiY68wae6\u2014 Jacob Rubashkin (@JacobRubashkin) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\nTo anyone who has spent enough time watching pro-Trump conservatives and #resistance liberals argue on the internet, it seemed extremely clear what had taken place. Browning was the owner of another Twitter account, one claiming to be a gay Black man who loved Trump, and he simply forgot to log in to it before posting the reply (this is often called \u201csock puppeting\u201d online). Immediately, users began to flood into the discussion, calling out Browning\u2019s accidental exposure of his fake burner account. \nThe situation seemed to remain a mystery to Browning, who left the tweet up for several hours. Later in the day, though, he said that it was actually all a misunderstanding. \u201cRegarding the tweet that is going viral from my account \u2014 I was quoting a message that I received earlier this week from a follower,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSorry if context was not clear. Trump received record minority votes & record LGBTQ votes. Many people won\u2019t say it vocally, but do in private.\u201d\nThough Browning attempted to use the \u201csilent majority\u201d argument, most people didn\u2019t buy it. Within the span of just a few minutes, Washington Post journalist Phillip Bump claimed to have found the smoking gun: the fake account in question. \u201cYou know who replies to Dean Browning a lot? \u2018Dan Purdy,\u2019 a gay black Trump supporter who joined Twitter in October,\u201d wrote Bump, including screenshots of Purdy\u2019s frequent replies to Browning. \n@DanPurdy322 is an account with a cartoon of a Black man wearing a beanie as its avatar and a Trump 2020 logo as its header. As people on Twitter soon discovered, it also has a history of posting extremely racist and sexist remarks. Sample tweets include \u201cBlack ppl can\u2019t count\u201d and \u201cblack women will be the death of America,\u201d among many others, in Purdy\u2019s short time on the platform. \n\n\nincredible stuff happening here pic.twitter.com/Fvrmoq5kTk\u2014 jordan (@JordanUhl) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this your totally real black gay conservative follower? pic.twitter.com/XSxgGjjxlc\u2014 Don \"Big Chooch\" Moynihan (@donmoyn) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\nIf Browning turns out to be the man behind the account, this is not a new phenomenon, particularly among conservatives. As far back as 2016, experts were identifying huge networks of pro-Trump bot accounts for people who didn\u2019t actually exist. In October, Clemson University social media researcher Darren Linvill told the Washington Post that he\u2019d identified more than two dozen Twitter accounts claiming to be Black Trump voters who\u2019d gained hundreds of thousands of \u201clikes\u201d and retweets in the span of just a few days, sparking major doubts about their identities. Many used photos of Black men from news reports or stock images, including one in which the text \u201cblack man photo\u201d was still watermarked on the image. White nationalists have also had a history of disguising as \u201cantifa\u201d online to sow fear toward leftists. \nThe Browning-Purdy plot thickened, however, when the account posted a video shortly thereafter of a Black man claiming to be Purdy himself. \u201cI sent that message to Dean, Dean accidentally posted it somehow, that\u2019s the end of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not a sock puppet. No, I\u2019m not a bot.\u201d\n\n\nso the video was taken down, but here it is in case you want your brain to melt: pic.twitter.com/umGPjt5sN4\u2014 alex (@alex_abads) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\nMany of the replies to the video asked questions like, \u201cHow much is he paying you?\u201d and accusing him of being a hired actor. Internet sleuths like Jon Hendren (better known as @fart on Twitter) used Google to discover that \u201cDan Purdy\u201d was also the name listed on a suspended account that had a history of several other aliases \u2014 including \u201cPat Riarchy\u201d and \u201cWhite Goodman.\u201d \n\n\nso from googling it would appear @deanbrowningpa's black guy identity \"Dan Purdy\" was also once used on the suspended account @soulcookie322. but before that account became Dan Purdy, it was a white guy named \"Pat Riarchy\" and \"White Goodman\". dean is really something else pic.twitter.com/gFkUPkNDPV\u2014 food truck drove away with my debit card (@fart) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\nIn yet another twist, people noticed similarities between the avatars \u2014 and faces \u2014 of the man in the video and William Holte, otherwise known as Byl Holte, otherwise known as the adopted son and nephew of music legend Patti LaBelle. Holte has indeed written several articles on Medium complaining about feminism and anti-racism in the media and proudly calls himself an \u201canti-feminist TV critic.\u201d\n\n\nBRUHHHH pic.twitter.com/fBiEY9TlSq\u2014 (CLOSED.) (@chribbyy) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\nHowever horrifying the tweets from \u201cDan Purdy\u201d may be, the fiasco has offered, for some, a welcome distraction from the news. Much like the objectively hilarious Four Seasons Total Landscaping ordeal, the idea that a small-time Republican politician is posing as a gay Black man on Twitter \u2014 who may also be Patti LaBelle\u2019s actual son \u2014 is too juicy to ignore. \u201cCongratulations to Dean Browning, today\u2019s main character,\u201d tweeted Chris Geidner. \u201cI really needed this \u2026 LMAO\u201d added Yashar Ali. \nBrowning, meanwhile, continues to, as they say, \u201ctweet through it,\u201d while Purdy\u2019s account has been suspended. Vox has reached out to Dan Purdy and Dean Browning and will update with more info as it comes in. \n\n\nI would love to see a debate between Candace Owens and AOC!\u2014 Dean Browning (@DeanBrowningPA) November 10, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
