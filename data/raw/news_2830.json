The Twitter user shared how, in their experience as an abortion clinic employee, some pro-life women get abortions themselves and allegedly try to justify this by lashing out at others. Scroll down to read Annoyed Cicada\u2019s thoughts in their own words.  According to a recent Gallup poll, around 62 percent of Americans who are between the ages of 18 and 29 consider themselves to be pro-choice on the question of abortion. Meanwhile, only 37 percent of Americans over the age of 65 are pro-choice.We know that this is a very sensitive topic, dear Pandas. Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, remember to keep the discussion in the comment section civil and respect your fellow readers.An abortion clinic employee shared their experience with some clientsShare iconImage credits: AnnoyedCicadaShare iconImage credits: AnnoyedCicadaShare iconImage credits: AnnoyedCicada     Share iconImage credits: AnnoyedCicadaShare iconImage credits: AnnoyedCicadaShare iconADVERTISEMENTImage credits: AnnoyedCicadaShare iconImage credits: plannedparenthoodThe same poll found that 48 percent of all interviewed American men identified as pro-choice and 46 percent thought of themselves as pro-life. Meanwhile, fewer women (43 percent) who took part in the poll considered themselves pro-choice; 51 percent identified as pro-life. In both cases, 6 percent of men and women had no opinion.In May 2020, Gallup found that 20 percent of Americans believe that abortions should be illegal in all circumstances. Meanwhile, 29 percent thought that they should be legal under any circumstances; 50 percent believe that they should be legal, but only under certain circumstances.When compared to 2019, the number of Americans supporting abortions without restrictions increased by 4 percent.Even though the number of Americans who are either pro-choice or pro-life is more or less equal right now, this wasn\u2019t always the case. According to Gallup, far more Americans identified themselves as supporters of the pro-choice position a couple of decades ago.Back in 1995, Gallup found that 56 percent of respondents were pro-choice and only 33 percent were pro-life. Meanwhile, 5 percent had mixed opinions, 3 percent had no idea what the terms meant, and another 3 percent had no opinion whatsoever.Here\u2019s how some people reacted to the threadADVERTISEMENTShare iconADVERTISEMENTShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconShare iconADVERTISEMENTShare iconShare iconShare iconShare icon Anyone can write on Bored Panda.

They were wonderful to me and my husband when we didn't have insurance and needed prenatal care. They helped insure our baby would be born healthy. Our story is not some small exception either. Free prenatal vitamins, free ultrasound, free professional advice and help. Not once did they suggest abortion. They said, \"Do you want to have this baby?\" and when we said \"Yes\" that was instantly everyone's main goal.

Planned Parenthood helped my mom in many ways through a miscarriage and an abortion, and even though, if course, she's depressed about losing 2 babies, she's still grateful that they helped her through those hard times. We were a poor family, so same as above, we couldn't afford pre and post natal care. And honestly? It's that individual's and their spouses/family's decision, no one has the right to make them feel bad about anything.

If you plan to be a parent, they will help you. If you didn't plan (or are unable to plan) to be a parent, they will help you. I... really didn't think it was that complicated.

They're simply anti-abortion. If they were pro-life then they would support the women who don't have abortions and keep a child, while living in poverty. Or how about they step up and adopt the children that are unwanted? I don't see that happening. That's life.

There are about 300,000+ children in the US that are available for adoption and about 64 million people that consider themselves \"Pro-Life\". If they were truly Pro-Life that number of children waiting to be adopted should be zero.    Vote comment up  51  51points   Vote comment down   reply  Load More Replies...         Curry on...

They don't find anything contradictory in trying to force a woman to give birth if she does not want to but allowing the state to murder a living breathing human for crime(s) they may have committed. I say \"may have committed\" because we are finding out there have been innocent people executed for crimes they did not commit and people on death row for years that have been exonerated. It horrible to destroy a clump of cells, but perfectly fine to kill a human. People are so messed up it is unreal.

Using pro vs anti abortion is much clearer & to the point, too. Particularly for that small percentage that answered the survey stating \"I don't know what those terms mean\".\nFrom that I would also hazard a guess that a small percentage of respondents may have been confused by the terms used and unintentionally ticked the wrong box on the survey.\nAlthough pro-life = anti-choice, pro-choice does not mean anti-life.

If I saw someone get thrown off a cliff and I said \"Hey, that's not right.

I wouldn't take care of your parents, and if I saw them in the street homeless frankly I probably would pass them up. But that doesn't mean it's okay to murder them.

They were wonderful to me and my husband when we didn't have insurance and needed prenatal care. They helped insure our baby would be born healthy. Our story is not some small exception either. Free prenatal vitamins, free ultrasound, free professional advice and help. Not once did they suggest abortion. They said, \"Do you want to have this baby?\" and when we said \"Yes\" that was instantly everyone's main goal.

Planned Parenthood helped my mom in many ways through a miscarriage and an abortion, and even though, if course, she's depressed about losing 2 babies, she's still grateful that they helped her through those hard times. We were a poor family, so same as above, we couldn't afford pre and post natal care. And honestly? It's that individual's and their spouses/family's decision, no one has the right to make them feel bad about anything.

They're simply anti-abortion. If they were pro-life then they would support the women who don't have abortions and keep a child, while living in poverty. Or how about they step up and adopt the children that are unwanted? I don't see that happening. That's life.

They don't find anything contradictory in trying to force a woman to give birth if she does not want to but allowing the state to murder a living breathing human for crime(s) they may have committed. I say \"may have committed\" because we are finding out there have been innocent people executed for crimes they did not commit and people on death row for years that have been exonerated. It horrible to destroy a clump of cells, but perfectly fine to kill a human. People are so messed up it is unreal.

Using pro vs anti abortion is much clearer & to the point, too. Particularly for that small percentage that answered the survey stating \"I don't know what those terms mean\".\nFrom that I would also hazard a guess that a small percentage of respondents may have been confused by the terms used and unintentionally ticked the wrong box on the survey.\nAlthough pro-life = anti-choice, pro-choice does not mean anti-life.
