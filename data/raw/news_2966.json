My voting record shows this to be false.Zach NunnGuest columnistZach Nunn, the Republican candidate for Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, represents portions of Polk and Jasper counties in the Iowa Senate.This November, the future of our country will be determined by Iowa voters. Iowa\u2019s new 3rd District could\u00a0determine who controls Congress, and what priorities will become policy.\u00a0Congress\u2019\u00a0reckless spending is driving massive price hikes and other economic woes. Our congresswoman, Cindy Axne, cannot defend her votes to waste trillions of dollars on pork-filled bills that caused an inflation crisis, so she is cynically hoping that divisive social issues will be her ticket to re-election.The Supreme Court recently reversed Roe v. Wade, allowing the American people to decide the issue of abortion through their elected officials instead of unelected judges. This means Iowans again have the right to decide future policies related to abortion.As with other political discussions that are happening today, the issue of abortion is rarely given constructive, respectful discussions between opposing sides. This is why, as a candidate running to serve our community, I share the frustrations of many I\u2019ve spoken to on both sides of the issue who seek a compassionate and pragmatic discussion around life.\u00a0Another View:Cindy Axne: Reproductive rights are on the ballot. Leave government out of medical decisions.Let me be clear: I am pro-life and believe life begins at conception. I also believe we must be compassionate toward both women and unborn children. \u00a0Axne has falsely stated I would let a woman die to bear a child. This is untrue,\u00a0with a vote history to prove it. Axne has also taken out of context comments from a primary debate,\u00a0cutting out the important conversation that was had on protecting both the health of the mother and baby. This issue is too important: Iowans deserve to have their voices heard.\u00a0As an elected representative of my community, I led legislation to protect the mother and baby's life before, during, and after pregnancy. \u00a0I wholeheartedly support the sanctity of life and believe that life begins with conception, but I also understand that there are real-world scenarios that aren\u2019t black-and-white. There are medical emergencies that happen, like ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages, that are beyond our control. That is why the heartbeat bill I supported in the Legislature contained specific exceptions for horrific circumstances like rape,\u00a0incest and fetal abnormalities, and to save the life of the mother.More:Iowa asks state court to allow 'fetal heartbeat' abortion law to go into effectMore:3rd District candidate Zach Nunn calls for federal government to model Iowa's successGood people can disagree on this fraught issue.\u00a0I have fought for both pregnant women and their unborn children. Cindy Axne has fought against the safety of unborn children.Axne supports taxpayer funding for brutal late-term abortions when babies can feel pain. And Axne supports allowing abortion up until the moment before birth.\u00a0These views are extreme \u2014 and, unsurprisingly, underreported.\u00a0When you go to vote this fall, I implore you to look at our actual records. While I have fought for a compassionate approach toward both unborn babies and their mothers, Axne has fought for radical policies that would allow babies to be aborted as late as nine months into a pregnancy. \u00a0Iowa voters have a big decision this fall, and after taking both of our records on this issue into account, I hope they recognize\u00a0Axne\u2019s radical stance has no place in our state.Zach Nunn, the Republican candidate for Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, represents portions of Polk and Jasper counties in the Iowa Senate.Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote Your Event Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Licensing & Reprints Promote your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper Archives MilestonesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.desmoinesregister.com.
