Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, S. 311, sponsored Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska.\nLargely because of \u201cnearly unanimous Democratic opposition to the measures,\u201d as National Right to Life noted, neither measure received the 60 votes needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster and advance to a vote on passage.\n[hotblock]\nThe Pain-Capable bill, which would protect unborn children from late-term abortions, failed to advance by a vote of 53 to 44.\nThe Born-Alive bill failed to advance by a vote of 56 to 41. It would prohibit infanticide by ensuring that a child born alive following an abortion would receive the same degree of care to preserve her life and health as would be given to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.\n\u201cIt is appalling that even one senator, let alone more than 40, voted to continue the brutal dismemberment of nearly full-grown infants, and voted against protecting babies who survive abortion,\u201d said Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\n[hotblock2]\n\u201cOur nation is better than this, and the majority of Americans who support these bills must make their voices heard,\u201d he added in his statement.\nCarol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a statement issued following the votes: \u201cThese bills would have protected very developed, living unborn children who can feel pain and those babies who are born alive following an abortion who are often allowed to die from neglect.\u201d\n\u201cShame on pro-abortion Democrats for not being willing to even protect living babies that survive abortion or to protect late-term babies who feel the excruciating pain of abortion,\u201d she added. \u201cTheir constituents will want to know why they are willing to allow these horrors to continue.\u201d\nJennifer Popik, National Right to Life\u2019s legislative director, said that in the eyes of the law, \u201cbabies born after an abortion are considered separate individuals \u2026 and every effort should be made to preserve their lives.\u201d\n\u201cBabies capable of feeling pain are considered by the medical profession to be a \u2018second patient\u2019 and should be treated in the law as the pain-capable human beings that they are,\u201d she added.\nFather Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, and other pro-life leaders praised Graham and Sasse for sponsoring the bills and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, for setting the vote on the measures for Feb. 25.\n\u201cYou would think that those elected to public service would know the difference between serving the public and killing the public,\u201d Father Pavone said in a statement. \u201cWith few exceptions, that is apparently not the case among Democrats in the U.S. Senate, as once again, a largely party-line cloture vote failed to advance two key pro-life bills.\u201d\nIn pushing back against the bills, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and other Democrats said the Republicans were \u201cfabricating an infanticide narrative,\u201d when infanticide is already illegal in the U.S.\nSasse has noted several times that in 2002, Republicans and Democrats worked together to ensure that children born alive are recognized as persons under federal law. \u201cBut, unfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cfederal law does not criminalize the denial of care to babies who survive an abortion.\u201d\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
