Phillips, who identifies as bisexual, says she has been dating more women since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee esta historia en Espa\u00f1olPart 2 in a series on abortion in Texas. Find the rest of the series here.Among the dating apps Amanda Phillips has used, she prefers Hinge. The people, she says, seem nicer.Like many dating apps, Hinge lets users upload photos, answer prompts (\"My simple pleasures \u2026,\" \"I get myself out of a funk by \u2026\") and comment on others\u2019 profiles in the hopes of matching, chatting and eventually meeting in person.It\u2019s a practice in curation; you present a certain image of yourself and hope your ideal partner takes the bait. Phillips\u2019 profile consists of a couple selfies, a photo outdoors with a friend, a shot of her multicolored hair, plus her non-negotiables: bodily autonomy, Black Lives Matter and her 7-year-old son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nWith abortions banned, these Central Texans turned to permanent forms of birth control\n\n\n\nMarisa Charpentier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Listen \u2022 8:23\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy brand is cute, progressive single mom in Austin, Texas,\u201d Phillips, 28, said.This is the image Phillips projects of herself, one of a complex person. But she said she feels the state, which now outlaws nearly all abortions, only sees her as one thing: a person whose worth depends on her ability to reproduce. Living under this abortion ban has prompted Phillips to set the bar much higher when it comes to who she dates, even when she\u2019s dating casually.\u201cWhen I'm dating a man, I have to ask myself, am I worth more than $10,000 to them?\u201d she said.Phillips is referring to Senate Bill 8, the near-total ban on abortions that went into effect in Texas last year. The law allows citizens to sue someone who helped or encouraged a woman get an abortion. If their lawsuit is successful, they can claim up to $10,000.While SB 8 does not allow people to sue the person seeking an abortion, Phillips said it still feels like a bounty on her body.\u201cWould this man rape me for $10,000?\u201d she said. If Phillips got pregnant after being raped and sought an abortion, she explained, under SB 8 a man could sue anyone who helped her. \u201cI honestly haven't found many men that I trust who put me above that imaginary bounty.\u201dAbortion laws became even more restrictive after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. That move put in place Texas' so-called \"trigger law,\" which prohibits abortion except in the case that a woman's life is endangered.As a result of the bans, some Texans say they\u2019re having deeper conversations earlier on in dating \u2014 not just about contraception and potential pregnancy, but about values. The result can be increased intimacy, but also exhaustion, particularly among women.'That\u2019s a really big conversation to have'Annie Fichtner remembers a conversation she had this summer with a guy she had been dating for about a month. They were talking about how often he used condoms when having sex.\"'Yeah, I'll use it if the woman asks me to,\u2019\u201d she remembers him saying. \"I was like, \u2018Well, you should be using it anyway for your own protection, buddy,'\u201d she said.\n\n\n\"Now it's not just a conversation around, \u2018Did you bring a condom?\u2019 It's bringing up conversations of, \u2018Would you support me financially or emotionally if I needed to do something?'\"\nMadison Wise, therapist\n\n\n\n\nFichtner, 30, used to have an intrauterine device, more commonly known as an IUD. The small, T-shaped device is inserted into a person's uterus and blocks sperm by either releasing hormones or copper into the body.\u201cThe experience itself is quite painful, it's quite invasive,\u201d Fichtner said. \u201cBut it was worth it to me to not have to worry anymore. Not to have to worry about taking a pill every day and then not to have to worry about having access to birth control.\u201dBut she had her IUD removed last year after experiencing various side effects: abdominal pain as a result of ovarian cysts, plus constant heavy periods. Without some form of long-lasting birth control, Fichtner has been using diaphragms and condoms and tracking her fertility.So, when the person she was dating said he didn\u2019t always use condoms, the conversation moved to sexually transmitted infections and then contraception and then: What would happen if she were to get pregnant?\u201cIf anything were to happen, what would you do?\u201d Fichtner remembers asking. Roe v. Wade had just been overturned and most abortions had already been illegal in Texas for about a year. She hadn\u2019t necessarily thought about having this conversation until she found herself without access to abortion.\u201cIt's going to be quite the process if I need to [get an abortion]. Especially financially. Are you prepared to help out with that?\u201d she asked him.Some women have been traveling across the country to receive abortions, incurring the cost of flights and hotel rooms, not to mention the procedure. One patient who traveled from Texas to Minnesota paid more than $1,300, according to The New York Times.Madison Wise works as a licensed therapist with many people in their 20s and 30s who are dating. She said a ban on abortions may force someone to communicate about sex earlier \u2014 and on a deeper level.\u201cNow it's not just a conversation around, \u2018Did you bring a condom?\u2019 It's bringing up conversations of, \u2018Would you support me financially or emotionally if I needed to do something?\u2019\" she said. \"That's a really big conversation to have.\"And it\u2019s a conversation, Wise said, that often falls to women to initiate. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d she said.One result, Wise said, is that women may be dating more intentionally. They may be vetting peoples\u2019 values and politics when they first meet them, as opposed to weeks or months into knowing someone.\u201cIt might be a little bit of a higher turnover rate of first dates that just don't go anywhere, which is not a terrible thing in the long run,\u201d Wise said. \u201cYou can meet a more respectful partner quicker.\u201dCarrying the weightMike Arendt has also talked about sex and contraception earlier on in dating now that abortion is illegal in Texas.Arendt, who is going through a divorce, has been dating for several months. At 36, he has decided he doesn\u2019t want children. So, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Arendt called a urologist\u2019s office the next week to make good on a decision he\u2019d been thinking about for years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Minasi\n/\nKUTMike Arendt, who got a vasectomy after Roe v. Wade was overturned, says it has led to conversations about values more quickly while dating. \n\n\n\n\u201cI decided that it was past time to finally take my own bodily autonomy into my own hands,\u201d Arendt said. \u201cThat's why I decided to get a vasectomy.\u201dArendt, who uses dating apps, includes that he\u2019s had a vasectomy in his profile \u2014 among perhaps less consequential facts like that he keeps his toenails trim and is a good cook. When he matches with people, he said, his vasectomy is one of the first things they comment on.\u201cIt\u2019s usually something like, \u2018I really appreciate that you have a vasectomy,\u2019\u201d Arendt said. \u201cThat's usually a good entry point for conversations about shared values.\u201dAs a dating coach based in Austin, Shaina Singh said women she works with are now, perhaps more than before, looking for someone willing to shoulder the burden of having these hard conversations.\u201cA lot of people who are able to get pregnant seem to be carrying a lot of the weight, anxiety and worry around [the abortion ban],\u201d Singh said. She said now many of them are asking themselves: \u201c\u2018Hey, why is it that I am the one who continues to carry this weight and worry?\u2019\u201dThis isn't the first time she's seen a shift like this in dating. After the racial justice protests in 2020, Singh said, people started to be more discerning about shared values, even when casually dating, asking questions like, \"Where do you stand in terms of anti-racism and liberation? How invested are you in social justice?\"The abortion ban, she said, adds another layer. And it may even affect how people are choosing to meet.\u201cThe people who are not using dating apps \u2026 they are meeting people through some of their friends or community,\u201d Singh said. \u201cBecause a lot of these communities, these friend groups, these social groups tend to have some common values they are finding that they're still matching, they're still meeting.\u201d'It\u2019s just exhausting'Last weekend, Phillips planned two dates: coffee with an insurance agent whose profile included lots of gym photos, and another with an EMT who, after working a 24-hour shift, still had the energy to meet up.These dates were with men \u2014 which has been unusual recently for Phillips, who identifies as bisexual.\u201cI've dated a lot more women since Roe v. Wade,\u201d she said. \u201cThe women aren't asking me to go to their house on a first date. The women aren't arguing about birth control.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Minasi\n/\nKUTPhillips' cat, Cake, looks on as she browses through her favorite dresses to wear on dates. \n\n\n\nOn Friday morning, she sifted through dozens of dresses spread across two rooms in her house: a blue form-fitting one with a single strap, a red-striped one and another that was bright yellow with a cut-out below the breast bone.\u201cThis would be [for a] fourth date, if I could find anyone to go on a fourth date with,\u201d Phillips said, holding up the yellow dress. \u201cThis is expensive and nice. I look incredible and feel incredible in it. And, honestly, a lot of people don't deserve to see me in this.\u201dPhillips wasn\u2019t sure, though, if she\u2019d have the energy to go on dates this weekend. She was physically tired from the week, sure, but also dating as a woman living under an abortion ban can be tiring.\u201cAt a certain point, it's just exhausting,\" she said. \"And you're like, 'I'm just going to watch a movie and go to bed.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you found this reporting valuable, please\u00a0consider making a donation to support it.
