Secretary-General Antonio Guterres lashed out at men who abuse power and declared before Sunday\u2019s observances of International Women\u2019s Day that the fight for gender equality is \u201cthe biggest human rights challenge we face.\u201d\nTwenty-five years after 189 countries adopted a 150-page road map for achieving equality for women, a new report by UN Women says the reality is that millions of women still face poverty, discrimination and violence. It notes more than 70% of lawmakers and parliamentarians and managers are men and nearly 500,000 women and girls older than age 15 are illiterate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres speaks during a press briefing at United Nations headquarters, Feb. 4, 2020, in New York City.\n\n\n\nBias against women\nThe U.N. Development Program\u2019s new Gender Social Norms Index also had some bad news for women. It found that close to 90% of both men and women hold some sort of bias against women.\nAccording to the index, about half the world\u2019s men and women believe men make better political leaders and more than 40% think men make better business executives and have greater rights to a job. Further, 28% feel it is justified for a husband to beat his wife.\nGuterres told the U.N.\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day observance Friday that \u201cgender inequality is the overwhelming injustice of our day.\u201d\n\u201cDeep-rooted patriarchy and misogyny have created a yawning gender power gap in our economies, our political systems, our corporations, our societies and our culture,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen are still very frequently denied a voice; their opinions are ignored and their experience discounted.\u201d\nThe secretary-general cited examples in recent months, including high-profile peace agreements being signed with no women at the table and emergency health care meetings on the new coronavirus held with few or no women participating.\nScaled-down event\nInternational Women\u2019s Day is taking place a day before the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women holds a drastically scaled down one-day event so delegations in New York can adopt a draft political declaration commemorating the 25th anniversary of the 1995 U.N. conference in Beijing that adopted the wide-ranging plan to achieve gender equality.\nThe commission had been expecting up to 12,000 people from its 193 member nations to be at its annual meeting. But it decided to postpone the major event until a later date because of the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of a civil society take part in a pro-women demonstration ahead of Women's Day in Peshawar, Pakistan, March 7, 2020. Pakistani women plan to hold rallies to celebrate International Women's Day.\n\n\n\nBold platform, slow progress\nThe Beijing platform called for bold action in 12 areas for women and girls, including combating poverty and violence, ensuring all girls get an education, and having women at the top levels of business and government as well as at the table in peace negotiations.\nIt also said for the first time in a U.N. document that women\u2019s human rights include the right to control and decide \u201con matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.\u201d\nThe draft declaration expected to be adopted Monday reaffirms the Beijing platform for action and expresses concern \u201cthat overall, progress has not been fast or deep enough.\u201d It pledges to take \u201cconcrete action to ensure the full, effective and accelerated implementation\u201d of the road map.\nOlof Skoog, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat at the U.N., said the EU wasn\u2019t happy with the initial draft but \u201cwe played hardball, I think it\u2019s fair to say,\u201d to produce \u201cthe most detailed and action-oriented political declaration ever adopted\u201d by the commission.\nHe said there are advances in some areas and the declaration avoids \u201cbacktracking on some of the issues where there was huge push back.\u201d\nAmong those issues was the definition of the family, with traditionalists insisting on a mother, father and children and progressive countries wanting to include LGBT families as well, he said. Another was on how to mention sexual and reproductive health and rights for women.\nIn the end, Skoog said, direct references to both issues were dropped in the declaration. But since the declaration affirms the Beijing platform, what that document says about the family and women\u2019s rights and health will stand.\n\u2018Positive sign\u2019\nFrancoise Girard, president of the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, said it was critical that governments recommit fully to the Beijing platform and called it heartening that they did so. She said governments also recommitted to achieving U.N. goals for 2030 that include sexual and reproductive rights for women, \u201cso we feel that that is an extremely positive sign.\u201d\nWhat could really change the trajectory to achieve gender equality, Girard said, is ensuring that young girls can control their bodies, and there is still a long way to go.\n\u201cControlling your body \u2014 sexual and reproduction and free of violence \u2014 is critical to everything else,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to education, to employment, to political participation, to sitting on boards of companies. All these things won\u2019t happen unless you control your body.\u201d\nOn Friday, Guterres urged young women to keep up activism, and \u201cplease hold the world to account.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-five years after the Beijing conference, progress on women\u2019s rights has stalled and even reversed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must push back against the push back. ... It is more important than ever for men to stand up for women\u2019s rights and gender equality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMore Art & Culture News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Kung Fu Panda 4' No. 1 at Box Office for Second Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's March Madness, More People Can Legally Bet on Basketball Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsher, Fantasia Barrino, 'Color Purple' Honored at 55th NAACP Image Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian-Belarusian Band Returns to Stage After Detention in Thailand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Squid Game' Star Found Guilty of Sexual Misconduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Day in Photos \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS News\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\nAll About America\n\n\nSilicon Valley & Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThe Americas\n\n\nEast Asia Pacific\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOA Programs\n\n\nSpecial projects\n\n\nDay in Photos\n\n\nPress Freedom\n\n\nRefugees\n\n\nVOA News on Iran\n\n\nVOA News on China\n\n\nArts & Culture\n\n\nEconomy & Business\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nExtremism Watch\n\n\nStudent Union\n\n\nVOA Connect\n\n\n52 Documentary\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From VOA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOAAfrica.com Programs\n\n\nVOA Learning English\n\n\nPolygraph.info\n\n\nEditorials\n\n\nSatellite schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use & Privacy Notice\n\n\nAbout VOA\n\n\nGet VOA+\n\n\nVOA Around the World\n\n\nContact VOA\n\n\nMedia Relations\n\n\nUsage Requests\n\n\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nXS\nSM\nMD\nLG\n\n\n\n"
