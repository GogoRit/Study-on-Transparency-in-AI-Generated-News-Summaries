    "description": "Since Roe v. Wade fell, states with strict abortion bans are trying to reach outside their borders to keep their residents from getting abortions in other states. But legal observers say there\u2019s no precedent offering guidance about what would hold up in court. Arguments about the laws could be rooted in clauses of the U.S. Constitution that require states to respect the laws of other states. Or they could be argued based on potentially conflicting clauses that recognize the right to travel among states and that restrict the ability of states to impair interstate commerce.

The new law is obviously aimed at abortions obtained in other states, but it\u2019s written to criminalize in-state behavior leading to the out-of-state procedure \u2013 a clear nod to the uncertainty surrounding efforts by lawmakers in at least half a dozen states to extend their influence outside their borders when it comes to abortion law.At the same time, Democrat-controlled states are advancing and adopting laws and executive orders intended to shield their residents against civil lawsuits and criminal investigations related to providing abortions for women from states where there are bans.But there is no legal precedent giving good guidance about whether states can influence their residents getting abortions outside their borders.\n\n\u201cIf red states pass laws saying, \u2018We can go after people for X, Y and Z,\u2019 and blue states say, \u2018You can\u2019t,\u2019 we\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at the University of California, Davis School of Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArguments about the laws could be rooted in key clauses of the U.S. Constitution that could contradict each other in this case. One clause requires states to respect the laws of other states while another recognizes the right to travel among states and a third restricts the ability of states to impair interstate commerce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal experts say that no prior cases are exactly comparable, though state laws have conflicted in weighty ways in the past.https://apnews.com/video/politics-tennessee-religion-wilmington-state-government-bf9584284a664ce0b571e07ffb9f5548In the 1840s and 1850s, it was with questions over whether fugitive enslaved people in free states remained the property of slaveholders. In the 1857 Dred Scott decision, frequently cited as the worst ruling in U.S. history, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that they did.\n\nMore recently, before the nation\u2019s top court recognized a right to same-sex marriage in 2015, state marriage laws were a patchwork. Some states did not recognize marriages that were legal elsewhere, and all the protections that go with them, including hospital visitation rights and even the ability to divorce. The federal ruling largely resolved those legal conflicts.The effort to restrict abortion in far-reaching ways is an outgrowth of last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion.Each state now makes its own rules. Abortion is banned in all stages of pregnancy in 13 states. Another five have similar bans on the books but are not being enforced under judge\u2019s orders as legal challenges to them are sorted out.Texas took a step toward state-border restrictions even before Roe was overturned with a 2021 law that allows civil lawsuits against a person who \u201caids or abets the performance or inducement of abortion.\u201d It does not specify whether the aid would have to happen within Texas. Oklahoma has a similar law.But using them to block out-of-state abortions has not been tried yet \u2014 or tested in court.\n\nOther states are pursuing different approaches.Idaho\u2019s measure bans transporting a minor for an abortion without parental consent \u2014 but bars only the part of the journey that takes place in Idaho.Tennessee\u2019s GOP-dominated legislature last week approved a measure that would prohibit cities and counties from using their funds to help someone obtain an abortion outside the state \u2014 including banning coverage of out-of-state abortions under government employee health insurance plans.In his concurring opinion in last year\u2019s ruling overturning Roe, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh contemplated whether states could restrict their residents from getting abortions in other states: \u201cIn my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel,\u201d he wrote.Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, which supports abortion rights, said the validity of interstate laws is unclear.\n\n\u201dThe hope would be this would be seen as an extreme overreach,\u201d she said, \u201cbut one would have thought that overturning Roe v. Wade would have been an extreme overreach too.\u201dElisabeth Smith, state policy director for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the measures have impacts even if they don\u2019t hold up in court.\u201cWill anti-abortion activists continue to try to use these techniques and use these avenues?\u201d he asked. \u201dAbsolutely. Their goal in doing so is to try to chill activity and make those of us who support abortion rights too frightened to help people.\u201dOne possible test of the out-of-state applicability of abortion laws is just getting started in Texas.The former husband of a Galveston-area woman who terminated a pregnancy last year with medication sued three women who helped her obtain pills, claiming wrongful death. The lawsuit says the woman terminated the pregnancy in July 2022 and the couple divorced in February.\n\nA lawyer representing the ex-husband is Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general who is the architect of the law that uses civil penalties to enforce an abortion ban. As part of the suit, Mitchell sent a letter to the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice in New York City, demanding that it preserve documents. The letter said one of the women helping the ex-wife obtain abortion pills worked for the group and the organization would face questions about whether she was acting as part of her job.\u201cIf anyone out-of-state helps one of their employees break Texas laws, then you better believe that there can be action taken against that, against that company or organization,\u201d said Mark Lee Dickson, a Texas anti-abortion activist who has pushed successfully for local governments to bar abortion clinics. \u201cIf an individual assists Texans in breaking the laws of Texas, then that\u2019s a problem, too.\u201d___Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey and Hanna from Topeka, Kansas.
