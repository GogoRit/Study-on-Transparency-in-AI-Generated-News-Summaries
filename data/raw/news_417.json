Tens of thousands of people, gathering in defiance of pandemic restrictions, vented their frustration about the abortion ruling and more broadly at perceived restrictions on their freedoms under the right-wing ruling party, Law and Justice.With military gendarmes ordered to monitor the crowds, protesters demanded the Polish government\u2019s resignation.Protests against last week\u2019s court ruling also spread to other countries. People gathered at Poland\u2019s embassies in Stockholm, Lisbon and Rome in solidarity with Polish women.Poland, a mainly Catholic country, already had one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws. The ruling that declared it unconstitutional to terminate pregnancies for congenital defects amounts to a near-total ban.\n\nIn Warsaw on Wednesday, demonstrators marched from the office of Ordo Iuris, a conservative group that has been lobbying for years for a full abortion ban, to the parliament building, which was surrounded by police officers in riot gear. Large crowds also filled the streets in other major cities, including Krakow, Wroclaw, Szczecin and Lodz.\nIn parliament, Poland\u2019s most powerful politician, ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, lashed out at opposition lawmakers, accusing them from the podium of inciting people to protest during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are destroying Poland, Kaczynski told them. \u201cYou are exposing a lot of people to death, you are criminals.\u201dThe nationwide strike and protests have been largely organized by Women\u2019s Strike, a women\u2019s rights initiative. They come amid a deepening standoff between angry demonstrators and Poland\u2019s deeply conservative government, which pushed for last Thursday\u2019s court ruling and has vowed not to back down.\n\nOpinion polls show a majority of Poles oppose the constitutional court\u2019s ruling and the protesters have even found support from unexpected groups, including farmers and miners.Another opinion poll on Wednesday showed falling support for the Law and Justice party.\u201cI am so furious! They have no right to decide about my life, about my personal decisions, about my future,\u201d Julka Wojciechowska, 19, a student protesting in Warsaw, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand young people. They don\u2019t understand the world now, but they are trying to regulate our lives. We will never allow that.\u201dDaily protests since Poland\u2019s constitutional court issued its decision have exposed deep divisions in this central European nation of 38 million, long a bastion of conservative Catholicism and now undergoing rapid social transformation.Rage over the ruling, which would deny legal abortions to women even in cases of fatal birth defects, has been directed at the Roman Catholic Church and ruling party leader Kaczynski.Kaczynski has said in the past that pregnancies involving even fetuses that are badly damaged and have no chance of survival outside the womb should \u201cstill end up in a birth, so that the child can be baptized, buried, have a name.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, women entered Polish churches on Sunday to disrupt Masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings.Kaczynski accused protesters of seeking \u201cto destroy Poland\u201d late Tuesday and called on his party\u2019s supporters to defend churches \u201cat any cost.\u201dOn Wednesday, people heeded that call, gathering outside churches and singing religious songs, in hopes of drowning out the obscenity-filled chants of protesters.Some saw Kaczynski\u2019s words as an incitement to violence. The 71-year-old also holds the job of deputy prime minister in charge of police and security services.Donald Tusk, a former prime minister and European Union leader who is a harsh critics of Kaczynski, called for the country\u2019s current leaders to step back from their confrontation with their people.\u201cPoland is the worst prepared country for the autumn epidemic wave in the entire European Union,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cWhile others were getting ready for the war against the virus, you -- for the war against the nation. Withdraw from it before some tragedy occurs.\u201d \n\nThe conservative rulers have sought to depict the huge crowds of mostly young people led by women\u2019s rights activists as \u201cfascists.\u201d\u201cLeft-wing fascism is destroying Poland,\u201d read a Tuesday headline on state TV.Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski on Wednesday vowed \u201cdecisive action\u201d by the police \u201cin the face of further attempts of similar acts of aggression and desecration announced by the leaders and organizers of the protests.\u201dHe said 76 people were detained in connection with the protests at churches, and prosecutors are carrying out proceedings in 101 cases. People have been taking to the streets in massive numbers even as the coronavirus spreads fast, with a record 18,820 new cases and 236 new deaths over the past day. \n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda, who is in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, said he was saddened by the situation in the country.
