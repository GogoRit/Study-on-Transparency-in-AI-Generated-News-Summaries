Held on the 49th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade, which struck down the nation\u2019s anti-abortion laws, the events celebrated the sacredness of human life and sought a restoration of legal protections for the unborn. \u00a0\nThe San Francisco event is led and largely attended by Catholics; San Francisco\u2019s Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone was honored at the event and is a regular participant. The Los Angeles event is organized by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles; Los Angeles Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez speaks to walkers and participates in the event.\nStudents from Thomas Aquinas College (TAC) and Oregon State University\u2019s Newman Club led the San Francisco walk. Junior Sophia Ferri, who is from Nashville, Tennessee, was one of the more than 200 TAC students who participated in the event. \u201cThere was so much energy and love,\u201d said Ferri. \u201cWe walked through the streets chanting, \u2018We are the pro-life generation.\u2019\u201d\nThe weather was ideal, and other than a handful of counter-demonstrators, she said, the community members she encountered were friendly and seemed to welcome their presence. \u201cWe live in a democratic republic, and I believe a public demonstration of our beliefs is important to change minds and hearts,\u201d Ferri said. \u201cWe want to say that life begins at conception, and no matter who you are, your life matters, and you are a beloved child of God.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was TAC sophomore Maggie LaFond\u2019s first time at the Walk for Life West Coast, and she admitted that she was initially nervous about publicly demonstrating her pro-life beliefs. But she and her fellow students sang the Rosary for much of the walk, and she enjoyed her participation in support of the unborn. \u201cWe walked through the streets holding our signs and making friendly eye contact with the residents,\u201d LaFond said. \u201cWe were telling them we are here because we love women and babies. Not only were we well received, but I\u2019d say it was a life-changing experience.\u201d\nStephen Morris, director of youth ministry for the northern California Diocese of Santa Rosa, helped organize and turn out student participants for the day. \u201cIt was a joyous day and a wonderful experience,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt was beautiful to hear the singing and see the camaraderie.\u201d \nClockwise from top left: Scenes from OneLife LA: proclaiming, 'Forward in Hope'; religious attend One Life LA, the pro-life group is vast at Walk for Life West Coast, and pro-life families and religious came out for One Life LA.(Photo: Courtesy photos) \nAs pandemic fears reduced the numbers of walkers to several thousand a year ago, he was pleased that numbers had substantially rebounded this year: \u201cPeople are returning in hordes.\u201d\nHe added that the San Francisco police provided security for the walk, and the group enjoyed a friendly exchange with them. \u201cThey were smiling and seemed to enjoy our presence. I got the feeling that they were on our side.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the students attending with Morris was 18-year-old Michael Gonzalez, a senior at Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa. Gonzalez comes from a strongly pro-life family and was participating in his fourth walk. \u201cIt was great to see men and women of different ethnicities and backgrounds turn out for life,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI\u2019m particularly glad that so many young people like myself came out.\u201d\nEva Muntean, a walk organizer, estimated that 20,000 turned out for the 2022 walk. While this number is down from their pre-pandemic high of 50,000, it indicated to her that the cause was still important to many and that pandemic fears were easing. She noted that the rally talks were especially powerful this year, including remarks delivered by Christi Hockel Davenport, who has Down syndrome. \u201cChristi noted that babies with Down syndrome are often targets for abortion, but [their] lives still have value,\u201d Muntean said. \u201cShe gave the example of her own life and all she had accomplished.\u201d\nAlso notable was a presentation by Irene Zamorano-Archacki of the Silent No More campaign, according to Muntean. Zamorano-Archacki was six months pregnant and had a late-term abortion, but immediately regretted it. She related to the audience the pain she had in holding her dead baby after delivery, burying the child and telling her seven other children what had happened.\nMuntean\u2019s pastor, Father Joseph Illo, also joined the walk. He shared her enthusiasm for the speakers and remarked, \u201cIt was a fabulous event with great energy. It was prayerful and turned out many families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop Cordileone participated in the Knights of Columbus\u2019 \u201cVigil for Life\u201d the night before, Father Illo added, and the archbishop encouraged participants, \u201cKeep working for the gospel of life with consistency, charity and sound reasoning. \u2026 The pro-life movement is essentially evangelization of the people from the gospel of selfishness and personal autonomy to the Gospel of a loving and all-provident God. This God is with us, and so we should not be discouraged.\u201d\nLos Angeles\u2019 OneLife LA drew 4,000 participants this year, reported Michael Donaldson of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles\u2019 Office of Life, Justice and Peace. The eighth-annual event was held in person after the 2021 event was held online only. \u201cIt was a fabulous event,\u201d he said of Saturday\u2019s turnout, adding that \u201cwe had great weather and tremendous energy. Our speakers were outstanding, and it was wonderful hearing people say their Rosaries and Divine Mercy Chaplets as they walked.\u201d \nLos Angeles seminarians participate in OneLife LA on Jan. 22. \n\nArchbishop Gomez addressed participants and urged them to be vigilant in their advocacy of the protection of human life and expressed hope that an overturning of the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe decision would soon come. The archbishop said, \u201cOneLife LA reminds us of the beautiful truth that we are all children of God and that every life is sacred. We go forward in hope, in the spirit of OneLife LA, to create a civilization of love that celebrates and protects the beauty and dignity of all human life.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nwalk for life west coast\nonelife la\narchbishop salvatore cordileone\narchbishop jose gomez\n\n\n\n\nJim Graves Jim Graves is a Catholic writer and editor living in Newport Beach, California.
