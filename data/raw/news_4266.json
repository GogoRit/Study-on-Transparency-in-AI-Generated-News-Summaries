On May 5, parliament, where ruling party Fidesz has a two-thirds majority,\u00a0blocked ratification\u00a0of a regional treaty on violence against women.\nThe Council of Europe Convention on Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, known as the Istanbul Convention, establishes a\u00a0gold standard of inclusion, recognizing everyone\u2019s right to live free from violence, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, or other characteristics. It obliges state parties to uphold minimum standards for protection from and prevention and prosecution of violence against women.\nBut politicians in Hungary\u00a0claim the convention\u00a0promotes\u00a0\u201cgender ideology\u201d\u00a0\u2013 a term used to argue that gender equality undermines \u201ctraditional family values\u201d and encourages homosexuality. They also claim the convention\u2019s protection of migrant and refugee women contradicts Hungary\u2019s efforts to crackdown on irregular immigration.\nHungary\u2019s government has launched persistent attacks on\u00a0gender equality\u00a0and the rights of\u00a0lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people\u00a0and\u00a0asylum seekers and migrants\u00a0\u2013 all of which feed into a broader\u00a0backslide\u00a0on the rule of law in the country.\nHungary\u2019s justice minister Judit Varga\u00a0argues\u00a0that national laws already protect women victims of violence, but\u00a0women\u2019s groups\u00a0have long lamented insufficient services and poor police response to\u00a0rampant domestic violence.\nThis week\u2019s political maneuvers reflect a disturbing trend:\u00a0Bulgaria,\u00a0Slovakia, and\u00a0Latvia\u00a0have similarly refused to ratify the convention,\u00a0Poland\u00a0has\u00a0threatened to withdraw, and Slovakia has also\u00a0opposed\u00a0European Union accession to the convention.\nOver 20 percent of women in the EU have\u00a0reportedly\u00a0experienced domestic violence. In many countries, over 50 percent of women murdered die at the hands of partners or family members.\u00a0Reports\u00a0of domestic abuse have soared\u00a0across Europe\u00a0during the Covid-19 pandemic. Government resources to prevent violence against women and ensure services to support and protect victims can save lives, and they can\u2019t wait.\nThe European Commission President and Equalities Commissioner have both\u00a0prioritized\u00a0EU accession to the convention. They should speak out as member states deliberately try to derail this process and misrepresent the convention\u2019s essential protections for women.\nInstead of using inflammatory rhetoric to block needed measures, European governments should focus on keeping all women safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Domestic Violence \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKazakhstan: Women\u2019s Rights Activist Targeted with Dubious Fraud Charges \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKyrgyzstan: Domestic Violence Against Women, Girls with Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cViolence with Every Step\u201d\n\n\nWeak State Response to Domestic Violence in Tajikistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKazakhstan: Women\u2019s Rights Activist Targeted with Dubious Fraud Charges \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKyrgyzstan: Domestic Violence Against Women, Girls with Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
