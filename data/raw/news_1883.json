(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arkansas House Judiciary Committee rejected two proposed exceptions to the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban Thursday.\nHouse Bill 1670, sponsored by Rep. Ashley Hudson, D-Little Rock, would have added an exception in cases of incest, while House Bill 1684, sponsored by Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, would have added the health of the mother as an additional exception to Act 180 of 2019, broadening the definition of a \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d\nBoth bills failed on split voice votes.\nAct 180 is one of the nation\u2019s strictest abortion bans, with the sole exception \u201cto save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency.\u201d The law went into effect in June 2022, the same day the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left abortion access up to individual states.\nOklahoma\u2019s Supreme Court ruled on March 21, the day before Garner filed House Bill 1684, that exceptions for the health of the mother were allowed under the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\nHowever, the conservative Family Council said March 22 that the bill would \u201ceffectively legalize elective abortion\u201d in Arkansas.\nRep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, made a similar comment during the committee meeting. \n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we start abortion again in Arkansas, it will not end,\u201d she said.\nHowever, waiting until a patient\u2019s life is in danger before administering treatment violates medical professionals\u2019 standard of care, which is usually considered medical malpractice, Garner told the committee in response to questions from Hudson.\nGarner added that some physicians are leaving or choosing not to live in Arkansas because of the risk of either breaking the law for properly treating a patient or following the law at patients\u2019 expense.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to think beyond the imminent danger of health and allow our medical professionals to take care of their patients,\u201d said Garner, a retired oncology nurse.\nAli Taylor and Karen Musick, representatives of the Arkansas Abortion Support Network, spoke for the bill, and no one spoke against it.\nMusick used to escort pregnant Arkansans to and from abortion clinics before Roe v. Wade was overturned. She shared stories of women who received abortions because they had cancer, multiple sclerosis or other health problems that meant carrying a pregnancy to term would have killed them.\n\u201cWomen spend most of our lives trying to not get pregnant or trying to get pregnant,\u201d Musick said. \u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming responsibility that becomes even more critical when your choices are to live or to die. If those are taken away from you, where\u2019s our compassion?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nTaylor asked the same question, adding that most people who receive abortions already have children.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to extend the compassion you feel for the unborn to the children that are already here,\u201d Taylor said.\nRep. Marcus Richmond, R-Harvey, said he was \u201csympathetic\u201d to the issue but voted against the bill because he thought its language should have been \u201ctighter.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be such an arbitrary thing that anybody who\u2019s wanting to perform an abortion will be able to make some claim somehow that their health is being affected, and they can find somebody who will support that,\u201d Richmond said.\n Protecting children\n\nHudson said House Bill 1670 would have created a \u201csmall exception\u201d applicable under \u201cvery limited circumstances\u201d and primarily aimed at children under 16, the age of sexual consent in Arkansas.\nAct 180 gives pregnant minors who are victims of sexual violence no other option but to give birth, Hudson told her fellow committee members. Children might not be physically capable of giving birth and could either die or have lifelong physical disabilities as a result, and they might not qualify for the exception in the law, she said.\n\u201cThat mother has to be very much on the brink of death in order to qualify, and in many cases, the harm to the child is not readily apparent [and] would not happen immediately,\u201d Hudson said.\nShe added that the state has the nation\u2019s highest percentage of pregnancies in children under 15 years old and that 2.4% of all minors who become pregnant in the United States are from Arkansas.\nHudson reminded the committee that lawmakers have said repeatedly this legislative session that protecting children should be a high priority.\n\n  Toni Rose (right), co-founder of the faith-based nonprofit An American Speaks, speaks against House Bill 1670, sponsored by Rep. Ashley Hudson (left), D-Little Rock, before the House Judiciary Committee on March 30, 2023. The bill would have added an exception for cases of incest to the state\u2019s abortion ban. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)\n\nToni Rose, director of the Arkansas Legislative Prayer Caucus and co-founder of the faith-based nonprofit An American Speaks, was the sole witness against the bill and called it \u201cviolence answered with violence.\u201d\nShe said incestuous sexual predators would be able to \u201celiminate the evidence\u201d of their acts of violence if they can repeatedly take their victims to receive abortions under the proposed law.\nNo one testified in favor of the bill.\n Other abortion legislation\n\nSeveral bills pertaining to abortion were filed during or after last week\u2019s Spring Break, including one from Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville. House Bill 1786 would specify that abortions to save the life of the mother would only be legal if they are performed in a hospital or emergency room.\nAdditionally, Senate Bill 466 would ban public and charter schools from providing or offering referrals for abortions. The Senate passed the bill along party lines Thursday with 27 Republicans voting for it, all six Democrats voting against it, and the remaining two Republicans not voting.\nSenate Minority Whip Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, said on the Senate floor that the bill is \u201cnot necessary government\u201d and would ban something that simply \u201cis not happening.\u201d\nTwo bills were filed last week pertaining to abortion medication as a federal judge in Texas is set to decide whether to ban the abortion drug mifepristone.\nHouse Bill 1686 from Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, would \u201cprohibit chemical abortions\u201d and create the Arkansas Chemical Abortions Ban Act, according to the one-sentence shell bill. He declined to comment about whether another bill is forthcoming.\nSen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, is sponsoring a bill that would revoke physicians\u2019 medical licenses if they are found to violate state law pertaining to the administration of abortion-inducing medication. Senate Bill 463 passed the Senate with a party-line vote Tuesday.\nThe sole abortion-related bill in Arkansas that has become law so far this year is Act 310, which will create a \u201cmonument to the unborn\u201d on state Capitol grounds.\nEarlier this month, the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee rejected a proposed exception to the state\u2019s abortion ban for cases of fetal abnormalities \u201cincompatible with life.\u201d\nHouse Bill 1301, sponsored by Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, would have allowed physicians to induce labor in rare cases when a fetus has a condition that prevents living beyond a few hours after delivery, if at all. Representatives from the Family Council spoke against House Bill 1301 before the committee\u2019s vote.\nTwo more abortion-related bills have not been heard in committee since being introduced early in the session. House Bill 1174 would charge abortion recipients and their doctors with homicide, and Senate Bill 261 would create tax credits for fetuses.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLawmakers reject two proposed exceptions to Arkansas\u2019 abortion ban\nby Tess Vrbin, Arkansas Advocate March 30, 2023\nLawmakers reject two proposed exceptions to Arkansas\u2019 abortion ban\nby Tess Vrbin, Arkansas Advocate March 30, 2023\n The Arkansas House Judiciary Committee rejected two proposed exceptions to the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban Thursday.\nHouse Bill 1670, sponsored by Rep.
