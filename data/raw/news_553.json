Henry McMaster signs into law a bill banning almost all abortions in the state Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021, in Columbia, S.C.\t\t\n\nBy Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.comPUBLISHED: February 18, 2021 at 4:02 p.m. | UPDATED: February 18, 2021 at 9:02 p.m.South Carolina\u2019s governor on Thursday signed a bill banning most abortions, one of his top priorities since he took office more than four years ago. Planned Parenthood immediately sued, effectively preventing the new law from taking effect.\nThe \u201cSouth Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,\u201d is similar to abortion restriction laws that a dozen states have previously passed. All are tied up in court. Federal law, which takes precedence over state law, currently allows abortion.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of happy hearts beating across South Carolina right now,\u201d Republican Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed during a ceremony at the Statehouse attended by lawmakers who made the proposal a reality.\nImmediately after he signed  the bill, a group of legislators and members of the public, standing shoulder to shoulder and wearing masks to protect against the coronavirus, began singing the words \u201cPraise God\u201d to the tune of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\n\nThe House passed the bill by a 79-35 vote on Wednesday after hours of emotional speeches from both supporters and opponents, and gave the measure final approval on Thursday. Moments after the Thursday vote, Planned Parenthood announced that it was filing a lawsuit. The South Carolina law, like those of other states that are currently being challenged, is \u201cblatantly unconstitutional,\u201d said Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signs into law a bill banning almost all abortions in the state Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021, in Columbia, S.C.\nSupporters of restrictive abortion laws are trying to get the issue before the U.S. Supreme Court in the hopes that \u2014 with three justices appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump \u2014 the court could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision supporting abortion rights. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that abortion is legal until a fetus is viable outside the womb \u2014 months after a heartbeat can be detected, Black noted. \n\n\nState bills to restrict or ban abortion \u201care plainly absurd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no other way around it.\u201d\nSouth Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson issued a statement Thursday saying that his office \u201cwill vigorously defend this law in court because there is nothing more important than protecting life.\u201d He stood near McMaster as the governor signed the bill. \n\n\nAbortion opponents have pushed for the ban for years, but it got stuck on a procedural hurdle in the Senate. Republicans gained three seats in the Senate in November\u2019s election and the bill was tabbed \u201cSenate Bill No. 1\u201d to show it was the top priority.\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to do what I\u2019ve been trying to do for 25 years: shut down the abortion industry in South Carolina,\u201d Republican Sen. Larry Grooms said moments before the governor signed the bill.\nDemocrats say Republicans wasted taxpayer money by passing a bill that everyone knew would be challenged in court. They also argue that there are more important issues needing their attention, such as COVID-19, health care and education.\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of the hypocrisy,\u201d said House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford. Rutherford said Democrats have also had enough of lawmakers across the aisle telling them they don\u2019t care about life.\n\u201cWe care about life until death. We care about birth. \u2026 We care about people eating, people not dying because they can\u2019t get vaccines,\u201d he said.\nThe lawsuit by Planned Parenthood and The Center for Reproductive Rights argues that South Carolina\u2019s new law \u201cis in flagrant violation of nearly five decades of settled Supreme Court precedent.\u201d The suit says a high rate of women, especially African Americans, die during or immediately after childbirth in South Carolina. The abortion ban would fall hardest on low-income women, who wouldn\u2019t be able to travel to a nearby state where abortion is still permitted, the suit says.\nA hearing to determine if the law should be suspended while the lawsuit is being heard is scheduled for Friday afternoon.\nLike Democratic lawmakers, Black said the focus on abortion not only wastes money by fighting established law, but also ignores a host of other important issues.\n\u201cIf lawmakers are really interested in making lives better, we have a long list of priorities they can focus on,\u201d she said.\nSouth Carolina\u2019s law requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus. If one is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\nThe measure does not punish a pregnant woman for getting an illegal abortion, but the person who performed the abortion could be charged with a felony, sentenced up to two years and fined $10,000 if found guilty.\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMore in News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSUBSCRIBER ONLY\n\n\nNational Politics |  \n\n\t\t\tTrump is making the Jan. 6 attack a cornerstone of his bid for the White House\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNational Politics |  \n\n\t\t\tTrump says Jews who vote for Democrats \u2018hate Israel\u2019 and their religion\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe spring equinox is here.
