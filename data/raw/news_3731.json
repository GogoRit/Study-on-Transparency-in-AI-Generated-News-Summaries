On an auditorium stage, a series of sweetly corny, retro-style performances takes place: a trio of crooning letter-sweater-wearing boys; a rhinestone-suited Elvis impersonator; a crew of clean-cut, poodle-skirted, bobby-socked dancers. But the tone shifts when a dark-haired girl with an acoustic guitar steps out to perform a cover version of \u201cHe\u2019s Got the Power,\u201d by the early-sixties girl group the Exciters. She is dressed in a pink satin bomber jacket, with her eyelids painted in gold glitter, but her voice is pure anguish, and the originally upbeat song turns, in her hands, into a howl. \u201cHe makes me do things I don\u2019t want to do / He makes me say things I don\u2019t want to say / And even though I want to break away / I can\u2019t stop saying I adore him / I can\u2019t stop doing things for him,\u201d she sings. \u201cHe\u2019s got the power / the power of love over me.\u201dThe girl is Autumn Callahan (Sidney Flanigan), and this is the first and last time during the movie in which she will be so overtly expressive. \u201cSlut!\u201d a boy in the audience cough-yells, interrupting Autumn\u2019s song halfway, and though she finishes her performance, this destabilizing slur, coupled with the song\u2019s lyrics, echo the oppressive circumstances that conspire to mute her. Like Hittman\u2019s previous films\u20142013\u2019s \u201cIt Felt Like Love\u201d and 2017\u2019s \u201cBeach Rats\u201d\u2014\u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always\u201d explores the ways in which an alienated young person in difficult circumstances is kept from articulating her needs and desires, not just by her own youth and na\u00efvet\u00e9 but by the cruel diktats of the world around her. Autumn, we soon grasp, is pregnant, and the movie focusses tightly on her journey to dismantle the ticking time bomb of this pregnancy, as she and her cousin and friend, Skylar (Talia Ryder), travel to New York from their small, grimly post-industrial Pennsylvania town in an attempt to procure an abortion.I met up with Hittman, who is forty, in late February, to discuss her film. It was the week leading up to its New York release, and, initially, we had planned to walk around the Port Authority Bus Terminal, where Autumn and Skylar shelter miserably when they run low on funds. The arrival of the coronavirus, however, had foiled that plan (much like it would soon come to foil the movie\u2019s theatrical run\u2014it is now streaming online), and Focus Features, the studio that had distributed the film, arranged for us to meet for lunch, instead, at the tony restaurant situated in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, in midtown. From the height of the thirty-fifth floor, where we sat, the city gleamed like a magnificent but far-off artifact, very different from the grimy, close-at-hand, sometimes menacing version of New York that is depicted in the film. \u201cOne movie I was thinking about when I was making this was [Robert] Bresson\u2019s \u2018A Man Escaped,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Hittman told me. \u201cWhere you see, in very physical and tactile detail, a man\u2019s journey to set himself free from prison.\u201d Like Bresson\u2019s protagonist, a member of the French Resistance whose minute exertions to break out of his jail cell that movie painstakingly follows, Autumn is unswervingly determined to free herself of the burden of unwanted pregnancy, beginning with a painful-to-watch attempt at a self-induced miscarriage, continuing with a fruitless pursuit of local assistance at a pro-life clinic, and culminating with an exhausting journey across state lines, once she realizes that, as a minor, she cannot have an abortion in Pennsylvania without parental permission.In its profound sensitivity to everyday detail, \u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always\u201d makes the viewer aware of the mundane challenges that dog every step its heroines manage to take along that path\u2014from the large, cheap suitcase bumped along with difficulty on subway steps, to the dwindling-down-to-nothing funds in a secreted-away pouch, to the flutter-lidded, late-night dozes taken on the subway, in lieu of a place to stay, waiting out the hours until finally, blessedly, the abortion might be over and done with. (The film serves as the d\u00e9but of Flanigan as well as of Ryder, and they are both excellent, giving performances that are affecting because of\u2014rather than in spite of\u2014their understated tone.) Hittman told me that she didn\u2019t want to focus on what brought on Autumn\u2019s moment of crisis. We never learn who impregnated her, or what exactly happened with the boys at school, or even what she is like when she is not experiencing the extreme duress of a crisis. Instead, the director decided to zero in on the crisis itself. \u201cIt was about showing the active obstacles in Autumn\u2019s way,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to make it as slice of life as possible. She\u2019s trying to tackle what she can tackle, undo what\u2019s been done.\u201d With the extremely limited emotional and practical resources at Autumn\u2019s disposal, her expectations are simultaneously reduced and barely achievable.Watching Hittman\u2019s films, I found them fairly removed from most contemporary American fare, and, perhaps, more reminiscent of a certain vein of naturalistic European cinema, like that of the Belgian Dardenne brothers or the Romanian Cristian Mungiu, with its minor-scale but politically resonant explorations of issues of class and gender. And yet the realities of young people\u2019s lives that Hittman depicts in her work are at the heart of current-day American society. \u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always\u201d is scant of dialogue, and Autumn and Skylar are rarely introspective. In her work, the director has remained dedicated to exploring the inner lives of kids whose feelings, though intense, are often a mystery not just to their peers and elders but to their own selves as well: \u201c\nIt\u2019s about giving the audience insight into what the issue is, and then watching the characters fumble through the world,\u201d she told me. But \u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always\u201d still allows for an intimate look at an oppressive American landscape, whose prejudices and inequalities inform its characters\u2019 most minute interactions and gestures. It\u2019s a movie whose political significance works in tandem with its deep interest in the human element.Autumn and Skylar are young working-class women in what Hittman portrays as, still, very much a man\u2019s world, and their truncated resources and opportunities\u2014geographically, economically, socially\u2014make that world that much smaller. We can see it at the local supermarket, where they work as cashiers, and where they must jokingly brush off older customers\u2019 come-ons, and silently withstand the harassment of their manager, their faces tight with disgust as they stoically slip him their till\u2019s balance while he covers their hands in kisses. We see it in Autumn\u2019s relationship with her frustrated, hostile father, who chides the hungry-for-affection family dog for being a \u201cslut\u201d (\u201cLook how easy she is,\u201d he crows); we see it in Skylar\u2019s acquiescence to the amorous demands of a worldlier, wealthier boy the two girls meet on their way to New York, and in their understanding that this is simply the price a woman in a rough spot must pay in order to negotiate the help of a man. And, of course, we see it in the more abstract machinations of the systems dedicated to women\u2019s reproductive health, in which care is obtained precariously, if at all, and where the ability to make decisions is so often taken out of a woman\u2019s hands. Watching \u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always,\u201d I sometimes found it hard to retain hope for its protagonists on their grim quest, but, for Hittman, the movie is not completely pessimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a self-destructive character,\u201d she told me, and the end offers the audience a measure of release. \u201cFor the moment, we can experience some peacefulness with her.\u201dNaomi Fry is a staff writer at The New Yorker.More:Movie ReviewFilmAbortionTeen-Agers (Teenagers)Goings OnWhat we\u2019re watching, listening to, and doing this week, online, in N.Y.C., and beyond.
