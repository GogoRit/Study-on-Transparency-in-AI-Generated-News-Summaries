I\u2019m here because my life was changed through my kids. We\u2019re here for peace. We\u2019re here for love. We\u2019re here to spread God\u2019s love to everybody.\u201dAnti-abortion demonstrators kicked off the event at 1 p.m. at the intersection of 14th Street and San Jacinto Boulevard with a march to the Capitol.State Rep. Jeff Leach; U.S. Rep. Chip Roy; and Sylvia B. Johnson-Matthews, the Houston Pregnancy Help Center\u2019s chief executive officer, were just a few of the speakers who spoke during the rally that followed.Claire Culwell, who introduced herself to the crowd as an abortion survivor, also spoke at Saturday\u2019s rally about her journey to find her birth mother, which she said ended with the revelation that her twin died from the abortion.\u201cI can tell you what it felt like to look into my birth mother\u2019s eyes and realized I survived something that was meant to take my life, and that I was walking around every single day for 21 years not knowing I was a twin-less twin in the name of choice,\u201d Culwell said.\u201cThere is a face, a name and a story with that unborn baby,\u201d she continued. \u201cToday, when you look at my face, you are literally looking at my twin. You are literally looking at that unborn child.\u201dAmy O\u2019Donnell, communications director for Texas Rally for Life, said the mission of the annual event was to \u201cshow the media and our elected officials that Texas is pro-life.\u201dO\u2019Donnell said it was also to commemorate the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that established a woman\u2019s legal right to an abortion.Texas Department of Public Safety troopers estimated the crowd size Saturday as being between 5,000 to 6,000 people. A handful of abortion rights supporters also briefly stood at the front gates of the Capitol before the rally began.The Texas rally comes a day after President Donald Trump made history as the first sitting president to attend the March for Life rally in Washington.During Trump\u2019s speech Friday, he said the event\u2019s mission was to \u201cdefend the right of every child born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential.\u201d\u201cYoung people are the heart of the March for Life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation.\"Miles Sheahan, who held a sign Saturday at the Austin rally that read \u201cMy generation will end abortion,\u201d echoed Trump\u2019s remarks. Sheahan said he opposed abortion because he felt unborn children had the right to life.\u201cI feel like we need to defend the voiceless,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do it for them.\u201dCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Austin American-Statesman Store Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.statesman.com.
