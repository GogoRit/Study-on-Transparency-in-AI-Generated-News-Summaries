At the same time they consider the idea of an anti-abortion progressive an absurdity.\n\n\nIn New Hampshire Feb. 9, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders,\u00a0said\u00a0that \"being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat\" and vowed to nominate judges who would be 100% behind Roe v. Wade. One of his goals, he said, is to \"codify\" Roe into law and expand Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\nA few days earlier, Pete Buttigieg, pressed by Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life, on whether the party might moderate its language to welcome folks who want to reduce the number of abortions, answered bluntly, \"I'm not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you. I am pro-choice, and I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision.\"\u00a0\nMeanwhile the Republican Party, which calls itself pro-life, has become an obstacle to life on any issue but abortion. Its current leader, Donald Trump, has become best known for putting children in cages or letting them\u00a0die in detention\u00a0while apart from their parents. His social welfare policies have put the more than 140 million Americans who live in poverty at risk.\nBut purely from a political viewpoint, it's the Democrats who are the bigger puzzle. They seem to be doing everything they can to lose independent voters (like me) and Republican refugees \u2014 those voters Buttigieg calls \"future former Republicans,\" not to mention the 29% of Democrats \u2014 some 20 million people by some estimates \u2014who call themselves pro-life. (Another 59% support at least some restrictions on abortion, according to Gallup.)\nIt's little wonder that the Democratic candidate that was surging over the weekend, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar,\u00a0made headlines\u00a0by taking a different angle. \"I am strongly pro-choice,\" she said. \"I have always been pro-choice. But I believe we're a big-tent party, and there are pro-life Democrats, and they are part of our party. I think we need to build a big tent. We need to bring people in instead of shutting them out.\"\nNot so long ago, \"big tent\" language on abortion was the official Democratic Party line. The platform of the Democratic National Committee said that abortion should be \"legal, safe, and rare\" and that we should all be working together to make it rarer and rarer. In my home state of Pennsylvania \u2014 one of the swing states that went for Trump in 2016 \u2014 this kind of rhetoric still draws voters, as Pennsylvania's Sen. Bob Casey, who has won on a pro-life platform, can attest.\nPro-life voters are not just white evangelicals but a diverse demographic slice of the American population. Abortion weighs heavily on how many Catholics, Latinx, African American and Asian Christians as well as Jewish and Muslim voters decide on a candidate. And even in their advocacy for life, they are moderates: Many pro-lifers do not want to overturn Roe v. Wade but want to see the number of abortions reduced, in part by providing adequate healthcare and other services to people facing the somber decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWe don't hear about this in part because of the partisan dualism of pro-choice versus pro-life. Trump is better than perhaps any other recent president at exploiting single-issue voters, convincing them that his appointment of federal judges is enough reason to turn a blind eye to everything else he does.\u00a0\nReligious pundits like Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress abet him by hailing Trump as the most pro-life president in American history, even as he assassinates a foreign leader days before speaking at the March for Life and celebrates countries like China who execute citizens for drug offenses just a day after speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast.\nLiberals and conservatives who care about life need to overcome the politicization of life issues to find common ground. All of us who are pro-life should continue to care about abortion, but we should care just as passionately about all the other issues that are destroying the lives and squashing the dignity of children whom God created and loves so deeply. It's not enough to make the womb a safe place if the child is in deeper trouble as soon as it is born.\u00a0\nWouldn't it be beautiful to have a pro-life movement that worked to reduce abortions but also stood just as passionately against the death penalty, gun violence, militarism and war, the degradation of creation, police brutality and all other things that destroy life? That would truly be a pro-life movement. To be pro-life is not only about protecting the unborn but also about supporting folks after they are born.\nAll Americans who have compassion for mothers, who fight for health care and preserve the right to terminate a pregnancy should consider the power of the consistent ethic of life, which has been a helpful ethical framework for centuries, and help to make abortion something that happens in extreme, exceptional conditions.\u00a0\nOne of the most important questions for this election is: Can we have a better conversation about abortion? We are tired of death. We also are tired of a two-party system that is very inconsistent when it comes to this ethic of life. It creates a quagmire for all of us for whom life is our ultimate value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMost Read Stories\n\n\n \n\n#1 New combative faith group to host 'Catholic prayer' for Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n \n\n#2 Attacking Pope Francis, anonymous cardinal seeks to curb the influence of his papacy\n \n\n#3 Here in the US, Catholicism is for sale\n \n\n#4 The Catholic Church needs married priests now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanRome biblical and Eastern institutes merged with Gregorian UniversityByCindy WoodenCatholic News Service\n \n\nNewsLife-threatening safety concerns keep Burkina Faso Catholics away from Sunday MassByTonny OnyuloOSV News\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanThe first outside legal analyses of Vatican's 'trial of the century' are in, and they're criticalByNicole WinfieldAssociated Press\n \n\nFrancis, the comic stripVaticanFrancis, the comic stripByPat Marrin\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR's Free NewslettersSelect any of the newsletters below, then enter your email address and click \"subscribe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per dayDaily Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updates: The latest news and feature articles\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Daily: (the latest articles, sent every morning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per weekWeekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Weekly: NCR staff talk music, television, books, movies and more\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Weekly: Environment editor Stephanie Clary dives into the week's climate change news\n\n\n\nMichael Sean Winters: The nexus between religion and politics\n\n\n\nNCR Book Club: Find your latest book to read\n\n\n\nScripture for Life: Reflections on the Sunday readings\n\n\n\nSunday Resources: Reflections on the readings sent two months ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x WeeklyBiweekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Francis Chronicles: Get to know the pope's pastoral side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Sections\n\n\nNCR Sections\n\n\nNews\n\n\nVatican\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSpirituality\n\n\nSunday Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Channels\n\n\nEarthBeat\n\n\nGlobal Sisters Report\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Menu\n\n\nWays to Give\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nYour NCR Legacy\n\n\nFriends & Tributes\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR\n\n\nRenew Subscription\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\nFree Newsletters\n\n\neNCR and Kindle Edition\n\n\nRequest a sample issue\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nHow to write for NCR\n\n\nLetters to Editor\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\n\nChange your address\n\n\nReprints\n\n\n\n\nAbout NCR\n\n\nMission & Values\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nStaff and Contributors\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nDonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Catholic Reporter\nFollow\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTikTok\n\n\nAdvertising Guidelines / \n  Terms of Use / \n  Privacy Policy / \n  Site Map\n/ Mailing Address: 115 E Armour Boulevard Kansas City, MO 64111 / Phone Number: +1-800-444-8910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
