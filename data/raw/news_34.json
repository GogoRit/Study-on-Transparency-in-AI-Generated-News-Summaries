Apr. 14, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n print\n write a letter\n\n\n\n              A courtroom at the historic John Minor Wisdom U.S. Courthouse in New Orleans, home of the 5th Circuit. (Image via Library of Congress)  \n\nIn a series of dizzying legal twists and turns over state officials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 draconian decision to ban abortion amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has reinstated medication abortion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for now.\nSince March 23, abortion has been largely unavailable in Texas, for the first time since 1972. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when Attorney General Ken Paxton, following an order from Gov. Greg Abbott, deemed abortion care a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-essential\u00e2\u0080\u009d procedure that must be placed on hold, supposedly to conserve medical resources. Reproductive health advocates and providers have called the move \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploitation\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the public health crisis to achieve the anti-choice agenda.\nProviders represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Lawyering Project, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, filed suit in Austin; while U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel initially blocked the ban, the conservative 5th Circuit almost immediately overruled that order. A few days later, Yeakel allowed providers to resume medication abortion as well as procedures for patients who would be unable to access abortion due to gestational age by April 22 (when Abbott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order would expire). Again, the 5th Circuit struck the order down.\nAbortion providers then, on April 11, sought emergency relief to allow medication abortion from the U.S. Supreme Court. Countering the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main argument for banning procedures during the COVID-19 emergency, providers argued that patients will require more medical resources if they cannot obtain an early abortion and remain pregnant. Medication abortion, they noted, can be provided without any personal protective equipment (PPE) or hospital space. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no evidence that prohibiting medication abortions will conserve hospital capacity or PPE to fight COVID-19. In fact, forcing Texans to travel out of state for abortion care or to remain pregnant for additional weeks (or months if the Executive Order is extended) harms public health by increasing the amount of PPE required to provide abortion or pregnancy-related care to patients, further straining hospital capacity, and increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission as anxious patients fly or drive hundreds of miles across state lines to attempt to obtain abortion services,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote to SCOTUS. \nOn Monday, April 13, the 5th Circuit changed its tune, ruling that Texas failed to make a strong showing as to why Abbott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order should apply to medication abortion. In his concurrence, U.S. Circuit Judge James Dennis, appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to enforce the medication ban despite the executive order\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009capparent inapplicability\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong indication\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the enforcement is simply a pretext that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear a \u00e2\u0080\u009creal or substantial relation to the public health crisis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo, for now, the two-pill process to terminate pregnancy up to 10 weeks of gestation is once again legal. However, surgical abortion procedures remain unavailable to Texas patients unless their gestational age will exceed the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal limit by April 22. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince Gov. Abbott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Executive Order went into effect, hundreds of Texans seeking time-sensitive, essential abortion have faced ongoing anxiety and uncertainty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dyana Limon-Mercado, executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is shocking but unsurprising that [Abbott and Paxton] have used the current global health pandemic to try and advance their extremist political agenda.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\n\nGot something to say on the subject?
