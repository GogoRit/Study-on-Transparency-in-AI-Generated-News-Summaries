The bill as drafted would continue to deny many pregnant people the right to make their own choices about whether to continue a pregnancy.\nThe government\u2019s hand was forced in April 2019 when the Constitutional Court ruled that South Korea\u2019s existing legislation on abortion was unconstitutional. Human Rights Watch filed an amicus (\u201cfriend of the court\u201d) brief in that case. The court set the deadline of December 2020 for the National Assembly to reform the law. Activists have pushed for reform for years.\nUnder current South Korean law, procuring or providing\u00a0an abortion is a crime under most circumstances. A person who undergoes an abortion risks a prison sentence of up to a year or a fine of up to 2 million won (US$1,850). Healthcare workers who provide abortions face up to two years in prison. There are exceptions, for instance in cases of rape or incest, if continuing the pregnancy might jeopardize the woman\u2019s health, or if the woman or spouse has certain hereditary or communicable diseases. Married women must have their husband\u2019s permission for an abortion.\nThe proposed law would end criminalization of abortions before the 14th week. Up to the 24th week, pregnant people would be permitted to obtain an abortion in cases of rape or for social, economic, or health reasons, subject to mandatory counselling and a 24-hour \u201cconsideration period.\u201d The law would remove the requirement that husbands consent.\nThese reforms are a step forward, but the government is missing a chance to fully reform the law by decriminalizing all abortion. When governments restrict abortion, women still have abortions \u2013 they just have more dangerous ones. According to the United Nations, in 2011 the average unsafe abortion rate was more than four times greater in countries with restrictive abortion policies than in countries with liberal abortion policies.\nThe bill is subject to a 40-day comment period before it goes to the National Assembly. President Moon Jae-in and his government should use that time to revise the legislation to fully decriminalize abortion. South Korea should remove all penalties for people who seek abortion and for medical providers of abortions.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAsia South Korea \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 21, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nBrazil: Revoke Regulation Curtailing Abortion Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 11, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nA Step Forward for Abortion Rights in Italy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cSchools are Failing Boys Too\u201d\n\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s Impact on Boys\u2019 Education in Afghanistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThey Don\u2019t Treat Us like Human Beings\u201d \n\n\nAbuse of Imprisoned Women in Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 21, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nBrazil: Revoke Regulation Curtailing Abortion Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 11, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nA Step Forward for Abortion Rights in Italy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
