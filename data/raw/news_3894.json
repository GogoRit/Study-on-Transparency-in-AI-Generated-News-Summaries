Then came school closures brought about by a national lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19. For many, the situation worsened.But not for girls living in the villages of Group Village Head Grace Anafi Mndima, in Traditional Authority Jalasi, Mangochi.Here, 10 women, who endured personal difficulties because they were unable to complete their education, came together to stop this cycle repeating for their own daughters \u2014\u00a0and for other girls in their respective villages. These mothers know the story only too well. For their daughters\u2019 sake, they wanted to change the downward trajectory.\u00a0Theirs is an inspirational story.The Mpapa mothers\u2019 group, as they call themselves, set to work. Armed with training by the Joint Programme on Girls Education (JPGE), which is supported by UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, they began to mentor adolescent girls on\u00a0sexual and reproductive health, including on the dangers of\u00a0teenage pregnancy\u00a0and\u00a0child marriage, and their reproductive\u00a0rights. They encouraged them to complete their education.Joining forces to unblock girls' access to educationA girl who has benefited from the twice monthly mentoring sessions with the mothers\u2019 group is Aisha Kayima, 15, a standard 7 pupil at Mpapa Primary School. \u201cDue to access to the right information, my choices about the future I want are better informed,\u201d she said.But for many girls, the ability to attend school is not a given.\u00a0Esther White, who is chairperson of the Mpapa mothers\u2019 group, explained how they remove obstacles to girls\u2019 education.\u201cWe monitor the well-being of adolescent girls by ensuring that they attend school daily, and mediate if they have issues that might hinder their access to education,\u201d she said.In this task, the mothers quickly realized that they would need the wider support of their communities. Nationally, almost 1\u00a0in 2\u00a0girls \u2014\u00a0or 47% \u2014\u00a0marries before age 18, bringing their education to an early end. The mothers joined forces with community leaders to rescue girls who had been forced into early marriage or who had become pregnant at a young age. Working together, they helped these girls return to school.Soon they were seeing results. In 2019, 1,120 girls who had dropped out of school in Group Village Head Mndima's area returned to continue their education, according to Cecilia Chinula, adolescent and youth specialist for UNFPA in Malawi.\n\u201cI have made a decision to focus on my education so that I can be an independent and empowered woman,\u201d said Aisha.At Mpapa Primary School, the annual drop-out rate for girls was 26% in 2017. By 2020, it had dropped to just 6%. Nationally, only 51% of girls complete primary school.Rescued from marriage, girls and boys go back to schoolAlong with the village chief, the school administration, and other community members, Mpapa\u2019s efforts have also been instrumental in ensuring very low rates of teenage pregnancy and child marriage in their communities.Through a community-based gender-based violence (GBV) prevention structure, 55 girls and 17 boys were rescued from forced or early marriage. Just four teenage pregnancies have been recorded in their area to date during the nation\u2019s wrestle with COVID-19.Then came the pandemic, presenting a significant threat to their hard-won successes. The Mpapa women\u2019s group were determined to keep girls\u2019 education on track, even if it meant adding a new weapon to their arsenal \u2014\u00a0that of masks.\u201cWe provide homemade masks to ensure that adolescent girls and young women continue to attend school and do not use the lack of a mask as an excuse,\u201d said Ms. White.She is pleased that the low child marriage and teen pregnancy rates have been maintained, even during the school closures this year.Leading change for girls, one girl at a timeGroup Village Head Mndima has been a champion for their cause.\u201cI understand the pain that millions of mothers go through when a child falls into the trap of early marriage or teenage pregnancy. I am doing all things possible within my power to ensure that no cases of early child marriage or teenage pregnancy are registered in my community,\u201d she said.Her work with community groups such as the Mpapa mothers\u2019 group to make this vision a reality has earned her praise.Dr. Julitta Onabanjo, UNFPA regional director for East and Southern Africa, recently undertook a trip to the region to understand how community efforts such as the mothers\u2019 group have achieved such impressive results.\u201cWe want to continue to see good results, so please keep girls in school and ensure that there are no teenage pregnancies or child marriages,\u201d she urged Group Village Head Mndima and those working with her to support these efforts.Comprehensive sexuality education reinforces positive messagesPatrick Chibayo is head teacher at Mpapa Primary School. He has witnessed a drastic improvement in school retention for girls. At his establishment, life skills are imparted as part of Malawi\u2019s education curriculum, to reinforce positive messages around girl\u2019s education, and sexual and reproductive health and rights.\u201cMpapa school has registered good success stories \u2014\u00a0a low drop-out rate, high attendance among adolescent girls, and low early marriages and teenage pregnancies due to comprehensive sexuality education,\u201d he said.Aisha Kayima agrees with this approach to empowering girls and boys while still in school: \u201cWe learn about the dangers of teenage pregnancy, early child marriage and early sexual debut,\u201d she said.At Mpapa Primary School, the drop-out rate has decreased from 26%\u00a0a year for girls in the 2017 academic year to 6%\u00a0in 2020. School attendance for adolescent girls increased from 73%\u00a0in 2014 to 87%\u00a0in 2019.Ensuring girls menstruate with dignity while in schoolThere\u2019s another critical aspect to empowering girls that the Mpapa mothers\u2019 group has assumed willingly \u2014\u00a0ensuring that girls don\u2019t miss out on school due to their periods.Using machines provided by JPGE, the mothers make about 20 reusable menstrual pads a day. They provide these for girls at school.\u201cEvery single pad made brings joy into our lives, as we know that girls attending school will manage their periods with dignity, enabling them to continue their education and not have periods as a blockage to their bright future,\u201d said Ms. White.However, resolving the purely physical management of menstrual health did not take care of all the girls\u2019 needs in this respect. Stigmatization is a reality they also deal with.For this reason, the women also focus on building a more positive sense of masculinity among schoolboys, imparting to them the need to support girls who are menstruating, instead of laughing at them or making discriminatory remarks. Their approach has changed boys\u2019 attitudes.\u201cThrough life skills and mentorship sessions provided to us by Mpapa mothers\u2019 group, I have learned\u00a0not to stigmatize adolescent girls and young women during their periods,\u201d said Sam Loganie, 17, a standard 7 pupil at Mpapa Primary School.\u00a0This community endeavor to empower girls, together with the support of JPGE, is reaping rewards.Through life skills and mentorship sessions, I have learnt not to stigmatize adolescent girls and young women during their periods.\u201cI have made a decision to focus on my education so that I can be an independent and empowered woman,\u201d said Aisha.It is precisely this that the Mpapa mothers\u2019 group intended to foster \u2014\u00a0a new generation of young women who are empowered to reach for and achieve their potential, unhindered by the traps of child marriage, teen pregnancy, and school drop-out.Their combined efforts are testimony to the African proverb that \u201cit takes a village to raise a child.\u201dWith the support of the Government of Norway, the\u00a0Joint Programme on Girls\u2019 Education\u00a0(JPGE) is being implemented by UNFPA, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme in 169 schools in the districts of Dedza, Mangochi, and Salima. It aims to improve access to, quality, and relevance of education for girls, through addressing the key known threats to girls\u2019 education. These include poor food and nutrition, inadequate protection against sexual and physical violence, poor quality schooling, harmful social and traditional practices, and the violation of girls\u2019 sexual and reproductive health and rights.TopicsChild MarriageEducationWomen & GirlsSexual HealthMalawiReproductive HealthUNFPAEarly PregnancyNewsDemand EquityA Group of Mothers in This Malawi Community Helped Keep Girls in School During COVID-19\n          Dec. 2, 2020\n        \u00a0\n            English (en)\n          \n            Deutsch (de)\n          \n            fran\u00e7ais (fr)\n          \n            espa\u00f1ol (es)\n          "
