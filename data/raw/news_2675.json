Want to express unpopular political and religious beliefs? Prepare to be persecuted.\nRafael Zaki\u2019s parents fled Egypt because of persecution they faced as Coptic Christians, but now their devout son is facing professional and academic persecution by his medical school at the University of Manitoba.\nAll because he shared his pro-life and pro-gun views on Facebook.\nAs of this moment, the Canadian courts aren\u2019t helping Zaki, Barbara Kay writes in The Post Millennial. The Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench ruled against his motion for reinstatement to the medical school while his case against the school is under consideration.\nFor U.S. observers who thought they\u2019d seen everything in American university kangaroo courts, Zaki\u2019s case reminds us there are worse places to be accused of offending your peers. (He\u2019s crowdfunding to pay litigation expenses.)\nHe was hit with 18 anonymous complaints in February 2019, claiming his Facebook posts made them feel \u201cunsafe.\u201d One of his arguments is common among more zealous pro-life activists: that broadly legal abortion is comparable to the Holocaust. He wrote it originally as a Sunday school \u201cessay.\u201d (Zaki took down the posts within two days of the complaints.)\nThe school\u2019s response will make you nauseated. Ira Ripstein, associate dean for undergraduate medical education, summoned him to seven meetings and coerced him into writing 10 apologies \u2013 five each for offended students and faculty \u2013 to avoid discipline. It wasn\u2019t enough:\nAccording to Dr. Ripstein, the apologies were insufficiently remorseful and sincere, as they did not include testimony to a change in his beliefs. Indeed, they did not contain evidence of a change in his beliefs, because Zaki had not experienced a change in his beliefs. He continues to believe in the right to own arms, and he continues to believe abortion is a moral crime.\nMORE: Cross-ideological groups ask SCOTUS to protect pro-life med student\u2019s speech\nIn an arrangement ripped straight from a typical American Title IX adjudication (now barred by Department of Education regulation), Ripstein (left) served as \u201cinvestigator, prosecutor and judge,\u201d Kay writes.\nZaki claimed the dean\u2019s own biases actually inspired even more farfetched allegations against him. Ripstein assumed that \u201cI must support shooting up abortion clinics, support rape at gunpoint and support shooting those of a higher socioeconomic status.\u201d\nMore evidence-free accusations: that he\u2019s homophobic, transphobic and racist.\nRipstein\u2019s own daughter was in Zaki\u2019s class and rumored to have filed one of the complaints, \u201ca factor that would cry out for his recusal in the affair,\u201d Kay writes. A subordinate responded on Ripstein\u2019s behalf to her request for his verification, saying he can\u2019t comment on active litigation.\nWhile the school technically expelled him a year ago for \u201cStudent Non-Academic Misconduct and Concerning Behaviour Procedure,\u201d it let him keep attending classes during appeals, obviously not considering him a safety risk.\nPerhaps the school also happened to notice that he didn\u2019t violate the policy as written, since none of his posts concerned \u201cmatters regarding the University\u201d in any \u201csignificant focus.\u201d\nHis appeal failed anyway, despite the lack of any evidence for even a policy violation, because the University Discipline Committee determined this July that his posts were \u201cmisogynistic and hostile to women,\u201d which caused a \u201cnegative impact on the learning and work environment.\u201d (Warning to the nonplayer characters of American medical education considering pulling this stunt: Half of women in America consistently identify as pro-life.)\nThe committee ruled in July that Zaki would have to change his views \u201cin order to meet the professionalism standards set by the [undergraduate medical education] policies.\u201d\nZaki says his family has been discussing \u201cwhether Canada values us\u201d:\nFriends from church have also talked to me about whether Canada is still a safe country for Coptic believers. It would be tragic if Coptic believers, having been pushed out of the Middle East for having non-approved beliefs, are also pushed out of Canada for having non-approved beliefs.\nKay has advice for future potential victims of Canadian academic intolerance for marginalized views: record your interrogations, as did Lindsay Shepherd, the graduate student who publicly shamed Wilfrid Laurier University for trying to punish her for showing a Jordan Peterson interview in class.\n\u201cPublic exposure of Shepherd\u2019s tape turned a private act of academic bullying into a national scandal,\u201d Kay writes: \u201cIn my opinion, this ought-to-be scandal is even worse than the Shepherd affair.\u201d\nMORE: Inside Lindsay Shepherd\u2019s $3.6 million lawsuit\nIMAGE: NOBUHIRO ASADA/Shutterstock\n\n\n                    Read More                \n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\n\nPlease join the conversation about our stories on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, MeWe, Rumble, Gab, Minds and Gettr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Articles from The College Fix\n\n\n SCOTUS denies emergency request for campus drag show\n\n\n Time for real consequences on campus for violent protests\n\n\n UW-Madison professor worked to cancel her conservative grad student: FOIA documents\n\n\n 48 colleges nationwide still require COVID vaccine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nGreg Piper\nAssociate Editor\n\nGreg Piper served as associate editor of The College Fix from 2014 to 2021.\t\t\n\nWebsite\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Miss A Thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\n Most Popular from The College Fix\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarriage promotes \u2018white supremacy\u2019: George Mason professor\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYale University employs nearly one administrator per undergrad\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUCSB Black Studies faculty plan \u2018day of interruption\u2019 to protest protections for Jews\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArizona State U.
