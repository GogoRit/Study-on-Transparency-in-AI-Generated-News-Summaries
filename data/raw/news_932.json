After a four-year legal battle, another judge commuted Elsy\u2019s sentence and released her to her family. Her son turns 12 on Friday.\u201cI am so happy. Because there were times I thought this day would never come,\u201d Elsy, 38, told abortion-rights activists after her release on Wednesday from the Zacatecolica Detention Center. The Women\u2019s Equality Center, a New York-based human rights group, shared the interview with VICE World News.\u00a0El Salvador is one of five Latin American countries with a total ban on the procedure, including in cases of rape or when the woman\u2019s life is at risk. Women convicted of abortion face up to eight years in prison. Many women, like Elsy, have been charged with homicide after stillbirths and then been sentenced by judges to decades in prison. In some cases, hospital employees reported the women to police after they came in seeking medical treatment.El Salvador\u2019s abortion ban has been toughest on poor, rural women with little access to prenatal care, which means they are more vulnerable to losing their pregnancies. Women's rights activists have fought one by one to win the release of women they believe are wrongly convicted, slowly notching up victories.\u00a0But their grass-roots campaign to rewrite one of the world\u2019s strictest abortion laws has so far failed.Advertisement\u201cThe absolute ban on abortions leads to stigmatization, discrimination and persecution. It automatically converts women who lose their babies into suspects and practically condemns them,\u201d said Morena Herrera, head of the Salvadoran non-profit Citizen Group For The Decriminalization of Abortion.\u00a0\u201cThis has been a long and tortured path to free Elsy, but we have been determined and finally won.\u201dAcross Latin America, abortion-rights advocates have made major inroads over the past two years. Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court decriminalized abortion last year and Argentina passed legislation legalizing the procedure up to 14 weeks of pregnancy at the end of 2020. Ecuador lifted its total ban on abortion last year to make it available under specific circumstances.\u00a0El Salvador has bucked that trend. Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Honduras also have total bans on abortion.\u201cI have had conversations where prosecutors tell me it\u2019s impossible for a woman to bleed during pregnancy,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guillen, an international human rights lawyer and Executive Director of the Women\u2019s Equality Center.\u201cThere is this chaotic environment in which women\u2014all of them poor\u2014don\u2019t have any idea how to advocate for themselves,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are assigned a public defender that in many cases doesn\u2019t even know their name. When you look at the files, there is not one inch of defense. It\u2019s outrageous.\u201dAdvertisementOver the past two decades, more than 180 women in El Salvador who suffered obstetric emergencies\u2014health problems that cause a woman to lose her baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy\u2014have been prosecuted for abortion or aggravated homicide, according to activists. While prosecutors sometimes dropped the charges, dozens of women ended up in prison.Women\u2019s rights advocates say they have helped free 62 women since 2009 in El Salvador, including Elsy. In December, they began a campaign featuring Hollywood stars like America Ferrera and Milla Jovovich calling on President Nayib Bukele to release a dozen women who remained locked up.\u00a0Bukele has frequently expressed his opposition to abortion and in a March 2020 interview with the Puerto Rican rapper Residente, he called the practice a \u201dgreat genocide\u201d and said that even rape victims should be required to bring their pregnancies to term. But he has expressed concern that women are unfairly charged in the case of medical emergencies.\u201cOne thing I do oppose is that in countries like ours, women are criminalized for having miscarriages. Because they\u2019re poor, they are automatically accused of having an abortion,\u201d he said.The Salvadoran anti-abortion group Foundation Life SV has criticized the effort to release Elsy and the other women, describing it as a \u201cmassive disinformation campaign\u201d and a \u201cstrategy of media, political and legal manipulation\u201d in an attempt to decriminalize abortion.AdvertisementBut the campaign has made an impact. On December 23, the courts and government officials approved the release of three women serving 30-year sentences. On January 17, a fourth woman who was raped at 17 and had spent nine years behind bars was released.\u201cWe did whatever necessary to get them out,\u201d Avila-Guillen said, acknowledging that they are still considered to be guilty under the law because their sentences were commuted and their convictions had not been overturned. \u201cThey are innocent and hopefully they get reparations one day.\u201dEven today, many women who go to hospitals for medical emergencies are reported to the police for alleged abortions, Herrera said. But fewer are going to prison because abortion-rights groups have gotten better at defending them.\u201cWe understand how the criminal justice system functions,\u201d she said. \u201cSome judges and prosecutors also understand that this complaint violates human rights.\u201dThe Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in November that El Salvador violated the rights of a woman who died in prison in 2010 while serving a 30-year sentence for aggravated homicide after suffering a stillbirth. The court said El Salvador must pay reparations to the woman\u2019s family and develop policies that protect women who suffer obstetric emergencies.\u00a0\u00a0Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox?
