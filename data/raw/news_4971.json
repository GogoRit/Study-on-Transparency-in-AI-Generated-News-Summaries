Wade. The court\u2019s overturning of the landmark court ruling is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.The ruling, unthinkable just a few years ago, was the culmination of decades of efforts by abortion opponents, made possible by an emboldened right side of the court fortified by three appointees of former President Donald Trump.Both sides predicted the fight over abortion would continue, in state capitals, in Washington and at the ballot box. Justice Clarence Thomas, part of Friday\u2019s majority, urged colleagues to overturn other high court rulings protecting same-sex marriage, gay sex and the use of contraceptives. \n\nPregnant women considering abortions already had been dealing with a near-complete ban in Oklahoma and a prohibition after roughly six weeks in Texas. Clinics in at least eight other states \u2014 Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, South Dakota, Wisconsin and West Virginia \u2014 stopped performing abortions after Friday\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ohio, a ban on most abortions at the first detectable fetal heartbeat became the law when a federal judge dissolved an injunction that had kept the measure on hold for nearly three years. And Utah\u2019s law was triggered by the ruling, going into effect with narrow exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion foes cheered the ruling, but abortion-rights supporters, including President Joe Biden, expressed dismay and pledged to fight to restore the rights.Protests built into the evening in a number of cities, including thousands demonstrating against the decision outside the barricaded Supreme Court. Thousands more chanted \u201cWe will rise up!\u201d in New York\u2019s Washington Square.At the White House, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for the court and for the country.\u201d He urged voters to make it a defining issue in the November elections, declaring, \u201cThis decision must not be the final word.\u201d\n\nOutside the White House, Ansley Cole, a college student from Atlanta, said she was \u201cscared because what are they going to come after next? ... The next election cycle is going to be brutal, like it\u2019s terrifying. And if they\u2019re going to do this, again, what\u2019s next?\u201dMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, agreed about the political stakes.\u201cWe are ready to go on offense for life in every single one of those legislative bodies, in each statehouse and the White House,\u201d Dannenfelser said in a statement. Trump praised the ruling, telling Fox News that it \u201cwill work out for everybody.\u201dThe decision is expected to disproportionately affect minority women who already face limited access to health care, according to statistics analyzed by The Associated Press.It also puts the court at odds with a majority of Americans who favored preserving Roe, according to opinion polls.Surveys conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and others have shown a majority in favor of abortion being legal in all or most circumstances. But many also support restrictions especially later in pregnancy. Surveys consistently show that about 1 in 10 Americans want abortion to be illegal in all cases.\n\nThe ruling came more than a month after the stunning leak of a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito indicating the court was prepared to take this momentous step. Alito, in the final opinion issued Friday, wrote that Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to abortion, were wrong had and to be be overturned.\u201cWe therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives,\u201d Alito wrote, in an opinion that was very similar to the leaked draft.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining Alito were Thomas and Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett. The last three justices are Trump appointees. Thomas first voted to overrule Roe 30 years ago. \n\nFour justices would have left Roe and Casey in place.The vote was 6-3 to uphold Mississippi\u2019s law banning most abortions after 15 weeks, but Chief Justice John Roberts didn\u2019t join his conservative colleagues in overturning Roe. He wrote that there was no need to overturn the broad precedents to rule in Mississippi\u2019s favor.Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 the diminished liberal wing of the court \u2014 were in dissent.\u201cWith sorrow \u2014 for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection \u2014 we dissent,\u201d they wrote, warning that abortion opponents now could pursue a nationwide ban \u201cfrom the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department will protect providers and those seeking abortions in states where it is legal and \u201cwork with other arms of the federal government that seek to use their lawful authorities to protect and preserve access to reproductive care.\u201d In particular, Garland said the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Mifepristone for medication abortions. More than 90% of abortions take place in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, and more than half are now done with pills, not surgery, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic, which was at the center of Friday\u2019s case, continued to see patients Friday. Outside, men used a bullhorn to tell people inside that they would burn in hell. Clinic escorts wearing colorful vests used large speakers to blast Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down\u201d at the protesters.Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri are among 13 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, that already have laws on the books to ban abortion in the event Roe was overturned. Another half-dozen states have near-total bans or prohibitions after 6 weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. In roughly a half-dozen other states, including West Virginia and Wisconsin, the fight will be over dormant abortion bans that were enacted before Roe was decided in 1973 or new proposals to sharply limit when abortions can be performed, according to Guttmacher.Outside the barricaded Supreme Court, a crowd of mostly young women grew into the hundreds within hours of the decision. Some shouted, \u201cThe Supreme Court is illegitimate,\u201d while waves of others, wearing red shirts with \u201cThe Pro-Life Generation Votes,\u201d celebrated, danced and thrust their arms into the air. The Biden administration and other defenders of abortion rights have warned that a decision overturning Roe also would threaten other high court decisions in favor of gay rights and even potentially contraception.The liberal justices made the same point in their joint dissent: The majority \u201celiminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women\u2019s freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court\u2019s legitimacy.\u201dAnd Thomas, the member of the court most open to jettisoning prior decisions, wrote a separate opinion in which he explicitly called on his colleagues to put the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage, gay sex and contraception cases on the table.But Alito contended that his analysis addresses abortion only. \u201cNothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,\u201d he wrote.Whatever the intentions of the person who leaked Alito\u2019s draft opinion, the conservatives held firm in overturning Roe and Casey.In his opinion, Alito dismissed the arguments in favor of retaining the two decisions, including that multiple generations of American women have partly relied on the right to abortion to gain economic and political power.Changing the makeup of the court has been central to the anti-abortion side\u2019s strategy, as the dissenters archly noted. \u201cThe Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed,\u201d the liberal justices wrote.Mississippi and its allies made increasingly aggressive arguments as the case developed, and two high-court defenders of abortion rights retired or died. The state initially argued that its law could be upheld without overruling the court\u2019s abortion precedents.Justice Anthony Kennedy retired shortly after the Mississippi law took effect in 2018 and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020. Both had been members of a five-justice majority that was mainly protective of abortion rights.In their Senate hearings, Trump\u2019s three high-court picks carefully skirted questions about how they would vote in any cases, including about abortion.___Associated Press writers Jessica Gresko, Fatima Hussein, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist Nathan Ellgren in Washington, Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston, Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, Leah Willingham in Charleston, West Virginia, Michael Hill in New York and Kantele Franko in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.For AP\u2019s full coverage of the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, go to https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
