I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this without employing a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo choose when to have my children and with whom, when I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing as all mothers do that the scales must and will tilt towards our children,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, I know my choices might look different thank yours, but thank God or whomever you pray to, that we live in a country founded on the principle that I am free to live by my faith, and you are free to live by yours. So women, 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest. It\u2019s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them, but don\u2019t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let\u2019s make it look more like us.\u201d Concluded Williams, \u201cTommy and Matilda, I can\u2019t wait to come home to you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Surprise Couple Michelle Williams and Thomas Kail Make Debut at Golden Globes\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Tarantino, 1917 Among Big Winners at the 2020 Golden Globes\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nmichelle williams\n\n\ngolden globes 2020\n\n\npolitics\n\n\nfosse/verdon\n\n\nabortion rights\n\n\nawards season\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nMichelle Williams Talks Reproductive Rights In Globes Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn\u00a0Vox Media\u00a0a commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nCinematrix No. 17: March 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiet on Set Shows the Darkest Side of Kids TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever She Is, Kate Middleton Isn\u2019t on Our Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Charles III Isn\u2019t Dead Yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Wish Is a Crypto-Fascist, AI-Generated Harbinger of Doom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiet on Set Shows the Darkest Side of Kids TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Wish Is a Crypto-Fascist, AI-Generated Harbinger of Doom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever She Is, Kate Middleton Isn\u2019t on Our Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinematrix No. 17: March 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscar Speech Inspires Controversy, Misquoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe city politic\n\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njd vance\n\nJ.D.
