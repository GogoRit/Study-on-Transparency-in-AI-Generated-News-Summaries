Anthony List, National Right to Life, and the Family Research Council, the groups called for restrictions on medication and surgical abortion providers in order to \u201cfree up much needed medical equipment\u201d and ease an alleged strain on emergency rooms stemming from patients with complications from abortion care. (Complications from abortion care are rare, according to medical research.)\nBut the letter illustrates a broader trend: While many people are seemingly coming together to try to survive the virus \u2014 the Senate, for example, unanimously passed a $2 trillion relief package Wednesday \u2014 the pandemic hasn\u2019t erased politics entirely. \nHouse Democrats, for example, proposed environmental reforms for industries receiving a coronavirus bailout. (The House\u2019s bill has been dropped, however; the chamber plans to vote on the Senate\u2019s version Friday). Meanwhile, social conservatives have taken advantage of the pandemic to further many politically divisive policies, like state-level bans on \u201celective\u201d abortions, under the guise of protecting the interests of public health. But a closer look at the policy demands being made by anti-abortion conservatives shows that this is just politics as usual.\nThe letter contains five specific demands for HHS during the pandemic: ensuring that emergency response funds are not given to abortion providers, urging abortion providers to cease operations in order to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for treating Covid-19 patients, not expanding telemedicine for medication abortion access, continuing actions to stop mail-order abortion prescriptions, and promoting \u201cmedically accurate\u201d information to abortion care patients.\n\u201cBy ceasing both surgical and chemical abortions now, Planned Parenthood will free up much needed medical equipment and decrease the demand placed on ER\u2019s due to complications from both medical and surgical abortion,\u201d the letter states. \nAbortion rights advocates pushed back on the claims, stressing that abortion care is essential and time-sensitive. \u201cA public health emergency is not the time to play politics,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement Tuesday. \u201cDelays or additional barriers to care can make it more difficult or even impossible for some patients to access safe, legal abortion.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what effect, if any, Tuesday\u2019s letter will have on HHS policy during the pandemic; a spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment. But it\u2019s far from activists\u2019 and lawmakers\u2019 only effort to seize on the uncertainty the crisis has created to further a political agenda. \nAt least four states have restricted abortions or passed anti-trans bills in recent weeks\nConservative governors in several states have gone even further in advancing cultural priorities during the pandemic.\nOhio, Mississippi, and Texas officials all announced that most abortions were considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d and suspended the procedure under state-wide orders to suspend unnecessary surgeries during the coronavirus pandemic. Mississippi\u2019s governor, Tate Reeves, made the decision to do so despite rejecting a shelter-in-place order for the state. \u201cMississippi\u2019s never going to be China,\u201d he said at a press conference Monday. He later clarified that the state would take a \u201cwait and see approach\u201d toward a possible future shelter-in-place order.\nSeveral abortion providers in Texas, including Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights, promised to fight back on behalf of their patients, announcing they were filing a federal lawsuit against the state in order to continue offering abortion care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that the Texas Attorney General is exploiting this pandemic to end abortion in the state,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. \u201cAbortion care is time-sensitive and essential health care that has a profound impact on a person\u2019s health and life, which is why it is protected as a constitutional right. Texas is abusing the state\u2019s emergency powers and we are filing suit today to stop it.\u201d\nAuthor and abortion rights activist Robin Marty explained how easily the legal right to abortion was pushed aside during the pandemic in an op-ed for Time Tuesday:\nIn the end, it didn\u2019t take the Supreme Court to end Roe. All it took was one public health crisis to show exactly what we already knew: as long as abortion as a legal right is centered on the clinic or medical person providing it \u2014 not the person seeking to end the pregnancy \u2014 it is a \u201cright\u201d that could easily be ripped away just by ending the ability to provide that care.\nAbortion rights groups also decried a provision in the Senate coronavirus relief bill which would expand the Hyde amendment, which bans federal taxpayer dollars from funding abortion care. The funds in the bill are meant to help local, state, and tribal health officials meet their health care needs however they see fit; however, the Hyde language places an unneeded restriction on those funds.\n\u201cOur communities across the country are doing everything we can to keep ourselves and our families safe, and our elected officials should be doing the same \u2014 not blocking health care for communities that already face significant barriers,\u201d Kelsey Ryland, director of federal strategies for reproductive justice advocacy group All* Above All told Vox in a statement.\nWhile Republicans accused House Democrats of inserting progressive political goals, such as parts of the Green New Deal, into the House\u2019s latest coronavirus bill, social conservatives seem to be pushing for a much broader array of policies, even beyond limits on reproductive health access.\nIn Idaho, the state legislature passed the first two state-level anti-transgender bills in the country last week, even as the pandemic continued to spread. HB 500, which bans trans girls and women from high school and college women\u2019s sports, and HB 509, which bans gender changes on birth certificates issued in Idaho, both passed the legislature and were sent to Gov. Brad Little\u2019s desk. The deadline for either signing or vetoing the bills was extended to March 31, which just so happens to be International Trans Day of Visibility.\nThe governor hasn\u2019t signaled whether or not he will sign the bills, but five former Idaho state attorneys general urged him to veto the bills in an op-ed earlier this month.\nThe South Carolina state legislature scheduled a hearing for March 19 on a bill that would require high school trans athletes to compete in the gender designated on their birth certificate.\n\n\n SOUTH CAROLINA: S1087, a bill that would require transgender student-athletes to compete according to their designation on their original birth certificate, is scheduled for a hearing tomorrow, 3/19.They will try to do this while no one is looking.\u2014 The Chris Mosier (@TheChrisMosier) March 18, 2020\n\n\n\nThe timing of the hearing meant that families with trans kids were forced to risk infection in order to travel to the state capitol to advocate for their own civil rights.\nElsewhere, the US Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the Connecticut high school athletic association\u2019s transgender participation policy.\n\n\nWow. The Trump administration just filed a statement of interest in CT to argue that girls who are trans are \u201cbiological males\u201d and it violates Title IX to protect trans people. The audacity. This is so cruel. pic.twitter.com/exsRc8goJg\u2014 Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) March 24, 2020\n\n\n\nIn some cases, conservatives are using the pandemic to further their long-stated goals, especially in restricting access to abortion care. In others, like their anti-trans actions, they\u2019re moving quickly to pass their agenda while everybody else is rightly focused on dealing with the pandemic.\nEither way, a pandemic is no time to be taking decisive political action on long-standing and highly contentious social issues.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
