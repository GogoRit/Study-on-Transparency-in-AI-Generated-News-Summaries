In 2005, he transferred to the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, with plans to launch an order of priests with the stated purpose of promoting the end of abortion.\u00a0\nThose plans were soon nixed\u00a0and over the last two decades, Priests for Life, which boasts of being the \"largest ministry in the Catholic Church focused on ending abortion,\" has been engulfed in management and financial scandals.\u00a0\nIn 2014, New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who had been tapped by the Vatican to help reform the organization, washed his hands of the group, saying he wanted \" nothing further to do with the organization.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nDespite claiming to be a non-partisan organization, Pavone has regularly collaborated with the Trump administration and the Republican Party.\u00a0\nOne day after news of his dismissal from the clerical state was announced, Pavone's social media accounts still contained photos of him with the former president and a photo of him wearing a clerical collar and one of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" baseball caps.\u00a0\nIn 2022, Pavone marked the 35th anniversary of his regular television show, \"Defending Life,\" on EWTN, a U.S. Catholic media conglomerate that has become known for its regular antagonistic coverage of Francis and partisan political focus, often supportive of Trump.\u00a0\nAccording to its most recent publicly available tax documents, in 2018, Priests for Life, which is now headquartered in Florida, had brought in over $10 million that year. Recent communications from Pavone celebrated the forthcoming Republican takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives and said that looking ahead, the organization's focus would be on the 2023 and 2024 elections.\u00a0\nNeither Pavone nor Priests for Life immediately responded to NCR's request for comment about the Vatican's decision.\u00a0\nIn the immediate aftermath of the announcement, however, Pavone received support from one controversial U.S. Catholic bishop who is known for his own vocal opposition to both abortion and Pope Francis.\u00a0\n\"The blasphemy is that this holy priest is canceled while an evil president promotes the denial of truth and the murder of the unborn at every turn,\" wrote Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, who in 2020 endorsed a video that claimed \"You cannot be Catholic and be a Democrat.\"\nAccording to Priests for Life's website, five active ministry U.S. Catholic bishops are listed as serving as bishop advisors to the organization: Peter Jugis of Charlotte, North Carolina;\u00a0Robert McManus of Worcester, Massachusetts;\u00a0 Ralph Walker Nickless of Sioux City, Iowa, Clarence Silva, Bishop of Honolulu, Hawaii; and Richard Stika of Knoxville, Tennessee.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs for Pavone's future, the official statement from the Vatican's U.S. nunciature noted that Priests for Life is not a Catholic organization and it would have to decide the nature of Pavone's relationship to it, given that he is no longer a Catholic priest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMost Read Stories\n\n\n \n\n#1 New combative faith group to host 'Catholic prayer' for Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n \n\n#2 Attacking Pope Francis, anonymous cardinal seeks to curb the influence of his papacy\n \n\n#3 Here in the US, Catholicism is for sale\n \n\n#4 The Catholic Church needs married priests now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanRome biblical and Eastern institutes merged with Gregorian UniversityByCindy WoodenCatholic News Service\n \n\nNewsLife-threatening safety concerns keep Burkina Faso Catholics away from Sunday MassByTonny OnyuloOSV News\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanThe first outside legal analyses of Vatican's 'trial of the century' are in, and they're criticalByNicole WinfieldAssociated Press\n \n\nFrancis, the comic stripVaticanFrancis, the comic stripByPat Marrin\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR's Free NewslettersSelect any of the newsletters below, then enter your email address and click \"subscribe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per dayDaily Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updates: The latest news and feature articles\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Daily: (the latest articles, sent every morning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per weekWeekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Weekly: NCR staff talk music, television, books, movies and more\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Weekly: Environment editor Stephanie Clary dives into the week's climate change news\n\n\n\nMichael Sean Winters: The nexus between religion and politics\n\n\n\nNCR Book Club: Find your latest book to read\n\n\n\nScripture for Life: Reflections on the Sunday readings\n\n\n\nSunday Resources: Reflections on the readings sent two months ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x WeeklyBiweekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Francis Chronicles: Get to know the pope's pastoral side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Sections\n\n\nNCR Sections\n\n\nNews\n\n\nVatican\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSpirituality\n\n\nSunday Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Channels\n\n\nEarthBeat\n\n\nGlobal Sisters Report\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Menu\n\n\nWays to Give\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nYour NCR Legacy\n\n\nFriends & Tributes\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR\n\n\nRenew Subscription\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\nFree Newsletters\n\n\neNCR and Kindle Edition\n\n\nRequest a sample issue\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nHow to write for NCR\n\n\nLetters to Editor\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\n\nChange your address\n\n\nReprints\n\n\n\n\nAbout NCR\n\n\nMission & Values\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nStaff and Contributors\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nDonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Catholic Reporter\nFollow\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTikTok\n\n\nAdvertising Guidelines / \n  Terms of Use / \n  Privacy Policy / \n  Site Map\n/ Mailing Address: 115 E Armour Boulevard Kansas City, MO 64111 / Phone Number: +1-800-444-8910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
