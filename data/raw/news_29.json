Greg Abbott (R) announced he would stop most abortions as part of the state\u2019s response to COVID-19. \n\u201cI was super excited going into work [Tuesday],\u201d one abortion counselor, who preferred to withhold their identity, told Rewire.News. \u201cMy boss and I even did a little celebratory dance when I got there.\u201d \nShe was relieved to see patients who were forced to reschedule as a result of the initial order, and enthused to see patients visiting for the first time.\u00a0\nBut after the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling, patients learned at the last second they wouldn\u2019t be able to have an abortion. \nSome cried. Some seemed frustrated and angry, the abortion counselor said. Some didn\u2019t understand why this was happening. \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t help that I didn\u2019t have definite answers or timelines to give them,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cThe state could extend the executive order at any time, citing coronavirus precautions.\u201d Some patients noted the COVID-19 pandemic as their reason for needing abortion care. \u201cThat\u2019s the excuse the state is using to deny their abortion care,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so cruel and calculated.\u201d\nFlyers with information about out-of-state abortion care, practical support organizations for patients, and abortion funds are typically given to patients who are over the gestational limit to have an abortion in Texas, but because of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, the counselor\u2019s clinic provided all patients with this information.\n\u201cIt was so surreal handing [the resource flyer]\u00a0to every patient, knowing that going out of state during a public health crisis could be dangerous or too expensive,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cPatients should have access to abortion care in their own communities. They shouldn\u2019t have to risk their health to travel for such a simple and safe procedure.\u201d\nOne Texan recently traveled all the way to Colorado for a medication abortion\u2014something that could have been accessed through telemedicine had it not been outlawed in Texas. Fund Texas Choice, a practical support organization serving Texans traveling to abortion clinics, said people with pregnancies of varying gestational ages have considered traveling out of state since Abbott\u2019s order first went into effect. \nRobin Marty, communications director for Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion fund serving people in Alabama, told Rewire.News that while the organization hasn\u2019t talked to Texans traveling to Alabama for care, one abortion clinic in the state reported an \u201cinflux of callers\u201d from Texas following the COVID-19 abortion ban. \nProviders in Texas have talked to patients considering traveling out of state too.\u00a0\n\u201cI had one patient who\u2019d originally scheduled an appointment at our clinic, then rescheduled at a clinic in another city out of state, then rescheduled back to us when we reopened,\u201d one provider said on the condition of anonymity\u00a0so they could speak openly about the effects of the ban. \u201cShe was very frustrated at the whole process. I went over a map we have of the U.S. that has clinic locations in other states, brainstorming where would be the best place for her to go.\u201d\nBut traveling out of state would mean navigating the various travel restrictions among the pandemic, longer wait times to get in the clinic, and it \u201crequired a flight she didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking at this time.\u201d\u00a0\nAnother Texas provider told Rewire.News that scheduling was tight on Tuesday in an effort to see patients following Monday\u2019s temporary restraining order against the COVID-19 abortion ban\u2014most of whom had appointments delayed last week. One clinic staffer pushed back their lunch break in order to process payments so people could be seen by the doctor before the legality of abortion in Texas changed.\u00a0\nThey were relieved to return to work, something \u201cresembling normal,\u201d but nervous things would take a turn for the worst. Things did.\u00a0\n\u201cI found out [about the order] when I got back to the office [from lunch and] I felt absolutely devastated when I heard,\u201d the clinic staffer said. \u201cIt was a sadness beyond tears. I had to spend a bit just sitting and forcing myself to breathe because I knew the next step was talking to patients, and I didn\u2019t want to cry in front of them\u2014I wanted to be able to tell them the truth, that we hoped we could reopen and continue their appointment.\u201d \nMost patients cried when they were told abortion had been outlawed in Texas.\u00a0\nLike other providers, they\u2019ve spoken to patients considering traveling out of state for an abortion but emphasized nearby states, like New Mexico, have long wait times as the extent of these impacts affect people all over Texas. One patient considered continuing the pregnancy. \u201cMost of our patients already can\u2019t afford to have a baby, but when you add cut hours, a lack of insurance, and job loss to that\u2014it\u2019s an impossible situation,\u201d the clinic staffer said. \u201cPlus, any trip to a doctor\u2019s office carries a chance of exposure to COVID-19, and continuing a pregnancy requires far more visits to a doctor\u2019s office than getting an abortion does, which no anti-choice people seem to acknowledge is a risk. Anytime you leave the house in a pandemic, you risk exposure. Abortion is safer than having a baby more now than ever.\u201d\nAster Dyer, a nurse at an abortion clinic in central Texas, told\u00a0Rewire.News\u00a0they haven\u2019t provided direct patient care in nearly two weeks as a result of Abbott\u2019s abortion ban.\n\u201cI\u2019m hurting just thinking about the people we have to turn away, and what they might do or experience without access to safe abortion care. We have seen time and again that people will do whatever it takes not to be pregnant when access is restricted,\u201d said Dyer, pointing to Rosie Jim\u00e9nez\u2014a young Chicana living in Texas at the time\u2014and others who have died from unsafe abortions following anti-choice legislation. \u201cWe will only see more of that when clinics get shut down.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday'sPopular Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n \n\nEmail Sign-Up\n\n\n\n\nInterests \n\nEvents\n\nInformation\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\nFundraising Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nContact Us\n\n \n\u00a9 2024 Rewire News Group.
