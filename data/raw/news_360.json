Photograph: Kasia StrekMass demonstrations have exposed underlying anger at political and religious interference in people\u2019s everyday livesby Jon Henley, Europe correspondent, and Kasia Strek in WarsawFri 6 Nov 2020 14.28 CETLast modified on Tue 10 Nov 2020 19.12 CETShareFor 14 nights they have marched, enraged by a near-total ban on abortion that has stirred a generation to stage the largest mass demonstrations that Poland has seen since Solidarno\u015b\u0107 toppled the communist regime in the 1980s.Until soaring coronavirus numbers and a looming national lockdown made it almost impossible, up to a million people nightly defied a government ban on protests, taking to the streets from Warsaw to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144 to Wroc\u0142aw, Gda\u0144sk to Krak\u00f3w.The protests, led by the grassroots women\u2019s movement Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet (OSK, or All-Polish Women\u2019s Strike), have shocked the ruling conservatives and created a new political faultline that, analysts say, could spell more serious problems for the party.\u201cI think it is a whole backlash against a patriarchal culture, against the patriarchal state, against the fundamentalist religious state, against the state that treats women really badly,\u201d said Marta Lempart, a 41-year-old lawyer and one of OSK\u2019s leaders.View image in fullscreenMarta Lempart calls for the liberalisation of abortion, establishment of sex education classes and universal access to contraception during a rally in front of parliament in Warsaw on 27 October.

Photograph: Kasia StrekPredominantly Catholic Poland already had one of Europe\u2019s strictest abortion laws when, on 22 October, its constitutional tribunal ruled that terminations in instances of severe foetal anomalies, which accounted for all but about 30 of the 1,110 abortions performed legally in Poland last year, were \u201cincompatible\u201d with the constitution.The decision by the court\u2019s 15 pro-PiS judges, many of them appointed unlawfully, would allow terminations only in instances of rape, incest and when the mother\u2019s life is at risk \u2013 a tiny fraction of cases. Women\u2019s groups estimate an additional 200,000 Polish women have abortions either illegally or abroad each year.The ruling sparked an immediate reaction. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, mainly women and young people, took to the streets with banners proclaiming \u201cI wish I could abort my government\u201d, \u201cThis is war\u201d and \u201cWomen\u2019s hell\u201d.View image in fullscreenProtesters holding anti-PiS signs. Photograph: Kasia StrekOn Tuesday \u2013 apparently in response to the protests \u2013 the government indefinitely postponed publishing the court\u2019s decision in the official journal, preventing it from coming into effect (and raising major constitutional questions if it tries to do so later).But the genie may be out of the bottle.While surveys show more than 60% of Poles support the status quo on abortion, barely 15% back the proposed changes. This has mobilised a generation not previously engaged with politics and stoked existing, wider anger at what many see as the steady erosion of democratic norms since PiS came to power in 2015.Maria Kowalczyk, 38, a beauty journalist, said at a protest in Warsaw that Poland was \u201cyears behind. In this country, because of the politics and doctrine of the government and the religious fanatics, someone who is different is worse. The way they treat LGBT people, migrants, all minorities \u2013 and now women \u2026 Society has had enough.\u201dView image in fullscreenMaria Kowalczyk,who has two children and lost two through stillbirth and miscarriage, says: \u2018Forcing a mother to give birth to a baby without an organ is simply insane\u2019. Photograph: Kasia StrekJulia Estera, 30, a performance and makeup artist from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, said Poland was no longer a free country. \u201cWe are a religious state where we are all demanded to think in one possible way.\u201d Bianka, 15, and Maja, 16, said Poland\u2019s youth would not back down. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live in a country where we don\u2019t have a choice, where everything is decided for us.\u201dView image in fullscreenJulia Estera at a protest in Warsaw on 30 October. Photograph: Kasia StrekAndrzej Kompa, a historian and university researcher, said on another march in the capital that he was protesting \u201cnot just against this hell for women, decided by this so-called constitutional court, but against this government, against church involvement in political affairs, for minority rights. Simply for freedom.\u201dSupport for the PiS, who were re-elected last year, and its founder, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, 71, has plunged by almost 10 points to 30.9% in a month, according to one poll. Another showed 70% of Poles would like Kaczy\u0144ski \u2013 widely seen as the country\u2019s true powerbroker \u2013 to step down as PiS leader.Breaking long-held taboos, the protests have also challenged the Catholic church and its influence on Polish policy, education and culture, with some demonstrators disrupting services and defacing churches. Support for the church has fallen eight points to 49% since March, one poll showed.View image in fullscreenA woman covering her ears as she passes the Church of the Holy Cross, in Warsaw, where Catholic fundamentalists, flanked by nationalist militias and separated from protesters by police and military officers, were playing the cries of newborns through loudspeakers. Photograph: Kasia StrekKaczy\u0144ski last week urged the party faithful to call for a defence of the Catholic church \u201cat all costs\u201d. He also said the protests were \u201cintended to destroy Poland\u201d, and urged his supporters to fight for \u201cPoland and patriotism\u201d in order to avert \u201cthe end of \u2026 the Polish nation as we know it\u201d.The protests could hardly have come at a worse time for PiS. As Covid-19 infections and death tolls break new records, the government \u2013 which warned this week of a new national lockdown within 10 days unless things improve \u2013 is coming under increasingly heavy fire for its handling of the pandemic.It now appears to have few easy ways out. Many Poles view the court ruling as a tactical play by Kaczy\u0144ski to bolster support on the traditionalist right while bypassing parliament, where the ruling coalition has only a slender majority. It has sparked an explosion of popular fury unlike any PiS has seen.View image in fullscreenA protester holding a banner saying: \u2018This is war\u2019. Photograph: Kasia Strek\u201cIt certainly feels different,\u201d said Adam Mrozowicki, a sociologist at the University of Wroc\u0142aw. \u201cWe need to study it properly, but the heart of this does seem to be young people. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve never seen this level of engagement among my students \u2013 in my faculty, maybe 70-80% of students have taken part in some kind of protest.\u201dThe scale and nature of the protests was new, Mrozowicki said: \u201cThey are led by young women. This is decentralised, locally based, grassroots. And personally, in 20 years, I\u2019ve never seen anything like these numbers. To have 65,000 people on the streets of Wroc\u0142aw \u2026\u201dBen Stanley, a political scientist at the SWPS university in Warsaw, said the protests felt \u201cqualitatively different\u201d. Previous anti-PiS demonstrations over the rule of law mainly drew \u201cSolidarno\u015b\u0107-era protesters, people in their 50s and 60s. It wasn\u2019t an issue that resonated so much with young people.\u201dView image in fullscreenArtists and dancers protesting in Warsaw on 30 October. Photograph: Kasia StrekWomen\u2019s rights are \u201ca lot more tangible for 25-year-olds; they really mean something concrete. This ruling has animated many more people by personalising the culture war PiS has declared: its chosen narrative of a Poland whose authentic identity and traditions are at threat from rootless cosmopolitanism.\u201dThe protests had \u201cblown a hole in the idea that Kaczy\u0144ski is always three steps ahead, that PiS always has its finger on the pulse of what Poland really feels\u201d, Stanley said, \u201cat the same time as Covid has blown a hole in their reputation for competence\u201d.The party could salvage the situation in the short term, he said, but \u201cprocesses are accelerating that will make the nationalist, clericalist PiS narrative more difficult to sustain longer term. All this may not bring PiS down immediately, but it could make things a lot more difficult in future.\u201dMrozowicki said it was unclear how the protests would immediately affect Poland\u2019s politics because the protesters had no clear links to parliamentary politics, and their leaders have said they do not want to become a political movement. \u201cBut it feels like something, definitely, is shifting,\u201d he said.
