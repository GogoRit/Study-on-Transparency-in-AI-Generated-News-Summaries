The Grand Rapids resident has received the endorsements of multiple pro-abortion groups, including Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.\u00a0\nMichigan voter Allan Hoekstra, a financial adviser in nearby Holland first learned about Scholten during her congressional campaign in 2020. Her pro-abortion position bothered him then and still bothers him today. Scholten caught his eye because her background, Hoekstra said, is \u201cthe Christian Reformed story,\u201d one that he and many others in the area share. Hoekstra is also the descendant of Dutch immigrants and grew up in the Christian Reformed Church of North America, a Calvinist denomination based in Grand Rapids. He was\u00a0part of the church\u00a0until about three years ago. But, unlike Scholten, Hoekstra adheres to the CRCNA\u2019s official stance on abortion\u2014that it is the \u201cwanton \u2026 destruction\u201d of an image-bearer of God. \n\u201cBecause Hillary is a member and an office bearer in a Christian Reformed Church, I think there\u2019s an unspoken implication potentially that she would have beliefs on abortion that are in line with the denomination,\u201d said Hoekstra. Instead, in her campaign materials, Scholten pledges to \u201censhrine Roe v. Wade as the law of the land\u201d and promises to be \u201ca steadfast supporter of a woman\u2019s God-given ability to make her own healthcare decisions\u201d\u2014a right that Hoekstra said is \u201charder to find \u2026 in the Bible than it is to find the right to abortion in the constitution.\u201d \nScholten is not the only pro-abortion political candidate in West Michigan touting membership in a CRCNA church. David LaGrand, a state representative running for reelection, has campaigned on the same platform. The denomination has historically opposed abortion. But some Michiganders with ties to the CRCNA think the denomination hasn\u2019t done enough to clarify its stance in light of these public campaigns\u2014and next week\u2019s historic vote on a pro-abortion ballot measure in the state. If passed, the amendment would add a right to abortion to the Michigan Constitution. To these Michiganders, the denomination\u2019s failure to speak out in these specific cases seems to highlight a drift away from the CRCNA\u2019s\u00a0official pro-life stance. \nIn September and October, Hoekstra sent emails (obtained by WORLD) about Scholten\u2019s campaign to Shiao Chong, editor-in-chief of the CRCNA publication The Banner, and to the Rev. Zachary King, the CRCNA general secretary. In them, he encouraged CRCNA leadership to inform members of the denomination about Scholten\u2019s stance and her endorsements from pro-abortion groups. \nIn a separate reply to WORLD\u2019s inquiry on the subject, Chong said, \u201cWhile we stand with our denomination's official position on abortion, The Banner does not, as a policy, publish articles on any political candidates during election campaigns, as we do not wish to give any false impressions of supporting or opposing any political candidates.\u201d \nKing\u2019s office said local CRCNA churches are responsible for overseeing \u201cthe doctrine and life\u201d of individual members. His director of communications, Kristen deRoo VanderBerg, said denominational leadership tends not to get involved in directing local congregations on how to respond to members who are running for office under positions that oppose the denomination\u2019s official stance. In response to WORLD\u2019s question about the denomination\u2019s efforts to educate voters about Michigan\u2019s pro-abortion proposal, she said the CRCNA tends to produce materials focused on national rather than state-level legislation. She sent links to the denomination\u2019s online materials on abortion and to the most recent public statement on the topic, released in June in reaction to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. \nHoekstra received similar replies. But he said clarifying Scholten\u2019s position wouldn\u2019t require the denomination to break the rules prohibiting churches and other nonprofit organizations from participating in a political campaign. Stating Scholten\u2019s position, he said, would be \u201csimply reporting the facts.\u201d \nLaura Alexandria, president of Grand Rapids Right to Life, thinks churches need to be bolder regarding political issues like abortion\u00a0that intersect with church teachings. In the cases of Scholten and LaGrand, she affirmed that churches can\u2019t explicitly endorse or oppose specific candidates, but, she added, \u201cThey can absolutely say, \u2018These candidates support abortion. Our stance as a church is that we protect life at every stage.\u2019 \u2026 That implies opposition, but you have not said it, and you are continuing to inform your congregation based on the doctrine of your church.\u201d \nChurches in the CRCNA and even individual members within those churches aren\u2019t uniform on the abortion issue. Scholten is still a member at LaGrave Avenue Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, the church she attended during her 2020 campaign on a pro-abortion platform. That church brought her on as a deacon the next year. State Sen. Mark Huizenga is a fellow member at LaGrave and a resident of the Grand Rapids suburb of Walker. Unlike Scholten, he is a pro-life Republican who has the endorsement of the Right to Life of Michigan Political Action Committee. (The preaching minister at LaGrave turned down WORLD\u2019s request for an interview.)\nMeanwhile, LaGrand attends Eastern Avenue Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids and is a commissioned pastor who has preached in the Kent County Jail. The Grand Rapids resident once identified as a pro-life Democrat, and the state Right to Life group endorsed him during his 2010 state Senate race. Today, his campaign website lists repealing Michigan\u2019s 1931 abortion ban as a priority. Neither Scholten nor LaGrand responded to requests for comment from WORLD.\nOther CRCNA churches in the area encourage a stronger pro-life stance among their members. Pastor Lloyd Hemstreet, the pastor at Coopersville Christian Reformed Church in Scholten\u2019s district, described the CRCNA as \u201ca broad denomination that is not all of one mind.\u201d Unlike at LaGrave, he said running for political office on a pro-abortion platform could be cause for church discipline at his church. Although he hasn\u2019t spoken about Scholten\u2019s campaign specifically, Hemstreet recently preached against the pro-abortion amendment on Michigan ballots this fall that could add a right to abortion to the state constitution. He said he has encouraged his congregation to take voting seriously and do their homework on candidates before going to the polls. \nPastor Mark Neymeiyer at another CRCNA church in the district, Rusk Christian Reformed Church, said he\u2019s been so upfront about how abortion goes against God\u2019s Word that anyone with pro-abortion views attending his church probably would have left already. He also preached against the pro-abortion ballot measure and distributed copies of the proposal language in church members\u2019 mailboxes so they could read it for themselves. He said he hasn\u2019t spoken about specific political candidates but has instructed attendees about how to find Right to Life\u2019s recommended candidates. \nNeymeiyer said he used to put little thought into who he voted for and, in some nonpartisan races, would just pick \u201cwhat name looks the most Dutch to me.\u201d Now, Neymeiyer realizes the danger of that method and relies heavily on groups like Right to Life to help him pick candidates who stand for unborn life. He said he\u2019s disappointed that he hasn\u2019t heard the denomination speak out more on the abortion issue. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to their leadership to help us in this,\u201d he said.\nHoekstra praised the CRCNA\u2019s official statement on abortion. \u201cI think it would resonate with all Christians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, how far are we willing to push it? How public are we willing to be about it? I think that\u2019s the question, and I think there\u2019s never been a time in the state of Michigan where we need to be more public about this position.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Savas\nLeah is the life beat reporter for WORLD News Group.
