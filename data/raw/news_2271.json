In recent decades, the movement mainstream has been careful to protect its public image by distancing itself from overt white nationalists in its ranks. Last year, anti-abortion leader Kristen Hatten was ousted from her position as vice president of the anti-choice group New Wave Feminists after identifying as an \u201cethnonationalist\u201d and sharing white supremacist alt-right content. In 2018, when neo-Nazis from the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP) sought to join the local March for Life rally organized by Tennessee Right to Life, the anti-abortion organization rejected TWP\u2019s involvement. (The organization\u2019s statement, however, engaged in the same false equivalency between left and right that Trump used in the wake of fatal white supremacist violence at Charlottesville. \u201cOur organization\u2019s march has a single agenda to support the rights of mothers and the unborn, and we don\u2019t agree with the violent agenda of white supremacists or Antifa,\u201d the group wrote on its Facebook page.) \n\n\n\n\nBut despite the movement\u2019s careful curation of its public image, racism and xenophobia have been woven into it throughout its history. With large families, due to Roman Catholic Church prohibitions on contraception and abortion, Catholic immigration in the mid-1800s through 1900s sparked white Anglo-Saxon Protestant fears of being overtaken demographically that fueled opposition to abortion as a means of increasing birthrates among white Protestant women. At the time, Roman Catholic immigrants from countries like Ireland and Italy who would be considered white today were among the targets of white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. As sociologists Nicola Beisel and Tamara Kay wrote with regards to the criminalization of abortion in the late 19th century, \u201cWhile laws regulating abortion would ultimately affect all women, physicians argued that middle-class, Anglo-Saxon married women were those obtaining abortions, and that their use of abortion to curtail childbearing threatened the Anglo-Saxon race.\u201d\nHostile anti-Catholic sentiment cut both ways when it came to abortion, however. Until the 1970s, \u201cpro-life\u201d activism was firmly associated with Catholics and the pope in the minds of American Protestants. This deterred many Protestants from opposing abortion as a Christian moral issue\u2014not only in the political sphere, but even as a matter of denominational teaching\u2014because of its association with \u201cpapists\u201d (a derogatory term for Catholics). Even the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 decriminalizing abortion did not immediately bring conservative Protestants around. As late as 1976, the conservative evangelical Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) passed resolutions affirming abortion rights. \u201cThe assumption was that it must not be right if Catholics backed it, so we haven\u2019t,\u201d commented John Wilder, who founded Christians for Life as a Southern Baptist ministry in 1977 as the resistance to the pro-life movement began to dissipate.\nThis shift occurred in light of the lessening of anti-Catholic prejudice, strategic recruitment of evangelicals by New Right Catholic leaders, and evangelical discomfort with how many abortions took place as women accessed their new reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Fetterman, American Jagoff\n\nJohn Fetterman, American Jagoff\n\n\n\nKim Kelly \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky Is About to Pass the Cruelest Criminal-Justice Bill in America\n\nKentucky Is About to Pass the Cruelest Criminal-Justice Bill in America\n\n\n\nPaige Oamek and Rohan Montgomery \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe True Threat of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBloodbath\u201d Speech\n\nThe True Threat of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBloodbath\u201d Speech\n\n\n\nJeet Heer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Glazer\u2019s Brave Oscar Speech Represents the Best of Judaism\n\nJonathan Glazer\u2019s Brave Oscar Speech Represents the Best of Judaism\n\n\n\nDave Zirin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Fetterman, American Jagoff\n\nJohn Fetterman, American Jagoff\n\n\n\nKim Kelly \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky Is About to Pass the Cruelest Criminal-Justice Bill in America\n\nKentucky Is About to Pass the Cruelest Criminal-Justice Bill in America\n\n\n\nPaige Oamek and Rohan Montgomery \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe True Threat of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBloodbath\u201d Speech\n\nThe True Threat of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBloodbath\u201d Speech\n\n\n\nJeet Heer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Glazer\u2019s Brave Oscar Speech Represents the Best of Judaism\n\nJonathan Glazer\u2019s Brave Oscar Speech Represents the Best of Judaism\n\n\n\nDave Zirin \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cultural position of Catholics had shifted dramatically by the 1970s. As substantial immigration from Latin America and Asia posed a new threat to white numerical superiority, Catholics from European countries became culturally accepted as part of the white race, a readjusting of boundaries that maintains demographic control. The election of Roman Catholic John F. Kennedy as president in 1960 demonstrated how far Catholic acceptance had come\u2014at least among liberals. Although conservative evangelical opposition to his candidacy remained rife with anti-Catholic fears, the rhetoric was less racialized and more focused on concerns about influence from the Vatican. \n\nThe New Politics of Abortion \n\nThere\u2019s a New Playbook for Securing Abortion Access\nAndrea Miller \n\n\nThe Politics of Abortion Is Entering a New Era\nEmily Douglas \n\n\nMeet the Prosecutors Resisting America\u2019s Frightening New Abortion Bans\nCynthia Greenlee \n\n\nTo counter this lingering prejudice, conservative Catholic leaders seized on the opportunity offered by the specter of atheist Communism in the mid-20th century to establish themselves as part of a Christian coalition with Protestants, unified against a common godless enemy. As Randall Balmer has written, evangelical concerns about being forced to desegregate Christian schools spurred political investment that Catholic New Right leaders capitalized on and channeled into anti-abortion and anti-LGBT opposition.\nFor white nationalists, meanwhile, as Carol Mason wrote in Killing for Life, Jewish people replaced Catholics as targets for groups like the KKK. \u201cNow that abortion is tantamount to race suicide\u2026naming Catholics\u2014whose opposition to abortion has been so keen\u2014as enemies would be counterproductive,\u201d Mason wrote. Militant anti-abortion and explicit white nationalist groups came together prominently in the 1990s when a wing of the anti-abortion movement, frustrated with a lack of legislative progress, took on a more violent character fed by relationships with white supremacists and neo-Nazis. \nCurrent Issue\n\n\n\n \nView our current issue\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite supremacists were already participants in the anti-abortion cause, as Loretta Ross wrote in the 1990s. In 1985, the KKK began creating wanted posters listing personal information for abortion providers (doxing before the Internet age). Randall Terry, founder of the anti-choice group Operation Rescue, and John Burt, regional director of the anti-abortion group Rescue America in the 1990s, adopted this tactic in the 1990s. Terry\u2019s first wanted poster targeted Dr. David Gunn, who was murdered in 1993 in Pensacola, Florida. Gunn\u2019s successor, Dr. John Britton, targeted by a Rescue America wanted poser, was killed in 1994.\nThe Florida-based KKK organized a rally in support of Dr. Britton\u2019s killer, Paul Hill, and Tom Metzger, founder of the racist group White Aryan Resistance (WAR), condoned the killing if it \u201cprotected Aryan women and children.\u201d Burt himself was a Florida Klansman prior to becoming Christian and an associate of both killers. \u201cFundamentalist Christians and those people [the Klan] are pretty close, scary close, fighting for God and country,\u201d Burt told The New York Times in 1994. \u201cSome day we may all be in the trenches together in the fight against the slaughter of unborn children.\u201d Members of the Portland-based skinhead group American Front regularly joined Operation Rescue to protest abortion clinics. Tim Bishop, a representative of the white nationalist Aryan Nations, said, \u201cLots of our people join [the anti-abortion movement]\u2026. It\u2019s part of our Holy War for the pure Aryan race.\u201d\nGroups like the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan trafficked in rhetoric that mirrored that of the anti-abortion movement\u2014with an anti-Semitic twist: \u201cMore than ten million white babies have been murdered through Jewish-engineered legalized abortion since 1973 here in America and more than a million per year are being slaughtered this way.\u201d Metzger has claimed that \u201cabortion makes money for Jews\u201d and called Planned Parenthood \u201ca corrupt Jewish organization.\u201d In 1996, a series of bombings in Spokane, targeting a newspaper office, a bank, and a Planned Parenthood office, were perpetrated by members of the Phineas Priesthood, who followed the white separatist anti-Semitic religion Christian Identity. In the late 1990s, Eric Rudolph, a clinic bomber, and James Charles Kopp, who murdered a Jewish abortion provider returning home from synagogue, were affiliated with the anti-abortion terrorist organization Army of God and staunch Holocaust deniers.\nWhile in recent years, the mainstream anti-choice movement has been careful to distance itself from overtly racist and white nationalist groups and figures, embedded anti-Semitism appears in the trivialization of the Holocaust and in coded appeals to neo-Nazis. Abolish Human Abortion (AHA), a more recently founded group led by young white men (in a movement that typically likes to put female leaders at the forefront for better mainstream appeal) that views that pro-life movement as too moderate, created an icon linking the acronym AHA in such a way as to resemble \u201cnewer incarnations of swastikas that are proliferating among white supremacist groups,\u201d according to Mason.\nAHA claims that \u201cthe abortion holocaust exceeds all previous atrocities practiced by the Western World,\u201d a statement that signals to anti-Semites an implicit disbelief in the Nazi Holocaust and a trivializing of real historical persecutions. The anti-abortion movement has long framed abortion as a holocaust\u2014a holocaust that it depicts as numerically more significant than the killing of 6 million Jewish people. Historian Jennifer Holland told Jewish Currents that because Jewish people in the United States are more pro-choice than other religious groups, anti-abortion activists \u201coften imply and even outwardly state that Jews are participating in a current genocide and were thus ideologically complicit in the Jewish Holocaust.\u201d This frame sometimes goes hand in hand with outright anti-Semitic denial that the Nazi Holocaust even happened.\nThe framing of abortion-as-holocaust is starkly visible in a law passed by Alabama in May banning abortion in nearly all circumstances and threatening abortion providers with up to 99 years in prison. The law states, \u201cMore than 50 million babies have been aborted in the United States since the Roe decision in 1973, more than three times the number who were killed in German death camps, Chinese purges, Stalin\u2019s gulags, Cambodian killing fields, and the Rwandan genocide combined.\u201d The framing of abortion as holocaust demeans the significance of the Nazi Holocaust, in turn feeding anti-Semitism already interwoven in the movement. \n\n\n\n\nFlorida State Senator Dennis Baxley, discussing the possibility of implementing similar legislation in his state, revealed that nativist fears of replacement went into support for the idea. \u201cWhen you get a birth rate less than 2 percent, that society is disappearing,\u201d Baxley said of Western Europe. \u201cAnd it\u2019s being replaced by folks that come behind them and immigrate, don\u2019t wish to assimilate into that society and they do believe in having children.\u201d\nAnti-choice figures continue to tout demographic concerns\u2014which at their core are a form of white nationalism\u2014in order to oppose abortion. In the political sphere, Representative Steve King is the most prominent political figure to emerge as a symbol of both white supremacism and abortion opposition. \u201cIf we continue to abort our babies and import a replacement for them in the form of young violent men, we are supplanting our culture, our civilization,\u201d King stated. King has taken far-right positions on both immigration and abortion, including defending rape and incest as necessary for historical population growth.\nThese overt expressions of demographic nativism by politicians making decisions about reproductive rights on the state and national level is cause for alarm. With the election of Donald Trump and the rise of the alt-right\u2014an umbrella for white supremacist, male supremacist, and anti-Semitic mobilizations\u2014the \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d image the Christian right and the \u201cpro-life\u201d movement have strategically invested in may be slipping, but also may be less necessary.\nCoexisting in abortion opposition is an ideology that honestly seeks to end abortion for people of all races and ethnicities, alongside a white supremacist ideology that only desires to prevent white women from obtaining abortions, but uses universal opposition to abortion as a pragmatic screen for its goals. As Kathleen Belew, author of Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement in Paramilitary America, told The Nation in an interview in September, for white supremacists, \u201copposing abortion, opposing gay rights, opposing feminism, in white power discourse, all of this is tied to reproduction and the birth of white children.\u201d\nCommenting on the strategic pragmatism of white supremacist movements, Jean Hardisty and Pam Chamberlain wrote in 2000 that \u201cpublic advocacy of abortion for women of color might alienate potential far right supporters who oppose all abortion.\u201d White supremacist leaders, like David Duke, have instead focused on other ways to deter birthrates among people of color, such as encouraging long-term contraception or condemning social welfare programs.\nThe relationship between Christian right anti-abortion, white supremacist, and secular male supremacist ideology is complex. While they often put aside their differences in order to collaborate on shared goals, the agendas are different and inclusive of conflict.\nWhite supremacist responses demonstrated \u201ccomplicated feelings\u201d following the passage of the Alabama law, as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which tracks hate and bigotry, reported. Some, like the founder of Gab, a popular alternative social media forum frequented by white supremacists and neo-Nazis, heralded the Alabama law. Other white supremacists were unsatisfied that the ban would apply to white women and women of color alike. Longtime white nationalist Tom Metzger eschewed the pragmatic approach in posting on Gab that he had instructed \u201ccomrades in the Alabama state legislature to introduce a bill that releases all nonwhite women within the borders of Alabama to have free abortions on demand.\u201d (It\u2019s not clear whether this claim is true or which representatives he meant.)\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Anglin, founder of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, writes that while abortion is \u201csick and evil,\u201d white supremacists should be focused on the immigrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d Lest readers be disappointed, Anglin reassured them, \u201cA great reckoning is coming\u2014and it is coming swiftly! The glorious vengeance we take upon these whores will shake the cosmos!\u201d Anglin recently referred to himself as the \u201cself-appointed spiritual successor to Elliot Rodger,\u201d the incel (\u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d) mass killer who intended retribution on all women for his being sexually rejected. Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi credited with coining the term \u201calt-right,\u201d tweeted that the ban should punish women who seek abortion, but instead \u201cdemonizes doctors.\u201d\nSpencer\u2019s approach, aligning with his other misogynist comments on women, flies in the face of the Christian right frame of \u201cprotecting women\u201d used to advance its agenda in the mainstream. But it\u2019s the same approach Donald Trump took while on the presidential campaign trail in 2016, when he stated that women should receive \u201csome form of punishment\u201d if abortion were banned in the United States. After anti-abortion groups made clear that this comment ran afoul of their strategy for banning abortion\u2014though not necessarily their actual preferences\u2014Trump backtracked and instead focused on punishing doctors and stating that the \u201cwoman is a victim.\u201d\nOn the other hand, MSNBC reported that AHA activists, who refer to themselves as \u201cabolitionists,\u201d stand for \u201cbanning all abortion without exceptions, equating hormonal birth control (even the daily pill kind) with abortion, and advocating that women who have abortions be tried as murderers.\u201d Under the current Supreme Court, with its Trump-instated anti-choice majority, and the president\u2019s own anti-woman rhetoric, misogyny, and nativism may be becoming more acceptable strategies.\nTrump, after all, shows a perfect willingness to cater to the Christian right, but no genuine personal interest in opposing abortion. His brand of secular misogyny, mingling objectification and vilification of women, demonstrates the same ideology as that put forth by secular male supremacist mobilizations such as Men\u2019s Rights Activists (MRAs) and The Red Pill, which have little regard for women\u2019s rights and well-being. Trump\u2019s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, demonstrated the administration\u2019s willingness to give an ear to male supremacist groups at the expense of women when she invited men\u2019s rights groups, which spread the myth that women make widespread false accusations of rape despite all data to the contrary, to weigh in on campus sexual assault policy. The result has been the regurgitation of MRA talking points and a proposed rule gutting Obama-era protection for survivors of campus sexual violence.\nThe anonymous nature of many online forums, like The Red Pill, poses a challenge for determining how much influence members of these communities have. We might be inclined to dismiss Metzger\u2019s claim to have \u201ccomrades in the Alabama state legislature\u201d as mere bluster. But before Bonnie Bacarisse\u2019s investigative reporting in The Daily Beast\u00a0 in 2017 uncovered New Hampshire Republican state Representative Robert Fisher\u00a0 as the founder of The Red Pill, which promotes conspiracist theories about feminist control of society and advocates manipulating women into sexual intercourse, these online misogynist forums were often assumed to be divorced from real-world politics. An online pseudonym that The Daily Beast has linked to Fisher\u2019s personal e-mail address advocated voting for Trump in 2016 because he\u2019d been accused of sexual violence. A spokesperson for a state anti-violence group said that Fisher was part of a \u201cvery vocal minority in the NH House right now that is very antiwoman and antivictim,\u201d and that there had been surprises in recent legislative votes.\nThese secular misogynist mobilizations address abortion in a variety of ways, though always through the lens of establishing male power and rights, even when endorsing legal abortion. Male supremacist communities seek control over women\u2019s bodies, whether it is through denying abortion care or coercing it, or through defending or even perpetrating sexual assault.\nWhile arguments about men\u2019s and fathers\u2019 rights have been used by politicians in suggesting abortion restrictions, such as requiring that a woman receive consent from the man she conceived with in order to obtain an abortion, this is not a key concern for the movements themselves. The misogynist Red Pill forum instead suggested women should have to obtain permission to give birth and that men be able to opt out of child support. The top posts on the Reddit forum r/mensrights related to abortion complain that women hold all the rights when it comes to reproduction, arguing that it is unjust that men have no say in the matter. Not because abortion kills the man\u2019s child, as the Christian right would argue, but because men are responsible for 18 years of child support if the pregnancy comes to term. MRAs and MGTOWs (Men Going Their Own Way) refer to this financial obligation as \u201cslavery\u201d and advocate for \u201cpaper abortions,\u201d where a man can sever financial responsibilities and parental claims to a child.\nPaul Elam\u2019s A Voice for Men, a leading organization in the men\u2019s rights movement over the past decade, established in 2010 an editorial policy that would not take an official position on abortion. Elam did criticize women\u2019s \u201cauthority over abortion\u201d and painted child support as a means of controlling men, writing, \u201cWe have an entire father\u2019s rights movement necessitated by the fact that millions of men have had their lives eviscerated, their freedom forfeit, their assets garnisheed, even where paternity fraud has been proven and acknowledged by the courts.\u201d\nOn Return of Kings (ROK), a website listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group for pickup artists (PUAs) and founded by Daryush Valizadeh, who goes by \u201cRoosh V.,\u201d the coverage of abortion has shifted from a position accepting of abortion\u2014though not out of support for women\u2019s human rights\u2014to an increasingly anti-choice position. In 2013, abortion was discussed as beneficial because it reduces the minority population, demonstrating the racism already inherent in this ideology, and \u201csav[es] a lot of alpha players from having to write a check to a single mom.\u201d Other posts promoted access to contraception as a means to prevent abortion, criticizing Christian right opposition to birth control as ineffective to stopping abortion.\nTwo years later, Valizadeh himself wrote a post on ROK titled \u201cWomen Must Have Their Behavior and Decisions Controlled by Men,\u201d recommending that women receive permission from a guardian to access abortion or birth control. He continues, \u201cWhile my proposals are undoubtedly extreme on the surface and hard to imagine implementing, the alternative of a rapidly progressing cultural decline that we are currently experiencing will end up entailing an even more extreme outcome.\u201d (In case you\u2019re wondering, Valizadeh has identified other offensive posts as satire, but made no such excuse for this one.) In another 2015 article, \u201cThe End Goal of Western Progressivism Is Depopulation,\u201d he condemns abortion rights, birth control, and female empowerment as causes of declining population that risk Western culture. Valizadeh has admitted to perpetrating acts that meet the legal definition of sexual assault and has endorsed the decriminalization of rape. Though he later claimed that endorsement was a \u201cthought experiment,\u201d similar excuses have been used by other misogynist leaders such as Paul Elam to provide cover for their most egregious statements.\nFurther ROK posts on abortion described it as murder and criticized abortion and birth control for destroying \u201ctraditional families.\u201d Matt Forney, a writer whose personal blog appealed to both MRAs and PUAs, referred to women who obtain abortions as \u201cmonsters,\u201d and wrote, \u201cIf a girl is in favor of abortion, there is evil dwelling in her soul.\u201d Forney is a noted white nationalist who also wrote for AltRight.com, and Valizadeh attempted to join him in cozying up with the white supremacist alt-right, sharing the concern for the decline of Western culture. (He turned against this movement after meeting hostility for being a non-white man bragging about sexual intercourse with white women.) The strongest opposition to abortion within the sphere of misogynist groups thus appears to stem from an overlap with the white supremacist movement and concern for the decline of Western culture.\nIn 2019, Valizadeh announced that he had found God and would no longer promote casual sex. His prior arguments about male control of women and his opposition to abortion and contraception on the basis of concern about population decline, however, fit seamlessly into his new perspective, demonstrating how easy it can be to shift from secular to religious misogyny.\nAs elements of the male supremacist sphere take on more anti-abortion and white supremacist positions, the confluence of this overt misogyny and racism with the anti-abortion movement may strengthen the support for harsher anti-abortion legislation that eschews the anti-abortion pragmatism of the past and becomes more overt about its criminalization of pregnant people. In 2019, Georgia passed a six-week abortion ban, currently blocked in court, that applies criminal penalties for murder (which includes life imprisonment or the death penalty) for terminating a pregnancy, with no exception for pregnant people self-terminating. Bills like this fulfill Trump\u2019s and Abolish Human Abortion\u2019s claims that the criminalization of abortion should include punishments for women; even though Trump backpedaled because of concerns from mainstream anti-choice groups, his support for this position is already out there, along with his dog whistles to white and male supremacists.\nAnti-abortion violence has also been climbing in recent years, as has white supremacist and misogynist violence. Given the history of fatal anti-abortion violence in the 1990s perpetrated by individuals with the connections with white supremacist and anti-Semitic groups, the confluence of these ideologies must be cause for concern beyond the political realm as well.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
