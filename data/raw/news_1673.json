Wade in June.The arguments being made before the Indiana justices come after the top courts in two other conservative states went in opposite directions on similar state constitutional challenges to their abortion bans; South Carolina\u2019s ban was struck down and Idaho\u2019s was upheld.\n\nIndiana Chief Justice Loretta Rush asked whether the Supreme Court should now decide the constitutionality of the abortion ban since it has been blocked by a judge\u2019s preliminary injunction order \u2014 a legal step taken without a full trial on the merits of the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Gov.

Or all of us Hoosiers, we could only receive health care for substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily functions, nothing else?\u201dThe state attorney general\u2019s office has argued that Indiana had laws against abortion when its current constitution was drafted in 1851 and that the judge\u2019s ruling wrongly created an abortion right.Fisher said the ACLU was asking Indiana courts \u201cto recognize a novel, unwritten, historically counter-indicated right to abortion.\u201dThe five-member Supreme Court, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, faces no deadline for releasing a decision, and it typically takes weeks or longer.The question of whether the Indiana Constitution protects abortion rights is undecided. A state appeals court ruled in 2004 that privacy is a core value under the state constitution that extends to all residents, including women seeking an abortion.\n\nBut the Indiana Supreme Court later upheld a law requiring an 18-hour waiting period before a woman could get an abortion without addressing whether the state constitution included the right to privacy or abortion.Court orders have allowed abortions to continue since September under existing laws generally prohibiting abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and tightly restricting it after the 13th week.Justice Christopher Goff said he considered it \u201cunprecedented\u201d to have what was considered a federal constitutional right for 50 years eliminated and asked Fisher why the question of allowing abortions shouldn\u2019t be directly voted upon by the public.\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t there be a referendum and that issue put to the people?\u201d Goff said. \u201cWhy should that end with the courts or the General Assembly?\u201d\n\nAbortion opponents lost votes on ballot measures last year in Kansas, Michigan and Kentucky, but Indiana law only provides for statewide referendums after a proposed constitutional amendment has twice been approved by the Legislature in a process that can take four years.Fisher said the voting public elected the legislators who enacted the abortion ban and abortion-rights supporters can seek to amend the state constitution.\u201cWe don\u2019t modify the constitution by way of judicial decree to say, well, in this situation, we\u2019re going to throw this question open to some kind of initiative or referendum,\u201d Fisher said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
