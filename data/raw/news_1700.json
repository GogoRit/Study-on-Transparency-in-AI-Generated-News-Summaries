Brown\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid court challenges to Florida\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, the leader of a statewide policy council who\u2019s against the medical procedure believes GOP lawmakers could push for a more restrictive ban \u2014 at around six weeks \u2014 during the Legislature\u2019s spring session.\nDemocrats fear that such a restriction \u2014 connected to a so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bill \u2014 could threaten women\u2019s reproductive rights even more.\nCurrently, Florida\u2019s 15-week ban has no exceptions for rape or incest.\nJohn Stemberger is a longtime attorney in Orlando and serves as the president of the Florida Family Policy Council, considered a \u201cleading pro-life\u201d organization. In an email to the Florida Phoenix, Stemberger said he expects an abortion ban at around six weeks, to be filed by Republicans, but\u00a0it\u2019s unclear which lawmakers will lead the effort.\nWhen the Phoenix asked Stemberger about whether there will be a potential six-week ban and which lawmakers could be pushing it, he responded:\n\u201cBecause there are so many brand-new legislators, and so many former representatives that are now senators, and then brand-new leadership in both [the] House and Senate, it\u2019s hard to say who will carry these bills,\u201d Stemberger said in an email to the Phoenix.\n\u201cSo, I really would not want to speculate. I do think you\u2019re correct that the heartbeat bill [considered a 6-week type abortion ban] is the most likely legislation to be supported by leadership, and ultimately, they will have great influence as to who the prime sponsors are.\u201d\nBut so far, Republicans have been largely mum on the issue, including Gov. Ron DeSantis. As it stands now, lawmakers haven\u2019t filed any legislation for further bans yet, though that could change as the March 7 legislative session draws near.\nHouse Speaker Paul Renner recently said, \u201cwe have a \u2018pro-life\u2019 majority,\u201d indicating that GOP lawmakers could easily push for further abortion bans in the 2023 legislative session. And Senate President Kathleen Passidomo has reiterated that she would consider a 12-week abortion ban, with exceptions for rape and incest.\nBryan Griffin, DeSantis\u2019 press secretary, didn\u2019t give specifics in an email about whether the governor is seeking further abortion restrictions but pointed to a video at a Dec. 15, 2022 news conference. In that news conference, DeSantis didn\u2019t go into detail about potential legislation, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m willing to sign great life legislation. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always said I would do.\u201d\nGriffin added: \u201cThe upcoming 2023 Florida legislative session starts in March, and we look forward to working with the Florida Legislature to further advance protections for innocent life.\u201d\nIn September 2021, House Republican lawmaker Webster Barnaby of Volusia County filed\u00a0one of the most restrictive anti-abortion bans in Florida. It was HB 167, and it was called the \u201cFlorida Heartbeat Act.\u201d It would have prohibited abortion care after around six weeks\u2019 gestation.\nThat initiative landed in a subcommittee\u00a0but eventually died\u00a0in the 2022 legislative session. Barnaby was the lone sponsor.\nDemocratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani of Orange County told the Phoenix that she hasn\u2019t \u201cheard anything but I suspect Republicans will file another extreme abortion ban as they continue to take away our freedoms and get in between Floridians and their doctors.\u201d\nState Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican representing part of Brevard County, said in a text message to the Phoenix that he\u2019s unsure about any abortion legislation at the moment. \u201cThere are 85 Republican members of the house who each can file seven bills. I can\u2019t speak for what any of them will do.\u201d\nMeanwhile, abortion rights advocates have been fighting in court to block the abortion ban entirely. Just recently, abortion providers, including Florida Planned Parenthood affiliates\u00a0wanted the Florida Supreme Court to expedite deliberations over the law and to block its enforcement in the meantime, the Phoenix wrote. The justices accepted jurisdiction but refused to block the law\u2019s enforcement.\nThe controversial bill, HB 5, was passed by the Legislature last March and signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis in April of 2022.\nAndrew Shirvell, founder of Florida Voice for the Unborn, declined to comment in an email about any potential abortion bans for the upcoming session but argued that lawmakers need to impose a complete ban in the state.\nComplete bans have been implemented in at least 13 states, according to a map from The New York Times. Georgia prohibits abortion at around 6 weeks\u2019 gestation.\n\u201cIn November 2022, pro-life Republicans attained supermajorities in both chambers of the Florida Legislature.\u00a0 As such, they have more than enough votes in each chamber \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 to enact complete protections for all of Florida\u2019s unborn children, starting at the moment of conception,\u201d Shirvell said.\n\u201cTo enact anything less than a total abortion ban would be cowardly and unacceptable in this new Dobbs era, where the U.S. Supreme Court has given, all states the opportunity to completely ban abortion within their borders for the first time since 1973. Governor DeSantis and Republican legislative leaders need to show the same boldness in protecting our state\u2019s unborn children as they have demonstrated on so many other less important issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\u2018Heartbeat bill is the most likely legislation\u2019 that could be pushed by GOP in 2023\nby Issac Morgan, Florida Phoenix January 31, 2023\n\u2018Heartbeat bill is the most likely legislation\u2019 that could be pushed by GOP in 2023\nby Issac Morgan, Florida Phoenix January 31, 2023\n Amid court challenges to Florida\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, the leader of a statewide policy council who\u2019s against the medical procedure believes GOP lawmakers could push for a more restrictive ban \u2014 at around six weeks \u2014 during the Legislature\u2019s spring session.\nDemocrats fear that such a restriction \u2014 connected to a so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bill \u2014 could threaten women\u2019s reproductive rights even more.\nCurrently, Florida\u2019s 15-week ban has no exceptions for rape or incest.\nJohn Stemberger is a longtime attorney in Orlando and serves as the president of the Florida Family Policy Council, considered a \u201cleading pro-life\u201d organization.
