And in the U.S. Senate, six pro-life women were elected, including three incumbents. If Sen. Kelly Loffler (R-Georgia) wins her runoff election Jan. 5, a Republican Senate majority will be secured with its seventh pro-life female senator.\nAll 11 pro-life female incumbents won reelection to the U.S. House, giving the chamber an unprecedented 29 female representatives committed to defending life in the womb and fighting for the voiceless.\u00a0\n\u201cA record 29 pro-life women will serve in the House of Representatives in the next Congress: continued proof that life is winning in America,\u201d states Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, in a press release by the national pro-life group. \u201cThese pro-life champions will serve as a brick wall against the radical pro-abortion agenda of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and pro-abortion Democrats dead set on taking out even modest protections for pro-life Americans such as the Hyde Amendment and similar legacy riders.\n\u201cThe exponential growth of pro-life women in the House is reflective of the fact that life has gone from being viewed as a political problem to a winning issue,\u201d Dannenfelser adds. \u201cThese women have already done important work to expose the extremism of their radical pro-abortion opponents, and we look forward to working alongside them to defend lifesaving law and policy in Congress.\u201d\nMeanwhile, New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District election results are being contested in Oswego County Supreme Court. Pro-life Republican candidate Claudia Tenney held a 29-vote lead over the Democrat incumbent with several hundred outstanding disputed absentee or affidavit ballots.\n\u201cI remember when there was just a small handful of pro-life women in the House and none in the Senate,\u201d Dannenfelser says. \u201cOver the years, Susan B. Anthony List has worked tirelessly to fix this severe underrepresentation and counter the well-funded abortion lobby. This is breathtaking progress, something that Republican insiders and even some staunch pro-lifers doubted could be done.\u201d\nProfiles of the newly elected pro-life congresswomen reflect ethnic and professional diversity in districts from the East Coast to the West Coast and north to south.\n\u201cThe rise of pro-life women leaves me more convinced than ever that momentum is on our side and the battle to save unborn children and their mothers is one we can and will win.\u201d\n\u2014Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List\nKat Cammack, 32, is the youngest GOP woman in history to be elected to Congress. In a campaign video for Florida\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Cammack recounts how doctors and her grandmother advised her mother to abort her second pregnancy with Kat after suffering a stroke during her first pregnancy. \u201cWhen given the choice, my mom chose life, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Cammack declares in the video.\nNancy Mace became the first female graduate of The Citadel in 1999. The 42-year-old single mother of two defeated a pro-abortion Democrat incumbent to become the first Republican elected to represent South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\nYvette Herrell is the first Republican female of the Cherokee Nation elected to Congress. She defeated New Mexico\u2019s 2nd District Democrat incumbent, who supported late-term abortion.\nIn California, Republicans Young Kim and Michelle Steel, both first-generation Korean-American immigrants, defeated Democrat incumbents in Districts 39 and 48 respectively.\nAnd in New York\u2019s 11th Congressional District, the only Hispanic elected official in New York City and a former state assemblywoman, Nicole Malliotakis, defeated a Democrat incumbent.\nPro-life female candidates also flipped congressional districts in Oklahoma, Florida, Iowa and Minnesota, all previously held by Democrats.\nStephanie Bice, a fourth-generation Oklahoman, is also the first Iranian American ever elected to Congress. Bice defeated a pro-choice incumbent to represent Oklahoma\u2019s 5th Congressional District.\nAnd in Florida\u2019s 27th Congressional District\u2014including Miami Beach, Little Havana and portions of Miami-Dade County\u2014Maria Salazar, a Cuban American journalist and television broadcaster, unseated pro-abortion incumbent Donna Shalala, former secretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration.\nVoters in Iowa\u2019s 1st and 2nd congressional districts elected Republicans Ashley Hinson and Mariannette Miller-Meeks respectively. Hinson, an award-winning journalist and mother of two, defeated Democrat incumbent Abby Finkenauer, who refused to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Such legislation aimed to ensure that a baby born alive during a failed abortion receives life-sustaining medical care is currently being denied a vote on the House floor by Speaker Pelosi. Miller-Meeks\u2019 election flips another House seat previously held by a Democrat who didn\u2019t seek reelection.\nRepublican Michelle Fischbach, whose husband, Scott, heads up Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, unseated a 15-term Democrat incumbent in that state\u2019s 7th District.\nIn Tennessee\u2019s 1st Congressional District, Republican Diana Harshbarger, a pharmacist from Kingsport, won nearly 75% of the vote. In a campaign ad, Harshbarger says, \u201cJesus is Lord, and His light fills our lives, even through the chaos.\u201d\nAnd while the Democrat-led state legislature in Illinois has sanctioned taxpayer-funded abortion up until the moment of birth, Republican Mary Miller was elected to represent the state\u2019s 15th Congressional District as a pro-life champion. The farmer, mother of seven children and grandmother of 17, says her family and faith in God inspired her to seek election to Congress.\nMarjorie Taylor Greene was elected to represent Georgia\u2019s 14th Congressional District. \u201cLife starts at conception,\u201d she says. \u201cMy goal is to end abortion in America. Killing a baby in the womb is the worst lie sold to women. And it doesn\u2019t solve problems. Nor is it women\u2019s health care.\u201d\nIndiana, Colorado, Michigan and Texas also elected pro-life women to Congress.\u00a0\nDannenfelser says the pro-life wave in Congress shows that the pro-choice movement is losing ground in America. \u201cThe rise of pro-life women leaves me more convinced than ever that momentum is on our side and the battle to save unborn children and their mothers is one we can and will win,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that no \u2018mandate\u2019 exists to enact deeply unpopular policies expanding abortion-on-demand through the moment of birth, paid for by taxpayers, as Biden and Harris have promised.\u201d\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Courtesy of Susan B.
