The plaintiffs represent just a fraction of the many red-state residents who\u2019ve been denied emergency abortions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this past June. Their suit asks Texas courts to rule that existing state law permits emergency reproductive care\u2014or to strike down the most lethal restrictions.\nTexas has not yet responded to this complaint. But we don\u2019t have to guess the state\u2019s reaction, because it has already staked out a position on this exact question: Texas\u2019 abortion bans strictly bar doctors from terminating a pregnancy until it is actively killing the patient or impairing a \u201cmajor bodily function.\u201d That is what Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced this summer in his successful effort to block state hospitals from providing abortions before the patient is close to death. Paxton declared in federal court that Texas law does not allow an abortion when it\u2019s necessary to \u201cstabilize\u201d a patient in a downward health spiral. The procedure is legal only once a doctor becomes certain that, without it, the patient will either die or permanently lose a major bodily function (which is undefined). A doctor charged with terminating a pregnancy before this point of fatal certitude faces 99 years\u2019 imprisonment if prosecuted and convicted.\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion advocates have tried to blame this denial of care to pregnant patients on greedy hospitals, activist doctors, and even the media outlets that report on it. But the new lawsuit makes it clear that the responsibility falls entirely on Texas\u2019 abortion bans. (There are three overlapping statutes.) These laws were designed to outlaw the termination of pregnancies that pose a serious\u2014but not indisputably fatal\u2014threat to the patient\u2019s life. They are working as intended.\nEach plaintiff\u2019s story illustrates exactly how the state\u2019s ban prevents doctors from following the well-establish standard of care to pregnant patients in crisis. Take Amanda Zurawski, the lead plaintiff. At nearly 18 weeks, Zurawski was diagnosed with an incompetent cervix, a condition that causes premature dilation and prolapsing membranes. That evening, her water broke, so she went to the emergency room. There was no chance her fetus could survive, but it still showed \u201ccardiac activity,\u201d so doctors told her they could not terminate until her health collapsed. After three painful days, she developed a high fever, a symptom of sepsis. The doctors finally agreed to terminate, deeming her life to be in true, imminent peril\u2014but only after awaiting the hospital ethics committee\u2019s approval.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nZurawski then spent three days in the ICU. While there, doctors discovered that the untreated infection had caused a secondary infection and massive scarring in her reproductive system, which required a procedure to remove the scar tissue. The result was that one of her fallopian tubes remains permanently closed, making a future pregnancy even more difficult.\nThis story, and others like it, are not the result of some liberal conspiracy to drum up opposition to abortion bans, as some conservatives claim. They are, rather, the inevitable consequence of Texas\u2019 ban.\nSome history: The anti-abortion movement has long opposed exceptions for any reason, treating health carveouts with heightened suspicion. Opponents of reproductive health care believe that women and physicians will exaggerate the threat of a pregnancy, or concoct a fake condition, in order to justify an abortion. So the anti-abortion lobby persuaded a majority of red states to adopt bans with an extraordinarily narrow exception not for a patient\u2019s \u201chealth,\u201d but only for her \u201clife.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThese exceptions are also intentionally vague, failing to define key terms so that doctors are rarely certain when they can legally terminate and often err on the side of refusing an abortion. After all, if they fall on the wrong side of the line, they could face 99 years\u2019 incarceration. (In a sense, Texas\u2019 law is generous: Other states, like Tennessee, do not have a true exception for the patient\u2019s life; they simply allow doctors to cite concern for the patient\u2019s life as an affirmative defense once they\u2019re being prosecuted.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nPaxton, the Republican Texas attorney general, has staunchly defended the extreme interpretation of Texas\u2019 bans, with no dissent from Gov. Greg Abbott or Republican legislators. In July, Joe Biden\u2019s administration tried to impose a baseline standard of care for pregnant patients with health crises, issuing guidance under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA. That law requires hospitals to provide \u201cstabilizing treatment\u201d to anyone with an \u201cemergency health condition,\u201d expressly including pregnant patients. The administration said EMTALA compels hospitals to provide abortions when they are necessary to treat a condition that is \u201clikely or certain to become emergent without stabilizing treatment.\u201d It also claimed that, as a federal law, EMTALA preempted any Texas statutes with narrower exceptions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nPaxton swiftly filed suit to block Biden\u2019s guidance in Texas. He shopped the case to Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Donald Trump appointee who was certain to agree with him. In ruling for the state, Hendrix juxtaposed the EMTALA with Texas law and found that they conflicted. Texas, he explained, \u201climits abortions to when the medical condition is life-threatening.\u201d EMTALA, by contrast, requires treatment for any condition that \u201ccould reasonably be expected\u201d to put the patient\u2019s health \u201cin serious jeopardy.\u201d Texas\u2019 standard, Hendrix concluded, is much more difficult to meet: A patient must be not only in \u201cjeopardy\u201d but at dire risk of death without an abortion. Moreover, Hendrix identified a divergence in timing: EMTALA requires treatment for a condition that is \u201clikely or certain\u201d to \u201cbecome emergent.\u201d Texas law, however, permits abortion only when a patient is certain to die, or sustain irreversible and catastrophic damage to a \u201cmajor bodily function,\u201d without treatment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nHendrix sided with Texas over the Biden administration, issuing an injunction that barred the government from enforcing EMTALA against state hospitals that do not provide emergency abortions. Paxton celebrated the victory, proclaiming: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow left-wing bureaucrats in Washington to transform our hospitals and emergency rooms into walk-in abortion clinics.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs in this new case want the state courts to interpret Texas law differently so that it allows for abortion when a patient\u2019s health is in serious jeopardy\u2014even if a doctor cannot prove (to a jury) that the patient would have died without one at the time of the abortion. They want to let patients like Zurawski obtain lifesaving care before they are actually at death\u2019s door. Failing that, the plaintiffs want Texas courts to broaden the exception by establishing a right to emergency abortion care under the state constitution. They are likely to face staunch opposition from Paxton and the Texas GOP. (A few Republican legislators who helped write two abortion bans now claim they intended their statutes to be less restrictive, but that rationale cannot apply to the third ban, which was passed in 1857.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plaintiffs want something more, too: They want the courts to create a right of patients to terminate a fetus that is deemed \u201cincompatible with life,\u201d meaning it has a condition that will prevent it from surviving after birth. Here, too, they will find stiff resistance. The anti-abortion movement vigorously resists such exceptions, rejecting the very concept of a fetal condition that\u2019s incompatible with life. Thus, the exception is absent from Texas\u2019 bans.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nOne plaintiff in the suit, Lauren Hall, suffered the consequences of this decision: Her fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly at 18 weeks, which hinders the development of a skull and brain. Yet no medical provider in Texas would even speak to her about abortion, evidently for fear of civil or criminal liability. She eventually flew to Seattle for the procedure.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nHall is just one of many women forced to carry a nonviable pregnancy because of a strict abortion ban. But she, like her fellow plaintiffs, faces a steep climb in the Texas judiciary. The state Supreme Court is composed of nine Republicans, none of whom have shown any solicitude for reproductive rights. The plaintiffs are essentially asking the courts to create a legal ruling that compels the state to respect a physician\u2019s judgment about when, exactly, termination is necessary to spare the patient a lifelong injury or possible death. But in overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court said it would leave these decisions \u201cto the people and their elected representatives.\u201d The hard-right Texas judiciary seems likely to agree.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the effort is entirely hopeless. Doctors and patients desperately need help navigating Texas\u2019 new abortion regime; the state courts may at least provide some clarity about the line that a condition must cross before it justifies an abortion. For instance, just how certain must a doctor be that their patient is dying before terminating their pregnancy? 10 percent? 50 percent? 100 percent? In practice, the answer today is: certain enough that they\u2019ll take the risk of prosecution and incarceration. The courts could impose a clear standard that defers to the doctor\u2019s reasonable judgment, shielding them from prosecution if their diagnosis was defensible.\nBut that won\u2019t solve the underlying problem: Texas\u2019 bans reflect the belief that it is worth risking a patient\u2019s life to save the fetus, because the fetus simply matters more. Until the legislature changes the law, pregnant patients will keep risking sepsis, hemorrhage, and other horrific ailments before getting the care they need. Eventually, someone will die. And the state has already decided that this death will have been worth the trade-off.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Jurisprudence\n            \n\n\n              Republicans\n            \n\n\n              Texas\n            \n\n\n              Judiciary\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
