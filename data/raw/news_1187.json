Wade. Then there\u2019s Wisconsin, where a politically divided government, a hotly contested election season, and a 173-year-old law that criminalizes nearly all abortions are making for a potentially chaotic post-Roe landscape.The prospect of a restoration of the 1849 statute has upended the midwestern swing state. Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general, a Democrat, has vowed not to enforce it but can\u2019t stop local officials from doing so. And while Democratic Gov. Tony Evers supports repealing the law, Republicans control the state legislature, where such efforts will go nowhere. On the flip side, GOP lawmakers are unable to further restrict abortions in the state because of Evers\u2019 veto power. It\u2019s a reality that is quickly reshaping Wisconsin\u2019s already competitive races for governor, attorney general, and the U.S. Senate ahead of the Aug. 9 primaries. \u201cThis has changed Wisconsin politics in the snap of a finger,\u201d says Mordechai Lee, an urban planning professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and a former member of the state assembly and state senate. \u201cThe fall election is going to be a referendum on abortion.\u201dWisconsin is one of 10 states with a pre-existing law to ban abortion. All such laws were nullified after the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling granting a constitutional right to an abortion. But if the court strikes down that ruling this summer\u2014as a leaked draft, first reported by Politico, suggested it would\u2014those laws will automatically be reinstated. Thirteen red states also have so-called trigger laws that would immediately outlaw or curtail abortion rights if such a ruling is issued.The Wisconsin law is notably stringent. It constitutes performing or assisting in any abortion as a Class H felony, punishable by up to six years in prison. The consequences are even more severe for the termination of an \u201cunborn quick child,\u201d i.e. a fetus that can move in the womb\u2014a Class E felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The law only allows for abortions when the health of the mother is at risk. It does not include any exemptions for victims of rape or incest.It didn\u2019t take long after the draft opinion leaked for the battle lines to emerge in the Badger State. Attorney General Josh Kaul, Wisconsin\u2019s top law enforcement official, has said his office would not enforce the 19th Century law, and urged local officials not to do so either. His leading Republican challenger has said he would enforce it. It\u2019s a similar dynamic in the governor\u2019s race, where the winner would largely determine whether Republicans can impose even stricter restrictions on abortions once Roe is tossed out. Evers, 70, currently serves as the only defense against the legislature beefing up restrictions on abortion access. Last year, he vetoed five such bills that were sent to his desk. He is also leading a coalition of 17 governors urging Congress to pass a nationwide right to abortion. Several Republican candidates for governor made clear this week that they would support enforcement of the 1849 law if elected. \u201cThe left wants to enforce mob rule and further degrade law and order in Wisconsin,\u201d says Kevin Nicholson, one of the leading GOP candidates. \u201cWisconsin needs new leadership\u2014leaders that will follow the law and protect innocent life.\u201d Another candidate, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, celebrated the leaked ruling. \u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d she tweeted.Close Madison watchers suspect that a Republican in the governor\u2019s mansion would support the legislature passing even tighter restrictions to update the pre-Civil War law, such as adding language to prohibit the use of abortion pills. \u201cThat\u2019s a murky area of the law that they may want to address,\u201d says David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it comes into play the governor\u2019s race\u2014stopping any additional legislation that would make access to abortions even more difficult,\u201d Canon added.More than 60 percent of Wisconsinites support legalized abortion, according to polling conducted by the Marquette Law School over the last 10 years. And the conventional wisdom has already formed that the overturning of Roe would motivate key Democratic constituencies, particularly women and young people. Wisconsin GOP strategists, however, insisted that the electorate would care more about the economy than access to reproductive care. \u201cIt will energize the Democratic base in the short term, but in the long term, people are still going to vote on pocketbook issues: inflation, gas prices, food prices, immigration, and crime,\u201d says Bill McCoshen, who served as chief of staff to former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson. If Roe is overturned, Lee predicted that the media would be looking for \u201ccase number one\u2014a woman who wanted to get an abortion but couldn\u2019t afford to go to Chicago or Minnesota and has to have the kid.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen before November, but I don\u2019t think voters will need to see a prosecution to feel strongly about the issue,\u201d he added.The leaked draft opinion may also become a galvanizing force in the U.S. Senate race, where the Republican incumbent, Ron Johnson, is up for reelection. On Wednesday, he said that the draft\u2019s contents represented the \u201ccorrect decision.\u201d The three leading Democrats running to unseat him have vowed to support codifying a right to abortion into federal law.One of those Democrats, Sarah Godlewski, is currently Wisconsin\u2019s state treasurer, an elected position. She was visiting Washington, D.C., this week for a conference hosted by Emily\u2019s List\u2014an organization that, ironically enough, works to elect women who support abortion rights. She and a friend heard about the leak Monday night while driving to the house where she was staying. Almost immediately, she says, they turned the car around and headed to the Supreme Court.As she stood in front of the courthouse that evening among hundreds of others, she emphasized the practical implications in her state, where access to abortion had become endangered once again. \u201cWhat frustrates me is we\u2019ve had 50 years to codify this into law,\u201d Godlewski said in an interview, raising her voice above the roar of chants. \u201cThe Democrats have had the House, the Senate, and the White House, and yet we haven\u2019t gotten this done. Now we\u2019re waiting for the final hour to try to pull something together. Enough is enough.\u201d Godlweski didn\u2019t wait long to make Roe a central campaign issue. By Thursday morning, she launched her first abortion-related ad of the midterm season.
