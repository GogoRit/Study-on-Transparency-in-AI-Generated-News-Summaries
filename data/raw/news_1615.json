These conditions result in miscarriage, stillbirth or are otherwise unsurvivable for a baby. A child born with one would be expected to live for only a few weeks at best.\u00a0\nAcrania \u2013 a disorder where a fetus develops without a complete skull \u2013 was put on the list after Baton Rouge resident Nancy Davis told reporters she had been denied an abortion in Louisiana for a fetus with that diagnosis.\u00a0\nAs in the previous version, the new rule also includes catch-all language to cover unsurvivable conditions for babies that are not explicitly mentioned. It says a person could end their pregnancy if two physicians determined their fetus is \u201cincompatible with sustaining life after birth.\u201d \nThe health department released the new version of the emergency rule last week because the previous one on \u201cmedically futile\u201d pregnancies was lapsing.

It looked exactly the same as the recently released emergency rule. \n\nThe agency publicly advertised that proposed rule in September and held a hearing on it in October.
