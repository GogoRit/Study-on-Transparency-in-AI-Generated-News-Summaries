Two pro-life activists have been accused by the Department of Justice (DOJ) of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.\u00a0    Defendants Bevelyn Williams and Edmee Chavannes of Tennessee are charged in connection with \"a multi-year campaign to interfere with individuals seeking to obtain and provide lawful reproductive health services in New York and in several other states.\"ZERO ARRESTS IN AT LEAST 17 JANE'S REVENGE ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE ORGANIZATIONS  \"As alleged, the defendants repeatedly attempted \u2014 including by using threats, and on at least one occasion, force \u2014 to prevent individuals from accessing their legal right to reproductive health services,\"\u00a0said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. \"This Office will remain committed to ensuring that healthcare facilities, their staff, and those seeking to obtain reproductive health services can continue to do so without unlawful interference.\"  This combo of photos provided by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department shows pro-life activists Edmee Chavannes, left, and Bevelyn Williams, right. (Metropolitan Nashville Police Department via AP)  Williams and Chavannes live-streamed their attempts to stop individuals from soliciting abortions on social media, promising to \"terrorize\" targeted abortion clinics, prosecutors say.  LETTER SIGNED BY RADICAL ABORTION GROUP JANE'S REVENGE DECLARES \u2018OPEN SEASON\u2019 ON PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERSRead the indictment:Not a single arrest has been made in the more than a dozen attacks on pro-life organizations across the country claimed by left-wing pro-abortion group Jane\u2019s Revenge.  Jane\u2019s Revenge has claimed responsibility for at least 18 arson and vandalism attacks on crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) and other faith-based organizations throughout the U.S. since the May 2 leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  A pro-life pregnancy center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was vandalized on Tuesday, and the group Jane's Revenge has claimed responsibility for carrying out the act in an online post. (Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life)  The Federal Bureau of Investigation first told Fox News Digital in June that it had launched an investigation into the targeted vandalism.\u00a0    The FBI said in a Sept. 7 statement that it was still investigating the \"series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the US Supreme Court,\" but it made no mention of Jane\u2019s Revenge specifically.
