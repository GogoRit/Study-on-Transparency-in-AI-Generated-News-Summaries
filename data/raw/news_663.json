Out of 87 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) at Stormont last week, just 12 voted to allow women the right to choose abortion in line with international human rights standards. These are built into a law smuggled into NI while the institutions in Belfast were collapsed in acrimony in 2019, following an inspiring collective effort by local feminists and the British Labour MP Stella Creasy. Jubilant, proud, relieved and tearful, women stood at Stormont with banners that said, simply, \u201cDecriminalised\u201d.But so far, Stormont has succeeded in thwarting the implementation of the new law, leading the NI Human Rights Commission to mount a legal challenge. On Thursday, the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis intervened and is expected next week to direct that the services to which women are legally entitled are actually made available. The Good Friday agreement promised equality \u2013 the continued stymying of abortion access is a depressing indicator of just how far we are from reaching it.Feminists campaigned for decades to get the British government to deal with the fact that women in Northern Ireland were denied the same reproductive rights as women in the rest of the UK. Abortion was all but banned. Thousands of women crossed the Irish Sea for terminations in England. Ultimately, the UN found the UK government was in contravention of its obligations under international human rights laws and the supreme court obliged it to act. The law allows abortion in many circumstances, including after 24 weeks in cases where severe foetal impairment is diagnosed. The bill the DUP brought to its second stage at Stormont last week seeks to restrict this right except when the impairment is fatal.The UN\u2019s committee for the elimination of discrimination against women (Cedaw) included in its recommendations to the UK \u201cthat abortion on the ground of severe foetal impairment be available to facilitate reproductive choice and autonomy\u201d. It also called for social and financial support for women who decide to carry such pregnancies to term.The DUP calls abortion one of its \u201cred line\u201d issues. Yet a 2020 poll showed almost 60% of people believe abortion should be decriminalised, rising to 70% when it comes to fatal foetal abnormality cases. Westminster\u2019s interventions must be a matter of private relief to the party, but it will do all it can to signal to its more conservative voters (including a significant fire and brimstone element) that it continues to fight the good fight.Progressives are used to being appalled by the DUP. The party also last week fought back against an expert panel calling for sexual orientation and gender equality to be included in relationships and sex education (RSE) in schools, high profile figures have recently defended conversion therapy, and the party is against same sex marriage, which also had to be brought in by Westminster. But there was bewilderment and anger among feminists over Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s behaviour on the abortion bill. The party\u2019s 27 MLAs all abstained.Sinn Fein\u2019s president, Mary Lou McDonald, defended the decision. She said the DUP bill was a \u201cstunt\u201d. One woman who found herself trapped with a devastating diagnosis and unable to get a late abortion several years ago told me the proposed bill felt like yet another punishment, and she was \u201cbeyond disappointed\u201d that Sinn F\u00e9in had not \u201cstood up and just said no\u201d.The truth is that Sinn F\u00e9in could not do this \u2013 because it supports the DUP\u2019s position. It does not \u201ctrust women\u201d as feminism requires. There is a smiling photograph of Mary Lou McDonald and the North\u2019s deputy first minister Michelle O\u2019Neill in 2018 on the day when the referendum to lift the abortion ban in the Republic was won: they\u2019re holding a banner that says, \u201cThe North is Next!\u201d While it is now broadly pro-choice, Sinn F\u00e9in shares the DUP\u2019s position that some abortion rights must be legally restricted. It does not support the UN\u2019s recommendation on severe foetal impairment. Voting with the DUP would have been honest but impossibly embarrassing to it, so abstention was the only option.McDonald said her party wants \u201cthe same legislative framework and regime\u201d to apply to the whole of Ireland. The Republic\u2019s legislation on the late abortion issue is actually in line with the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s. It does not work for women, because the distinction between severe and fatal impairment is in practice often impossible to make. Some severe abnormalities are not even detectable until 20 weeks, and women, their families and their doctors should not be forced to make an inevitably painful decision while also facing complex legal hurdles. But Sinn F\u00e9in will not risk alienating entirely those among its core voters who are as conservative as the DUP.Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann of the Ulster Unionist party, has refused to commission the services except in very limited circumstances, claiming public consultation and executive agreement are required \u2013 to implement a British law. The DUP has vowed to fight the British over this. Throughout the pandemic, women have continued to have to cross the Irish Sea to get abortions in England. As Green party leader Clare Bailey noted, this is hypocrisy. The DUP\u2019s \u201cfrenzied\u201d opposition to the Irish Sea border installed in the Brexit trade deal was, she pointed out, supposedly about the alleged diminishment of Britishness yet when it came to women\u2019s rights, the party insisted we remain in \u201ca place apart\u201d.Both Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP know that the law has to comply with the UN\u2019s recommendations. This could end up in the courts again, causing more delay, more torture for women in heartbreaking situations. Brave women laid their souls bare through court case after court case to get these rights. Just 12 of Northern Ireland\u2019s politicians are willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.\nSusan McKay is an Irish writer and journalist\nExplore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandOpinionAbortionDemocratic Unionist party (DUP)Sinn F\u00e9inNorthern Irish politicscommentShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyNorthern Ireland can create abortion clinic buffer zones, supreme court rules7 Dec 2022UK\u00a0government to accelerate abortion services delivery in Northern Ireland19 May 2022Abortion services in Northern Ireland almost nonexistent despite legalisation4 May 2022UK\u00a0government preparing to override Northern Ireland on abortion services24 Mar 2022Abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in 2019 \u2013 so why are we still waiting for it?29 Oct 2021Sinn F\u00e9in welcomes call for progress on Northern Ireland abortion services28 Oct 2021Northern Ireland Office may directly instruct trusts to offer abortion services27 Oct 2021Northern Ireland secretary failed to comply with abortion duty, judge rules14 Oct 2021Northern Irish woman told to go to England for abortion gets case heard26 May 2021Most viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
