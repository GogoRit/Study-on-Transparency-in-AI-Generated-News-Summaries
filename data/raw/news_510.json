(Credit: CBS)\n\nAfter an often emotional debate, the Florida House on Friday overwhelmingly passed a bill that would prevent doctors from performing abortions that women seek because of tests showing that fetuses will have disabilities.\n\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 74-44, largely along party lines, to approve the bill (HB 1221), sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach. The bill addresses what it describes as \u201cdisability abortions,\u201d which would involve situations in which physicians know pregnant women are seeking abortions because fetuses will have disabilities.\n\n\nSuch disabilities could include such things as physical disabilities, intellectual or mental disabilities or Down syndrome. With one week in the legislative session, the Senate has not moved forward with such a bill \u2014 making it unlikely that a measure will ultimately pass. But Grall\u2019s bill drew heavy debate, \u201cWe have a duty to protect innocent life,\u201d said Rep. Clay Yarborough, a Jacksonville Republican who supported the bill.\n\n\nBut Rep. Kelly Skidmore, D-Boca Raton, said the bill was about banning abortions. \u201cA ban is a ban is a ban is a ban. Abortion is health care, abortion is health care, abortion is health care,\u201d she said.\n\n\nRepublicans Mike Caruso of Delray Beach, Sam Killebrew of Winter Haven and Rene Plasencia of Orlando joined Democrats in opposing the bill. Miami Democrat James Bush voted for it.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\nSubmit a correction\nSubmit a news tip\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please note that article corrections should be submitted for grammar or syntax issues.If you have other concerns about the content of this article, please submit a news tip.Article URL *What needs to be corrected? *The video in the article is missingI found errors in the articleThe video in the article is missing and I found errors in the articleWhat needs to be corrected in the article? *Submit \n\n\n\t\tCopyright \u00a92024 Fort Myers Broadcasting.
