That can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many people know they\u2019re pregnant. Preterm-Cleveland and other Ohio abortion clinics challenge the law as a violation of the Ohio Constitution. The ruling allows the case to proceed in county court, where the state is arguing that the Ohio Constitution doesn\u2019t mention abortion and therefore doesn\u2019t protect the right to one.Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins knocked that argument when he issued his preliminary injunction from the bench in October. He said a right doesn\u2019t have to be named to be protected.\n\nA previous challenge to the Ohio law\u2019s constitutionality under the U.S. Constitution was dropped after the nation\u2019s high court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortions in June.\nSwift action by Republican Attorney General Dave Yost allowed the Ohio law, signed in 2019, to take immediate effect in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, but only briefly until the challenge under the state\u2019s constitution was filed.Two different groups announced plans this week to pursue ballot issues to change Ohio\u2019s constitution permanently to protect abortion rights. Majority Republicans at the Statehouse have said they want to raise the threshold for changing the constitution from a simple majority to a 60% supermajority to try to thwart that effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIE CARR SMYTH\n\n\n                Smyth has covered government and politics from Columbus, Ohio, for The Associated Press since 2006.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
