How they\u2019d told their families, picked out a name, built a crib and bought pink sheets.\nShe wanted them to experience the agony she felt when she learned that her fetus was developing without a skull or a brain, a condition her doctors told her was \u201cincompatible with life.\u201d\nMany of the protesters had traveled to Washington state all the way from Texas, just like Hall had. She wished she could make them answer for the state\u2019s near-total ban on abortions after the overturning of Roe v. Wade just a few weeks prior.\nAs Hall learned the hard way, the law makes no exception for lethal fetal anomalies. Pregnant people are now required to just wait, endangering their own lives with no hope of ever bringing home a baby. Or, like Hall, they can shell out thousands of dollars to abruptly travel out of state while grieving a lost pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHall managed not to scream any of this at the protesters, instead just silently flipping them off.\nOnce she made her way through the clinic\u2019s stringent security, the nurses took her into a private room. Hall, raised in a conservative Christian family outside Dallas, felt like she had whiplash from the sudden and tragic events that had brought her to an abortion clinic halfway across the country.\nA doctor she had never met entered the room.\n\u201cShe just put her arms around me and took my hand and she was like, \u2018I know you don\u2019t want to be here, but you\u2019re in good hands. We\u2019re going to take care of you, and you\u2019re going to be OK,\u2019\u201d Hall remembers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter holding it together all morning, Hall burst into tears.\n\u201cIt was just the most tender moment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it just occurred to me that the people I\u2019ve been told my whole life are going to hell for their actions were the most kind and angelic individuals through this whole thing.\u201d\nJoyful beginnings\nGrowing up outside Dallas, Hall often heard that abortion was murder and, perhaps worse, interfering with God\u2019s plan. But even from a young age, she had a lot of questions about what she saw as a deeply unforgiving idea.\n\u201cI would always say, \u2018What if it was necessary to save the life of the mother? Or in cases of rape or incest? Or what if the pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that was always the scenario I used to explain what a ban would do, and I never met a self-proclaimed conservative that doesn\u2019t think those exceptions should be in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHall went on to become a nurse and, together with her husband, created a life in the same town where they both grew up. Frustrated with her experience on hormonal birth control, she and her husband decided it was time for her to get off of it.\n\u201cWe both have good jobs, we\u2019ve got a house and we were at a place where \u2026 if it happens, it happens,\u201d she said. \u201cTook no time at all.\u201d\nWhen she first saw that positive pregnancy test, she panicked \u2014 even at 27, she said, her first reaction was that of a 15-year-old, worried about telling her parents. But then an overwhelming sense of calm washed over her.\nThis was fine. In fact, this was good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe and her husband immediately jumped into planning mode, scheduling an appointment at one of the only OB-GYN practices in town. She knew the doctors at the practice were both proud members of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, but she waved it off. After all, she didn\u2019t need an abortion \u2014 she needed convenient pregnancy care.\nAfter she got through the first trimester, Hall and her husband both heaved a sigh of relief and got to work telling their friends and family. Everyone was thrilled, buying them car seats and baby clothes.\nWhen they learned they were having a girl, Hall and her husband even picked out a name: Amelia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Hall shelled out thousands of dollars to abruptly travel out of state while grieving a lost pregnancy.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nHall was in her second trimester when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional protection for abortion and allowing states to set their own laws governing abortion access. In Texas, the second-largest state in the nation, legal abortion immediately ceased to be an option except to save the life of the pregnant patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHall was outraged about the world that her daughter was going to be born into, but she didn\u2019t worry too much about how this would affect her pregnancy.\nAlmost immediately, though, Texas\u2019 conflicting and confusing laws on abortion started to cause problems for pregnancy care. All of Texas\u2019 abortion laws have exceptions to treat miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, a potentially life-threatening condition in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus, as well as to save the life of the pregnant patient.\nBut pregnancy care isn\u2019t as clear cut as the law makes it out to be, doctors say, and fear of criminal prosecution has led medical professionals to delay or deny care they otherwise would have provided.\nResearchers with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin documented several cases in which doctors waited to treat pregnancy complications until a patient\u2019s health had deteriorated to the point that their life was in danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a letter from the Texas Medical Association, a physician in Central Texas was instructed not to treat an ectopic pregnancy until it ruptured, which can cause serious medical complications.\nPatients experiencing miscarriage have also struggled to get prescriptions filled for misoprostol, which is used both to treat miscarriages and induce abortions.\nEarlier this month, Gov. Greg Abbott said there were \u201csome things that we need to work on\u201d to ensure patients can get treatment for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.\n\u201cThere has been apprehension by doctors about dealing with both of those two issues,\u201d Abbott told Fox 4 News. \u201cI want to see legislation come out that will both do more as well as clarify the ways that we are protecting the life of the mother.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he did not address the question of lethal fetal anomalies, which are fatal for the fetus during pregnancy or shortly after birth. Texas\u2019 abortion laws make no exception for these cases, which are not as rare as people would like to imagine, said Dr. John Thoppil, an Austin OB-GYN and president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\u201cThis is already incredibly difficult news that someone receives,\u201d Thoppil said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re forcing someone to continue the pregnancy and go through all the risks of a potentially term delivery and all those potential complications for a pregnancy that has no chance of surviving. It just seems cruel and unusual.\u201d\nMany of these lethal fetal abnormalities come to light at an anatomy scan performed later in pregnancy. Hall was 18 weeks along when she went in for hers on a Friday afternoon.\n\u201cI was so excited for this appointment because it\u2019s so good to see her in there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was a vibe immediately. I\u2019m a nurse. I knew something was wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pregnancy interrupted\nHall\u2019s fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly, a neural tube defect in which the brain, skull and scalp do not develop properly in the womb.\nMost of these pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth. Anencephalic babies born alive will likely survive only for hours or days; they will be unconscious, blind, deaf and will not voluntarily respond to touch or sound, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nHall\u2019s maternal-fetal medicine specialist laid out the best-case scenario: If she managed to carry to term and deliver a live baby, with miracles of medicine, science and technology, they might be able to keep her alive for a few weeks, tied to machines and without hope of recovery.\nHall\u2019s entire vision of this pregnancy \u2014 giving birth, becoming a mom, watching her daughter grow up \u2014 evaporated in an instant. She was bereft, unable to even process the news. Her husband took over, asking the doctor what, if anything, they could do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately, they sensed hesitation from the doctor. Eventually, she laid out their options: Keep carrying the pregnancy or leave Texas to get an abortion.\n\u201cAnd she said, \u2018If you do that, don\u2019t tell anybody why you\u2019re traveling, don\u2019t tell your jobs, don\u2019t tell anyone at the airport,\u2019\u201d Hall remembers. \u201cWhich sounds extreme, but Roe had just been overturned. Everyone was so scared.\u201d\nHall and her husband left the specialist\u2019s office in a daze. Once inside the car, they both burst into tears, for their baby and the terrible choices they were now left to navigate.\nIf she wanted to stay in Texas, Hall\u2019s only choice was to continue with a pregnancy that would not yield a healthy, living baby. But that comes with the same significant risks that accompany a viable pregnancy, said Dr. CeCe Cheng, a high-risk OB-GYN in San Antonio. Cheng did not treat Hall, but has counseled patients facing similar situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the changes your body faces in pregnancy are going to be very similar, no matter if your fetus is viable or whether the baby won\u2019t survive on the outside,\u201d said Cheng, who is also a fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just the physical changes, but the emotional toll of knowing their baby is not going to survive and just waiting for something to happen so they can get the care they need.\u201d\nThe emotional toll was what worried Hall most of all.\n\u201cIt was just a matter of time before the baby died, or maybe I\u2019d have to go through the trauma of carrying to term knowing I wasn\u2019t bringing a baby home,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nHall has struggled with depression, and as the weekend wore on, her mental health deteriorated. One of the most painful parts was trying to reach her medical team. Rather than warmth and sympathy, she was met with fear, hesitation and, worst of all, silence.\nHer mental health spiraled to the point that she considered checking herself into the hospital. But she was too scared to tell health care providers what was going on for fear that they would know she was considering an abortion.\n\u201cI was losing my mind,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI would consider what I experienced that weekend a medical emergency.\u201d\nAt the same time, she was searching for abortion clinics. She considered Colorado and New Mexico, the nearest states without a total ban, but both states are being inundated with patients from Texas and elsewhere.\nEventually, she found a clinic near Seattle that provides specialty care for patients who have decided to terminate due to lethal fetal abnormalities. She and her husband booked outrageously expensive last-minute flights, got a hotel and, four days after they got the news that upended their world, flew out of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\nDespite the tragedy she was facing, Hall knew she was one of the lucky ones. They had savings to fund this last-minute trip, and because her company is based in Illinois, her insurance covered the procedure.\nAnd surprisingly, both of their families sent money to help pay for the trip, despite their anti-abortion sentiments.\n\u201cThey were just all shocked, like, \u2018Surely, there\u2019s an exception for this,\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t occur to them that a ban would include cases like this.\u201d\nMany Texans facing this same set of circumstances won\u2019t have the means to leave the state, Thoppil said, contributing to the state\u2019s high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, particularly among communities of color.\n\u201cThe women who will be forced to carry these babies are the women with less resources,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a huge leap to see that our rates of complications will go up because we have a selection bias on who is going to have to continue more complicated pregnancies.\u201d\nCheng, in San Antonio, said that even as she cautiously points her patients to their options out-of-state, she\u2019s well aware that many of them struggle to even make it to their appointments in-state.\n\u201cMany of the patients that we see in my practice already have to drive so far away to get basic prenatal care,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re the primary caregiver. They have jobs and multiple children to take care of and they don\u2019t have the finances to take four or five days to go to a different state. \u2026 These are the patients that are the most affected.\u201d\nInside the clinic\nAs a clinic that offers second-trimester abortions, Cedar River Clinics in the Renton, Washington has always seen a good number of patients from states with more restrictive laws, said clinic communications director Mercedes Sanchez. But those numbers have skyrocketed since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\u201cTexas is the state we\u2019ve seen the biggest increase from,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cStarting last September, when the [ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy] went into effect, we started getting calling from Texas and it hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\nTo deal with the increased demand, Cedar River has reopened a previously shuttered location, enhanced its telemedicine services and worked to find ways to help patients pay for travel and procedures.\nIt\u2019s also had to heighten security \u2014 since Roe was overturned, Sanchez said, the clinics have seen more \u2014 and more aggressive \u2014 protesters, including people from out-of-state like those Hall faced.\nAfter Hall made it through the protesters and the clinic\u2019s security screening, the clinic itself was an oasis, she said. She had to go two days in a row and both times the staff gave her the support, sympathy and care she\u2019d been missing in Texas.\nCedar River offers specialty care for patients facing lethal fetal abnormalities like anencephaly. They have private waiting rooms for these patients and offer grief support, genetic counseling and even bereavement services, including ways to memorialize the lost pregnancy.\n\u201cWe see patients from many different religions and cultures, and how they grieve is unique to each patient,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe do what we can to honor each of those cases.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Hall was in her second trimester when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nHall declined those services. It was just too hard, as she navigated a complicated mix of relief and grief. Coming back to Texas a few days later only amplified those feelings.\n\u201cYou have to suddenly leave for a medical procedure, and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, so despite everything that made me leave, it was a relief to be back home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m still so angry I had to leave.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a difficult few weeks since the procedure. The pink-sheeted crib is still set up in the nursery, filled with all the baby supplies they\u2019d bought or been gifted that they now have no use for. They had to call their OB/GYN repeatedly to get the $500 delivery deposit refunded. And they\u2019ve had to navigate complicated politics when sharing their news. More often than not, they just say they lost the baby.\nHall and her husband would like to try again at some point. But first, she\u2019s focused on her mental health and getting through the next few months. The holidays are going to be especially hard.\nShe was due just a few days before Christmas.\nDisclosure: Texas Medical Association and University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
