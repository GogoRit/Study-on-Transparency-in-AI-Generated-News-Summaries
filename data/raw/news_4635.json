On February 23, parliament voted to extend the legal timeframe for abortion under any circumstances from the twelfth to the fourteenth week of pregnancy. On February 19, the government eased access to medication abortion as an alternative to more invasive surgical procedures.\nFrance\u2019s 12-week time limit for abortion on request had forced thousands of women annually to travel outside of France to procure legal abortions. Its new 14-week limit mirrors that of Spain, while other European Union countries go further: abortion for any reason is legal in Sweden up to 18 weeks and in the Netherlands up to 24 weeks.\nMeanwhile, the February 19 decree permitting medication abortions up to the seventh week of pregnancy via telemedicine, rather than requiring visits to health facilities, is another positive step. This practice, initiated briefly during the Covid-19 pandemic, reduces pressure on health systems and facilitates access to abortion for people struggling to reach medical facilities, including those in rural areas or who fear stigma.\nMedication abortions are a safe and effective means of ending pregnancies that, according to the World Health Organization, women can self-manage up to the twelfth week of pregnancy where they can access accurate information and support from a healthcare provider if needed. The bill also eliminates a mandatory two-day waiting period before having an abortion, among other welcome measures.\nHowever, obstacles remain. Despite some policymakers\u2019 efforts, individual medical personnel can still refuse to provide abortion on grounds of religion or belief under a \u201cconscience clause,\u201d which is not sufficiently circumscribed to ensure it is not a barrier for women seeking abortions. Such policies, and lax enforcement of regulations to mitigate their impact, are major impediments to safe and legal abortion access in other countries too including Italy, Poland, and Romania. And France\u2019s parliamentary vote followed months of contentious debate that surfaced persistent taboos surrounding abortion.\nFrance\u2019s government can and should do more to remove all barriers to safe and legal abortion, as called for by international rights bodies and the European Parliament. This includes ensuring that providers who invoke the \u201cconscience clause\u201d fulfill the legal obligation to refer people to other accessible abortion services, further expanding access to medication abortion via telemedicine in line with international standards, and working to combat stigma around abortion.\nThe French government\u2019s moves are a step in the right direction. As other European governments roll back reproductive rights, France is showing that reproductive choice should be expanded, not curtailed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia France \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nRegression on Abortion Harms Women in Poland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nLandmark Decision on Colombia Abortion Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cViolence with Every Step\u201d\n\n\nWeak State Response to Domestic Violence in Tajikistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nRegression on Abortion Harms Women in Poland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nLandmark Decision on Colombia Abortion Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
