Credit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.org\n\n\n\nRepublican Bob Stefanowski\u2019s carefully worded position on abortion won plaudits Thursday from an anti-abortion leader who sees common ground with a Connecticut gubernatorial nominee for the first time in decades.\nPeter Wolfgang, the president of the Family Institute of Connecticut, was responding to a statement from Stefanowski indicating support for adding a parental notification provision to a Connecticut abortion rights law that he otherwise would not attempt to change.\n\n\u201cIt has heartened pro-life voters. We know that Bob is not 100% with us. We\u2019ve always suspected it. And now we know it for sure,\u201d Wolfgang said. \u201cBut what we also know is where he does have common ground with us.\u201d\nStefanowski, who was nominated by Republicans over the weekend for a rematch with Gov. Ned Lamont, has positioned himself to the right of the Democratic governor on abortion while not opposing Connecticut\u2019s 32-year-old law codifying the tenets of Roe v. Wade.\nHis approach will test whether a candidate can appeal to social conservatives, who Wolfgang has long complained have been marginalized by the Connecticut Republican establishment, without losing more voters who support abortion rights.\n\n\u201cWhen abortion comes up in Connecticut, Democrats snap to attention, and Republicans wet themselves. And Bob is the first Republican in 20 years that I\u2019ve seen to actually seize the initiative and flip the script with that statement,\u201d Wolfgang said.\n \n\nWant more in-depth Connecticut reporting?\nGet CT Mirror's latest government and public policy reporting in your inbox daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:  \n\nIn a written statement issued Wednesday, Stefanowski said, \u201cunder no circumstances will I as Governor attempt to change the existing law. A woman\u2019s right to choose has been, is, and\u00a0will remain codified in Connecticut State Law, including Connecticut\u2019s ban on late-term abortions \u2014 except in the case where the mother\u2019s health is at risk.\u201d\nStefanowski, consistent with his position in 2018, also broke with Lamont on the issue of requiring parental notification for a minor to obtain an abortion \u2014 an addition Wolfgang sees as a gesture to social conservatives.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the majority of other states, Connecticut should consider a parental notification requirement for minors under 16 seeking an abortion, except in the case of rape or incest,\u201d Stefanowski said.\nDemocrats seized on the ambiguity in Stefanowski\u2019s statement: He promised not to personally seek changes restricting an adult woman\u2019s access to abortion without saying if he would oppose or veto them.\n \n\n\n\n\nMore STORIES in Politics\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSecretary of the State files Bridgeport election complaint with SEEC \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCT bill seeks transparency on \u2018junk fees\u2019 added to tickets, hotels \n\n\n\n\n\nWolfgang acknowledged the wiggle room in Stefanowski\u2019s statement about parental notification: The candidate said the state should \u201cconsider\u201d such a measure, not that he would propose or support one.\n\n\u201cWould you love to see him say that he supports parental notification in a more active voice? I would definitely love to see it,\u201d Wolfgang said. \u201cBut I, again, I\u2019m reading that statement against the backdrop of what the Republicans have been saying in the week or two since the Dobbs leak.\u201d\nThe leak of a draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization suggests a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court is prepared to overturn Roe, the 49-year-old landmark case that struck down state bans on abortions before fetal viability.\n\u201cWhen Republicans don\u2019t answer the abortion issue, as I think they\u2019ve been doing since the Dobbs leak,\u00a0it\u2019s a lose-lose,\u201d Wolfgang said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling pro-lifers that you\u2019re not with us and you\u2019re telling pro-choicers that you have something to hide. It just never works.\u201d\n\nWolfgang, a featured speaker at an abortion protest that drew 2,000 to the state Capitol in March, acknowledged that the bar may be relatively low for getting a good grade from the anti-abortion movement in Connecticut, a heavily Catholic state that nonetheless has been consistently supportive of abortion rights.\nIt is one of a few states that has affirmatively declared a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. A 1990 law provides that \u201cthe decision to terminate a pregnancy prior to the viability of the fetus shall be solely that of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician.\u201d\nPeter Wolfgang, center, at the March for Life protest in March. Credit: CTMIRROR.ORG\n\u201cIf you\u2019re pro-life in the state of Connecticut, you are very much grading on a curve,\u201d said Wolfgang, who branded Stefanowski\u2019s position that of \u201ca pro-choice moderate.\u201d\u00a0\n\nStefanowski has been careful in his statements about abortion, an issue unmentioned in his acceptance speech last week.\nHe has yet to submit to public questioning about abortion, instead communicating with the press and voters by written statements that initially downplayed the issue as a matter of settled law in Connecticut. His campaign offered no reaction to Wolfgang\u2019s assessment.\n\u201cI think Bob\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d said Liz Kurantowicz, the senior adviser to the Stefanowski campaign.\n\nStefanowski has refused to take a position on a new law declaring Connecticut a \u201csafe harbor\u201d against lawsuits against out-of-state women seeking abortions here or the abortion providers.\n \nA scathing report released this week found \u201can alarming lack of oversight\u201d of CT\u2019s ___.\nDo you know the answer? Play this week's news quiz to find out.\n\n\nHis running mate, Rep. Laura Devlin of Fairfield, voted for it, and his opponent, Lamont, signed it into law. \nWolfgang said he had no idea why Stefanowski has refused to take a position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take his silence over Devlin\u2019s affirmative vote for it,\u201d Wolfgang said.\nWolfgang said Devlin\u2019s vote, which she says was cast without consulting Stefanowski, brought no abortion-rights voters to the fold, while turning off some opponents.\n\u201cI think Rep. Devlin put Bob in a very difficult position by voting in favor of that bill. I know that Rep. Devlin is pro choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that she understands the difference between pro-choice and pro-life. I\u2019m not sure if she understands the difference between pro-choice moderate and being more extreme on abortion. Because that was an extreme vote.\u201d\nDevlin could not be reached for comment Thursday. No parental notification bill in her tenure has cleared even the low hurdle of a committee vote scheduling a public hearing.\nConnecticut law requires a minor seeking an abortion to be counseled about the alternatives to abortion, including adoption, and the possibility of consulting her parents. About three dozen other states require either consent or notification, with some ability to bypass the requirement in the case of abusive parents.\nIn 2018 and in comments this week, Lamont indicated a comfort with Connecticut\u2019s approach. At a visit to a tulip farm in Preston on Thursday, a WTNH reporter asked how he would feel about a 13-year-old getting an abortion without parental consent.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can regulate and have laws for each and every eventuality,\u201d Lamont said, according to audio provided by the governor\u2019s office. \u201cMy instinct is that 98% of people, younger people, talk to their parents. If they feel comfortable, they feel like it\u2019s safe, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\nAbortions by females younger than 15 are rare.\nOf the more than 9,000 abortions in Connecticut in 2019, 20 were performed on girls 14 or younger and 788 on patients 15 to 19, according to the most recent statistics available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNationally, the percentage of abortions involving females from 15-19 fell steadily from 14.6% in 2010 to 8.7% in 2019, a 40% drop over a decade.\n \nBefore you leave... \nAs a nonprofit newsroom, we believe the healthiest way to sustain and grow CT Mirror is through the support of people who use and value it \u2014 loyal, curious readers like you.\n\nPlease make a gift today.\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged: 2022 Election,\u00a0Bob Stefanowski,\u00a0Family Institute of Connecticut,\u00a0feature story,\u00a0Ned Lamont,\u00a0Roe v.
