McCorvey found herself\u00a0on both sides of the issue, first as a pro-choice advocate, who worked in women's clinics. But in 1995 she became a born-again Christian and worked with anti-choice groups, including one she started called Roe No More that was dissolved in 2008.\u00a0A new FX documentary\u00a0\"AKA Jane Roe\" challenges\u00a0the narrative that Roe changed her mind about abortion due to religious realization.\u00a0In the film, directed by Nick Sweeney, McCorvey offers what she calls a \"deathbed confession,\" shortly before her 2017 death at 69, in which she claims that the pro-life movement paid her to join their side and speak out against abortion.\u00a0\"I think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they put me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d say,\" she says in the documentary. \"I did it well, too. I am a good actress. Of course I\u2019m not acting now.\"McCorvey goes on to say that she still supported abortion rights.\u00a0\u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine! You know, that\u2019s no skin off my ass. You know that\u2019s why they call it choice. It\u2019s your choice.\"She adds,\u00a0\u201cRoe vs. Wade helped save women\u2019s lives.\"The documentary, which details McCorvey's life story and fraught relationship with the abortion debate, also offers perspectives from leaders on both sides, including lawyer Gloria Allred and prominent evangelical Rev.\u00a0Rob Schenck. Schenck, who worked with McCorvey in pro-life organizations and at events, corroborates that she was paid.\u00a0\"Yes, Norma would be paid,\" he says on camera.\u00a0\"At a few points she was on the payroll so to speak.\u00a0There were so many different elements of the movement that were cutting checks to Norma, I\u2019ll never know how much was actually given to her. ...\u00a0Norma would complain that she wasn\u2019t getting enough money. Her complaints were met with checks. Several hundred dollars to a few thousand at a time. What we called benevolence gifts. There was some worry that if Norma wasn\u2019t paid sufficiently, she would go back to the other side.\u201dMore:Casting aside its precedents, Supreme Court moves inexorably toward those on abortion rightsThe film shows copies of tax documents outlining the amounts the organizations paid McCorvey.\u00a0\"What we did with Norma was highly unethical. The jig is up,\"\u00a0Schenck adds.\u00a0However, Rev.\u00a0Flip Benham, leader of anti-abortion organization\u00a0Operation Save America (formerly known as Operation Rescue, by which it is referred to in \"AKA\"), denies in the film McCorvey was paid in this manner.\u00a0McCorvey died in February 2017 of heart failure. \"AKA Jane Roe\" airs on FX Friday at 9 ET/PT and will be available to stream\u00a0on Hulu Saturday.Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
