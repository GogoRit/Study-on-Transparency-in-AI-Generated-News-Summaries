Initiative supporters must turn in 124,632 valid signatures by March 4 in order to qualify for the November ballot. \u201cWe are not going to rest because what started in Colorado will end in Colorado,\u201d said David Bereit, co-founder of 40 Days For Life, a Christian non-profit that campaigns against abortion. \u201cColorado has tried other ballot initiatives on the pro-life side in the past that have failed. This is the one that a large majority of people agree upon.\u201dIn 1967 Colorado became the first state to decriminalize abortion in limited instances. It currently doesn\u2019t have any restrictions on when in a pregnancy a woman can get an abortion.Valentina Rossi from Aurora said she grew up in a pro-choice home but her opinion on abortion changed when she learned about the definition of a cell -- the smallest unit of life. She said she doesn\u2019t support any kind of abortion and will vote for Initiative 120 if it makes the ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction but I hope we can move to protect all life,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cI just hope it\u2019s not the end.\u201dRalliers marched from the Capitol to Colfax Avenue, around Civic Center Park and then back. They carried signs that read, \u201cCivil rights begin in the womb\u201d and \u201cI am the pro-life generation.\u201d Others held 6-foot-high images of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Hayley Sanchez/CPR NewsPro-life supporters marched near Civic Center Park on Saturday, Jan. 11, 2020, as part of the \u201c2020 Celebrate Life Rally.\u201d Trina Rios of Arvada attended the rally with her husband and daughter, who identify as Catholic. \u201cWe believe that all life should be respected, especially because God created all of us and loves us and we don\u2019t believe that abortion is right,\u201d Rios said.Her husband Joseph said he\u2019s going to pray that Initiative 120 makes the ballot and passes. \u201cLife does begin at conception,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though the legislators want to play God, we can\u2019t play God.\u201dBarbara Tekip of Littleton shared similar sentiments. But she acknowledged the political reality of passing legislation that restricts abortions in Colorado, an increasingly blue state. \u201cI do think that abortion is probably here to stay,\u201d she said. But when it comes to abortions after 22 weeks, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand. If you\u2019re going to do it, why wait that long? I know there\u2019s reasons and I feel sorry for women that are in that situation. But if it\u2019s a reason of just inconvenience, I just would pray that people would let the child live and be adopted.\u201dSupporters of keeping abortion legal throughout pregnancy point out that some of the most severe developmental problems aren't diagnosed until a fetus is well into the second or third trimester.Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila spoke to attendees about how many years ago he worked in a hospital and saw fetuses after abortions were performed. He said that experience is what pushed him to be pro-life.\u201cIt is tragic and I remember being stunned,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly persons whose consciousnesses are dead, who have no conscience, can participate in such things.\u201dYou care.You want to know what is really going on these days, especially in Colorado.
