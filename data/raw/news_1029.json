Mike Young of Indianapolis called for removing the rape and incest exceptions, a move that would have left the bill only allowing abortions deemed necessary to save the pregnant woman\u2019s life.\u201cExceptions equal death for unborn innocent children,\u201d Young said. The Indiana proposal followed the political firestorm over a 10-year-old rape victim who traveled to the state from neighboring Ohio to end her pregnancy. The case of the Ohio girl gained wide attention when an Indianapolis doctor said the child had to go to Indiana because Ohio banned abortions at the first detectable \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision last month overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublican Sen. Sue Glick of LaGrange, the abortion bill\u2019s sponsor, urged senators to protect rape and incest victims who\u2019ve been subjected to violence.\n\u201cGive them that choice,\u201d Glick said. \u201cDon\u2019t foster that evil on them after the evil they\u2019ve already suffered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEighteen Republicans joined 10 Democrats in voting to keep the rape and incest exceptions in the proposal. But the votes of many of the 18 Republicans who want to strip out those exceptions will be needed for the bill to advance from the Senate for consideration in the GOP-controlled House. That Senate vote could happen Friday. The proposal would prohibit abortions from the time a fertilized egg implants in a uterus with the limited exceptions, including a requirement that a woman or girl seeking an abortion because of rape or incest to sign an affidavit attesting to the attack.\n\nIndiana has one of the first Republican-run state legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws since the Supreme Court decision. Its debate comes as several states are also in the midst of court fights over whether tighter abortion restrictions can take effect.The Indiana Republican disagreement over the abortion ban proposal contrasts with West Virginia, where the GOP-dominated House of Delegates voted Wednesday in favor of a sweeping abortion ban that includes exceptions for victims of rape and incest, as well as for medical emergencies. A top legislative Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mark Messmer, voted against the measure during a committee meeting Tuesday, lamenting the \u201cnear impossibility of threading the perfect needle\u201d on the issue during a short special legislative session that GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb originally called to address a tax rebate plan. Holcomb has avoided saying whether he supported the proposed abortion ban and stayed out of public view during demonstrations Monday and Tuesday that drew thousands of competing anti-abortion and abortion-rights supporters to the Statehouse as a legislative hearing on the bill took place.\n\nThe bill cleared the committee on a 7-5 vote Tuesday with two Republicans saying they disliked the proposal as it stood and only voted to advance it in hopes of the full Senate making changes.Senate Democratic Leader Greg Taylor said Wednesday it was clear Republicans had not reached an agreement on a bill to advance to the House for consideration.\u201cI think they\u2019re having problems,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to whether or not anything\u2019s gonna pass.\u201dGlick, the abortion bill\u2019s sponsor, said she was \u201cnot exactly\u201d happy with the proposal after the committee adding provisions under which doctors could face felony criminal charges for performing an illegal abortion, along with limiting the time period allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest to eight weeks of pregnancy for women ages 16 or older and 12 weeks for those younger than 16.\n\nGlick acknowledged this week that there was a chance Republicans wouldn\u2019t be able to reach consensus before the special session\u2019s Aug. 14 deadline to adjourn.\u201cIf we can\u2019t reach that result, there is a statute in Indiana we\u2019ll live with until it will change in the future,\u201d Glick said Monday. \u201cIf that decision can\u2019t be made in a week or two weeks\u2019 time, then we\u2019ll come back in January and start again.\u201d___Arleigh Rodgers is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
