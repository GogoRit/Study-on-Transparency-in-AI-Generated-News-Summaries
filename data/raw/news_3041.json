(CBS DETROIT) - An Eastpointe pregnancy clinic was the target of vandalism over the weekend.\u00a0According to Pregnancy Aid Detroit, a group of people spray painted the words \"liars\" and \"fake clinic\" on one of the building's walls. The vandals also painted the name of an abortion rights group, Jane's Revenge, on the wall.\u00a0A Grosse Pointe Woods home of a clinic board member was also left with similar graffiti and some broken windows.\u00a0\"We're a 501(c)3. By definition, we are not political. And we don't take any money. We're not government-funded,\" said Pregnancy Aid Detroit executive director Nancy Anter. \"We're just kind of here, passing out diapers, and we are pro-life. But we don't proselytize. And people have a  choice. We're right next door to a clinic, if people made a different choice, or  maybe they went there, and we went here,  We just want to help women, and we do that to the best of our ability.\"Police in Eastpointe and Gross Pointe Woods as well as the FBI are investigating.\u00a0\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Detroit Fire Department, mentor group teach Detroit youth CPR basics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Birmingham elementary school closed Monday due to voicemail bomb threat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Michigan Made: Blake's partners with Pleasantrees to open facility in old Gibraltar Trade Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Clinton Township residents have questions regarding vape facility explosion and fire\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Abortion\nEastpointe\n\nFirst published on December 19, 2022 / 4:40 PM EST\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
