Burke drew loud cheers from a Washington crowd Jan. 25 when he said of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton: \u201cWe intend to have these decisions completely repealed.\u201d\nIn 1973, in Roe and its companion case, Doe, the Supreme Court legalized abortion on demand nationwide.\nHe was a speaker at the annual National Pro-Life Summit the day after March for Life on the National Mall, which featured President Donald Trump speaking from the platform. Trump was the first sitting president to address the rally in person.\n[hotblock]\nA conference video drove home the point that elections matter. It included images of a smiling Trump; Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who supports legal abortion; and Trump\u2019s two Supreme Court appointments, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, considered the president\u2019s top pro-life court appointments.\nCardinal Burke hailed Trump\u2019s rally appearance as \u201ca historic moment,\u201d adding, \u201cAll of us are those responsible for kicking forward the respect for human life in our nation.\u201d\nThe National Pro-Life Summit drew more than 3,000 high school and college students to the Marriott Marquis. Organizers called it the biggest crowd they\u2019ve had.\nSponsoring organizations included Students for Life, Live Action, the Heritage Foundation and Alliance Defending Freedom.\nYoung people are the conference focus because, as one speaker observed, all of them were born at least 25 years after Roe v. Wade was decided; they can see abortion as the taking of a human life and not a constitutional right; and they can be trained in pro-life advocacy in workshop sessions.\n\u201cWe have to decide whether we\u2019re the first post-Roe generation this year,\u201d said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life. Or as Kay Cole James, president of the Heritage Foundation, put it as she began her speech, \u201cYou little adorable deplorables!\u201d\n[tower]\nIt was a full day of networking and swag selling as well. One table sold Patriot mobile phones, a company that promises none of its fees go to support abortion. Another group, Love Facts, promoted chastity. Sixty-four organizations were represented.\nAmong the 30 workshops were \u201cWhen (and How) to Sue Your School\u201d and \u201cInside the Brain of the Unborn,\u201d and sessions on how to enter media, politics, medicine and law as a pro-lifer. Nearly half instructed students on political tactics, legislation and attracting women voters.\nSpeakers included Russell Vought, who is acting director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Trump administration, and before that was a vice president of Heritage Action, the conservative policy advocacy group.\n\u201cYour numbers never receive the attention they deserve by the mainstream media, but every year, your families and your communities see someone who cares so much about this truth you hold dear that you march,\u201d Vought said.\nHe credited himself for the Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to deny $60 million in Title X funds to Planned Parenthood. He added, \u201cWe want to defund Obamacare, too.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump is the most pro-life president in history based on the advances he has made for the pro-life movement,\u201d Vought said. \u201cI can tell you that when decisions advance to the Resolute desk, he always sides with life.\u201d\nVought listed other achievements, including the appointments of 187 conservative federal judges, and the reinstatement of the so-called \u201cMexico City\u201d policy, which prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations from promoting abortion if they want receive U.S. health aid.\nThe ban was first instituted by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, and upheld by President George H.W. Bush. It was overturned by President Bill Clinton as soon as he was inaugurated in 1993; President George W. Bishop reinstated it in 2001. It was overturned by President Barack Obama immediately after his first inauguration as president in 2009. Trump reinstated it when he took office in January 2017.\n\u201cFolks, all this was done in the past three years,\u201d Vought said, adding that more could be accomplished \u201chopefully in the next four years.\u201d\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who in 2013 signed a bill requiring doctors to show pregnant women a sonogram of their fetus if they were considering an abortion, said: \u201cThe abortion industry and the news media \u2014 sometimes indistinguishable \u2014 provide a false narrative about abortion.\u201d\nJames, in her remarks, said: \u201cThe president of the United States can never make America great again until we secure the rights of every pre-born child. One of the most pro-life things you can do is vote.\u201d\n\u201cThe most terrible lie the abortion industry tells us is the fiction that they are on the side of women and they stand for feminine power,\u201d said Charmaine Yoest, a vice president of the Heritage Foundation. \u201cOur mission is to hold out an alternate story: To tell women that they can still face the future.\u201d\nThe conference\u2019s high political content was familiar to Ellen Wittman, a junior at Miami University of Ohio and a Catholic who heads the Students for Life chapter there. Her brother Bob is press secretary for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\u201cI would say that I\u2019m very involved in the political process,\u201d she said in an interview with Catholic News Service. She helped with lobbying for a bill signed into law in April 2019 by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected on an ultrasound, usually around six-weeks into the pregnancy. Three organizations have sued to stop the law.\n\u201cI think a lot of people are single-issue voters, and I think pro-life is one of the issues they focus on,\u201d Wittman said.\nShe praised Trump\u2019s speech for a particularly Catholic line that said, \u201cChildren are made in the image of God.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he hit that point, it definitely made the Catholics aware,\u201d Wittman said.\nCharlotte Pence, a daughter of Vice President Mike Pence and author of \u201cWhere You Go: Life Lessons From My Father,\u201d was the keynote speaker at the evening session. She spoke of helping her father prepare for questions in the vice presidential debate against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia in 2016.\n\u201cOf course, one of the most difficult ones was going to be about abortion. I wanted my dad to really practice his answers,\u201d she said.\nAt first, his answers in the practice debate \u201cwere more fact-based\u201d about legislation, \u201cbut I knew that he had such a heart for these people; he had such intense compassion for men and women in that situation,\u201d Charlotte Pence said. \u201cAnd I knew that his reasoning doesn\u2019t come from a place of judgment at all. It comes from a place of love, for that child, for that mother, and for the communities that abortion affects.\u201d\nAs a result, Pence instead asked Kaine to consider St. Teresa of Kolkata \u2014 who once said abortion was \u201cthe greatest destroyer of love and peace\u201d \u2014 and promote adoption as an alternative to abortion.\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
