Newsroom, Sep 13, 2022 / 17:00 pm\nTexas pro-life leaders are challenging Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands after she advocated for abortion while meeting with Gov. Greg Abbott in that state.\nUnlike the queen\u2019s country, the state of Texas limits abortion in most cases.\n\u201cThe moral reality is that the Netherlands should in fact follow Texas\u2019 lead when it comes to protecting innocent human life,\u201d Texas Right to Life President Dr. John Seago told CNA. \u201cNot only do they have one of the most extreme pro-abortion laws, but they also have been one of the most aggressive countries pushing for the euthanasia of vulnerable patients.\u201d\nHis comments come after the queen, together with the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Corporation Liesje Schreinemacher, met with the Texas Republican governor. The queen spoke about abortion, telling press afterward that \u201cwe are completely behind that,\u201d according to Dutch outlet NL Times, via news agency ANP, and broadcaster NOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\u00e1xima added that her message to Texas women is the same as her message to other women: that they should be able to access abortion, NL Times reported on Sept. 10.\nSchreinemacher also called for abortion in Texas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one point of concern that I wanted to raise, and that is on the right to safe abortion for women. Obviously, the Netherlands has a strong standpoint in that,\u201d Schreinemacher told Abbott, according to KXAN, a local news outlet in Austin, Texas.\u00a0\nShe spoke, KXAN reported, after M\u00e1xima talked about how Texas-Netherlands relations benefit both economies. She suggested they work together on abortion, too.\n\u201cI was wondering if we could, maybe partner up as counterparts to see what we can do in that [abortion] stance for Texas,\u201d Schreinemacher said.\nThe Netherlands allows abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for any reason. After 24 weeks, abortion is permitted for \u201cserious medical reasons.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective Aug. 25, Texas limits abortion in most cases, with exceptions to prevent the death or \u201csubstantial impairment of a major bodily function\u201d of the woman.\nIn response, Abbott advocated for protecting both mother and child.\n\u201cOne thing we put high importance on here is the safety and health of the mother,\u201d the governor told the Dutch officials, KXAN reported. \u201cBut the other thing we put importance on is the safety and health of the baby.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pro-life response\nFollowing the queen\u2019s visit, pro-life groups in Texas applauded Abbott as a pro-life governor.\n\u201cGov. Greg Abbott has a long history of supporting policies built on respect for the dignity of all human beings including Texas mothers, their children, and vulnerable patients,\u201d Seago said.\nTexas Alliance for Life Communications Director Amy O\u2019Donnell also expressed gratitude for Abbott and stressed that the Netherlands should learn from Texas\u2019 example.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018The religion of the Incarnation\u2019: Catholic artists reflect on the necessity of beauty\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Queen M\u00e1xima and Minister Schreinemacher are under the misconception that Gov. Abbott needs schooling on the abortion issue and the ability of women to advance in society,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told CNA. \u201cWe have complete confidence that governor and First Lady Abbott can educate the Dutch royals on how Texas successfully protects unborn babies from abortion while providing vast resources for women with unplanned pregnancies.\u201d\nAmong other things, the Texas Pregnancy Care Network, funded entirely with general revenues from the state of Texas, offers help to mothers and babies by supporting pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and more, CNA previously reported.\nO\u2019Donnell added: \u201cTexas proves that women have the ability to achieve economic and social equality without abortion.\u201d\nJonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values, said that his group agrees with the governor that Texas is a state that supports both women and babies.\n\u201cWe are the ninth-largest economy in the world, so we can understand that the Netherlands would travel to Texas to learn more about the culture that is the basis for our economic prosperity,\u201d he told CNA.\nQueen M\u00e1xima was raised Catholic and previously attended the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. She has also met with Pope Francis. The Catholic Church teaches that human life is sacred from the moment of conception and considers abortion \u2014 the destruction of a human person \u2014 a grave evil.\u00a0\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nprolife, \nQueen Maxima of the Netherlands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
