(File photo by Neetish Basnet/Cronkite News)\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A Pima County judge ruled Friday that a near-total ban on abortions in Arizona is back in effect, lifting a 50-year-old injunction that became moot after the U.S. Supreme Court this summer reversed its Roe v. Wade decision.\nThe ruling by Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson came just hours before a state law that would have allowed abortions up to 15 weeks of pregnancy was set to take effect in Arizona.\nThe 1901 law that she revived makes it a crime, punishable by up to five years in prison, to perform an abortion or take any action \u201cwith intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of such woman, unless it is necessary to save her life.\u201d\nAbortion-rights advocates had urged Johnson last month to keep the injunction in place, saying the 1901 ban would lead to confusion for health workers and prosecutors, and upend nearly 50 years of law that recognized abortion as a \u201clegal, medical procedure.\u201d\nBut in a ruling delivered late Friday afternoon, Johnson said that modifying the injunction as advocates wanted her to do was not \u201cprocedurally or legally appropriate.\u201d\n\u201cThe Court finds that because the legal basis for the judgment entered in 1973 has now been overruled, it must vacate the judgment in its entirety,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cThe Court finds an attempt to reconcile fifty years of legislative activity procedurally improper in the context of the motion and record before it.\u201d\nRelated story'We are ready to receive you': Blue states prepare for influx of patients seeking abortion care \nAbortion-rights advocates were quick to condemn the ruling and promise to fight it.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling by the Pima County Superior Court has the practical and deplorable result of sending Arizonans back nearly 150 years,\u201d said a statement from Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona. \u201cNo archaic law should dictate our reproductive freedom and how we live our lives today.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood said in a tweet Friday evening that because of Johnson\u2019s ruling it \u201chas been forced to pause abortion services, to protect our providers and patients.\u201d\nBut Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who had argued that there is no reason to keep the injunction imposed by Roe, now that Roe has been overturned, said Johnson made the right call.\n\u201cWe applaud the court for upholding the will of the Legislature and providing clarity and uniformity on this important issue,\u201d Brnovich said in a statement shortly after the ruling was handed down. \nJohnson\u2019s order is the latest fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling this summer that reversed Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that recognized a right to an abortoin. In June, the court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health its previous reasoning in Roe was \u201cegregiously wrong\u201d and that it should be left to state lawmakers to decide whether abortion should be legal.\nSince Dobbs, at least 14 states have instituted a total ban on abortion, with some states passing \u201ctrigger laws\u201d to enact a ban when the court overturned Roe. Other states, like Arizona, have been left grappling with what laws should be enforced once Roe was reversed.\nIn the immediate aftermath of Dobbs, Brnovich initially said the 15-week limit that passed this year and set to take effect Saturday would be the law of the land. He later reversed himself, however, and said the 1901 ban still stood and would take effect again as soon as the injunction was lifted.\nRelated storyHouse advances two abortion-rights bills, but prospects dim in Senate \nA Brnovich spokesperson defended that position in August, saying in a statement that state lawmakers have \u201cconsistently reaffirmed our existing law prior to Roe v. Wade, most recently the legislation passed by lawmakers and signed by the government earlier this year.\u201d\nThat was echoed Friday by Johnson\u2019s order.\n\u201cSignificantly, when passing laws concerning abortion when Roe v. Wade was law, the Legislature repeatedly disclaimed that the statutes it enacted were creating a right to an abortion,\u201d she wrote.\nClinics in Arizona, uncertain about the law after Dobbs, briefly suspended all abortion procedures in the state, while providing other family planning and OB/GYN services. Several began reoffering abortions, however, while the legal challenges worked themselves out. By the first of this month, at least five clinics, in Phoenix, Tempe and Tucson, had resumed abortions.\nJohnson\u2019s ruling now criminalizes abortions in the state, a move welcomed by anti-abortion groups.\n\u201cArizona\u2019s abortion law effectively affirms that life is a human right and should not be sacrificed unless the mother\u2019s life is at risk,\u201d said a statement from the Center for Arizona Policy. \u201cJudge Johnson rightly lifted a 1973 injunction on Pima County.\u201d\nPima County Attorney Laura Conover, who filed a brief in support of the Planned Parenthood challenge to Brnovich\u2019s motion to lift the injunction, said she was \u201cobviously very disappointed\u201d by the ruling.\n\u201cWe were hoping for a different result, and we will be looking at available legal remedies. My priorities as Pima County Attorney are public safety and health,\u201d Conover\u2019s statement said.\nIn her ruling, Johnson said Planned Parenthood, whose challenge of the abortion ban on constitutional grounds in the early 1970s led to the injunction, can take new legal action to challenge the law anew. That\u2019s what Fonteno said it plans to do.\n\u201cThis is not the end of the fight, this harmful ban has no place in Arizona, and we will persist until that is achieved,\u201d Fonteno\u2019s statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more vital news about health and health disparities,sign up for our Pathways to Equity newsletter here: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaley Smilow  HAIL-ee SMI-low\nYour browser does not support the audio element.(she/her/hers)Sports Broadcast Reporter, PhoenixHaley Smilow expects to graduate in May 2023 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in sports journalism.
