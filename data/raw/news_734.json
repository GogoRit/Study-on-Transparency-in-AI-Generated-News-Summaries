(AP) \u2014 The South Carolina House on Tuesday approved a total ban on\u00a0abortion\u00a0that includes exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.\nThe chamber initially rejected the bill without the exceptions by eight votes. But once Republicans saw the outcome, they quickly went through a number of complex procedures and votes to bring the bill back from the brink of failure.\nThe exceptions were added by enough lawmakers shouting \u201caye\u201d and the bill passed by a vote of 67-38.\nThe bill has one more routine vote before it goes to the Senate, where stricter bans on abortions have seen tougher fights.\nThe dizzying parliamentary maneuvers happened after Democrats joined with the chamber\u2019s most conservative members to try to keep the bill as restrictive as possible.\nREAD MORE: U.N. experts warn of impact of abortion bans on U.S. minorities\nMany Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics as they joined conservatives to also vote down an amendment supporters said would allow abortions for women carrying fetuses with medical problems leaving them unlikely to be born alive.\n\u201cThe ladies of South Carolina, they are gambling with your body,\u201d Republican Rep Micha Caskey said.\nDemocrats said they didn\u2019t want to debate abortion again after the General Assembly agreed to a six-week ban in 2021, but Republicans decided to call a special session after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\u201cIt is not out bill. We\u2019re not the ones trying to control their bodies,\u201d Democratic Rep. Leon Stavrinakis said.\nRepublicans who have nearly twice as many members as Democrats, took an hour break just before the vote to get their most conservative members to agree to the exceptions.\nThe bill allows abortions up to 12 weeks after conception if a women tells a doctor she was raped. The doctor has to tell the woman he is going to report the rape to the county sheriff and has 24 hours after the procedure to give deputies the woman\u2019s name and contact information.\nOther changes voted down in the debate included language supporters said would protect in vitro fertilization and birth control, and proposals that would allow prosecutors to charge a women who gets an abortion with murder.\nAbout 100 people gathered in the Statehouse lobby for the debate. They chanted phrases like \u201cAbortion is health care\u201d and \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d and drew honks from passing cars. Law enforcement closed the House gallery Tuesday.\nSouth Carolina currently has\u00a0a six-week ban\u00a0but the South Carolina Supreme Court\u00a0suspended the law\u00a0earlier this month while the justices decide on a Planned Parenthood lawsuit that says the ban is an unreasonable invasion of privacy under the state constitution. The decision leaves South Carolina\u2019s abortion ban at 20 weeks for now.\nREAD MORE: Some women cross state lines for abortions before bans take effect\nSupporters of the total ban in South Carolina want to follow the lead\u00a0of Indiana,\u00a0which earlier in August passed a total ban to go into effect on Sept. 15 with exceptions for rape, incest and if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. West Virginia\u2019s House and Senate\u00a0couldn\u2019t agree\u00a0on stricter abortion rules in a July session.\nThirteen states have so-called\u00a0trigger laws\u00a0designed to outlaw most abortions when the\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court threw out\u00a0the constitutional right to end a pregnancy in June.\nSouth Carolina leaders have watched those developments carefully, as well as events several weeks ago in Kansas, where nearly 60 percent of voters rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed the state\u2019s conservative Legislature to ban abortion. Republican Donald Trump received 56 percent of the 2020 presidential vote in Kansas. Trump won 55 percent in South Carolina.\nRepublican leaders in the South Carolina House allowed the speaker to call the special session after the leak of a draft opinion indicating the U.S. Supreme Court would allow states to ban abortion. Lawmakers started working on the total ban after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June.\nThe bill currently allows abortions if a mother\u2019s life is in danger and then lists a number of different medical emergencies that would fit into that exception.\nRepublican Gov. Henry McMaster hasn\u2019t given his opinion on this specific bill but has said he would like to see a day where there are no abortions in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                South Carolina State Capitol building, in Columbia, viewed from the southeast.
