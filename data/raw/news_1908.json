Brad Little\u2019s desk for signature or veto.\u00a0\nHouse Bill 242 creates a new section of Idaho law that defines the act of an adult helping a minor seek an abortion in another state or obtaining medication that will induce an abortion as \u201cabortion trafficking.\u201d\nUnder the legislation, Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador will have the authority and \u201csole discretion\u201d to prosecute a person for violating any aspect of Idaho\u2019s criminal abortion laws if the prosecuting attorney in the respective county refuses to bring charges.\n  Idaho Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, listens to the action on the Senate floor at the State Capitol in Boise on Jan. 9, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)\nSen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, sponsored the bill on the Senate floor and said the bill also provides an affirmative defense in court if the parent or guardian of the minor gave permission.\n\u201cWe have the authority and the obligation and the opportunity to establish criminal laws in Idaho,\u201d Lakey said during debate. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen when they cross the state line. It happens when they take the furtherance and act in this capacity to facilitate and procure an abortion, and then get that minor to travel within the state to pursue that abortion.\u201d\nIdaho\u2019s abortion ban applies to any stage of pregnancy, with affirmative defenses for cases of rape and incest with an accompanying police report and if an abortion is necessary to save a patient\u2019s life. But Idaho is surrounded by several states where abortion is legal, including Washington, Oregon and Montana. Washington allows minors to obtain an abortion without parental permission, and Oregon requires parental consent for girls under the age of 14.\nPlanned Parenthood Great Northwest has stated it will challenge the legislation in court if it is signed by the governor. If it becomes law, Idaho will be the first state to ban interstate travel for abortion care.\nMistie DelliCarpini-Tolman, director of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates in Idaho, told States Newsroom the bill amounts to \u201cmedical surveillance\u201d and said it\u2019s unclear how the law will be enforced.\n\u201cThat the state of Idaho or the Legislature thinks that is OK should be a huge red flag to anyone, no matter which side of the abortion issue you\u2019re on,\u201d DelliCarpini-Tolman said.\nLakey did not address the enforcement aspect of the bill, even after Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, commented on it during debate.\n\u201cI know this is a little facetious, but given the nature of this law, it sounds like you could post somebody at the border and check as you go across and say, \u2018Well, I see you have a pregnant woman with you, what\u2019s the purpose of your trip to Oregon?\u2019\u201d Ruchti said. \u201cThis goes way too far.\u201d\n Idaho AG: Physicians can\u2019t refer people across state lines for abortion\n\n\t\u00a0\nIdaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador also issued a legal opinion this week stating abortion pills are included in the state\u2019s abortion ban, and the medical professionals who supply them are subject to Idaho\u2019s criminal penalties, including those who refer or prescribe abortion pills to pregnant patients across state lines.\nThe opinion also states abortion pills cannot be promoted under Idaho state law.\nRep. Brent Crane, R-Nampa, requested an analysis from Labrador\u2019s office earlier this year, and the letter to Crane is dated March 27.\n\u201cThe criminal abortion statute, to which the statutory definition of \u201cabortion\u201d applies, does not distinguish between an abortion carried out as a medical procedure and an abortion carried out by pills or chemicals,\u201d Labrador\u2019s opinion said. \u201cThe use of any means to carry out an abortion is prohibited.\u201d\nCrane wrote the letter on behalf of Stanton Healthcare, an anti-abortion clinic founded by Brandi Swindell. In a press release, Stanton officials said they were grateful to Crane and Labrador for the opinion.\n\u201cWith this clarification of law from our attorney general, the state of Idaho has become one of the safest places for babies in the womb, and a place that provides a community of hope for women facing unexpected pregnancies,\u201d said Linda Thomas, director of community outreach, in the release.\n  Ra\u00fal Labrador, who won his race for Idaho attorney general, talks with attendees at the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)\nLabrador also cites two criminal statutes under Idaho law about promoting abortion pills, although both laws are from the 1970s and it\u2019s unclear if they are still enforceable.\n\u201cThe statute has several exceptions, but none of them apply to the promotion of abortion pills to the public,\u201d the opinion said.\nAccording to Labrador, medical providers located in Idaho cannot refer a woman across state lines for an abortion and cannot prescribe abortion pills to be picked up across state lines, saying it falls into the statute\u2019s prohibition on assisting in the performance of an abortion.\nMack Smith, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, told States Newsroom it is not illegal to refer someone out of state to access care in a state where abortion is legal.\u00a0\n\u201cI cannot state clearly enough that it is legal to access legal care in other states. So if you\u2019re accessing medication abortion in Ontario, Oregon, that is 100% legal, whether they like it or not,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe opinion indicates that health care providers can\u2019t refer patients for necessary, lawful care in another state and that\u2019s a view that has never been enforced in the 50 years, since Roe v. Wade or even before then, which is frankly ridiculous.\u201d\nShe added that the Washington Legislature is still considering a shield law that would protect medical providers in the state from attempts at prosecution by other states like Idaho for providing legal abortion care.\u00a0\n\u201c\u200b\u200bBefore these bills were introduced and this opinion was shared, we were already in a place where we were having to reassure patients that what they were doing was not only safe but legal to do in Washington, and I think having something like the shield law would further assure patients that they are protected in the state of Washington,\u201d Smith said.\u00a0\nStates Newsroom national reproductive rights reporter Sofia Resnick contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXNation\u2019s first interstate abortion ban bill awaits Idaho governor\u2019s signature\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun March 30, 2023\nNation\u2019s first interstate abortion ban bill awaits Idaho governor\u2019s signature\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun March 30, 2023\n Editor\u2019s note: This article has been updated to correct the effects of House Bill 242, which is separate from the civil enforcement aspects of Idaho\u2019s civil enforcement abortion law.\nIdaho Senate Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill making it a crime punishable by two to five years in prison to take a minor out of state for abortion care without parental permission.\nThe House of Representatives concurred with amendments, sending the bill to Gov.
