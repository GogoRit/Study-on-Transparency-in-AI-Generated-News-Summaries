On 4 March, the Supreme Court will consider oral arguments on the case. Ruling in favour of Louisiana could deal a devastating blow to reproductive autonomy through mere technicalities.\u00a0\nAcross the country, states have mounted harsh restrictions on abortion, making it harder and harder for women (especially of racial minorities and low income backgrounds) to access services. The \u2018heartbeat bills\u2019, which spread like wildfire across the South, ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected (something that usually occurs before the women is aware of her pregnancy).\u00a0\nOther restrictions include requiring providers performing abortions to have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital - something that is extremely hard to obtain for doctors dealing exclusively with abortion, since it is such a low-risk procedure.\u00a0\nSo far, women\u2019s rights organisations and clinics performing abortion have launched lawsuits challenging such restrictions on behalf of the women themselves, a legal standard that applies in instances when an individual may face impediments if they filed on their own.\nThe State of Louisiana, however, asserts in its lawsuit that the third-party privilege should not apply in abortion cases, arguing that the clinics do not have a close relationship with the women involved and that any fears of stigma are essentially nonsensical. \u201cThe notion that women considering abortion are unable to assert their own rights is a legal fiction,\u201d the Louisiana Department of Justice writes in its petition.\u00a0\nLet us make one thing clear: the process of suing a state government over its laws is lengthy, exhausting, complex, and expensive. Placing the burden of having to challenge abortion restrictions on individual women who are already enduring a physically and emotionally traumatic experience - and in some cases are financially incapable of embarking on a legal battle of this magnitude - is cruel and inhumane.\u00a0\nOn the same day that it considers this lawsuit, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about another abortion case coming from Louisiana - one which demands that providers performing abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius.\nThis restriction by Louisiana was already struck down by the Supreme Court back in 2016, when it ruled in the Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt that this law violated the U.S. constitution.\u00a0It might be hard to convince the Court to revisit an issue on which it already delivered a decisive ruling; yet with two new conservative justices on the bench, it is certainly within the realm of possibilities.\nIn the meantime, the White House has filed a brief in which it urges the court to side with Louisiana on restricting abortion and disregard its 2016 decision.\u00a0\nBut even if the court decides to discard the lawsuit concerning admitting privileges, it could still significantly restrict women\u2019s abortion access by ruling in favour of Louisiana on the case barring third parties from mounting legal challenges. This way, the court could cause potentially irreversible damage to reproductive independence and reverse decades of progress on women\u2019s rights, without touching the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision (1973) legalising abortion across the United States.\nImage: The Center for Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\nCall to Action\nDonate to help Alabama women access abortion services.\n\n Support now\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore picks from our editors- view all -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.Feb\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\nMoscow's calling: \"Soul hunters\" for Russia's \u00e9migr\u00e9s\n\n\n\ntopic:\nMigration\n\n\neditor:\nIgor Serebryany\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Russia launched a global campaign aimed at the repatriation of its citizens from abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.Feb\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 11, 2020\nDry February - a Czech campaign that aims to change drinking habits\n\n\n\ntopic:\nHealth and Sanitation\n\n\neditor:\nMagdalena Rojo\n\n\n\n14.4 liter per person.
