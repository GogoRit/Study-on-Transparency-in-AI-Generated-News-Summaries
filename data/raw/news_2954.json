But the implications reverberated nationally.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement the Biden administration would \u201ccontinue to push to require hospitals to provide life-saving and health-preserving reproductive care.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBecause of this decision, women in Texas may now be denied this vital care \u2014 even for conditions like severe hemorrhaging or life-threatening hypertension,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s backwards, and women may die as a result.\u201d\u00a0\nHendrix, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, wrote that Texas state law and the federal law overlap \u201cto a significant degree, allowing abortions in life-threatening conditions and for the removal of an ectopic or miscarried pregnancy.\u201d\nBut in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to end the nationwide, constitutional right to an abortion, Hendrix wrote the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance \u201cpurporting to remind providers of their existing \u2026 obligations to provide abortions regardless of state law.\u201d\nHendrix wrote that the guidance from the federal government was \u201cunauthorized\u201d and that HHS issued the guidance \u201cwithout the required opportunity for public comment.\u201d\u00a0\n Federal law under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act\n\nThe Texas case, as well as a separate case the U.S. Department of Justice filed against Idaho, revolve around the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.\nThe 1986 law requires hospital emergency departments to assess patients to determine if they have an emergency medical condition, and if they do, health care providers must provide stabilizing treatment or transfer the patient if the hospital is unable to help them.\u00a0\nEMTALA defines an emergency medical condition as something that manifests with \u201cacute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain),\u201d where a lack of immediate medical attention could place the patient \u201c(or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child)\u201d in serious jeopardy, cause serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily function or part.\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra wrote in a letter released in July that the \u201cunder the law, no matter where you live, women have the right to emergency care \u2014 including abortion care.\u201d\n\u201cToday, in no uncertain terms, we are reinforcing that we expect providers to continue offering these services, and that federal law preempts state abortion bans when needed for emergency care,\u201d Becerra continued. \u201cProtecting both patients and providers is a top priority, particularly in this moment.\u201d\n Texas lawsuit argues EMTALA doesn\u2019t guarantee access to abortion\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Lubbock Division a few days later arguing EMTALA doesn\u2019t guarantee access to abortion.\n\u201cOn the contrary, EMTALA contemplates that an emergency medical condition is one that threatens the life of the unborn child,\u201d Paxton wrote. \u201cIt is obvious that abortion does not preserve the life or health of an unborn child.\u201d\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a separate lawsuit against Idaho earlier this month arguing one of its state laws on abortion, set to take effect Thursday, violated EMTALA.\u00a0\nThe judge in that case is set to rule Wednesday.\u00a0\nThe Idaho lawsuit is part of the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to keep abortion legal in some circumstances after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.\u00a0\nThe judge in the Texas lawsuit wrote in the Tuesday preliminary injunction that when comparing EMTALA with Texas law, the federal law was \u201cmaterially broader.\u201d\nHendrix wrote that federal guidance on EMTALA said \u201cabortion may be required for emergency medical conditions that are likely to become emergent,\u201d while Texas state abortion law \u201crequires the condition to be present.\u201d\nFederal guidance, Hendrix wrote, would \u201crequire an abortion when the health of the pregnant woman is in serious jeopardy\u201d while the Texas state law \u201climits abortions to when the medical condition is life-threatening, and [Texas law] goes further to expressly limit the condition to a physical condition.\u201d\nFederal guidance \u201calso indicates that EMTALA may require an abortion when an emergency medical condition \u2018could \u2026 result in a serious impairment or dysfunction of bodily functions or any bodily organ\u2019\u201d while Texas law \u201cby contrast, requires the life-threatening physical condition to pose a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function,\u201d Hendrix wrote.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo, in addition to requiring a physical threat to life, [Texas law] requires both a greater likelihood and a greater severity than the Guidance\u2019s interpretation of EMTALA does,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0\nIn the 67-page decision, the judge gave an example of a pregnant woman arriving at an emergency department with a \u201cpregnancy-related emergency medical condition where, if she carries the child to term, the child will live but a serious impairment of a bodily function will result.\u201d\nHendrix wrote that terminating the pregnancy would allow the pregnant patient to \u201cretain the bodily function.\u201d He then asked what type of health care the pregnant patient should be allowed to have access to.\u00a0\n\u201cThe physician could (1) abort the child \u2014 prioritizing the health of the mother over the life of the child \u2014 despite independent EMTALA obligations to the child; or (2) keep the child in gestation and fail to stabilize the mother\u2019s emergency medical condition, causing her to lose the function. EMTALA provides no answers to this dilemma,\u201d Hendrix wrote.\u00a0\nIn such a situation, he wrote, \u201cdoctors must\u201d decide how to provide medical care \u201cin accordance with state law.\u201d\nHendrix then denied the federal government\u2019s request to dismiss the case and granted the preliminary injunction for Texas as well as members of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Christian Medical & Dental Association.\nThat ruling specifically said the federal government may not enforce its EMTALA guidance on abortion access in emergency medical situations, or its interpretation that federal law supersedes Texas state law on the issue.\u00a0\nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Christian Medical & Dental Association didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXFederal judge sides with Texas, blocks HHS guidance on emergency abortions\nby Jennifer Shutt, Idaho Capital Sun August 24, 2022\nFederal judge sides with Texas, blocks HHS guidance on emergency abortions\nby Jennifer Shutt, Idaho Capital Sun August 24, 2022\n \nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal district judge has granted the Texas attorney general\u2019s request to temporarily block guidance from the federal government that says federal law protects health care providers who perform abortions to save the life or health of pregnant patients in emergency situations.\u00a0\nJudge James Wesley Hendrix wrote the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidance from July \u201cgoes well beyond\u201d the text of the federal law, which he wrote \u201cprotects both mothers and unborn children, is silent as to abortion, and preempts state law only when the two directly conflict.\u201d\nThe preliminary injunction, granted late Tuesday, applies only to Texas, members of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations.
