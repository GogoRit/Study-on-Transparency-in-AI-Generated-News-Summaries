She is also an associate scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, which specializes in scientific, legal and scholarly research and education on various pro-life issues.\n\n\nRe: \u201cWould Prop. 1 allow abortions after fetal viability? Legal experts say no\u201d\nThe full legal story needs to be told. Proposition 1 could allow for late-term abortions.\nWhen you read Prop. 1, there\u2019s nothing in the text about current abortion state law.Instead, the language of the proposed state constitutional amendment says it\u2019s intended to \u201cfurther\u201d the constitutional right to privacy. A word like \u201cfurther\u201d \u2013 rather than \u201cpreserve\u201d \u2013 suggests the goal of Prop. 1 is to expand current law, not to maintain the status quo. To drive the point home, the last sentence says \u201cnothing herein narrows or limits the right to privacy.\u201d\nThe Roe and Casey U.S. Supreme Court decisions permitted states to limit abortion, but the language of this proposition does not. It\u2019s a simple, absolute prohibition: the state shall not deny or interfere with reproductive freedom.\nThis suggests that even existing restrictions on abortion will likely be struck down by courts under this constitutional amendment. After all, a constitutional amendment trumps all existing state laws to the contrary and governs the interpretation of state law.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a CalMatters member today to stay informed, bolster our nonpartisan news and expand knowledge across California.\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you\n\r\n            Want to submit a guest commentary or reaction to an article we wrote?
