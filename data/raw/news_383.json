Four years ago, his Law and Justice party (PiS) was forced to back down after it proposed legislation to achieve the same goal. Hundreds of thousands of women took to the streets to protest. Parliamentarians were rattled and the bill was dropped.Poland already has the toughest abortion restrictions of any country in Europe, bar Malta, and polls consistently demonstrate popular opposition to even stricter limits. But with the enthusiastic blessing of the most influential Catholic church in Europe, the government decided to persevere by resorting to judicial chicanery. After it parachuted PiS-friendly judges into Poland\u2019s constitutional tribunal, MPs requested a legal review of existing abortion laws. Presided over by a Kaczy\u0144ski crony, the court ruled that the abortion of foetuses with serious abnormalities amounted to an unconstitutional form of eugenics. Of the 1,100 terminations permitted in Poland last year, 98% came into this category. The ruling will come into legal force at the point it is officially published. It places Poland far outside the settled European consensus on the right of women to control their own bodies.Unfortunately for the government, but hearteningly for the future of Polish democracy, publication of the ruling in its current form may not be a foregone conclusion. For six years, PiS has successfully manipulated the courts and state media, relentlessly targeted minorities and ignored the obligations of European Union membership. Its bullying behaviour has been justified in the name of protecting \u201cPolish values\u201d which, as Mr Kaczy\u0144ski puts it, have their \u201crepository\u201d in the Church. But the shock and cruelty of the abortion ban, decreed without discussion, has generated a backlash well beyond the usual suspects in Poland\u2019s liberal cities. One worried PiS parliamentarian reportedly told the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper that the court\u2019s decision will backfire and damage the standing of \u201cCatholic Poland\u201d.The evidence so far bears that out. Defying Covid restrictions, farmers, miners and taxi drivers have joined women on the frontline of protests. One miners\u2019 union leader observed this week that \u201ca state which assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of people\u2019s consciences is heading in the direction of a totalitarian state\u201d. Churches have been daubed with graffiti and masses disrupted, some by young women dressed as characters from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Priests in small towns and villages have been challenged. Tens of thousands of women went on strike on Wednesday.Disgracefully, leading PiS figures have, in response, defended groups of far-right activists and football ultras, some of whom have beaten up protesters and dragged female protestors from churches. On Tuesday, a characteristically hyperbolic Mr Kaczy\u0144ski said that churches should be protected \u201cat any cost\u201d, and claimed the protests were an attempt \u201cto destroy Poland and end the history of the Polish nation\u201d.Given the government\u2019s innate authoritarianism, some form of the constitutional tribunal\u2019s ruling seems certain to be signed into law, as Poland\u2019s neighbours look on in dismay. Nevertheless, the scale of the pro-choice protests could prove a tipping point. PiS\u2019s brand of Catholic nationalism treats opponents as traitors to the nation. But as an EU member state, Poland\u2019s values should be debated and negotiated fairly in the public square, not handed down by priests and rubber-stamped by a puppet court. Happily, the signs are that more and more Poles are prepared to fight for that right.Explore more on these topicsAbortionOpinionPolandHealthFeminismCatholicismeditorialsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Third night of protests in Poland after abortion ban takes effect29 Jan 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Poland to implement near-total ban on abortion imminently27 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Poland delays abortion ban as nationwide protests continue3 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsCartoonsOpinion videosLettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
