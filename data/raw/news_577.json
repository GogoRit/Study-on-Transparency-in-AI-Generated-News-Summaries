Protests erupted across the country overnight with more expected in the coming days.https://p.dw.com/p/3oUqcThe law had prompted repeated protests, with the night it formally went on the statute books no different in WarsawImage: Omar Marques/Getty ImagesAdvertisementThousands of people\u00a0took to the streets of\u00a0Poland\u00a0to protest against\u00a0a near-total ban on abortion, which came into force on Wednesday. The controversial\u00a0law was published in Poland's Journal of Laws, the last step on its route to becoming law.\nDemonstrators shouted\u00a0slogans and held placards like, \"I think, I feel, I decide\" and \"freedom of choice without terror\". More protests are expected in the coming days.\nProtesters in Warsaw brought traffic to a stop after the controversial abortion law went into effectImage: Omar Marques/Getty Images\nProtesters in the capital city of Warsaw lit red flares,\u00a0waved rainbow flags\u00a0and\u00a0halted traffic.\n'War against women'\nWanda Nowicka, a member of Poland's Left party, said that the ruling government hadn't yet won \"this war against women\". Meanwhile, Poland's human rights commissioner said the move signaled that the state wanted to torture women and risk their lives.\n\nMarta Lempart, a member of Women's Strike, an organization organizing the protests, called for everyone to go into the streets. She added that the publication of the ruling was a \"crime\".\nThe law, which only allows abortion in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's life is in danger, was approved by the Polish Constitutional Court in October, sparking\u00a0nationwide protests. The law states that abortions in the case of fetal abnormalities are \"incompatible\" with Poland's constitution.\u00a0\nThe government has consistently supported the court's verdict, saying that it would halt what it called \"eugenic abortions,\" referring to the termination of fetuses with Down's Syndrome.\nThough opponents have accused the Catholic and conservative ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) of exerting influence over the court in its approval, party leaders say this is not the case. Poland, a staunchly Catholic country, already had some of the strictest abortion laws in the European Union\u00a0before approval of the newly tightened measures.\u00a0\nFewer\u00a0than 2,000 legal abortions are performed in Poland each year, with many doctors refusing to perform the operation because of religious convictions. Women's groups estimate that as many as 200,000 more Polish women seek abortions each year, either abroad or illegally at home.\nam, js/msh\u00a0(AFP, Reuters, dpa)\n\nSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisementSkip next section Explore moreExplore moreAbortion ban divides PolandAbortion ban divides PolandTens of thousands of young Poles protest against an almost total ban on abortion.
