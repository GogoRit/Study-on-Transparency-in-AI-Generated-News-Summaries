Lee Zeldin said it would be \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great idea\u00e2\u0080\u009d to appoint a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro-life\u00e2\u0080\u009d health commissioner for the state of New York. Zeldin is a leading Republican candidate for NY governor\n\nDuring his more than seven years serving in Congress, Zeldin has backed several anti-abortion legislative proposals\n\nSitting governor Kathy Hochul - a Democrat - has been outspoken in her defense of abortion rights\n\n\nIf Zeldin were elected, he would break a decades-old streak of elected New York governors who did not oppose abortion rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the video, Zeldin said he believes \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would be a great benefit for the state of New York to have a health commissioner who respects life as opposed to what we're used to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe also said that, if elected governor, anti-abortion advocates would have \u00e2\u0080\u009copen door\u00e2\u0080\u009d access to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on into the second floor of the New York State Capitol. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a while, but you come right on in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nDuring his more than seven years serving in Congress, Zeldin has backed several anti-abortion legislative proposals, including co-sponsoring a federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court made abortion legal nearly 50 years ago, no candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican or Democrat \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who opposed abortion rights has been elected New York governor.\nZeldin would break that streak.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been many, many, many decades. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remember the last time New York state had a pro-life governor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the virtual gathering.\nZeldin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid for governor comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is considering one of the most direct challenges to Roe v. Wade in decades. The court is expected to rule this summer.\nIn a statement, a spokesman for the New York State Democratic Party said, \"Zeldin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event with the Right to Life Party shows just how dangerous it would be for New Yorkers if he were elected governor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA Siena poll from three years ago found that 63% of New Yorkers backed codifying Roe v. Wade in New York, including nearly half of Republicans.\nGov. Kathy Hochul has been outspoken in her defense of abortion rights. On a podcast, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a right that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamentally, deeply personal to women, to not have male governors or Supreme Court justices telling them what to do with their bodies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00a0\nMy message to governors attacking reproductive rights is simple: Knock it off. pic.twitter.com/26BvuPzExm\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kathy Hochul (@KathyHochul) April 27, 2022\n\n\n\u00a0\nSpectrum News NY1 did reach out to the other Republicans vying for governor. They did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Zeldin expanded on his comments, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose ruling Albany support late term partial birth abortions, and non-doctors performing abortions. Instead, Kathy Hochul should be supporting adoption, health care, families, life, informed consent and parental consent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs it relates to a Health Commissioner, Congressman Zeldin will cast a very wide net on potential applicants to choose the best qualified candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson continued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            CERTIFICATIONS\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
