Black Maternal Health Week highlights a hard truth: Black women\u2019s needs have never been prioritized, leading to disparate, inequitable health outcomes. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic devastates Black communities across the country, that truth is all the more glaring.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Time and again, a state or county releases racial data. Time and again, those numbers reveal a sizable racial disparity. Time and again, black Americans are overrepresented among the infected and dead,\" @DrIbram writes: https://t.co/oXdEtg2rNb\u2014 The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) April 6, 2020\n\n\n\nFor Black people, impending motherhood can feel fraught even in normal times \u2014 because during and after childbirth, their health and lives are on the line. At over 40 deaths per 100,000 live births, the maternal mortality rate for Black women is more than three times higher than that of white women.\u00a0\nThe work of organizations such as the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, SisterSong, The National Birth Equity Collaborative and other Black-led reproductive justice organizations have brought the Black maternal health crisis to national attention. Since the first commemoration of Black Maternal Health Week in 2018, these organizations\u2019 efforts have led to the introduction of more than a dozen bills in Congress to rectify the challenges and systemic bias that too often lead to poor maternal health outcomes for Black mamas.\u00a0\u00a0\nJoin us by urging your member of Congress to support the\u00a0 Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020 \u2014 introduced by Reps. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) and Alma Adams (D-N.C.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Ca.), and members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. Among a comprehensive set of regulations and investments to address the crisis in Black women\u2019s maternal mortality, the Momnibus Act will compile data on the underlying social determinants that lead to higher mortality rates to address the racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes among Black women in America. The bill is endorsed by over 90 reproductive rights and justice organizations, including Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Planned Parenthood, and Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health and rights groups have fought targeted attacks against reproductive health care, we recognize that the bulk of the groundbreaking work to defend access to care has been done by reproductive justice organizations and leaders on the ground. Heroes like Dr. Joia Crear-Perry of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, Angela Aina of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Monica Simpson of SisterSong, and Kwajelyn Jackson of the Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center \u2014 have lived and led the work to eradicate disparities and save Black women\u2019s lives. We will never have health equity without the reproductive justice framework they\u2019ve built.\u00a0\nIt is clear that the leading cause of Black maternal mortality is racism: Studies show (link) medical professionals tend to take Black women's health concerns less seriously. Anecdotal evidence suggests a pattern of mistreatment and inattention to Black women by medical professionals. Compared to white women, Black women are more likely to have serious complications resulting from pregnancy and less likely to have conditions diagnosed, monitored, and treated in a timely manner.\u00a0\nFor many Black women, the addition of a doula or similar supporting provider to advocate on behalf of the patient during pregnancy and delivery has improved their health outcomes. Yet COVID-19 has compelled many hospitals to limit the presence of support providers from delivery rooms \u2014 which may exacerbate existing disparities and increase incidences of mistreatment by providers towards patients.\u00a0\n\nCompared to white women, Black women are more likely to have serious complications resulting from pregnancy and less likely to have conditions diagnosed, monitored, and treated in a timely manner.\n\nRacism in the workplace, when accessing housing, in educational settings, and in other community settings \u2014 the social determinants of health \u2014 negatively affects Black people. In recent research conducted by Planned Parenthood, Black respondents were most likely to report difficulty paying for basic necessities like food, housing, medical care, and heating. The stress of dealing with racism on a daily basis makes Black women more susceptible to heart disease, high blood pressure, and other chronic health conditions known to contribute to poor maternal health outcomes.\u00a0\nWhat we must also take into account: Attacks on access to sexual and reproductive health care also have a disproportionate impact on Black women. The Trump-Pence administration has taken unprecedented steps to roll back access to abortion, block patients from seeking care from the provider of their choice, and institute other restrictions on reproductive health care for millions of people in this country. But obstacles to access are nothing new to Black women, who disproportionately live in states that had barriers to sexual and reproductive health care well before Trump became president. Given the strong link between reproductive health care access and maternal health outcomes, it comes as little surprise that many of those states \u2014 such as Texas and Georgia \u2014 also have some of the nation\u2019s highest maternal death rates.\u00a0\nWhile policymakers work with health care leaders and others to make health care more accessible and affordable for people directly affected by COVID-19, they must pay attention to the causes of death and inequities that affect the Black community \u2014 even during this pandemic. When we center the communities and people most impacted by health care crises, everyone benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese are challenging times, but we\u2019re in this together. Let\u2019s commit to improving the health and wellness of Black mamas, their families, and their communities during this pandemic and beyond.\n\n\n\nFollow @PPBlackComm on Twitter\n\nGet updates on how Planned Parenthood\u00a0works each and every day to protect and advance the sexual and reproductive rights of African Americans.\n\n\nFollow @PPBlackComm\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nHealth Equity,\nblack maternal health week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\u00a0\n\n\n\n Abortion Birth Control Health Care Planned Parenthood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Abortion Still Legal in My State?\n\nLearn about abortion access changes in your state.\n\n\nGet the Facts\n\n\n\n\n\nTell Our Courts: Save Mifepristone!\n\nWe should be able to trust our courts to respect science and follow the law.\u00a0It's time for our leaders to hear us, loud and clear: The attack on mifepristone is a gross injustice that could harm millions of people.\n\n\nSpeak Out Now\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund Will NEVER Back Down\n\nKnow this: our right to abortion is not debatable.\u00a0We will rebuild and reclaim the freedom that is ours.\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for Email\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund works to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITEMAP\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nPressroom\n\n\nTipsheet\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nElections\n\n\n\n\nIssues\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nAbortion Access\n\n\nAttacks on Planned Parenthood\n\n\nBirth Control\n\n\nFederal Courts\n\n\nHealth Equity\n\n\nSexual Assault\n\n\nSex Education\n\n\nState Attacks\n\n\nVoting Rights\n\n\n\n\nCommunities\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nLatinos for Planned Parenthood\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Black Community\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Generation Action\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nBans Off Our Bodies\n\n\nTake Action\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nGet Involved Locally\n\n\nStore\n\n\nCongressional Scorecard\n\n\nRecess Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
