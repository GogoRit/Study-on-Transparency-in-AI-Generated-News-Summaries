Wade \u2013 paving the way for extreme abortion bans across the country. Now he\u2019s promising to continue his crusade to ban abortion if he wins a second term.\nWhen asked whether he\u2019d sign a national abortion ban if it came to his desk, Trump touted his judicial appointments and said \u201cwe will get it done on some level.\u201d\u00a0\nAdam Sexton, WMUR: \u201cIf you\u2019re president again in 2025 and Senator Graham\u2019s 15-week abortion ban lands on your desk, are you gonna sign it?\u201d\nDonald Trump: \u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna look at it. We\u2019re looking at a lot of different options. We got it back to the states. We did the Roe v. Wade thing, which we\u2019ve been trying to get it done for 50 years. I got it done. I appointed incredible justices and judges all over \u2014 300 federal judges and three justices. And I was able to do things that nobody else was able to do, and we\u2019ll get something done where everyone is going to be very satisfied.\u201d\u00a0\nSexton: \u201cOn the national level? A national law?\u201d\nTrump: \u201cI think we\u2019ll get it done on some level, it could be on different levels, but we\u2019re gonna get it done. I know the issue very well. I think I know the issue better than most and we will get that taken care of.\u201d\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t new for Trump: When he was still in office, Trump backed a national abortion ban that could have thrown doctors in jail.\nThe Hill: \u201cThe Trump administration formally backed a House bill Monday that would ban abortions after 20 weeks. \u2026 It would make it a crime to perform or attempt an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with the possibility of a fine, up to five years in prison or both.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s years-long anti-abortion crusade doesn\u2019t end there \u2014 he\u2019s called for punishments for women who have an abortion.\nDonald Trump: \u201cThere has to be some form of punishment [for women who have an abortion].\u201d\nIt\u2019s all a part of Trump\u2019s plan to double down on his \u201cunmatched\u201d record of anti-abortion extremism.\nCNN: \u201c\u2018President Trump\u2019s unmatched record speaks for itself \u2013 nominating pro-life federal judges and Supreme Court justices that overturned Roe v. Wade, ending tax-payer funded abortions, reinstating the Mexico City Policy that protects the life of the unborn abroad, and many other actions that championed the life of the unborn. There has been no bigger advocate for the movement than President Trump,\u2019 said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement to CNN.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\n\n\n\nJoin Us\n\n\nEmail address*\n\n\n\nPhone number\n\n\n\nZip code*\n\n\n Sign up to get texts.
