She was 67.The Hoosier\u00a0native led Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky for 15 years before retiring in June 2017. Friends and allies regarded her as a force of nature and passionate champion of women's reproductive rights.\"She had the strength of a hundred women and spoke for thousands of us,\" said Vi Simpson, a former Indiana state senator and decades-long friend of Cockrum.Her family said she meant many things to many people.\u00a0\u201cCountless lives touched, careers built, families supported, jobs created, storms weathered and mountains moved,\" the family said in a statement.\u00a0\"While she was busy changing the world for the better, for us, she was just \u2018Mom.\u2019\u201dCockrum spent decades in politics, according to friends, family and former colleagues. Before Planned Parenthood,\u00a0Cockrum served as a state budget director and head of the Department of Administration and earlier as\u00a0Bloomington's city controller after working for the Bloomington Redevelopment Department.\u00a0\u201cBetty ran a tight ship at Bloomington City Hall and brought street smarts and passion to state government in every job she took on,\u201d John Goss, former deputy mayor of Bloomington, said in a statement.In 1997 when Gov. Frank O\u2019Bannon became governor, he tapped her to be the commissioner of the Department of Administration at the recommendation of his chief of staff, Tom New. Cockrum wanted a job in the governor\u2019s office, but New recognized there were many issues that needed to be handled and Cockrum was the person to do it.Her calm but commanding voice and steady demeanor led people to listen to what she had to say, New said.\u201cSo many times\u00a0Gov. O\u2019Bannon would say, \u2018Get Betty on the phone, have Betty come here to the office,\u201d he said. \u201cShe put out a lot of fires and did it often behind the scenes and did it very quickly and did with a lot of class.\u201dCockrum also connected personally with many of the people with whom she worked.Cheryl Reed, O\u2019Bannon\u2019s deputy press secretary,\u00a0met Cockrum when the two worked across the hall from each other. Cockrum, who\u00a0dubbed her \u201cCreed\u201d in a nod to her email address,\u00a0invited Reed to attend the \u201cEstro-fests\u201d Cockrum hosted.At these events, Cockrum would gather a group of her female friends to hang at her home downtown.\u201cShe tried to nurture and grow women as a force for good,\" Reed said. \"She would bring together all of these women she knew, anyone she knew that she felt had something positive to add to the world.\u201dHelping\u00a0friends in needIf a friend needed her, Cockrum always seemed to know just what to say.\u00a0\u00a0After Reed had a miscarriage, Cockrum reached out, but recognized\u00a0that Reed would not appreciate a long extended conversation. Cockrum said simply, \"Listen, Creed, you\u2019re going to get through this.\"\u201cShe would step in and say her piece if that was what you needed,\u201d Reed said.\u00a0Sometimes she would go the extra mile to do that.Although Cockrum and New had not seen each other for some time, Cockrum went out of her way to show up last fall at the calling for New\u2019s fiancee.\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen Betty, and all of sudden she just popped in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sort of brought tears to my eyes that she would drive up to Noblesville just to express a few kind words to me during a very difficult time.\u201dThe champion of Planned ParenthoodCockrum, though, is likely best known for her role as the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood.\u00a0During her tenure Indiana politicians approved\u00a0waves of anti-abortion legislation, attempted\u00a0to pull federal and state dollars from health centers and instituted stricter requirements for abortion facilities and doctors.Planned Parenthood sued the state five times during her tenure, at least twice successfully.Chris Charbonneau, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, called Cockrum a trailblazer.\u201cShe was a true force of nature as she championed abortion access for decades, and her leadership continued even after she retired from Planned Parenthood,\" Charbonneau said in a statement.\u00a0\"During her time at Planned Parenthood, Betty was persistent and never intimidated as she forged ahead in the fight to ensure that everybody regardless of income or zip code has access to affordable, expert reproductive health care.\u201dCockrum told IndyStar in 2017 that her job became more political after she started.\"You couldn't have told me 15 years ago how different it is today,\" she said at the time near her retirement. \"Everything we fought for in the '60s, so much of that, it's already eroded, and it's under attack.\"Cockrum pushed a host of initiatives, including\u00a0making\u00a0emergency contraception available over the counter, allowing\u00a0Planned Parenthood patients to use Medicaid for health care services\u00a0and expanding beyond abstinence-only education.But opponents viewed\u00a0Planned Parenthood as too focused on abortion.Protesters often crowded her lawn, once saying, \"You're a sicko, Betty! You're killing babies, Betty Cockroach.\"Deborah Simon, who served as president of the board of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, said\u00a0Cockrum rarely had her family visit her home because of the protesters.\u201cShe didn\u2019t want her kids to be exposed to it; she protected them,\u201d Simon said.\u00a0\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t going to give up the fight just because there were a bunch of protesters in front of her house.\u201dSimpson said she feared for Cockrum's safety at times. But she added that her friend was strong and undeterred.\u00a0Simpson said\u00a0she wants her friend to be remembered for her \"grace and strength under fire.\"\"It was a lesson I learned from her,\" Simpson said. \"And all of us can learn something from her. When\u00a0you're talking about hot issues that are politicized in the way that reproductive health has been politicized over the years, it is so easy to see it in black and white. And\u00a0be hateful or spiteful toward people who don't think the same way you do. And Betty, although she felt passionate and strongly about these issues, she never let that interfere with her doing her job, doing what she thought was the right thing to do.\"Still a mentor after retirementHaving grown up poor, Cockrum saw Planned Parenthood as a way to get health care to people who needed it, Reed said.But after about 15 years\u00a0Cockrum decided to step down from the job which by then had become head of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky.In her retirement, she relished the opportunity to spend more time with her grandchildren and to help with a number of local Democratic causes, Simon said.Nor was she only interested in politics. Recently she had embraced the Indianapolis Art Center as a cause, Reed said.Earlier this spring she hosted an afternoon event at the facility for about 30 of her friends, including her young granddaughter. She invited them to bring pieces of broken jewelry, sip mimosas and learn how to fix the baubles.\u201cIt was typical Betty,\" Reed said, \"trying to have people learn about something she cared about.\u201dThe youngest of eight children, Cockrum was born March 25, 1953, in LaGrange County, her family said. She attended Ball State University after graduating high school and earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.She is\u00a0survived by her two sons and four grandchildren. Her sons have asked in the spirit of her passion and career that donations be made in her name to the Julian Center for victims of domestic violence at www.juliancenter.org.\u00a0See the latest dealsContact IndyStar reporter Crystal Hill at\u00a0317-444-6094 or cnhill@gannett.com.
