(Lily O\u2019Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERLAND PARK \u2014 Kansas voters in a landslide Tuesday defeated a constitutional amendment that would have stripped residents of abortion rights, defying polling and political observers who expected a close result.\nThe ballot measure was failing by a 60-40 margin late Tuesday after voters responded to an intense and costly campaign marked by dubious claims by amendment supporters and the unraveling of protections by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe question before voters, in the form of a confusingly worded constitutional amendment, was whether to end the right to abortion in Kansas by voting \u201cyes\u201d or preserve the right by voting \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys, we did it,\u201d said Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, as she addressed a crowd of abortion-rights supporters at a watch party in Overland Park. \u201cWe blocked this amendment. Can you believe it?\u201d\nThe outcome could have far-reaching political implications, with a governor\u2019s race and congressional seats on the ballot in November. It also means reproductive health care will remain available in a state where six girls younger than 14 were among nearly 8,000 patients who received an abortion last year.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always maintained that a woman\u2019s reproductive health care decisions should be between her and her physician,\u201d said Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, in a statement to campaign supporters. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that Kansans stood up for our fundamental rights today.\u201d\nThe proposed constitutional amendment is a reaction to a 2019 decision by the Kansas Supreme Court, which struck down a state law banning a common second-term abortion procedure. The court determined that the right to bodily autonomy in the state constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights includes the decision to terminate a pregnancy.\nThat meant abortion remained legal in Kansas when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing each state to determine its own rules for reproductive health care. Kansas attracted national attention as the first state to vote on abortion rights in the post-Roe world.\nPresident Joe Biden, in a statement, said the vote makes clear \u201cthe majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions.\u201d\n\u201cCongress should listen to the will of the American people and restore the protections of Roe as federal law,\u201d Biden said.\nVoters showed up in unforeseen numbers in urban areas of the state, while rural areas underperformed compared with turnout in the presidential race two years ago.\n\u201cFrom the moment lawmakers put this on a primary ballot, we knew this was going to be an uphill battle, but we did not despair,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cWe put in the work and these numbers speak for themself.\u201d\n  Dawn Rattan, right, cries and applauds Aug. 2, 2022, at the Kansans for Constitutional Freedom watch party after learning Kansans had defeated a constitutional amendment to remove abortion rights. (Lily O\u2019Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)\nDawn Rattan, who attended the watch party in Overland Park, said the defeat of the amendment shows that reproductive health care is an issue that crosses party lines, \u201cand people everywhere want women to have a choice.\u201d She was moved to tears when the result was announced.\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d Rattan said. \u201cI was so worried that it was going to be really close, and this is just so decisive, it\u2019s not even close. So I\u2019m just happy and I\u2019m not moved to tears often, so I\u2019m kind of embarrassed, but I\u2019m just really happy.\u201d\nPassage of the constitutional amendment would have nullified the Kansas Supreme Court ruling and given the Legislature the authority to pass any kind of abortion restriction, without exceptions for rape, incest or a patient\u2019s health. The amendment\u2019s defeat means abortion will continue to be legal \u2014 and heavily regulated \u2014 in Kansas.\nSupporters and opponents of the amendment spent millions of dollars in campaigns to educate and influence voters.\nThe so-called Value Them Both Coalition refused to say whether it would support a ban on abortion if the amendment passes, routinely denouncing claims that the amendment equated to an abortion ban. But audio\u00a0obtained by Kansas Reflector revealed that supporters of the abortion amendment already had legislation in mind that would ban abortion from conception until birth, without exceptions.\nThe Value Them Both Coalition denied Kansas Reflector entry to its election night watch party because the organization doesn\u2019t approve of Reflector news stories.\nIn a statement,\u00a0Dannielle Underwood, a spokeswoman for the Value Them Both Coalition, said the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s election is a temporary setback.\n\u201cWe will be back,\u201d she said.\nMallory Carroll, spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the loss was \u201ca huge disappointment for pro-life Kansans and Americans nationwide.\u201d\n\u201cThe stakes for the pro-life movement in the upcoming midterm elections could not be higher, and there will be many more factors in play,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIt is critical that pro-life candidates go on offense to expose the extremism of Democrats\u2019 policy goals for nationalized abortion on demand paid for by taxpayers.\u201d\nOn Monday, Democrats received a text message \u2014 eventually connected to former Republican U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas \u2014 that inaccurately told them to vote \u201cyes\u201d to preserve reproductive health rights.\nOpponents of the amendment have complained about its misleading language. A line-by-line analysis by the Guardian concluded \u201cthe ballot language sows confusion in an effort to push people to vote \u2018yes.\u2019\u2009\u201d\nThe amendment claims to ban government-funded abortion, which is already banned under state law, and suggests the Legislature \u201ccould\u201d provide exceptions in state law for rape, incest or the life of a mother \u2014 even though the amendment doesn\u2019t actually require those exceptions.\nAnnual reporting from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment shows that a typical abortion in Kansas involves a woman of color between the ages of 20 and 30 who lives in Kansas or Missouri and is unmarried, already has at least one child, has never had an abortion before, is less than nine weeks from gestation and uses the drug mifepristone to terminate her pregnancy.\nBecause of existing restrictions, which remain in place, the patient has received state-ordered counseling designed to discourage her from having an abortion, waited at least 24 hours, looked at an ultrasound image and paid for the procedure out of her own pocket.\nKDHE reported no abortions occurred outside of 22 weeks, the legal threshold except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\nSweet said the defeat of the abortion amendment was historic for Kansas and America.\n\u201cWe will not hand over our constitutional rights and our bodily autonomy to the government, and we will take care of each other and look out for each other because that is what Kansas is all about,\u201d Sweet said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXKansas voters defeat abortion amendment in unexpected landslide\nby Sherman Smith, Kansas Reflector August 2, 2022\nKansas voters defeat abortion amendment in unexpected landslide\nby Sherman Smith, Kansas Reflector August 2, 2022\n OVERLAND PARK \u2014 Kansas voters in a landslide Tuesday defeated a constitutional amendment that would have stripped residents of abortion rights, defying polling and political observers who expected a close result.\nThe ballot measure was failing by a 60-40 margin late Tuesday after voters responded to an intense and costly campaign marked by dubious claims by amendment supporters and the unraveling of protections by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe question before voters, in the form of a confusingly worded constitutional amendment, was whether to end the right to abortion in Kansas by voting \u201cyes\u201d or preserve the right by voting \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys, we did it,\u201d said Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, as she addressed a crowd of abortion-rights supporters at a watch party in Overland Park. \u201cWe blocked this amendment.
