Wade \u2014 positions that place her sharply at odds with Church teaching.\n\u201cThis [topic] really gets me burned up in case you didn't notice, because again I'm very Catholic, devout, practicing, all of that. They would like to throw me out. But I'm not going because I don't want to make their day,\u201d the California Democrat said.\nPelosi made her comments at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, while being interviewed by Mark Updegrove, CEO and president of the LBJ Foundation. The topic was \u201cthe state of democracy at home and abroad, as well as [the] House Democrats\u2019 legislative agenda,\u201d according to Pelosi\u2019s YouTube channel.\nThe LBJ Presidential Library maintains records and archives of President Johnson\u2019s political career, while promoting his legacy. The library is supported by the foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the future of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion nationwide, Pelosi praised the House\u2019s success in passing a bill for the codification of Roe. That \u201ccodification,\u201d which ultimately failed in the Senate, came in the form of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which recognized a \u201cstatutory right\u201d to abortion, blocking state abortion regulations and removing restrictions on pre-viability abortions.\n\u201cOf course, we haven't passed it in the Senate. But we never, as I say, we never give up in that regard because we do think that the codification of Roe v. Wade would be a really important protection against the court,\u201d Pelosi said.\u00a0\nPelosi said that she had five children in six years and one week and often reminds \u201cthe other side\u201d that \u201cwhen you have five children in six years and one week, then we'll talk about this OK?\u201d\nAbortion was not right for Pelosi, she said, but \u201cit's not up to me to say what's right for somebody else. [Pointing at the crowd] Nor is it right for you, nor is it right for the Supreme Court. This has been a precedent of the court. It should be upheld by the court.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPelosi said that she respects other people\u2019s opinions \u201cabout how they see the law and their own personal lives,\u201d but added that \u201cthese are people who don\u2019t believe in governance.\u201d\n\u201cThey don't believe in government protecting the environment, they don't believe in government protecting people's rights or voting rights or anything like that. But they really are big-time government in your bedroom. Whether it's a woman's right to choose, LGBTQ, whatever it is, all of a sudden, there they are,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAgain it isn't about what is your religious belief,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cIt's what is the right of people to make their own decisions about the sizing and time or if they are going to have a family.\u201d\n\u201cThis really gets me burned up, in case you didn't notice, because again I'm very Catholic, a devout, practicing, all of that. They would like to throw me out. But I'm not going because I don't want to make their day,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPelosi said that abortion access is fundamental to respect women and families and questioned why \u201csomebody in Washington D.C. should be deciding the size and timing of your family and the rest.\u201d\nShe said she wishes that elections would not \u201cbe about a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d but noted that elections have consequences, and said that \u201cyou probably want to make decisions about who you vote for in the elections when it comes to this very sad situation.\u201d\nToward the end of the event, Pelosi was asked who her role model was and she named her mother, Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro, while speaking about her Catholic faith.\n\u201cWell, my mother was my main role model because, in our family, we were raised in a very Catholic family. So it was very Catholic, devoutly Catholic, proud of our Italian-American heritage, fiercely patriotic, staunchly Democratic. But the first three we had a lot in common with many people [Catholic, Italian-American, and patriotic] and then sometimes it would be that division there\u201d when it came to politics, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPelosi said that although her family believed in separation of church and state, their Catholic faith motivated them to care about people.\nWhile mentioning another role model in the Congress, the late Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., Pelosi said that while her and Boggs were on the same side of the aisle, they were on the opposite side of the \u201cchoice issue.\u201d\n\u201cWe were on the opposite side of the choice issue. She was a staunch Democrat. But [she was from] Louisiana and she was like my family,\" Pelosi said.\n\"I came from a pro-life family myself. They wish I would temper my remarks sometimes but that's not going to be happening,\" she said. \"So I think they gave up on that a long time ago.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nnancy pelosi\npro-abortion
