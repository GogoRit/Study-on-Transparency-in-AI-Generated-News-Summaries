Many wept tears of joy. Victory music kicked in and green smoke filled the air. A triumphant message flashed up on a big screen above the joyful crowd: \u201cWe did it!\u201d it said. \u201cES LEY!\u201d (IT\u2019S LAW!).\u201cI\u2019m very emotional,\u201d said 25-year-old Melany Marcati, who was among the celebrators. \u201cThere are no words to describe what your body feels after fighting for something for so long. I cried a lot, which I wasn\u2019t expecting.\u201dThe campaigner Ingrid Beck said: \u201cThe struggle for women\u2019s rights is always arduous, and this time we even had to contend with a pandemic, so I am overjoyed with this result.\u201dThe bill, which legalises terminations in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, was approved by Argentina\u2019s lower house earlier this month after being put to congress by the country\u2019s leftwing president, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez.\u201cSafe, legal and free abortion is now law \u2026 Today we are a better society,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez celebrated on Twitter after the result was confirmed.Fern\u00e1ndez has previously said that more than 3,000 women had died as a result of unsafe, underground abortions in Argentina since the return of democracy in 1983.The landmark decision means Argentina becomes only the third South American country to permit elective abortions, alongside Uruguay, which decriminalised the practice in 2012, and Guyana, where it has been legal since 1995.Cuba legalised the practice in 1965 while Mexico City and the Mexican state of Oaxaca also allow terminations.Giselle Carino, an Argentinian feminist activist, said she believed the achievement in the home country of Pope Francis would reverberate across a region that is home to powerful Catholic and evangelical churches and some of the harshest abortion laws in the world.View image in fullscreenPro-choice demonstrators celebrate. Photograph: Ricardo Ceppi/Getty ImagesIn most countries, such as Brazil, abortions are only permitted in extremely limited circumstances such as rape or risk to the mother\u2019s life, while in some, such as the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, they are banned altogether.\u201cI feel incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve been able to achieve. This is a historic moment for the country, without a doubt,\u201d said Carino, head of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Western Hemisphere Region.\u201cIt shows how, in spite of all the obstacles, change and progress are possible. Argentinian women and what\u2019s happening right now will have an enormous impact on the region and the world,\u201d Carino added, pointing to parallel struggles in Brazil, Chile and Colombia.Colombian activists recently petitioned the constitutional court to remove abortion from the country\u2019s criminal code while campaigners in Chile hope a new constitution might lead to expanded women\u2019s rights.In the region\u2019s most populous nation, Brazil, activists are waiting for the supreme court to rule on a 2018 legal challenge that would decriminalise abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy.Mariela Belski, Amnesty International\u2019s executive director in Argentina, called the result \u201can inspiration to the Americas\u201d.\u201cArgentina has sent a strong message of hope to our entire continent: that we can change course against the criminalisation of abortion and against clandestine abortions, which pose serious risks to the health and lives of millions of people.\u201dView image in fullscreenArgentina\u2019s vice-president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner speaks during the debate on the abortion bill. Photograph: Matias Baglietto/ReutersWednesday\u2019s victory is the result of five years of mass protest marches by Argentina\u2019s grassroots women\u2019s movement, which began as a Twitter campaign against gender violence that used the hashtag #NiUnaMenos (\u201cNot one less\u201d \u2013 meaning no more women lost to gender violence).The first spontaneous march came on 3 June 2015, in reaction to the murder of 14-year-old Chiara P\u00e1ez, who was found buried underneath her boyfriend\u2019s house after being beaten to death and a few months pregnant.\u201cAren\u2019t we going to raise our voices? THEY ARE KILLING US,\u201d the radio journalist Marcela Ojeda tweeted at the time. After that call to arms, a group of female journalists began tweeting under the #NiUnaMenos hashtag, resulting in the first of many marches that brought tens of thousands of women to gather at the congressional square in Buenos Aires.The following year, Argentinian feminists held a mass strike in response to the rape, murder and impalement of 16-year-old Luc\u00eda P\u00e9rez in the coastal city of Mar del Plata.It was after the 2015 #NiUnaMenos march that pro-choice campaigners realised the fight against \u201cfemicide\u201d could also encompass demands for access to legal abortion.They adopted a green scarf \u2013 worn as a bandana, head-scarf, or around the wrist \u2013 as a symbol of their movement, a trend that quickly spread to other Latin American countries, where green has come to symbolise the broader fight for women\u2019s rights.That green scarf was an allusion to the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo activists who wore white headscarves as they confronted Argentina\u2019s vicious 1976-83 dictatorship over the disappearance of their children.Pro-choice campaigners initially saw their hopes of change dashed in August 2018 when the senate, under pressure from the Catholic church, rejected a similar bill.Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s election the following year brought fresh hope, as he promised to back the push for change. \u201cThe criminalisation of abortion has achieved nothing,\u201d he said in November after putting the legislation to congress.Speaking outside congress on Wednesday, 46-year-old Julieta Cabrera said: \u201cUntil the last moment I didn\u2019t want to believe it, not until the last vote was in, because last time, we got our hopes up.\u201d She said she had come out because \u201cabortion is something I\u2019ve experienced firsthand. My generation and many others have been through it.\u201dOpponents of the law, who had gathered nearby by a giant model foetus that is their trademark, dispersed quickly after the result emerged, with one man occasionally shouting the word \u201cMurderers!\u201d towards the pro-choice side.Karina Marolla, a 49-year-old opponent of the law, said: \u201cWhat was voted for today is the death penalty for the most innocent. Today in Argentina there\u2019s no law giving the death penalty to rapists or murderers. So we\u2019re feeling sad, to put it lightly.\u201dView image in fullscreenAnti-abortion and other religious groups in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. Photograph: Alejo Manuel Avila/Le Pictorium Agency/ZUMA/REX/ShutterstockCarino said the leftward political shift that brought Fern\u00e1ndez to power had undoubtedly boosted the pro-choice campaign after the previous year\u2019s setback. Among those who helped Fern\u00e1ndez win office were many young women who took part in the #NiUnaMenos protests and were voting for the first time.Carino said the real credit lay with Argentina\u2019s indefatigable women \u201cwho never stopped occupying the streets and the social networks \u2013 not even against the backdrop of the pandemic \u2013 and kept up their struggle, without haste but without rest\u201d.\u201cIf anything made the difference, it was this.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionArgentinaAmericasHealthReproductive rightsnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMacron says battle for abortion rights is not over as France updates constitution8 Mar 2024MPs\u00a0and campaigners accuse Polish government of betrayal over abortion laws7 Mar 2024 France makes abortion a constitutional right in historic Versailles vote4 Mar 2024French move to make abortion a \u2018guaranteed freedom\u2019 gains big win in lower house30 Jan 2024Abortion rights will be in French constitution next year, Macron vows29 Oct 2023Woman in Malta charged in court for having abortion1 Jun 2023\u2018I will do the same again\u2019: activists continue fight against Poland\u2019s strict abortion laws 24 May 2023Japan approves abortion pill for the first time29 Apr 2023France moves closer to making abortion a constitutional right24 Nov 2022Malta drafts law allowing abortion if mother\u2019s life or health at risk21 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
