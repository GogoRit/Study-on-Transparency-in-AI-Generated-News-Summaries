The votes of rightwing Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party pushed the legislation through by a majority in the context of a pandemic in which he is ruling by decree indefinitely. The changes to Hungary\u2019s Registry Act will restrict gender to biological sex at birth, a status determined by primary sex characteristics and chromosomes. All other forms of identification are tied to birth certificates in Hungary so these too will reflect birth sex. (1)\nTrans advocacy and human rights groups argue that it will lead to more discrimination because Hungarians are required to produce identity cards on a frequent basis. This means that they will, in effect, be \u2018outing\u2019 themselves in everyday situations which may be humiliating, at best, and dangerous at worst. The government say they are merely clarifying sex within the law; a disingenuous claim in a political context in which the traditional family is increasingly being placed at the heart of a \u2018white\u2019, Christian nation.\nJulie Bindel recently argued that it was unwise of Pink News to look at Orban\u2019s policies in relation to transgender people in isolation. They should instead be conceived of as part of a broader attack on women\u2019s rights and the rights of minority groups. (2)\nBut Bindel\u2019s advice applies equally to those gender critical feminists, albeit small in number,\u00a0 who are responding positively to the news from Hungary, on the basis that Orban recognises the immutability of sex. Whilst Baroness Nicholson might see no problem in adding Hungary to her list of causes for celebration, feminists shouldn\u2019t lose sight of a much bigger picture. (3)\nIn 2013, Orban introduced a constitutional reform which enshrined the idea of \u200b\u200bthe family as the foundation of the nation in the Basic Law. Although abortion was legalised after the Second World War, since 2013 the Constitution has stated that \u201cthe life of the fetus must be protected from the moment of conception\u201d. Orban has yet to move on abortion but he publically supports anti-abortion organisations and in 2017 he opened The World Congress of Families conference in Budapest. The WCF is a United States coalition is a virulently anti-abortion organisation which promotes Christian right values globally. (4)\nBy 2018, he was setting out his plan for a new\u00a0 \u201ccultural era\u201d which included amending the kindergarten curriculum so that it would promote a \u201cnational identity, Christian cultural values, patriotism, attachment to homeland and family\u201d. (5) In 2019, the government announced a series of pro-natalist measures which included a lifetime income tax exemption for mothers of\u00a0 four children and free IVF treatment for married heterosexual couples. These policies aim to reverse demographic decline and curb immigration, at one and the same time. Orban argues that \u201cit\u2019s a national interest to restore natural reproduction. Not one interest among others \u2013 but the only one. It\u2019s a European interest too. It is the European interest\u201d. (6)\nIn essence, he subscribes to the white nationalist \u201cdemographic winter\u201d theory, which claims that the \u201cpurity\u201d of European civilisation is in peril due to the increasing\u00a0 numbers of\u00a0 non-white races, in general, and Muslim people, in particular. Orban\u2019s draconian measures against migrants and refugees dovetail with this belief system. (7)\nSuch policies also cast women in the role of wombs of the nation, echoing the eugenicist policies of Hitler, who also provided financial inducements to bribe Aryan women into motherhood. As Anita Komuves, a Hungarian journalist, tweeted, \u201cCan we just simply declare that Hungary is Gilead from now on?\u201d (8)\nHomosexuality is legal in Hungary, but same sex couples are unable to marry and registered partnerships don\u2019t offer equivalent legal rights. Orban\u2019s government has made the promotion of patriarchal family values so central to its cultural mission and policies that anti gay rhetoric amongst politicians has become commonplace. Last year, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, compared supporters of lesbian and gay marriage and adoption to paedophiles. \u201cMorally, there is no difference between the behaviour of a paedophile and the behaviour of someone who demands such things,\u201d he said. (9) In 2017 the annual Pride event was attacked by violent right-wing extremists hurling faeces, acid and Molotov cocktails at the marchers and police.\nJust as Orban has sought to eliminate the notion of gender identity within the law, so too has he gone to war against what he describes as \u201cgender ideology\u201d. In 2018 he issued a decree revoking funding for gender studies programmes in October that year. (10) At the time, this move was welcomed by some gender critical and radical feminists on the basis that postmodern feminism in the academy has contributed to a dogmatic sex denialism which is unable to analyse the basis of female oppression. (11) But, as with the changes in relation to the legal recognition of transgender people, Orban\u2019s reasons were anything but feminist. As one government spokesman explained: \u201cThe government\u2019s standpoint is that people are born either male or female, and we do not consider it acceptable for us to talk about socially constructed genders rather than biological sexes.\u201d (12) Gender studies is seen as promoting too fluid an understanding of male and female roles in the place of a fixed social order in which women\u2019s biological destiny is to be married mothers. The decision to withdraw funding from gender studies didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. At a party congress in December 2015, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, one of the founders of the Fidesz party, stated:\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the gender craziness. We don\u2019t want to make Hungary a futureless society of man-hating women, and feminine men living in dread of women, and considering families and children only as barriers to self-fulfilment\u2026 And we would like if our daughters would consider, as the highest quality of self-fulfilment, the possibility of giving birth to our grandchildren.\u201d(13)\u00a0\nOrban\u2019s war against \u201cgender\u201d also led to Hungary\u2019s National Assembly recently passing a declaration which refused to ratify the Istanbul Convention, the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.It was claimed that the convention promoted \u201cgender ideology\u201d and particular issue was taken with the section that defined gender as \u201csocially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men.\u201d Hungarian politicians object to an understanding of gender which recognises that women\u2019s \u2018role\u2019 can change, even improve (!), as societies change, an unwelcome thought to those wishing to uphold men\u2019s power in the family and discourage homosexuality. As with a number of Orban\u2019s other policy decisions, there was also a racist element to the refusal to ratify the convention. The fact that it would have afforded protections for migrant and refugee women was in direct contradiction to Hungary\u2019s anti-immigration policies. As one far right, Hungarian blog put it:\n\u201cBy refusing the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, Hungary, says \u2018Yes!\u2019 to the protection of women but \u2018No!\u2019 to gender ideology and illegal migration.\u201d (14)\n(Women\u2019s groups in the UK have long suspected that our government refuses to ratify the Convention as it would bind them to properly funding the VAWG sector.)\nOrban\u2019s concern about \u201cgender\u201d and \u201cgender ideology\u201d is shared\u00a0 by other states with a socially conservative programme for women. Some gender critical and radical feminists use this term, as well,\u00a0 which can be confusing when our respective analyses have so little in common. Here, it refers to a set of beliefs that conflate sex with gender and deny the material reality of sex-based oppression. This is a far cry from the definitions shared by the growing \u201canti gender\u201d movements in Central and Eastern Europe. (15)\nThese movements privilege biological understandings of what it means to be a man or a woman but only do so in order to insist that our biology should determine (and restrict) our lives.They want to hang on the man/woman binary because they believe that gendered roles and expectations, ones which place women below men, are determined by sex. In short, they deny that gender is a social construct. \u201cGender ideology\u201d, as a term, has become something of a dustbin category, deployed variously to attack feminism, same sex marriage, reproductive rights and sex education in schools. Trump\u2019s administration is engaged in an ongoing fight to remove the word \u201cgender\u201d from United Nations documents. (16)\nIn this context, we need to remember that \u201cgender\u201d is still most frequently used as a proxy for women/sex in UN Conventions like CEDAW (The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women). The term is also increasingly \u2013 to our concern \u2013 conflated with gender identity with all the risks that this entails. (17)\nBut that fact shouldn\u2019t blind us to the main motivations of those who oppose the use of the word gender at UN level. When conservatives say they want to replace the\u00a0 term \u201cgender\u201d with \u201csex\u201d, it\u2019s invariably to oppose women\u2019s equality with men and to enshrine patriarchal understandings of women\u2019s place in society. Replacing the language of gender with the language of sex is, in their terms, a route to a biologically driven and restricted notion of reproduction as women\u2019s only fate. Replacing the language of gender with the language of sex is not necessarily a feminist enterprise.\nUnless we establish very clear lines between ourselves and rightwing, religious fundamentalists, we are in danger of being swallowed up and used by the most anti-women, global forces, the canniest of which offer themselves as \u2018partners\u2019 in the fight against gender ideology: witness several events hosted by the Heritage Foundation, a hugely powerful Christian Right think tank which has platformed radical feminists. (18)\nThe Heritage Foundation has particular chutzpah. Whilst claiming to be an ally in the feminist fight to preserve female only spaces and sex-based rights, it opposes reproductive rights, lesbian and gay rights and any measures to counter discrimination against women, notably the Equal Rights Amendment. In fact, it blames feminists for the current state of affairs \u2013 though Ryan Anderson would never be rude enough to say so at their shared events. \u201cTransgender theories are part of the feminist goal of a sexual revolution that eliminates the proprietary family and celebrates non-monogamous sexual experiences.\u201d (19)\nWhen it\u2019s not cynically partnering with (a small number) of radical feminists as \u2018cover\u2019, the Heritage Foundation enjoys the company of the Holy See, the universal government of the Catholic Church which operates from Vatican City State. (20) The Vatican has opposed the notion of gender since the early-2000s, arguing that males and females have intrinsic attributes which aren\u2019t shaped by social forces. Recently, they published an educational document called \u201cMale and female he created them\u201d. (21)\nWoman\u2019s Place UK has consistently stated an opposition to working with, or supporting the work of the religious right (and their female representatives). Not simply because it is strategically disastrous but because it is wrong in principle. (22) When we look at what is happening in Hungary it is well to remember that there is more than one way to \u2018erase\u2019 women. Andrea Pet\u0151, a professor at the Central European University of Budapest, commenting on the official reports that Hungary (and Poland) send to the UN CEDAW Committee, noted, \u201cwe see that they replace the concept of women with that of family,\u00a0 women as independent agents are slowly disappearing from public policy documents, behind the single word family.\u201d (23)\n18th June 2020\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/hungary-votes-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\nhttps://unherd.com/thepost/the-orban-decree-is-scary-but-its-about-more-than-trans-rights/\nhttps://twitter.com/Baroness_Nichol/status/1271153399262822404?s=20\nhttp://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/pm-orban-at-world-congress-of-families-xi-summit-2018-will-be-the-year-for-families/\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/414f202e-9996-11ea-8b5b-63f7c5c86bef\nhttps://www.diggitmagazine.com/articles/viktor-orb-ns-anti-enlightenment-nationalism-and-homophobia-hungary\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-parliament-asylum-seekers-detain-law-approve-refugees-immigration-crisis-arrests-border-a7615486.html\nhttps://www.voanews.com/europe/demographic-slump-panics-european-leaders\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/27/hungary-pulls-out-of-eurovision-amid-rise-in-anti-lgbt-rhetoric\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/europe-far-right-target-gender-studies/591208/\nhttps://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/gender-fluid-primer-21st-century-sally-hines-Thames-and-Hudson\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-bans-gender-studies-programmes-viktor-orban-central-european-university-budapest-a8599796.html\nhttps://theconversation.com/gender-studies-banned-at-university-the-hungarian-governments-latest-attack-on-equality-103150\nhttps://abouthungary.hu/blog/yes-to-protection-of-women-no-to-gender-ideology-and-illegal-migration/\nhttps://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2018/01/15/traditional-values-for-the-99-the-new-gender-ideology-in-russia/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/18/us-accused-of-trying-to-dilute-international-agreements-un-commission-status-of-women\nhttps://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/scot.2019.0284?journalCode=scot\nhttps://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/event/biology-isnt-bigotry-why-sex-matters-the-age-gender-identity; https://www.heritage.org/event/the-inequality-the-equality-act-concerns-the-left\nhttps://www.heritage.org/gender/report/sex-gender-and-the-origin-the-culture-wars-intellectual-history\nhttps://holyseemission.org/contents/statements/5c9511849e908.php\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/vatican-launches-guide-to-tackle-educational-crisis-on-gender.\nhttps://womansplaceuk.org/2019/10/15/turbulent-times-ruth-serwotka/\nhttps://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/hungary-birthrate-family-and-country-viktor-orban-wants-women-back-in-the-home/?fbclid=IwAR2wHYxyvSQNAh5tyC5OfbBHv6dRLOZTB7g7\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\nShare\n\n\n\nPrevious post \n\nNext post \n\nWe believe that it is important to share a range of viewpoints on women\u2019s rights and advancement from different perspectives.
