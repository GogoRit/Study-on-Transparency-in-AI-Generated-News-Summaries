Wade.\nBut everything we have heard about supposed wholesale bans, or lack of concern for the life of the mother, pales in comparison to both the quantity and severity of obviously wrong pronouncements from those claiming a Jewish perspective. One notable organization summed up a common position by stating, \u201cJudaism permits abortion. Full stop.\u201d Few things have been said about Judaism by purported adherents that are more clearly untrue.\nThe Jewish Bible\u2019s position on life is unambiguous \u2014 and emphatically \u201cpro-life.\u201d The Torah identifies human life as a soul placed (breathed) within a body by G-d Himself [Gen. 2:7]. Throughout history, Judaism has opposed murder, child sacrifice and, with only modest exceptions, abortion. It is due to the Torah\u2019s influence that civilized Western society does not accept infanticide as a method of family planning, or regard throwing dissidents to the lions as entertainment.\n\nGet Jewish Exponent's Newsletter by email and never miss our top storiesWe do not share data with third party vendors.\n\n\nFree Sign Up\n\n\nOne who claims that fetal life is not precious to Judaism must not have read the Torah or Prophets, or studied our Oral Law. Rebecca is told not only that she is carrying twins, but that they have distinct natures and characters that explain their behavior in utero [Gen. 25:23]. Jeremiah is told that \u201cBefore I placed you in the womb I knew you, before you left the uterus I sanctified you, I appointed you a prophet to the nations\u201d [Jer. 1:5].\nAnd in the Mishnah [Ohalos 7:6] we are taught that the reason one must save a mother even at the expense of her child is \u201cbecause her life precedes his life.\u201d Some flagrantly misrepresent this as saying that the fetus is not yet considered alive, but the text itself explicitly says otherwise.\nJewish law also demands that the Sabbath be violated in order to save a fetal life. Given that lifesaving activity is the only situation in which Sabbath restrictions are set aside, were a fetus not considered alive this would be prohibited, not required.\nAdvocates must confront the truth: According to Judaism, abortion, entailing a loss of human life, is an unmitigated tragedy. Even the most permissive opinions reserve abortion for extreme situations that no woman should ever experience. The idea that abortion should be regarded as simply a \u201cchoice,\u201d or a routine health care decision when the mother\u2019s health is not abnormally threatened by carrying the child to term, is anathema to our beliefs.\nThis also, interestingly enough, coincides with all that the medical community has learned about fetal life since 1973. Today we know, for example, that newborn babies respond not only to their mothers\u2019 heartbeats, but to the sound of their parents\u2019 voices. While in utero, babies suck their thumbs for comfort, and even learn music. It is simply nonsensical to argue that a thinking, listening baby is not alive.\nThose Jews who ignore our ritual laws, eating pork and treating Saturday like a normal day, rarely insist that the relevant laws were misread or misunderstood. They simply admit they do not follow these laws. But recognizing the Torah\u2019s authority over moral judgments, those wishing to behave in contravention of its ethical precepts often devise tendentious readings to turn prohibited acts into \u201cJewish values.\u201d\nMuch as we can sympathize with the psychological need behind such efforts, we cannot minimize the inestimable value the Torah places upon all human life, including that of those as yet unborn.\nRabbi Yaakov Menken is the managing director of the Coalition for Jewish Values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinReddItTumblrMixEmailPrint\n\n Previous articleThe Future Is Our Past Unless We Act NowNext articleIt\u2019s Time to Turn the Palestinian Mindset Against Terrorism - - \n\n\n\n\n1 COMMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteven+N.+Schwartz\n\n\nMay 13, 2022 At 5:03 pm \n\n\n\nI wear a \u201cChai\u201d pendant on a necklace as I\u2019m sure many of you do. \u201cChai\u201d symbolizes life in Hebrew. Life is ALWAYS paramount in Jewish tradition, scripture, law and practice. Stop listening to liberal woman who have sold out Judaism for modern feminism or liberalism or progressivism or whatever the latest \u201cism\u201d is that they adhere with. Let them not lead us astray from our Jewish beliefs or drown out the voices of practicing Jews. Thank you Rabbi Menken for standing tall and stating clearly what so many Rabbis haven\u2019t the beitzim or chutzpah to proclaim.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Jewish Exponent7605 Old York RoadSuite #113Melrose Park, PA 19027215-832-0700\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory Archives\nDigital Edition Archive\n \n\n\u00a9 2024 Jewish Exponent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA JEWISH EXPONENT IS HERE FOR YOU\nYour voluntary contribution supports our efforts to deliver content that engages and helps strengthen the Jewish community in the Philadelphia area.\n\nCONTRIBUTE\n\n\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA JEWISH EXPONENT IS HERE FOR YOU\nYour voluntary contribution supports our efforts to deliver content that engages and helps strengthen the Jewish community in the Philadelphia area.\n\n\n\n\n$5\n$10\n$18\n$36 \n\n\n\nCONTRIBUTE\nThis is a voluntary contribution.
