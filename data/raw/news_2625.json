The iPad Pro 2018 also comfortably beats the best smartphones out there for performance.\nAlong with the A12X Bionic is 4/6GB RAM and storage options ranging from 64GB to 1TB. If you want that extra 2GB of RAM then you\u2019ll have to plump for the biggest storage option. I can\u2019t imagine anyone spending this much on a tablet and being happy with 64GB \u2013 but hey, I guess it allows Apple to offer a \u201clower\u201d starting price. The 256GB allowance would appear to be the perfect option for most people.\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Best tablet\n\nAll that power and those ridiculous benchmark scores are one thing, but it\u2019s real-world performance that matters. To test this out, I performed a couple of \u201cintensive\u201d tasks. I loaded multiple RAW photos into Lightroom, put some 4K footage into iMovie, and tried my best to draw a multi-layered picture in ProCreate. Each task worked perfectly well, without any lag or serious slow-down. \niMovie for iPad is surprisingly fully featured, and I managed to edit down my footage into something resembling a viewable video. Lightroom had no issues opening, allowing me to edit and then saving edited RAW photos to the cloud. It loaded up the images in roughly the same amount of time as my MacBook Pro.\nIt\u2019s with ProCreate and \u201ccreative\u201d processes that the iPad really shines, though. Interacting directly with the screen via the Apple Pencil feels responsive and natural; this is something that\u2019 just isn\u2019t possible on a Mac.\nDuring the unveiling of the iPad Pro 2018, Apple claimed it matched the Xbox One S in terms of gaming power. That might be the case, but that comparison is pretty irrelevant. There are some good, even great, games on the App Store: PUBG Mobile, FM 2019 Touch, Asphalt 9 all load up and run exceptionally well. There\u2019s nothing here of real console quality, though.\n\nEven with the lack of a headphone jack, the audio on the iPad Pro 2018 is great. There are four speakers on the device \u2013 two at the top and two at the bottom \u2013 and these each consist of their own tweeter and woofer. Sound is loud and clear, with a surprising level of bass and virtually no distortion, even at full volume. The speakers are clever, too: spin the iPad around and the audio will follow you.\nApple is selling a USB-C to 3.5m adapter alongside the new iPad; it isn\u2019t included in the box. You can also use compatible USB-C headphones \u2013 I tried the Pixel Buds you get with the Google Pixel 3, which sound as expected.\nThe rear camera of the iPad Pro 2018 takes plenty of inspiration from the iPhone XR. It\u2019s a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.8 lens and Smart HDR.\n\nLook deeper at the specs and you\u2019ll discover that not only is the camera a downgrade on the XR \u2013\u00a0which is to be expected, to be honest \u2013 but it\u2019s also a downgrade on unit featured on the last-gen iPad Pro. \nThere are now fewer elements inside the lens and OIS (optical image stabilisation) has been ditched. You\u2019ll notice the lack of stabilisation in video recording with footage looking shaky.\nPhotos are fine, however, especially for a tablet. Images display bright colours, plenty of detail and the sensor is quick to focus, too. Mainly for use with AR tasks and photographing documents, for such purposes the camera really impresses. \niPad Pro 2018 \u2013 \u00a0Software\nThe most significant thing to hold back the iPad Pro 2018 from becoming not only the ultimate tablet but the ultimate laptop, too, is iOS 12. This is pretty much the same software you\u2019ll find on the \u00a3329 iPad, and it stifles the potential of the hardware.\nTake the USB-C port, for example. While you can use it to reverse-charge other devices such as the iPhone and Apple Watches and to import photos from an SD card, you can only import those photos into a Camera Roll of the Photos app. If you\u2019re a Lightroom user, you\u2019ll have to first import snaps to Photos and then again into your Lightroom library. When you\u2019re trying to work fast, this is severely limiting.\nNeither can you use that USB-C port to plug in an external hard-drive. Again, there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\niOS 12 is a fantastic operating system on cheaper iPads used mainly for media consumption devices and iPhones. Here, however, it serves to stunt productivity. You have all this power and amazing hardware to play with, yet you can use only two apps concurrently, and neither of these can be turned into floating windows.\nThe lack of a proper file structure also limits functionality. Apple\u2019s Files app is fine, but I want something more akin to Finder on a Mac, where all my files can be stored and accessed from anywhere. There are simply too many hoops to jump through to get things done here.\n\nWhere the iPad\u2019s software impresses slightly more is in terms of the apps. The iOS App Store features plenty of custom-built apps for the iPad, including productivity apps such as iMovie, Lightroom, ProCreate and Affinity Photo. They\u2019ll be a Photoshop app coming in 2019. \nThese remain cut-down desktop versions, although each feels good on the touchscreen and offer a decent selection of features. I\u2019d still like more, though; and again \u2013 having all this power without fully featured apps feels like a waste.\nSome of those apps \u2013 iMovie, for instance \u2013\u00a0can output 4K (or 5K) via a USB-C cable to a television or monitor and display something different. This is something that needs to be added to an app by the developer, or else you\u2019ll just get a mirrored image of whatever you see on the iPad on the TV.\nFace ID replaces Touch ID as the main biometric method of unlocking and authenticating payments with the iPad Pro 2018. You\u2019ll be prompted to engage this feature on initial setup of the iPad.\n\nThe process is identical to that on the iPhone XS. You swivel your head a few times and then, voila, you\u2019re done. Face ID is fast, accurate and works in various orientations. If you\u2019re accidentally covering the camera, you\u2019ll get a handy alert to move your hand.\niPad Pro 2018 \u2013 Battery life\nBoth sizes of the iPad Pro 2018 have slightly different battery capacities. The 11-inch model has a 29.37Whr cell, with the 12.9-inch upping that to 36.71Whr. That difference is mainly to offset the larger screen and the extra power the latter model requires. Apple claims 10 hours of \u201cweb browsing, watching video or listening to music\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been using the 11-inch model for this review and the battery life stands up to, and often exceeds, Apple claims. It also matches up to just about every recent iPad, including the 9.7-inch iPad and iPad Pro 10.5.\nAn hour of streaming an HDR video from Netflix consumed between 7-10%, with an HDR movie from iTunes (downloaded to the device) taking off 6-7%. These were with brightness set to roughly half and Wi-Fi on. You\u2019ll of course get more (or less) juice by altering the brightness, but I found 50% was bright enough for me.\n\nIf you use the device sparingly, for a few hours each day, you could go multiple days without needing to charge the iPad Pro 2018.\nThere\u2019s no wireless charging here, with the USB-C port the only means of powering up the iPad Pro 2018. In the box, you get an 18W USB-C to USB-C charger However, if you\u2019ve got a recent USB-C MacBook or laptop then you can use that charger instead to enable faster charge.\nWhy buy the iPad Pro 2018?\nThere\u2019s plenty to like about the iPad Pro 2018. It\u2019s a gorgeous piece of design headlined by a beautiful display and hardware that\u2019s unmatched.\nYet for the potential of this tablet to be fully realised, iOS needs to grow up. There are too many limitations, too many roadblocks to completing tasks in a streamlined way. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can be super-productive with this device, but it takes more effort than it should.\nWith a starting price of \u00a3769/$799 for the 11-inch and \u00a3969/$999 for the 12.9-inch version, this is also the most expensive iPad to date. If you plump for the 1TB LTE-capable iPad Pro 12.9 then you\u2019ll be handing over \u00a31869/$1899. Add in the keyboard and Pencil and the package will set you back more than \u00a32000/$2000. That\u2019s a huge amount to spend on a tablet \u2013 and is more comparable to high-end laptops than other tablets.\nIf you can afford it \u2013 and you know what you\u2019re getting into \u2013 and the iPad Pro fits into your workflow, it\u2019s an exceptional device; one that will certainly impress.\nVerdict\nA stunningly built tablet that needs a better operating system to really make the most of all the power contained within. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow we test tablets\nWe test every tablet we review thoroughly.
