and \"pro-life\"\nPublic more evenly divided than usual about morality of abortion\nLargest segment continues to hold middle position on legality\n\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' overall stance on abortion has been stable in recent years, with the 48% calling themselves \"pro-choice\" and 46% \"pro-life\" similar to the close division on this measure observed most years since 2010.\n\n\nLine graph. Trend from 1995 to 2020 in the percentages of Americans identifying as either pro-choice or pro-life on the abortion issue. After leaning strongly pro-choice in 1995 (56%), the public became moderately more pro-choice than pro-life from 1996 to 2009. Since then attitudes have been closely split, including this year when 48% identify as pro-choice and 46% as pro-life.\n\nFor the past decade, an average of 47% of Americans have identified as pro-choice and 47% as pro-life. Almost every poll conducted during those years has revealed a close division in identification -- except in 2015, when the public tilted pro-choice, and in 2012, when it was more pro-life. Before that, from 1995 to 2009, the public leaned more pro-choice than pro-life by 49% to 43%, on average.\nThe latest results are from Gallup's 2020 Values and Beliefs poll, conducted May 1-13 by telephone with a random national sample of U.S. adults.\nAmericans Also Split on Morality of Abortion\nThe survey also finds Americans closely divided when asked about the morality of abortion: 44% call it morally acceptable and 47% morally wrong. This three-percentage-point difference is slightly smaller than the average five-point gap seen since 2013.\n\n\nLine graph. Trend from 2001 to 2020 in the percentages of Americans describing abortion as morally acceptable or morally wrong. Most years the morally wrong position has led by a significant margin, but in 2020 views are closely split with 47% calling it morally wrong and 44% morally acceptable.\n\nLargest Opinion Bloc Still Wants Abortion Legal With Restrictions\nGallup's longest trend on abortion asks Americans if the procedure should be legal in all circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances.\nConsistent with the trend since 1975, a plurality of Americans choose the middle position, saying abortion should be legal only under certain circumstances (50%). However, nearly as many hold one of two doctrinaire views -- wanting abortion legal under any circumstances (29%) or wanting it illegal in all circumstances (20%).\n\n\nLine graph. Trend from 1975 to 2020 in preferences for whether abortion should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances. Since 1975 half or more of Americans have consistently said it should be legal only under certain circumstances.\n\nSince 1994, Gallup has clarified Americans' views on the legality of abortion by asking those who think abortion should be legal under certain circumstances to say whether they should be legal in \"most circumstances\" or \"only in a few circumstances.\" The middle group breaks heavily for the more restrictive position, resulting in 14% saying abortion should be legal under most circumstances and 35% in only a few circumstances.\nAll told, then, 55% of Americans favor a more restrictive approach to abortion, and 43% favor a less restrictive approach. This 12-point gap -- which is down from 22 points in 2019 -- is larger than the gaps seen on the other abortion measures, perhaps reflective of the complexity of the issue.\n\n\nBar graph. Americans views on the legality of abortion. 29% of Americans say abortion should be legal under any circumstances. 50% say it should be legal under certain circumstances and 20% say it should be illegal under all circumstances.\n\nAbortion Views Differ by Politics and Demographics\nAs indicated by their preferred abortion label, Americans' views on abortion differ by a number of demographic and political factors, including gender, education, household income, ideology and party identification.\nThe political gaps in people's identification on abortion are most notable, with Republicans and Democrats being mirror images of each other: Seven in 10 Republicans identify as pro-life, while the same proportion of Democrats say they are pro-choice. An even wider gulf is seen between self-identified conservatives (77% pro-life) and liberals (78% pro-choice), with moderates tending toward the pro-choice position (55%).\nLarge differences are also seen by income and education, with the highest education and income groups being substantially more likely than others to be pro-choice. Smaller gaps are seen by gender and age, with women and younger adults being more pro-choice than their counterparts.\nThere are insufficient numbers of Black, Hispanic or Asian Americans in the sample to examine their views separately, but there is no significant difference in identification as pro-choice or pro-life between non-Hispanic white Americans and all other Americans.\n\n\nAmericans' Stance on the Abortion Issue in 2020, by Subgroup\nWith respect to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life?\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPro-choice\nPro-life\nMixed/Both/Neither\nNo opinion\n\n\n \n%\n%\n%\n%\n\n\n\n\nU.S. adults\n48\n46\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\nMen\n43\n51\n4\n2\n\n\nWomen\n53\n41\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n18-34\n53\n43\n2\n2\n\n\n35-54\n46\n46\n5\n3\n\n\n55+\n47\n47\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic white\n48\n46\n5\n1\n\n\nNonwhite\n50\n43\n2\n4\n\n\n\n\nCollege graduate\n62\n35\n2\n1\n\n\nNot college graduate\n41\n51\n5\n2\n\n\n\n\n$100,000+\n62\n35\n2\n0\n\n\n$40,000-$99,999\n46\n51\n2\n0\n\n\n<$40,000\n41\n49\n4\n6\n\n\n\n\nConservative\n19\n77\n2\n2\n\n\nModerate\n55\n38\n5\n2\n\n\nLiberal\n78\n17\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n29\n68\n3\n1\n\n\nIndependent\n47\n47\n4\n2\n\n\nDemocratic\n72\n24\n2\n2\n\n\n\n\nGallup, May 1-13, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\nUnlike other social attitudes in the U.S. -- such as on gay marriage, the legalization of marijuana and even polygamy -- Americans' views on the legality of abortion are not evolving but staying roughly where they have been for nearly a half-century. Americans' association with the \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" labels has shifted somewhat in that time, but preferences on this have been closely divided over the past decade. Given the extreme partisan gaps behind this division, abortion policy is going to continue to remain controversial at the state and federal levels, as well as face continued challenges in the courts.\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Methods\n\n\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted May 1-13, 2020, with a random sample of 1,028 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.\nEach sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 70% cellphone respondents and 30% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics Include:\n USA Abortion All Gallup Headlines Ethics and Morals Government Government and Politics Moral Issues Politics\n\n\n\n\nAccess Crucial Data for Your Research\nSearch, examine, compare and export nearly a century of primary data.\nLearn More about Access Crucial Data for Your Research\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\nPoliticsMay 20, 2020\nAmericans Remain More Liberal Socially Than Economically\nAmericans remain more likely to identify as social and economic conservatives or moderates than liberals.\n\n\n\n\nPoliticsJun 15, 2020\nU.S. National Pride Falls to Record Low\nAmerican pride has fallen to its lowest point in two decades of measurement by Gallup.
