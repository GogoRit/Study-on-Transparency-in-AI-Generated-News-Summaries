A few of them showed dismembered fetus body parts in comparison to a quarter.\u00a0\nThis was nearly a direct reflection of the demonstration that was held on Haley Concourse by CBR, which included a display that spanned between the Melton Student Center and Haley Center. On either side of the display, signs read, \u201cWARNING GENOCIDE PHOTOS AHEAD.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLarry Robinson | Photo Editor\n\nAuburn students and faculty walk past a Pro-Life demonstration on the Auburn University Haley Concourse on March 29, 2022.\n\n\nSeveral people said they were not prepared for the comparisons of abortion to various genocides throughout history \u2014 a depiction of a lynching, the Rwandan genocide, the Holocaust and the Battle of Wounded Knee. C. Fletcher Armstrong, Southeast region director for CBR, said they aren\u2019t trying to demonize women who\u2019ve had abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe're not saying that women who\u2019ve had abortions or people that support abortion are Nazis or racist or anything like that,\u201d Armstrong said.\u00a0\nBuried between pictures of genocides, dismembered baby parts and medical procedures was a poster defining misogyny. The poster below claimed \u201c'Transgendered' Biological Males are Destroying Women\u2019s Sports.\u201d\nAnd to the left, a poster proclaimed that \u201cABORTION SUPPRESSES THE BLACK VOTE.\"\nLincoln Brandenburg, who works for the Southeast regional office of CBR, said he thinks a lot of what they do, using \u201cshocking\u201d photos and messages, is based on Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d that was written to people on King\u2019s own side.\u00a0\n\u201cThey told him he needed to go about it in a way that was less in your face,\u201d Brandenburg said. \u201cThat was less controversial, but he pointed out that as long as people are comfortable with the injustice there was no incentive to end it. So his whole thing was causing discomfort and causing controversy and tension.\u201d\u00a0\nFor Brandenburg and the volunteers for CBR, this approach of intentionally causing discomfort was working \u2014 they were having conversations that they said were \u201cremarkably effective.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople can see [that] there\u2019s controversy, protesters with big signs, and whether they agree with this or not, they walk up and talk to us, and we have a conversation that I think is very productive,\u201d Brandenburg said.\u00a0\nWhile CBR called the demonstration a conversation starter, many students felt that the graphic images were not relevant to the group's cause.\u00a0\nChandler Ross, freshman in microbiology, was one of the many students who spoke to the volunteers during their demonstration.\u00a0\n\u201cYesterday I talked to him because I don't understand why they felt the need to start this conversation with this type of imagery,\u201d Ross said. \"Once you start a conversation like this people are more hostile and less likely to listen because you're giving all of this information out of your mouth, but behind you is a picture of a Black man being hanged that has nothing to do with what you\u2019re saying right now.\u201d\n\n\n Enjoy what you're reading?

I just don\u2019t want it on our campus.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the University\u2019s Expression and Demonstration Policy, students, employees and invited guests of student organizations may engage in demonstrations in certain sections of campus without prior notice or reservation, but to set up a display on the Haley Concourse, Students for Life had to reserve a space through Student Involvement.\nCBR reached out to the Auburn Students for Life group to share their Genocide Awareness Project on campus, said Omarr Peters, the Southern regional coordinator for Students for Life of America.\u00a0\n\u201cI do not think my students were fully in the know of what was going to happen or any of the images or of the organization,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI do think they were a little bit blindsided in that regard, and didn\u2019t have the time to fully research what this organization was.\u201d\u00a0\nPeters mentioned that the student groups are mostly independent of the national organization and can bring anyone in, as long as it\u2019s within the rights of the school, though he personally advised against bringing in CBR.\u00a0\nThough Peters attended the counter-protest on Toomer\u2019s on Tuesday, none of the students supporting CBR's display said they were attending on behalf of any on-campus organization.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m all for them coming on campus through the right methods and expressing their views,\u201d Persyn said. \u201cThey have a right to do that, everyone does, so it\u2019s just having this giant display. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to have it on our campus, permit or not.\u201d\u00a0\nStudents for Life went through the proper channels detailed in both the Expression and Demonstration Policy as well as the Campus Events Policy, said Kathryn Ruth-Sasser, manager of Student Center reservations, in an email sent to The Plainsman.\n\u201cFreedom of speech and diversity of ideas are at the foundation of higher education,\u201d Sasser wrote. \u201cAs such, all registered student organizations are allowed to reserve space on the concourse to promote their viewpoints, which are protected under the First Amendment.\u201d\u00a0\nDespite the demonstration following the steps to set up on the concourse, and not violating any rules, the images forced some students to adapt and change their daily routine.\nMaddie Wellbaum, senior in hospitality management and business, is a student recruiter who gives tours to interested high schoolers and their families. She was giving a tour while the displays were on campus and had to adjust her route after seeing the images.\n\u201dIt was a surprise to say the least,\u201d Wellbaum said. \u201cWe were unaware that the display would be in place on the concourse and have definitely taken actions to avoid the area during tours as to not make any potential students and their families uncomfortable and to not put our student recruiters in a position to receive questions that they don't have answers to.\u201d\nBailey Blake, an Involvement Ambassador in the Office of Student Involvement, said that as of now, there are no restrictions on the content of the displays that are set up on campus \u2014 they will be approved as long as they follow all of the guidelines for concourse banners, posters and flyers.\u00a0\n\nDo you like this story?
