The display included 1,000 pink flags that each represented 63,000 aborted fetuses worldwide.\u00a0Numerous flags were stolen during the days of the display.Through a campus approval process, SFL reserved Carnahan Quad, where they would set up the display for 48 hours from December 5 through December 7.\u201cTonight we set up our \u2018Cemetery of the Innocent\u2019 display right in the middle of Mizzou\u2019s campus for everyone to see. There are 1,000 flags - each represents 63,000 babies nation wide who lost their lives to abortion,\u201d the group posted to\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0The group also said \u201cThe flags and signs are private property. Vandalism will not be tolerated.\u201dYet, that declaration did not keep students from stealing flags from the display.\u00a0While tabling, members of SFL witnessed and recorded students stealing flags, expressing to them that their actions were illegal and asked them to stop.\u00a0[RELATED: \u2018Pro-life memorials vandalized at two California universities\u2019]When students continued, they were reported to the MUPD, Kaitlyn Banning, president of Mizzou Students for Life, told Campus Reform\u00a0is a private meeting.One individual reportedly stole almost 100 flags on her own until discovered by the MUPD. It is unknown whether any students faced disciplinary action or whether they were affiliated with any registered student organization. However, the university stated that they are currently investigating reports and also clarified in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that students don\u2019t have the right to remove or deface another organization\u2019s displays, as\u00a0stated\u00a0in the university\u2019s free speech policy.\u201cA lot of times, they wouldn\u2019t return the flags until I started to point out that the MUPD were showing up,\u201d said Banning.\u00a0The organization has faced other backlash as a result of the display and its pro-life beliefs.\u00a0Anonymous flyers around campus, which were obtained by Campus Reform, are petitioning to ban Mizzou Students for Life from campus, stating, \u201cThis club has been actively spewing factually inaccurate claims based in hatred.\u201d\u00a0Several members of the organization have also been the victims of death threats, which have been reported to campus police, according to Banning. \u00a0[RELATED: \u2018Christian college administrator calls pro-life students \u2018antagonizers\u2019\u2019]\u201cWe had a lot of people obviously say awful things that nobody should have to hear. It\u2019s a freedom of speech type thing. We reserved the places. We have every right to do it. We have every right to exist on campus,\u201d said Banning.The organization also gained attention of the university\u2019s meme page, which\u00a0shared\u00a0an informational post that critiques the men involved in the pro-life group.\u00a0\u201cWhite men are consistently in the room when choices are made over women\u2019s bodies,\u201d the post reads.\u00a0Banning clarified most members are female. She noted that refusing membership and leadership positions to men violates the discrimination clause in the club\u2019s constitution and the\u00a0university\u2019s equity policy.\u00a0Despite facing backlash, the organization also reported receiving an increase in donations from community supporters due to social media.\u00a0Apart from advocating for pro-life policies, the group assists a pregnancy center in Columbia through fundraising and volunteering.\u00a0But they are doing much more.This year, they\u2019ve been advocating for the university to provide more resources to pregnant students on campus, such as opening the university daycare to students in need.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it to where students that have children can get reduced if not free daycare during their class schedules so they don\u2019t have to choose between their baby or their education,\u201d Banning said.\u00a0Over winter break and next semester, they will be running a homeless initiative to raise money for supplies to distribute to the homeless population in Columbia.\u201cI\u2019ve been very blessed to have a great group and a lot of resources and people in the community reach out. We\u2019re going to make a difference,\u201d Banning concluded.Campus Reform contacted all parties mentioned.
