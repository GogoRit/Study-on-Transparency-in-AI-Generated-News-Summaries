They each potentially carry prison sentences of up to two years.\nThe incident in question took place on 25 October, the first Sunday after Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal issued a ruling that would ban almost all abortions in Poland. That day, some of those who taking part in protests against the ruling demonstrated inside churches.\nAmong them were Scheuring-Wielgus and her husband, Piotr Wielgus. During morning mass, they entered the church in Toru\u0144 where they had married 17 years earlier. Standing in front of the altar, they held up signs calling for women to have the right to decide on abortion, \u201cand not the state in support of Catholic ideology\u201d.\n\n\nKocham mojego m\u0119\u017ca bo zawsze mnie wspiera i zawsze stoi po stronie kobiet.

Scheuring-Wielgus (@JoankaSW) October 25, 2020\n\nYesterday, the prosecutor general, Zbigniew Ziobro \u2013 who also serves as justice minister \u2013 filed a request to the speaker of parliament for Scheuring-Wielgus\u2019s immunity to be waived, reports TVP Info.\nThe move came in response to a request from prosecutors in Toru\u0144, who received a number of notifications of crimes being committed by the MP and her husband. One of those complaints came from the city\u2019s Catholic curia itself, according to the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\nPriests and worshippers have reportedly testified that the behaviour of Scheuring-Wielgus and her husband prevented them from participating in the service.\n\n\nJe\u015bli chodzi o gro\u017aby odbierania immunitetu, to w zasadzie jestem weterank\u0105 i mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce przywyk\u0142am.

Scheuring-Wielgus (@JoankaSW) December 21, 2020\n\nScheuring-Wielgus says that she will fully address the accusations once she receives details from prosecutors. But today she tweeted that she is a \u201cveteran\u201d of attempts to strip her of immunity. \u201cMr Ziobro, if you wanted to intimidate me, sorry but you failed,\u201d wrote the MP.\nShe also received support from party colleague Robert Biedro\u0144. The MEP suggested that, if prosecutors want to investigate crimes in churches, they could find much \u201cworse deeds\u201d committed by those wearing \u201ccharacteristic costumes\u201d \u2013 a reference to recent revelations regarding sex abuse by priests.\n\n\nZbigniew Ziobro zabra\u0142 si\u0119 za przest\u0119pstwa w ko\u015bcio\u0142ach, ale zacz\u0105\u0142 od \u015bcigania @JoankaSW za przyniesienie plakatu.Ma\u0142a podpowied\u017a: w ko\u015bcio\u0142ach mo\u017cna spotka\u0107 grup\u0119, kt\u00f3ra du\u017co cz\u0119\u015bciej pope\u0142nia du\u017co gorsze uczynki. \u0141atwo ich rozpozna\u0107 po charakterystycznych strojach#MuremZaJSW pic.twitter.com/6dAqmVd8Bl\n\u2014 Robert Biedro\u0144 (@RobertBiedron) December 21, 2020\n\nOrganisers and participants in the abortion protests \u2013 which are the largest demonstrations in Poland\u2019s post-communist history \u2013 have faced a number of legal threats.\nShortly after the protests began, the national prosecutor\u2019s office instructed prosecutors to seek to bring charges against protest organisers for \u201ccausing an epidemiological threat\u201d during the pandemic, a crime that carries a sentence of up to eight years\u2019 imprisonment.\nLast month, prosecutors in Warsaw confirmed that they were investigating whether the organisers had endangered public health, insulted Catholics, and incited illegal actions.\n\nProsecutors investigate abortion protest leaders for insulting Catholics and endangering health\n\nMain image credit: Twitter/JoankaSW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel TillesDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0Notes from Poland.
