(Credit: Silvia Izquierdo/AP.)\nListenS\u00c3O PAULO \u2013A Brazilian pro-choice group has been forbidden to use \u201cCatholics\u201d in their name by the S\u00e3o Paulo State court.\nCatholics for the Right to Decide (CDD) was inspired by the U.S.-based Catholics for Choice,\n\nThe petition to remove the name \u201cCatholic\u201d from the group was made by the Conservative Catholic association Centro Dom Bosco, which argued that a pro-abortion group couldn\u2019t be called Catholic.\nJudge Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ferreira Alves stated in his decision on October 27 that the goals of the association \u201creveal incompatibility with the values adopted by the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\u201cBy advocating the right to decide for abortion, which the Church clearly and severely condemns, there\u2019s a clear distortion and incompatibility of the adopted name and the association\u2019s goals and concrete action, which directly violate moral and good customs, in addition to hurting the common good and the public interest,\u201d the judge said, according to a story published by the new website G1.\nThe judge ruled that CDD must change its statutes and legal name within 15 days, under penalty of fines of $175 a day.\nSince the court ruling, hundreds of non-governmental organizations, social movements, religious leaders and politicians have expressed solidarity with CDD, claiming that such a decision reinforced \u201cfundamentalism\u201d in Brazil and that the Judiciary shouldn\u2019t interfere with religious matters.\nIn an article published on the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, the Dominican priest Frei Betto, a leading figure in the Latin American Liberation Theology, asked if the Brazilian society \u201creturned to Inquisition.\u201d\n\u201cThe judicial ruling is wrongful. First of all, it\u2019s not up to the civil Judiciary to determine who can or who can\u2019t be considered Catholic. This would be the responsibility of the ecclesiastical institution, but it doesn\u2019t get to such a frontier. The canonical law admits that a Catholic be excluded from the Church for professing, for example, apostasy. Even so, nothing impedes that he keeps considering himself to be Catholic,\u201d Betto said.\nAccording to Pedro Affonseca, Centro Dom Bosco\u2019s president, the petition had been made in 2018, after CDD attended public hearings in the Brazilian Supreme Court during proceedings related to a project for the depenalization of abortion.\n\u201cWe realized that such association passed as a representant of a part of the Catholic followers, something that\u2019s simply false and inconsistent with the association\u2019s finality, which is the depenalization of a very serious sin such as abortion,\u201d he told Crux.\nAffonseca called the criticisms on Centro Dom Bosco\u2019s petition \u201cunfounded and ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cWe never intended to define what can be called \u2018Catholic\u2019 or not, but obviously, as Catholics, we obey the definition established by the Holy Catholic Church 2,000 years ago. Abortion Is defined by the Holy Catholic Church as a very serious sin against the Fifth Commandment of God\u2019s law, under penalty of excommunication,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA Catholic can\u2019t be favorable to the depenalization of abortion, under penalty of not being Catholic,\u201d he continued.\nAffonseca said that he hopes that Catholics from other countries, either individually or gathered in associations, petition against the use of \u201cCatholic\u201d in the name of the associations that are part of the CDD\u2019s network.\nRegina Jurkewicz, a member of CDD\u2019s institutional board, said the group is surprised by the judicial decision and intends to appeal it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lay state. It\u2019s not up to the state to decide such things,\u201d she told Crux.\nAccording to Jurkewicz, who holds a Ph.D in Religious Studies, \u201cbeing Catholic means being universal\u201d and there\u2019s a multiplicity of theologies and ideas in the Church.\n\u201cThere are Liberation theologies, black theologies, feminist theologies, and so on. Not even the Church has ever declared who\u2019s Catholic and who isn\u2019t in such a scenario. The right path is dialogue and not extinction,\u201d she said.\nJurkewicz admitted that the group advocates the women\u2019s access to legal abortion in Brazil.\n\u201cOnly a few hospitals perform legal abortions. It keeps being a big problem in the country,\u201d she said.\nCDD, she said, doesn\u2019t incentivize abortion. \u201cWe only want to secure the women\u2019s health. It\u2019s been proved that in countries which legalized abortion, its rates have fallen,\u201d she said.\nBishop Devair Ara\u00fajo da Fonseca, auxiliary in S\u00e3o Paulo and the archdiocese\u2019s episcopal vicar for communication, the bishops in Brazil had decided to be neutral in the dispute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a civil dispute between two civic associations. I don\u2019t think the Church should take any position in it,\u201d he told Crux.\nAccording to Da Fonseca, the Brazilian Church doesn\u2019t have ownership of the name \u201cCatholic\u201d in Brazil, something that could prevent this kind of problem.\n\u201cIn fact, I think there\u2019s an incongruency with an entity which defends abortion and the name \u2018Catholic\u2019. The Church is against abortion,\u201d he said.\nShareLatest Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Related Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Popular\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep Crux IndependentFor the cost of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can help keep the lights on at Crux.Support UsLast Week in the Church with John Allen Jr.Tuesdays onCrux.
