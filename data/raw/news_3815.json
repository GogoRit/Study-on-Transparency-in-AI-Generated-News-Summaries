I served as Chair of the Anthropology Department from 2010 to 2013. My training as a medical anthropologist combines a doctorate in socio-cultural anthropology with a master\u2019s degree in public health.\nMy research interests have lay principally at the intersection of gender, reproduction, and health. I have conducted field research in urban Colombia, rural Mexico, and with diverse ethnic groups in the U. S. In Cali, Colombia I investigated the circumstances that led pregnant women with unintended conceptions to seek illegal abortion. In rural Mexico, I sought to understand how local political relations shaped gender-based reproductive strategies. Since 1989, I have worked mainly in the U. S. on issues surrounding the medicalization of pregnancy and prenatal care, particularly the ways that prenatal genetic information may alter reproductive experience. My prize-winning collection, Reproduction, Globalization, and the State: New Theoretical and Ethnographic Perspectives (co-edited with Carolyn Sargent) was published in 2011 by Duke University Press.\nMy longstanding research into the social impact of decoding the human genome and the meanings and uses of genetic information led me to investigate the growing role of genetic testing in the field of neurology. Our monograph, Neurogenetic Diagnoses, the Power of Hope, and the Limits of Today\u2019s Medicine, co-authored with Mabel Preloran (2010, Routledge), explores the diverse meanings, and impacts of genetic diagnoses for patients enduring currently incurable and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative diseases \u2014 and for their family caregivers and clinicians. The analysis is framed by increasingly sharp social debates over the consequences of decoding the human genome \u2014 and the impact of genetic technology on our lives. Currently, with a team of neurogenetics experts and health services researchers,\nOther work has concerned how couples from Mexican backgrounds who are offered amniocentesis decide whether to undergo the procedure, how conflicts between a woman and man over whether to be tested are resolved, and the role genetic counselors play in couples\u2019 amniocentesis decisions. A follow-up study enabled me to deconstruct the strategies prenatal genetic service providers use to communicate information about prenatal genetic testing options to Latinas with limited education and/or English living in south Texas and southern California. Projects also have examined how Latino couples make decisions about condom use; the meanings associated with cervical cancer held by women and men living on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border; and the use of reproductive health services by homeless women in Los Angeles, a collaboration with professors from the UCLA Dental School to study motivations for volunteering on a medical mission to treat Mexican children born with cleft lip and palate; a project sponsored by the UCLA Departments of Medicine and Rheumatology on the real life contexts of lupus-associated \u201cflares\u201d among women of diverse ethnic and social class backgrounds living in Los Angeles; and the longitudinal processes that have contributed to rural Bali\u2019s dramatic fertility decline.\nCurrently, I am engaged in fieldwork with indigenous and nonindigenous Mexican rural women on identity and social transformation and in a collaboration with an economist and an epidemiologist on Mexican health and pension policy reform.\nMy work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Health Care Policy Research, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, private donors, and private foundations.\nI teach graduate seminars in Medical Anthropology; The Anthropology of the Human Body; The Politics of Reproduction; and Anthropological Perspectives on Genetics, Genetic Testing, and Genetic Knowledge, as well as courses in research design and methods to graduate and undergraduate students.\nMy professional service has included membership on the Scientific Advisory Committee for the State of California\u2019s Birth Defects Monitoring Program and on the Executive and Advisory Boards of several University of California institutes including UC-MEXUS, the Institute for American Cultures, the Institute for Development Studies, the International Institute, the Latin American Center, and the Center for the Study of Women.\nNationally, I have been elected to the Executive Boards of the American Anthropological Association, the Society for Applied Anthropology, the Society for Latin American Anthropology, and the Society for Medical Anthropology; I was President of the latter from 1995-97. I\u2019ve also served on the several journal editorial boards.\nI consult on projects on women\u2019s and Latino health in southern California, on the U.S.-Mexican border, in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.\n\n\n\nPublications\nBrowner, C.H. 1979.
