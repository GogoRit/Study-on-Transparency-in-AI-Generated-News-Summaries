telemedicine and online outreach and funding for a mobile-phone platform aimed at youth living in isolation and those who are out of school.\n\n\tA further $2 million will go to Ipas, another international body that works with governments to advocate for safe, legal abortion and to make contraception widely available.\n\n\tExperts who work in the field say the pandemic has heightened barriers that already existed for many women and girls when it comes to accessing safe abortion services, post-natal care and other reproductive health needs.\n\n\tLaura Neidhart of Action Canada for Sexual Health & Rights said the pandemic has made reproductive health care in Canada and abroad harder to get: supply chains for medication and birth control have been disrupted, clinics closed, and doctors more difficult to see.\n\n\t\"We've heard both on the ground here in Canada and also from organizations that are working in countries across the world that this is a pretty substantial problem,\" she said.\n\n\tThere are also a number of countries using the pandemic as a pretext to roll back abortion access, Neidhart said.\n\n\tMembers of a United Nations working group issued a statement last month expressing concern over some American states including Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Iowa, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee that \"appear to be manipulating the crisis\" to implement bans on different types of abortions during the pandemic.\n\n\tThis creates dangers, Neidhart said.\n\n\t\"Anywhere that we see attempts to roll back or reduce access to abortion care ... unsafe abortions become much more of a challenge and likelihood.\"\n\n\tShe applauded the Trudeau government for investing in reproductive health care and for highlighting the need to see this as a priority in the midst of a pandemic.\n\n\t\"It's really essential for feminist leadership from the Canadian government to make sure that people are able to access the care that they need,\" she said.\n\n\tDiana Sarosi, director of policy and campaigns for Oxfam Canada, said she too was heartened to see new money being committed to this effort.\n\n\tHowever she noted that $8.9 million \"seems like peanuts\" compared to the $1.4 billion pledged last year by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for international aid for women's health, half of which was dedicated to ensuring access to safe abortions and reproductive-health services worldwide.\n\n\tWhile this investment was lauded as \"historic\" for its size and focus, Sarosi said the money has yet to start rolling out.\n\n\t\"There has been little movement thus far in implementing those commitments, so right now it's not just about trying to sustain the services that were there before the pandemic, but also really building capacity of health systems to address a whole range of neglected areas, like contraceptive care, abortion services,\" she said.\n\n\t\"We're really hoping the government steps up in implementing that massive commitment for which they received a lot of accolades around the world. It's really time to implement that now.\"\n\n\tPart of the amount announced Tuesday -- $2 million -- will also go to the United Nations trust fund on violence against women to help combat gender-based violence internationally.\n\n\tGould said there has been a \"staggering\" increase in violence against women caused by COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 9, 2020.\n\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n \nview larger image\n\n\n\n\n \nDemocratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould responds to a question during a news conference in Ottawa, Monday, April 8, 2019.
