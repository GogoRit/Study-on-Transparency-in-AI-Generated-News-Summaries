But that hasn\u2019t stopped hospitals from cancelling them.THby Tim HumeNovember 19, 2020, 6:32pmShareTweetSnapA woman takes part in a protest in Warsaw in November. Photo: Maciej Luczniewski/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA nationwide protest movement has forced Poland\u2019s conservative government to back off from enacting a controversial court ruling that would introduce a near total ban on abortion.But Polish reproductive rights organisations say the judgment is already having a chilling effect regardless, resulting in hospitals attempting to cancel scheduled terminations, and a growing number of women heading to other countries for abortions.AdvertisementPolish abortion activist Kinga Jelinska, founder of the group Abortion Dream Team, told VICE World News that five women had contacted an abortion advice hotline she was affiliated with because hospitals had cancelled their terminations following the 22nd of October ruling, \u201cas simple as that.\u201dNews'There Is No Turning Back' \u2013 Polish Women Undeterred by Threat of Far-Right Violence Tim Hume, Nina Zabicka10.30.20\u201cWe can say it\u2019s definitely had a chilling effect,\u201d she said.Kamila Ferenc, lawyer for Poland\u2019s Federation for Women and Family Planning, said her organisation had received about 70 requests for assistance from women since the court ruling, including from women whose abortion providers had cancelled scheduled terminations.\u201cSome hospitals stopped performing legal abortions after the ruling, because they were afraid it is illegal,\u201d she said.\u201cWe approached the hospital directors \u2026 giving our legal opinion, and the abortions were performed eventually. But the system shouldn\u2019t work like that.\u201dLast month\u2019s ruling by Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal, that abortion in the case of severe foetal defects was unconstitutional, removed the most common of the few existing grounds for legal termination in the predominantly Catholic country, whose abortion laws are among the most restrictive in Europe.News'No More Compromise' \u2013 Pro-Choice Protesters in Poland Vow to Fight On Tim Hume11.02.20Rulings from the court take legal effect once the government publishes them in the Journal of Laws, typically a formality that occurs in the days immediately following a judgment.But this ruling \u2013 which would make abortion only legal in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother\u2019s health was at risk \u2013 sparked widespread outrage, drawing hundreds of thousands of Poles into the streets for sustained protests over the assault on women\u2019s rights.AdvertisementREAD: \u2018No more compromise\u2019: Pro-choice protesters in Poland vow to fight onNearly a month on, Polish officials have not published the ruling, creating confusion both for patients and abortion providers over the legality of foetal defect abortions, which accounted for about 98 percent of legal abortions in Poland last year.\u201cIt\u2019s a very unclear situation because of the non-publication of the law,\u201d said Jelinska, \u201cThere are multiple levels of legal confusion.\u201dJelinska said a growing number of women were seeking to have abortions abroad due to their questions over the legality of the procedure following the ruling.Abortion Without Borders, an abortion support network she is affiliated with, has helped 44 Polish women travel abroad to cities like Berlin, Amsterdam or London for terminations since the ruling, a rate of almost two a day. Previously, there was one such case roughly every day and a half.NewsPolish Embassy Backing Grassroots Campaign to Glorify Anti-Semite Buried in LondonTim Hume11.18.20She said the hotline had been deluged with calls as a consequence of the ruling and the nationwide protests it had inspired, which had dramatically lifted public awareness of the service. It has been getting between 200 to 300 calls a day since the judgment, compared to about 300 a month beforehand.READ: \u2018There is no turning back\u2019: Polish women protesters undeterred by threat of far-right violence\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t see any protest across Poland without someone having prepared a poster with the hotline\u2019s number. It\u2019s sprayed on walls, shared on social media, chanted at demonstrations,\u201d she said.Advertisement\u201cAs a side effect lots of people got to know how to get a safe abortion in Poland, even though it\u2019s not formally supported by the health system.\u201dPoland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws mean that only about 1,000 legal abortions were carried out last year, nearly all of them due to severe foetal defects. According to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, the country has one of the biggest underground abortion networks in Europe, with an estimated 120,000-150,000 illegal terminations each year, either through self-administered pills or surgical procedures. Many women also travel to European countries for abortions.NewsPoland's Capital Erupts As Far-Right Take Over Streets For Annual Hate-FestTim Hume11.11.20For Ferenc, from Poland\u2019s Federation for Women and Family Planning, the current legal situation is clear, although she said some hospitals still needed convincing of that.\u201cThe ruling hasn\u2019t been published, which means it hasn\u2019t come into force,\u201d she said. \u201cThe legal situation around abortion in Poland hasn\u2019t changed, and until the ruling is published, legal abortions should be performed.\u201dREAD: Polish far-right forming \u201cnational guard\u201d to protect churches during abortion protests\u00a0She said that could change at any time, if the government decided to enact the ruling, but she was optimistic that the fierce opposition to the ban would persuade the government to back off for good.\u201cThey\u2019re not sure about what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have protests in the street and know about society\u2019s anger. For now, they have taken a step back.\u201d  Tagged:worldnewsabortionreproductive rightswomen's rightsGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
