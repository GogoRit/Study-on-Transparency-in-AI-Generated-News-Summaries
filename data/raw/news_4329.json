These needs are often overlooked with potentially life-threatening consequences.\nOver 500 women die in pregnancy or childbirth every day in humanitarian and fragile settings.\u00a0It is therefore essential to provide lifesaving SRH\u00a0services as morbidity and mortality related to\u00a0SRH\u00a0is a significant global public health issue and those in humanitarian and fragile settings often face heightened risks and additional barriers to\u00a0SRH\u00a0services. The timely provision of\u00a0SRH\u00a0services can prevent death, disease, and disability related to unintended pregnancy, obstetric complications, sexual and other forms of gender-based violence, HIV infection, and a range of reproductive disorders.\n\u00a0\nThe MISP is developed by the Inter-Agency Working Group for Reproductive Health in Crisis (IAWG). UNFPA, in partnership with stakeholders, supports the implementation of the MISP to make sure that all affected populations have access to lifesaving SRH services. The key aims of the implementation are that there is no unmet need for family planning, no preventable maternal deaths and no gender-based violence (GBV) or harmful practices, even during humanitarian crises.\nThe six objectives of the MISP1. Ensure the Health Sector/Cluster identifies an organization to lead implementation of the MISP.\u00a02. Prevent sexual violence and respond to the needs of survivors.\u00a03. Prevent the transmission of and reduce morbidity and mortality due to HIV and other STIs.\u00a04. Prevent excess maternal and newborn\u00a0morbidity and mortality.\u00a05. Prevent unintended\u00a0pregnancies.\u00a06. Plan for comprehensive SRH services, integrated into primary health care as soon as possible. Work with the Health Sector/Cluster partners to address the six health system building blocks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is the MISP and what is UNFPA\u2019s role?\u00a0\n\nMISP is a set of minimum lifesaving SRH interventions. However, \u2018minimum does not mean \u2019only\u2019 \u2013 if the context makes it possible to provide more SRH services, then this should be done.\n\n\nImplementing the MISP is not optional or negotiable, it is an international standard of care that should be implemented at the onset of every emergency. It is one of the Sphere standards, and it is aligned with the lifesaving criteria of the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).\u00a0\n\n\nThe MISP was developed based on well-documented evidence of RH needs in humanitarian settings and can therefore be implemented without initial needs assessments.\n\n\nThe MISP can be broken down into three main areas:\u00a0\n\n\nCoordination with national stakeholders (objective 1), which is a core component of UNFPA\u2019s work with partners during emergencies that enable the service objectives.\u00a0\n\n\nFour clinical services (objectives 2-5), which are the minimum medical service components of the MISP, and\n\n\nTransitioning to comprehensive SRH (CSRH) services (objective 6). As soon as the situation permits, UNFPA, together with national partners and stakeholders, coordinates and supports the transition from MISP to quality CSRH care under the framework of health system strengthening (HSS) and its building blocks. This support is context-specific and builds on the lessons learnt from implementing the MISP during the emergency response.\u00a0\n\n\nUNFPA strives to ensure that MISP activities and additional SRH services are included in all phases of the humanitarian programme cycle.\n\nMinimum\u00a0 \u00a0Limited to core SRH servicesInitial\u00a0 \u00a0To be used in an emergency without the need of prior assessmentServices\u00a0 \u00a0Services to be delivered to the affected populationPackage\u00a0 \u00a0Supplies such as RH kits and other SRH activities, coordination and planning\n\u00a0\nRelated important resources\n\nIAWG website\u00a0\n\n\nThe Inter-Agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings (IAFM)\n\n\nThe MISP Readiness Assessment Tool\u00a0\n\n\nThe MISP Cheat Sheet (available in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish)\n\n\nThe MISP Calculator\n\n\nThe Checklist for Monitoring Implementation of the MISP\n\n\nMISP Online Distance Learning Module\n\n\nThe Interagency Emergency Reproductive Health (IARH) Kit Manual (currently being updated)\u00a0\n\n\nCERF website\n\n\nSphere website\u00a0\n\n\nThe Multi-Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA) Framework\n\n\nThe Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO)\n\n\nHumanitarian Response Plan (HRP) Guidance and Templates\n\n\nWHO Health Systems Strengthening website\u00a0\n\n\nWHO and UNFPA document on\u00a0 SRH during protracted crises and recovery\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nA displaced girl in Syria finds safety and support\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories\n\nA quest for safety and dignity in Rafah\u2019s tent cities\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nWomen and girls in Gaza use torn pieces of cloth in place of sanitary pads\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
