The rest are reassured.\nIn a green yard ringed by banana trees, on a breezy September afternoon in New Orleans, Louisiana, the women introduce themselves using code names. They\u2019ve left their phones at home so they can\u2019t be recorded or tracked.\nThis is a clandestine abortion provision group, formed in the wake of Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban to support those who still, inevitably, need abortion care. The fact of the group\u2019s existence was spread by word of mouth, over secure messaging platforms and mentioned to female friends in low voices over drinks. Now, group members sit in a circle around a small wooden table that holds snacks and seltzer water, talking strategy.\n\u201cI bet there are tonnes of groups. I\u2019d love to find them,\u201d says Carina*.\nThe women, who come from a range of professional backgrounds, are all under 40. They discuss an upcoming virtual training with Paula Rivera*, an organiser from Honduras. A couple of the women, children of Central American immigrants, are fluent Spanish speakers, and they volunteer to translate the training so the English speakers can follow along. Rivera will discuss protocols for delivering safe medication abortions according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards, as well as physical and digital security measures.\nThey set a plan for where to do the training and agree to use a secure video platform, Jitsi. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d shrugs Ana.\nThe app is the first tool they pick up from Central American organisers, who have been fighting abortion restrictions for years in their own countries. The knowledge and tactics of these organisers, with their decades of experience, are proving invaluable to those in Louisiana who are fresh to the fight.\nFighting back\nOn June 24, 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that enshrined the right to abortion care. Abortion bans are now in place in a dozen states across the US, including Louisiana and every state bordering it. Abortion is illegal in Louisiana, with no exceptions for rape or incest. All abortion clinics in the state have closed.\nWhile abortion is theoretically permitted for nonviable pregnancies, in practice, terminations on these grounds have already been denied to multiple women.\nWhile the statute criminalising abortion exempts pregnant women from prosecution, legal experts say this does not offer meaningful protection from determined prosecutors. Those who assist a termination, such as the backyard activists or healthcare providers, risk up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Undocumented women suspected of facilitating an abortion risk both criminalisation and deportation. Lawyers with If/When/How, a network of legal professionals supporting reproductive justice, warn of a worst-case scenario in which people facilitating abortion in Louisiana could now technically be charged with the homicide of someone under 12 \u2013 a crime that carries the death penalty in Louisiana.\nAccording to their research on criminalised abortions since 2000, published last August, even in states where laws didn\u2019t specifically criminalise abortion, some women have still been charged under statutes related to the mishandling of human remains or practising medicine without a licence.\nIn the ban\u2019s aftermath, activists are fighting back. As some advocate for change by challenging the law, others have already begun to form whisper networks, scrambling to organise abortion access. A child welfare worker, who asked not to be named, said advocates in Louisiana are helping minors, pregnant from rape, travel elsewhere for abortions. Non-profits are organising abortion access for Louisianans by post, boat, and even private plane.\nAnd in New Orleans, women are drawing from the tactics of organisers like Rivera in Honduras, one of the most abortion-hostile places on the continent, where abortion has been outlawed since 1982. That is in part because New Orleans is home to the largest Honduran-American community in the US, a legacy of successive waves of immigration \u2013 most recently following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, when an estimated 100,000 Hispanics came to rebuild the stricken city. Abortion is illegal in Honduras, without exceptions, even if there is a threat to the woman\u2019s life.\nWomen\u2019s struggle to circumvent the ban in Honduras, delivering abortion medication and guidance around safe abortion care, offers a model for the American women now organising under the shadow of the law.\nProtesters in New Orleans on June 24, 2022 took to the streets following the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to rescind federal protection for the right to abortion access [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]\n\u2018So taboo\u2019\nThe day that Roe v Wade was overturned, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in New Orleans, marching through downtown.\nNear the front of the crowd walked 29-year-old Edith Romero, a reproductive healthcare advocate who advises undocumented people and Spanish speakers on abortion and contraception. Romero came to New Orleans from Honduras about 10 years ago. As the sun set, she stood in front of the crowd on the steps of City Hall, carrying a cardboard sign reading \u201cEl aborto es un derecho humano\u201d (\u201cAbortion is a human right\u201d), and took the microphone.\n\u201cMy name is Edith Romero, I\u2019m from Honduras, and I received an abortion last December,\u201d she told the crowd to cheers of support.\nRomero was there as part of Uni\u00f3n Migrante, an organisation for immigrants that works particularly with undocumented people in the New Orleans area by assisting with legal and economic support, reproductive healthcare, and rights education.\nSoon after, Romero joined up with the newly-founded Louisiana Abortion Rights Action Committee (LARAC), which aims to build a mass movement to re-legalise abortion. She says she\u2019s drawing from the work of Central American organisers such as those in Mexico who, after years of mass protests and civil disobedience, saw abortion decriminalised in 2021. \u201cIt was a lot of people in the streets demanding change and being loud and bold. And the government had to respond to that,\u201d she says.\nRomero is also doing outreach in the Latina community. She has found that Honduras\u2019s long-standing ban has contributed to stigma around abortion within Louisiana\u2019s Honduran-American community, which means outreach can be a challenge. \u201cIn the Latina community, abortion is so taboo,\u201d she says.\nThe need for clandestine abortions due to stigma within the Hispanic community was something Cristi Fajardo, 44, founder of El Pueblo NOLA, a grassroots organisation run out of her home, was familiar with before the ban came into place.\nFajardo\u2019s organisation helps Hispanics in New Orleans navigate legal, immigration, and medical crises. \u201cWe are the 911 of our community,\u201d she says, referring to her being the first person women often turn to in an emergency.\nAn imposing woman with red braids, she reports with pride that several neighbourhood husbands are afraid of her. Fajardo originally hails from Brazil, where abortion is also a crime, though most of the people she helps are Honduran. These days, to better support her Honduran neighbours, Fajardo is learning Garifuna, an Indigenous language of Honduras.\nFajardo says more than a dozen women have asked for help accessing abortion since she founded El Pueblo NOLA in 2018. \u201cSome just recently had babies and don\u2019t want to have another,\u201d she says. Others were victims of rape or incest.\nCristi Fajardo, founder of Pueblo NOLA, a grassroots NGO and the \u2018911\u2019 of the Hispanic community that helped women access abortions before the ban came into effect [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]\nVulnerable and undocumented\nFajardo\u2019s neighbourhood is 98 percent people of colour, and 22 percent live in poverty, meaning women there are made particularly vulnerable by the ban. She has already seen what it means for some community members.\nIn one case, Beverly, a Honduran mother in Fajardo\u2019s community who was barely 20 and financially stressed, discovered that she\u2019d become pregnant by her cousin. Beverly, who only wanted to give her first name, already had a chronically ill infant to care for, and now feared she would be left homeless. She approached Fajardo about terminating her pregnancy and Fajardo helped her make an appointment at the New Orleans clinic. Before Beverly could have the procedure, abortion was criminalised. Facing homelessness, Beverly moved to New York, where she says she is receiving more substantial state support. Beverly ultimately gave up on seeking abortion care. The child she carried in New Orleans was born in New York in January.\nRomero is in frequent contact with undocumented and low-income women, who face higher barriers to healthcare access. Reproductive healthcare access \u201cwas already pretty horrible, especially for people of colour and undocumented immigrants. And now there\u2019s no options\u201d for legal abortions in Louisiana, explains Romero, a slight woman with a determined set to her jaw.\nAbortion care, like healthcare generally, was hard for undocumented people to access before the ban due to costs, language and transportation barriers, and other restrictions. For instance, Louisiana, like most US states, does not allow undocumented people to have driving licences, meaning that using a car carries the risk of arrest and deportation. A lack of health insurance, finances, and discrimination compound the difficulties of accessing help. This increases the health risks women may face, according to Romero.\n\u201cIf somebody has a self-induced abortion and complications, they\u2019re going to be scared of going to the emergency room,\u201d she says.\nRomero was in part drawn to the reproductive health movement because when she was younger, in Honduras, she saw firsthand what a lack of choice and sexual education meant for women\u2019s health and safety. \u201cComing from Honduras, you don\u2019t get sex education,\u201d she explains. \u201cI definitely saw a lot of teenage pregnancies in Honduras. Very, very high [rates], and of cervical cancer as well.\u201d\nCervical cancer, whose incidence can be reduced via education and screening, is the leading cause of cancer deaths among Honduran women.\nBut Romero believes there is a lot to glean \u201cfrom the [abortion organising] efforts that are going on in Honduras, which is an even more hostile environment for organising\u201d than Louisiana.\nEdith Romero, a reproductive healthcare advocate, immigrated to New Orleans from Honduras about 10 years ago [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]\nLearning from a veteran activist\nOn an October afternoon, the backyard crew arrange themselves on couches and on the floor, phones absent, to hear Rivera give the training for delivering clandestine abortion care based on strategies developed over decades.\nThe 60-year-old veteran women\u2019s rights activist is speaking over video from her home in Honduras, occasionally cracking jokes from behind large glasses that soften her eyes.\n\u201cWhat we are doing is politically charged,\u201d she begins, pausing so Ana can translate from Spanish. \u201cBut it is absolutely legitimate. Men may make the laws, but we know what we need.\u201d\nShe sits down, lights a cigarette, and launches into the training. It\u2019s thorough and lasts for three hours. She begins by going over the WHO\u2019s definitions of pregnancy, early-term and late-term abortion. Then she reviews the history of the two medications used for abortion \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 how they work, and how to use them effectively.\n\u201cMifepristone is not available in Honduras,\u201d Rivera says. When possible, activists acquire it from Mexico, where it is legal. \u201cMexico is the salvation of Central American countries,\u201d Rivera adds before sharing contact information for her own sources in Mexico who can help secure low-cost, legitimate abortion pills. Carina writes them down on a slip of paper.\nThe women in the room say that they, too, have an easier time acquiring misoprostol.\n\u201cBien (good),\u201d says Rivera, \u201cThen let\u2019s talk about how to administer an abortion with misoprostol alone.\u201d\nThen they cover patient care, contraindications, side effects and follow-up. Next, it\u2019s security protocol: use secure messaging platforms, burner phones, code names and coded language. Ask the patient if they\u2019ve told anyone else they\u2019re getting an abortion, Rivera says, and if they did, come up with a cover story together to explain the pregnancy loss.\nRivera suggests transporting the abortion medication to patients discretely in a Pringles can: \u201cFirst the chips,\u201d she says, miming the actions while smiling over video, \u201cThen the medication, and then the chips.\u201d\nRivera says she herself learned much of this from organisers in Costa Rica, where abortion is allowed only if the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Before she hangs up, the dozen women squeeze together on the floor in front of the web camera and wave, grinning, with a chorus of \u201cThank you!\u201d and \u201cGracias!\u201d as Rivera, smiling, waves back.\nA palpable contentment fills the room. The women make plans for the next meeting, then file out, chatting animatedly. Outside, after a month of drought, sorely-needed rain is beginning to fall.\nAbortion organisers in Honduras helped organisers in New Orleans purchase safe, affordable abortion medication from Mexico [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]\nWhat a lack of choice means\nRivera knows that the fight for reproductive rights comes with risks. She and her Honduran colleagues have been defamed and threatened by hardline religious groups because of their work. Her office has been searched by state authorities, and religious anti-choice groups have tried to infiltrate her network. Lately, her official work focuses on legal advocacy, fighting the ban\u2019s constitutionality in Honduras\u2019 Supreme Court.\nHer work providing abortion care is \u201cconstitutionally prohibited \u2026 it implicates me in a crime \u2026 it could lead to many years in prison,\u201d she explains. This is why she is careful to take precautions.\nDespite the risks, Rivera and others in Honduras press on because they are keenly aware of how the lack of choice touches all aspects of women\u2019s rights.\n\u201cForced maternity has huge consequences long term, physically, but also economically and socially,\u201d says Rivera, speaking to Al Jazeera over video one afternoon. \u201cIt affects their lives as well as the lives of the children born, who might not be welcomed, and who might never experience security in their lives.\u201d\nIn places where abortion remains illegal, women can lose access to education and career prospects due to forced pregnancy. Most sexually active 15- to 19-year-olds in Honduras said in a national survey that they did not want to have a child in the next two years; half of them will likely give birth by age 20. \u201cThis is a really brutal and terrible life change for many of them,\u201d says Rivera.\nCriminalising abortions can push people to seek unsafe options.\nNeesa Medina, 35, a campaigner with Somos Muchas, a Honduran umbrella organisation of several reproductive justice groups, says dangerous practices happen particularly in rural areas with less access to information and medication. \u201cWhat we are seeing is people who are doing very harmful practices, like throwing themselves from trees to have an abortion,\u201d she says.\nOthers \u201cput sharp objects [inside themselves]\u201d \u2013 which can lead to infections or more serious complications \u2013 or drink unsafe concoctions containing herbs and clay. They do this out of desperation, Medina says, despite the risks both physical and legal. Honduran law imposes jail sentences of up to six years for those who facilitate an abortion. According to an investigation by Somos Muchas, 47 women faced criminal charges\u00a0for abortion in Honduras from 2006 to 2018.\nHonduras offers a portrait of the structural consequences of forced pregnancy, says Medina, who notes that opportunities there are limited and that women\u2019s financial independence and safety are threatened. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that countries where you have total bans on abortion are countries where you have higher rates of sexual violence,\u201d she says.\nAbortion restriction \u201ccreates a social fabric that is so thin for the dreams of liberty of women and girls\u201d, Medina says.\nIn the wake of Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban, people are fighting back in different ways to help those who still, inevitably, need abortion care [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]\n\u2018We still find ways\u2019\nMany Honduran women, who may not know about abortion networks, are forced to turn to the unregulated supply of medication on the black market. Sellers, typically found on social media, are motivated by money \u2013 not women\u2019s health, say activists.\nSellers \u201cdon\u2019t do the math correctly to calculate how many weeks they [the women] are pregnant. Because they are looking at it as a transaction, not a [medical] service,\u201d says Rivera.\nMisoprostol, which is also prescribed to treat ulcers, costs about $6 legally. But \u201cthe people who are trying to make money off of this will sell the misoprostol for $60 a pill,\u201d Rivera says. The WHO \u201cdesignates that someone should take a round of 12 pills. And they\u2019ll sell just one to someone.\u201d\nThis can result in unsuccessful terminations, she says. Sometimes, women will believe they\u2019ve had a successful abortion only to discover, weeks or months later, that they\u2019re still pregnant. \u201cIt can lead to really dangerous situations.\u201d An incomplete abortion can lead to haemorrhage, infection, and sepsis.\nStill, clandestine doesn\u2019t have to mean unsafe, activists say.\nWell-managed clandestine support groups in Honduras, Rivera explains, provide legitimate and sufficient doses of misoprostol and mifepristone \u2013 and ensure women are informed and supported, so they don\u2019t resort to riskier approaches or self-harm.\nRivera says her group does not administer abortions that require clinical settings, such as vacuum aspiration abortions. But with the medication, they can assist patients who are up to 19 weeks pregnant.\nWhen Romero received abortion care in 2021, she wound up translating for a Honduran woman in her mid-40s, who explained that she had self-administered an abortion the previous year, back in Honduras, with misoprostol from the black market. \u201cIt caused her complications,\u201d Romero says. \u201cShe told me she\u2019d had to go to the ER.\u201d\nMedina believes that the formation of covert abortion provision circles like the one in the Louisiana backyard is both inevitable and necessary.\n\u201cEven within very, very restrictive environments like ours, we still find ways\u201d to exercise the right to choose, she says, referring to underground networks in Honduras. \u201cEveryone in the [United] States that are seeing their rights being cut back: people there will find a way, too.\u201d\nAn abortion access organiser in Louisiana holds up a packet of misoprostol obtained via Mexico [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]\nGetting the protocol down\nA month after Rivera delivered the training, the backyard crew meets again, at a different home \u2013 never the same meeting place twice \u2013 to go over what they have learned.\nOutside, rain is hammering the papaya trees, but it\u2019s cozy indoors. The women have brought each other food \u2013 black-eyed peas and sweet potato fries \u2013 and once they\u2019ve settled in, they start to outline a health and security protocol based on Rivera\u2019s guidance, writing in black marker on the back of a paper grocery bag.\nSince they\u2019re anxious about putting any information online, it\u2019s all handwritten or passed along orally. Repeating it over and over, they agree, helps them to remember.\nAna reads through her own takeaways from Rivera\u2019s training. \u201cThe first thing to say,\u201d she reminds the others, \u201cis to tell the patient that this is very safe. You\u2019re not going to die. You\u2019re not going to be left infertile.\u201d\nCypress* writes it on the paper bag, which the women will later finalise into a protocol. Rivera also told the backyard crew that her group uses a small, portable ultrasound with patients. These are used to check for ectopic pregnancies \u2013 a potentially life-threatening condition where the fertilised egg implants outside the uterus \u2013 but also as a safeguard against anti-abortion rights activists trying to infiltrate the network by posing as some who needs care. During the training, Rivera had warned the Louisiana women that such people sometimes send fake ultrasound photos, pretending to be pregnant, in order to get incriminating evidence on Rivera and her colleagues.\nIt was a risk the Louisiana women hadn\u2019t thought of. They discuss whether an ultrasound is in the group\u2019s budget. Ana writes a note to herself: Ask Paula what type of ultrasound they use. Then she turns to Maria*, one of the group\u2019s native Spanish speakers, and asks if she\u2019ll help her to translate messages with one of Rivera\u2019s Mexican contacts.\nAs they finalise protocols, they exchange notes about recent deliveries. Ana, who provided abortion pills to a 17-year-old over the summer, noted she should have better disguised the medication rather than leaving it in its original packaging. Jennifer*, who recently provided pills to a teacher from western Louisiana, discussed the difficulty of providing care instructions when meeting in a public place.\nThese unforeseen difficulties, the women agree, are why they need firm protocols and an intake process for patients who approach them. As Rivera explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just be a feminist. You also have to be a very responsible person, because we\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\u2018We have to keep fighting\u2019\n\u201cWhen the [Roe v Wade] ruling came through, I felt helpless,\u201d says Jennifer, at a cafe sidewalk table in New Orleans shortly after Rivera\u2019s training. \u201cI was \u2013 and still am \u2013 very angry. So it felt really good to just be like, \u2018F*** all of this. I\u2019m doing something.\u2019\u201d\nJennifer says she appreciated how clear and careful Rivera was in her training. \u201cThat gave me great comfort. This person has been doing it for so long.\u201d\nJennifer was also fortified seeing Rivera\u2019s approach, which she described as \u201cDIY\u201d (do it yourself). \u201cThe sense I got from her is that she was similar to me. Just a person who was like, \u2018F*** this. I\u2019m going to do, going to learn, whatever it takes\u201d to ensure people have access to abortions. That perspective \u201cmade me feel stronger,\u201d Jennifer says.\nRivera, for her part, is gratified to see women in the US take up the mantle. \u201cWe have to keep fighting,\u201d she says at the end of a video interview, stubbing out a cigarette. \u201cThose of us that were born with that right, we have to make sure we get it again.\u201d\nMedina has lived her whole life in Honduras without legal abortion, but says, \u201cI speak to you from a place of hope.\u201d She is strengthened by the work going on around her. \u201cNetworks save us. Feminists around the world save us. Women around us save us.\u201d\nA representative of Lift Louisiana, a reproductive justice non-profit, said they do not expect abortion to be decriminalised in Louisiana barring action at the federal level. Louisianans can expect abortion to be illegal for years.\nSpeaking to Rivera, Jennifer felt her years of experience \u201ccoming through\u201d.\n\u201cIt made me realise, in a deep sense: this is not going away. This is going to take a long time,\u201d Jennifer explains. Still, she is optimistic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the very beginning of something,\u201d she says, \u201cand we can really make it work.\u201d\n*Name has been changed at the interviewee\u2019s request.\nReporting for this story was supported by the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation\u2019s Reproductive Rights Reporting Fund.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
