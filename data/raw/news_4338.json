Soon known as Our Bodies, Ourselves, the book was a touchstone for generations of women. It was in print through 2011 and continues to live online today.\n\nThanks to Suffolk\u2019s Center for Women\u2019s Health & Human Rights, the pivotal text will come alive again as Our Bodies, Ourselves Today, updated online for modern readers at ourbodiesourselvestoday.org.\n\n\u201cThere are so many reasons to get excited about this online platform. Women are still in dire need of information of the kind that Our Bodies, Ourselves provides\u2014evidence and reality-based information that treats women as whole beings,\u201d says center director Amy Agigian, who\noversees the initiative.\n\nThe site initially will spotlight key topics including contraception, abortion, mental health, and heart health.\n\n\u00a0Suffolk has deep connections with Our Bodies, Ourselves cofounder Paula Doress-Worters, a Class of 1962 Suffolk alumna, and cofounder and Board Chair Judy Norsigian, who taught a Suffolk course called Women\u2019s Health Advocacy for several years.\n\nThe online information\u2014articles, videos, podcasts, first-person stories, and more\u2014will be curated and vetted by expert panels. Panelists will include specialists ranging from policymakers\nto physicians to everyday women from all walks of life.\n\n\u201cThis is extremely ambitious; we want to be the go-to for all sorts of women\u2019s health issues,\u201d Agigian says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT US\n[email\u00a0protected]\n        Suffolk University Office of Public Affairs\n        73 Tremont St., Boston, MA 02108-2770\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nSuffolk in the Media\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nThe Public Affairs Office\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nNews\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nSuffolk A-Z\n\n\nStaff Directory\n\n\nWork at Suffolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer\n\n\nNotice of Non-Discrimination\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nTitle IX\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind It Fast\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nWebAdvisor\n\n\nSelf Service\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\nLibraries & Archives\n\n\nEmployee Intranet\n\n\nBookstore\n\n\nCampus Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Public Affairs\n\n\n617-573-8447\n73 Tremont Street\nBoston, MA 02108\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Suffolk\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Suffolk University.\nAll rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
