(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\n\n\n\n\n\nNevada\u2019s top Republican candidates, some endorsed by national anti-abortion rights forces, are eschewing a chance to potentially slash the 24-week limit on terminating pregnancies in Nevada by nine weeks, a position that could confound pro-abortion rights voters energized by the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\u201cI think it will harm anyone that wants to get pro-life votes,\u201d says anti-abortion rights activist Janine Hansen, an Independent American who says she\u2019d personally prefer state to federal action. She says some pro-abortion rights voters would rather stay home than cast a ballot for a candidate who waffles on abortion. \u201cFor a lot of people, that is the issue.\u201d\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s proposed federal ban of abortion after 15 weeks, introduced earlier this month, is dividing Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail.\nCampaign publicist Lisa Mayo DeRiso, who primarily represents Republicans, says candidates who reject the 15-week national ban \u201care very smart. Republicans want limited government. We don\u2019t want a big federal ban. We want state law to take precedence. They are appealing to Libertarian, nonpartisan, and Independent voters. Those are \u2018limited government\u2019 activists.\u201d\nThe right to choose an abortion has been settled law in Nevada for 30 years, rendering the issue little more than a sideshow in most elections. But it\u2019s never retreated from the political stage.\nIt has been weaponized by opponents and used as a litmus test to gain support, but its codification 30 years ago permitted the state\u2019s pro-abortion rights majority to set the issue aside and elect pro-abortion rights Democratic Gov. Bob Miller and anti-abortion rights U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, also a Democrat.\nIn the same vein, former Gov. Brian Sandoval was at ease as a pro-abortion rights Republican.\nBut as so-called \u2018personhood\u2019 initiatives and other anti-abortion rights efforts emerged, voters became more attuned to abortion politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a canard. You and I both know there are not the votes in the House and there are not the votes in the Senate. And there isn\u2019t a president that is going to do anything but veto a ban.\n\n\n\u2013 Melissa Clement, executive director, Nevada Right to Life\n\n\nIn 2005, a sloppy answer from Democratic gubernatorial primary candidate Jim Gibson on Face to Face with Jon Ralston, a cable TV program in Las Vegas, about what he would do if Roe v. Wade were overturned, was publicized throughout the state and may have cost Gibson, a Mormon, the primary to Dina Titus the following year. Gibson is currently chair of the Clark County Commission.\nNow, with the Supreme Court\u2019s disposal of nearly a half a century of federal precedent and a surfeit of anti-abortion rights initiatives floating at state and national levels, the issue has the spotlight.\n\u201cThat is an issue that doesn\u2019t need to be in politics,\u201d Republican gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo told reporters earlier this month, when asked about the ban.\nLombardo said he will fight the ban and uphold Nevada law permitting abortion until 24 weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s the vote of the people within the state of Nevada, and I will support that.\u201d\nLombardo, who leads Sisolak by 1.5 percentage points, according to polling from Real Clear Politics, is not the only Republican candidate seeking cover under the \u201csettled law\u201d umbrella. He is joined by U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt, who is in a tight battle with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\nNevada\u2019s Hispanic voters, many of whom are conservative, could decide the Senate race.\u00a0 Cortez Masto, a Latina, surrounded herself with Hispanic women at a news conference just after the Supreme Court repealed Roe.\nLaxalt, who referred to the nearly 50 years of abortion precedent under Roe v Wade as \u201ca joke,\u201d has refused to directly answer questions about the proposed federal ban.\nLombardo and Laxalt are endorsed by the National Right To Life Committee, which supported Graham\u2019s ban and appeared at the news conference announcing it.\nNRLC\u2019s president Carol Tobias commended Graham \u201c\u2026 on behalf of unborn children and their mothers,\u201d saying the legislation. \u201cwould prevent cruel and painful abortions from being performed on innocent children.\u201d\nLaxalt\u2019s and Lombardo\u2019s opposition to the ban not only put them at odds with NRLC but also in the position of supporting a state law that allows abortion up to nine weeks later than the proposed federal ban.\nAn anti-abortion rights activist who asked not to be named for fear of professional retribution said of the 15-week ban that she \u201cwould be for it, from a practical policy perspective,\u201d adding it would \u201cgive women more of a runway to understand their situation and provide them with resources to understand their options\u201d than an outright ban favored by hardcore anti-abortion factions.\n\u201cThis is a canard,\u201d says Melissa Clement, executive director of Nevada Right to Life. \u201cYou and I both know there are not the votes in the House and there are not the votes in the Senate. And there isn\u2019t a president that is going to do anything but veto a ban.\u201d\nHansen, Clement\u2019s longtime ally in the anti-abortion rights effort, says although she supports states\u2019 rights and opposes Graham\u2019s proposal, it is a \u201cperfectly appropriate compromise,\u201d especially in a state like Nevada, where existing law is unlikely to be undone by a vote of the people.\n  Hundreds gather outside the Ohio Statehouse for a May 14, 2022, rally to support abortion rights after a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion showed a likely reversal of Roe v. Wade. (Photo by Graham Stokes)\n \u2018Pro-life lens\u2019\u00a0\n\nLombardo, a Catholic who has described himself as a \u201cpro-life individual,\u201d struck a decidedly anti-abortion rights tone during the Republican primary. Asked during a televised debate whether he\u2019d support restrictions on emergency contraceptives, waiting periods before ending a pregnancy and parental notification laws, Lombardo responded \u201cyes, absolutely,\u201d and noted that if elected, he would view everything via a \u201cpro-life lens.\u201d\nHe has since backed off.\n\u201cI support the existing laws that are in the state of Nevada,\u201d Lombardo says in a misleading ad that attempts to make his campaign spokesperson\u2019s assertion that he won\u2019t change abortion law appear to be the conclusion of news media.\nNRLC is advocating for legislation that would outlaw abortion pills like mifepristone and misoprostol, which are used in more than half of all abortions.\n\u201cNational Right to Life supports pro-life candidates and understands that pro-life candidates we support may have varying views on the best way to protect unborn children,\u201d NRLC said in a statement to the Current.\nAfter the Dobbs ruling, Lombardo said that if elected, he would repeal Gov. Steve Sisolak\u2019s executive order protecting people who seek abortion care in Nevada. He has also backed off that position.\nLombardo\u2019s evolution on abortion is detailed in broadcast ads, but DeRiso says viewing options, including ad-free services, have changed the way voters watch TV, rendering ads less impactful.\n\u201cIf abortion is your hill to die for, on either side, you\u2019re going to really be paying attention to those ads and they may determine how you vote. But if that\u2019s not what you\u2019re worried about, if you\u2019re worried about your kids\u2019 education, and prices and all the other things families are dealing with, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s on your radar,\u201d\nAbortion rights, she says, is low priority for most voters.\nWhile Lombardo says he supports the existing laws of the state, if elected, he\u2019d have the platform to support a referendum limiting abortion rights, as well as impose restrictions on access.\nHe has said he supports a 13-week ban at the state level.\nLaxalt has refused to take questions about abortion, but wrote an op-ed in the Reno Gazette-Journal supporting a state referendum limiting abortion to 13 weeks. \u201cI also believe that most Nevadans agree with that position,\u201d Laxalt wrote.\n\u201cThe law in Nevada was settled by voters decades ago and isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d Laxalt\u2019s campaign spokesman Brian Freimuth said in a statement to news media.\nRepublican House candidates April Becker and Mark Robertson oppose the proposed federal ban at 15 weeks.\n\u201cGiven the recent Supreme Court decision returning the issue of abortion regulation to the states, I do not believe it is constitutional for abortion policy to be determined at the national level; therefore, I would oppose Senator Graham\u2019s legislation,\u201d Becker, the Republican challenging Susie Lee in Congressional District 3, said in a statement.\n\u201cThe right to \u2018Life\u2019 is not granted by humans, but rather is an endowment by our \u2018Creator,\u2019\u201d says Congressional District 1 Republican candidate Mark Robertson\u2019s website. \u201cAborting an unborn life is an affront to the Creator.\u201d\nBut not enough of an affront to support a federal ban at 15 weeks.\n\u201cThe people of Nevada have spoken,\u201d Robertson said when Graham introduced the measure. \u201cI will oppose any bill in Congress that takes power from the People and gives it to the Federal government.\u201d\n  A protester attends a June 24, 2022, rally in Lansing, Michigan, against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v.

A majority said they opposed bans at 15 weeks of gestation.\nFor the last 30 years, far more Americans have supported first trimester abortion (about 60%) than second trimester (about 25%), according to Gallup. That waning support for later procedures is shaping the 13- and 15-week bans being floated by Republicans.\nBut will those bans satisfy the segment of the conservative base that views every abortion as murder?\nDays before the Supreme Court issued the Dobbs ruing, NRLC issued model state legislation that would outlaw abortion except when necessary to prevent the death of the mother.\nNow, with a majority of Americans disapproving the court\u2019s ruling and politicians walking back more stringent pro-abortion rights positions, NRLC is lowering its standards, writing in a statement it \u201csupports both state and federal bills protecting unborn children capable of feeling pain at 15 weeks from excruciating dismemberment abortions.\u201d\nA Fox News poll conducted in late April, before the Dobbs decision, asked respondents \u201c\u2026about a law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in the case of medical emergency \u2013 would you favor or oppose that in your state?\u201d\u00a0 More than half (54%) favored such a law and 41% opposed it.\nClement of Nevada Right to Life seems disinterested in compromise, unless it includes not only a time limit but parental notification provisions, as well.\n\u201cWe have 9-year-olds getting abortions without their parents\u2019 knowledge,\u201d she says. \u201cThe question is never \u2018do you support legalized abortion for all nine months, at any age without parental consent.\u201d\n[Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0This article was updated to use neutral terminology on abortion rights.]\nThis article was first published by the Nevada Current, part of States Newsroom network of news bureaus \u00a0with the Louisiana Illuminator supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
