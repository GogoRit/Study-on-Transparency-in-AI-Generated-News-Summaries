The court said this language conflicts with a previous ruling it issued in March. That ruling found the Oklahoma Constitution provides an \u201cinherent right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy when necessary to preserve her life.\u201d\nThe laws struck down Wednesday both included a civil-enforcement mechanism that allowed citizens to sue someone who either performed or helped someone perform an abortion.\n\u201cDespite the court\u2019s decisions today on SB 1603 and HB 4327, Oklahoma\u2019s 1910 law prohibiting abortion remains in place,\u201d Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement. \u201cExcept for certain circumstances outlined in that statute, abortion is still unlawful in the state of Oklahoma.\u201d\nThis developing story will be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                FILE PHOTO: A view of the medical bed and the procedure room where abortions once took place, inside Tulsa Women's Clinic, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. June 20, 2022.
