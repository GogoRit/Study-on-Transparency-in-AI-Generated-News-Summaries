(AP) \u2014 Outside the chambers of the West Virginia Legislature, the marble foyer was\u00a0packed with young women\u00a0in T-shirts, ripped jeans, and gym shorts holding signs with uteruses drawn in colored marker.\n\u201cBans off our bodies,\u201d the signs said. \u201cAbortion is essential.\u201d\nInside, a group of lawmakers, almost all of them men, sat at desks in pressed suits, doing their best to talk over protesters\u2019 chants carrying through the heavy wooden doors.\nA stark gender divide has emerged in debates unfolding in Republican-led states including West Virginia, Indiana and South Carolina following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June decision to end\u00a0constitutional protections for abortion. As male-dominated legislatures worked to advance bans, often with support of the few Republican women holding office, protesters were more likely to be women.\nWATCH: Conservative states continue to restrict abortion following overturn of Roe v. Wade\nThe contrast wasn\u2019t lost on West Virginia Sen. Owens Brown, the only Black lawmaker in the Republican-dominated Senate, who asked lawmakers to look around before they passed a bill banning abortion at all stages of pregnancy last week.\n\u201cWhen I look around the room, what do I see? A bunch of middle-aged and some elderly men. Also, middle-income men,\u201d the Democrat said during a final Senate debate in which only men shared opinions. \u201cLook out in the hallway. What do you see? You see young women, and we\u2019re here making a decision for all these young women because you\u2019re never going to have to ever face this issue yourself.\u201d\nIn all three states, lawmakers fighting against abortion bans have pointed to the gender divide, insisting that men shouldn\u2019t get to dictate medical decisions for women. Ban supporters say abortion affects not only women, but also children, and all of society.\n\u201cI am incredibly grateful to the men in my caucus, who were not afraid to stand up for life,\u201d said Republican Del. Kayla Kessinger, one of the West Virginia ban\u2019s biggest supporters. \u201cThey have just as much of a right to have an opinion on this as anyone else.\n\u201cI wish that the left would stop trying to silence conservative women who are pro-life and believe that empowering women doesn\u2019t require us to kill our children,\u201d said Kessinger, who joined the legislature eight years ago, at 21, running on the abortion issue.\nThe gender gap was hard to miss as protesters descended on the West Virginia Capitol starting in July, when\u00a0lawmakers first took up abortion. During a public hearing, dozens of women who showed up were given 45 seconds each to speak; several who went longer were escorted out by security. This past week, at least one woman was arrested and another dragged out of the chamber gallery by a group of male officers when she shouted \u201cshame\u201d at lawmakers during a debate.\nAfter the bill passed, the House clerk read a lengthy resolution introduced by a white male lawmaker describing how society should view mothers. Motherhood is a privilege, it said, and shouldn\u2019t be treated as \u201ca mere option.\u201d\n\u201cIt was formerly a wisdom common to all participants of the abortion debate that no woman wants an abortion,\u201d the resolution states. Those with power over women \u201cconvince them to perform acts against their conscience.\u201d\nThe resolution didn\u2019t sit well with Roni Jones, a mother from the Charleston suburb of St. Albans.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of older, rich white men deciding our fate,\u201d she said, her voice hoarse from protesting. \u201cThey have no idea what working-class people go through.\u201d\nJones once had an abortion in the second trimester of a wanted pregnancy because of a medical issue, she said. And while West Virginia\u2019s ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest, those apply only early in pregnancy \u2014 and she worries doctors will fear losing their license if they make a close call.\nHer daughter, Catherine Jones, 25, said none of these decisions should be up to men, who will never experience pregnancy, childbirth or a miscarriage: \u201cHow can they truly empathize?\u201d\nIn West Virginia, 18 of 134 lawmakers are women \u2014 and 13 of them, all Republican, voted for the near-total abortion ban. In Indiana, 35 of 150 legislators are women; 14 voted for the bill there. In South Carolina, 29 of 124 legislators are women; seven voted for bans.\nIndiana Republican Sen. Sue Glick sponsored the abortion ban that became law. A House version was also proposed by a woman. But it was a male Democrat who pointed out the gender divide \u2014 as in West Virginia.\n\u201cThis is the government, the male-dominated government of the state of Indiana, saying to the women of this state, you lose your choice,\u201d Indiana Democratic Sen. Tim Lanane said when the Senate passed its ban. \u201cWe\u2019ve told you \u2014 papa state, big state government \u2014 is going to tell you what you will do with your body.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Indiana faces a shifting abortion landscape as clinics shut down statewide\nMen have invoked wives, daughters and granddaughters during debates on rape and incest exemptions. Several said they needed to make a decision that allowed them to \u201csleep at night.\u201d\nFemale lawmakers in both parties have at times voiced frustration.\n\u201cTo say it\u2019s tough to be a woman in politics is an understatement,\u201d South Carolina Sen. Katrina Shealy \u2014 the body\u2019s longest-serving woman \u2014 said on the Senate floor. \u201cTo say it\u2019s really tough to be a woman in politics in South Carolina is hardly a statement at all.\u201d\nShealy was one of three female Republican senators who opposed an\u00a0effort to remove exceptions\u00a0for rape and incest.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also pro-life for the mother, the life she has with her children who are already born.\u201d\nSouth Carolina senators narrowly rejected a ban on almost all abortions this month. But Republican lawmakers plan to keep trying to enact new restrictions. In West Virginia and Indiana, the bans passed were\u00a0signed into law, although a judge has temporarily blocked enforcement\u00a0of Indiana\u2019s ban.\u00a0The state quickly\u00a0appealed.\nIn West Virginia, Democratic Del. Kayla Young noted the lack of legislative representation not only of women but of people of color \u2014 and those communities will be affected most by the ban, she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to have to deal with this because we\u2019re incredibly privileged people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are making decisions about other people, and we shouldn\u2019t do that. If it\u2019s your religious belief, if it\u2019s your moral belief, that is great for you. But get it away from me, get it out of my body, get it out of my uterus.\u201d\nDemocratic Del. Danielle Walker \u2014 the only Black woman in the Legislature \u2014 has acknowledged having an abortion. Walker often joined protesters between floor sessions, leading chants.\n\u201cWho do you think you are to tell me what I should do with my body, with my vagina, with my uterus, with my ovaries?\u201d she said amid the crowd before walking into House chambers to vote against the bill.\nOther legislators say the ban reflects what West Virginians want. Republican Sen. Patricia Rucker supported the measure and was vocal in debates about ensuring victims of rape and incest who want abortions must report assaults to police. Though she wasn\u2019t involved in drafting the final version, she said her male colleagues shared their work and sought input.\nRucker said she feels she\u2019s carrying out voters\u2019 wishes. But opponents of restricting abortion say that can be known only through a statewide vote. In 2018, 52 percent of voters approved a constitutional amendment saying that nothing in the state constitution \u201csecures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\u201d\nNo vote has been held in West Virginia since. In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, only\u00a0Kansas voters\u00a0have had a chance to weigh in on abortion. The traditionally conservative state voted to affirm the procedure as a right in the state constitution, with the support of an unprecedented increase in female registered voters.\nA proposal by West Virginia House Democrats to put the abortion question to voters was rejected by Republicans on the day the ban passed. At least four states \u2014 California, Kentucky, Michigan and Vermont \u2014 could have votes in November on abortion access.\nThe day the West Virginia bill passed, Rucker and other female legislators let her male colleagues do the talking \u2014 she felt she\u2019d already had her say.\n\u201cI did not feel any reason to delay action of saving the babies when the West Virginia voters already spoke out,\u201d she said. \u201cVoters knew when they elected me, I was 100% pro-life.\u201d\n___\nAP reporters James Pollard and Jeffrey Collins in South Carolina and Arleigh Rodgers and Rick Callahan in Indiana contributed to this report.
