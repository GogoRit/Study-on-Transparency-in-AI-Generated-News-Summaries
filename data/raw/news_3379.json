I\u2019m Eleanor. How can I help you?\u2019\u201d said Eleanor McCullen, an 85-year-old Catholic grandmother located near Boston, describing how she greets women outside abortion clinics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful moment when a woman looks at me and our eyes connect, and she stops to talk,\u201d McCullen stressed during her March 24 testimony. \u201cIt\u2019s in that moment I promise her she will never walk her journey alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCullen testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearings. She told CNA that she has dedicated 22 years to empowering women. Located in Newton, she engages with pregnant women considering abortion outside a Planned Parenthood in Boston.\n\u201cSo many women I\u2019ve met believe that their only choice is to end the life of their baby,\u201d McCullen told senators. \u201cIt is in that moment of isolation and fear, that I have the privilege of offering a different choice\u2014one that empowers and encourages the woman to know she is fully capable of becoming a mom and pursuing a job and going to school and having a successful and happy life.\u201d\nMcCullen introduced herself as the lead plaintiff in a 2014 Supreme Court case regarding free speech. In that case, McCullen v. Coakley, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that imposed a 35-foot \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around abortion clinics, which prevented sidewalk counselors from speaking with women entering those clinics. Faith-based legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom helped with the case.\nThe court\u2019s opinion in the case mentions another case, McGuire v. Reilly, which involved Jackson. In 2001, Jackson co-authored an amicus brief in McGuire v. Reilly, in support of a Massachusetts \u201cbuffer zone\u201d law, pro-life groups, such as Susan B. Anthony List, have cautioned.\nIn the amicus brief Jackson wrote on behalf of abortion groups, pro-life leaders previously told Senate leaders, she \u201cportrayed pro-life sidewalk counselors as a \u2018hostile, noisy crowd of 'in-your-face protesters.\u2019\u201d\nMcCullen appeared to respond to accusations like this in her testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was deeply saddened to find out that Judge Jackson, while in private practice, advocated in favor of Massachusetts\u2019 previous \u2018buffer zone\u2019 law in her amicus brief on behalf of abortion clinics,\u201d McCullen said. \u201cShe and her colleagues maligned pro-life sidewalk counselors, characterizing us in ugly and false ways.\u201d\nMcCullen added, \u201cHer misrepresentations certainly don\u2019t describe me or any of the sidewalk counselors that I have worked with over the years.\u201d\nMcCullen told CNA that she wanted to testify for two main reasons: She wanted to talk about helping pregnant women as a sidewalk counselor, and she wanted to support the confirmation of judges committed to preserving what she called \u201cone of Americans\u2019 most cherished freedoms,\u201d the freedom of speech.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce she began speaking, she said, she was not nervous.\n\u201cI had a message, the message was truth and when you're speaking truth, you do feel comfortable,\u201d she said.\nHer Catholic faith, she told CNA, informs her work as a sidewalk counselor.\n\u201cI believe that everything is the glory of God,\u201d she said, stressing her desire to speak with women \u2014 to introduce peace into their hearts and tell them they are not alone \u2014 when they are troubled.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nFaith, McCullen said, \u201ctells me peace is important.\u201d\n\u201cI take a step in faith every morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI take a step in faith and I, in this case, I walk with the women \u2014 and then when the babies are born, I walk with the mothers and the babies.\u201d\nMcCullen appears to do just that: she continues to care for women and their families after their babies are born. She shared one story with CNA, that she said she might have shared with senators if she had had the time.\n\u201cI talked to a mother and father, they were considering abortion, and I offered help and we went to see the ultrasound, and they said, yes, they would keep the babies,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThey had twins!\u201d\nShe and her husband also sent the father back to school. While he previously worked as a nurse in Nigeria, she said, his credentials did not transfer when he moved to the United States.\u00a0\nToday, the father is a registered nurse in the U.S. and the twins are juniors in high school.\u00a0\n\u201cEven today, they call for different reasons, because high school has a few expenses, and I'm happy to help them,\u201d Eleanor McCullen told CNA. \u201cI just love the girls.\u201d\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nOne, she said, is named Oprah. The other, Eleanor.\nDuring her testimony, she shared another story about a call this week from a mother she had helped.\n\u201cI was just looking through my baby book of my 3-month-old little girl,\u201d the woman told her over the telephone. Underneath that photo, the woman said, she found McCullen\u2019s card.\n\u201cI have to tell you,\u201d she said of her little girl, \u201cRose is now 18. She\u2019s graduating from high school, she\u2019s on her way to college, and I want to thank you for being there that day in January.\u201d\n\u201cRose,\u201d she told McCullen, \u201cis the joy of our life.\u201d\nMcCullen told senators that she hands out cards with her contact information to women outside of the abortion clinic. She held one up for them to see, bearing the image of the cross.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWomen often share with me their fears and their concerns about their pregnancy,\u201d she said during her testimony. \u201cI honor their thoughts and concerns and I say, \u2018I understand; that is a challenge. But I also know you can do it with support, and I will support you with all my kinds of support! I will stand with you throughout the nine months and beyond. I will hold your hand.\u201d\nShe does this by providing support, including medically, financially, and materially. Among other things, she has helped women pursue their education, and, she added, has hosted \u201cmany, many baby showers.\u201d\nMcCullen concluded her interview the same way she did her testimony: \u201cI'm here to help women and anything that I can do for women, I'm happy to do,\u201d she said, adding that she is passionate about supporting pregnant women and free speech because of love.\n\u201cAnd love,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can't argue with that.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nbuffer zones, \nAbortion in the United States, \nSupreme Court of the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
