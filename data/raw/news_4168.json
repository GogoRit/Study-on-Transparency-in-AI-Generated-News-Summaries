Think: If every POV you take in about health, about sex, about gender, about politics comes from someone who is white or from one (hyper-privileged) socioeconomic background \u2014 you\u2019re getting a fraction of a fraction the story and a fraction of the information you need to form a solid understanding.\nFor readers who are non-Black POC and white readers especially, these are also great tools for lifting your own weight and doing your own research instead of asking your Black loved ones to shoulder any of that burden for you. So if you\u2019ve noticed your reading list has felt a bit homogenous and more than a little incomplete, take this moment\u00a0 to make a lasting change and support Black authors who are telling necessary stories and contextualizing important information.\nReading, listening and learning won\u2019t replace taking necessary actions to dismantle white supremacy, but it\u2019s a good start to making yourself the most informed and empathetic person you can be.\nA version of this story was published June 2020 and updated in February 2023.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Strong Black Woman: How a Myth Endangers the Physical and Mental Health of Black Women\n\n \nThe myth that Black women are stronger, more resilient by nature undoubtedly harms Black women and girls by making it seem less likely that they are deserving or in need of help \u2014 as well as contributing to medical inequality in the physical and mental health spaces. Marita Golden explores the all too real harms of this myth in The Strong Black Woman and unpacks how we can better support Black women and give them access to resources they need.\u00a0\n \tBUY NOW:  \t$14.39 \t$18.95 \t24% Off  \ton Amazon.com   \t\tBuy now\t   \n\n\n\n\nSelf-Care for Black Women\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Amazon\t\t\t\n\nOkay, I know every single person in 2023 is absolutely bone tired of being told to practice self-care (in the capitalist, consumerist, exhausting way that doesn\u2019t account for being a real person with real responsibilities).
