Will It Work This Time?\n\nDecember 14, 2022 Editor 1 Comment\n\n\n\nby Megan Burbank\n\nIn September, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to impose new regulations on crisis pregnancy centers, nonprofit organizations that resemble abortion clinics \u2014 and often set up adjacent to licensed health care providers \u2014 with the goal of dissuading pregnant people from choosing to have abortions, often through deceptive practices and misinformation about abortion.\n\n\u201cCrisis pregnancy centers are pernicious organizations masquerading as healthcare to persuade pregnant people to not access medically accurate, unbiased healthcare \u2014 exactly when they need it most,\u201d said Councilmember Lisa Herbold of the new policy in a statement. \u201cSince Seattle will remain a safe place for people seeking abortions, crisis pregnancy centers are likely to proliferate here, making today\u2019s vote to regulate their false and harmful claims so vital.\u201d\nThe legislature is also making renewed efforts to crack down on the anti-abortion centers. Among a slate of reproductive health policy proposals set to be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, State Rep. Vandana Slatter (a Democrat from Bellevue) and State Sen. Manka Dhingra (a Democrat from Redmond), in partnership with Attorney General Bob Ferguson, are advocating for a bill that would enhance data privacy protections in response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nA news release from the attorney general\u2019s office lists crisis pregnancy centers among threats to privacy that the legislation seeks to address, noting that when a pregnant person visits a crisis pregnancy center, \u201cthe crisis pregnancy center can collect and share the [person\u2019s] sensitive data with anti-abortion groups who can then target the woman with pro-life messaging and political ads.\u201d\nPolicies like these reflect a newfound emphasis among lawmakers on preserving reproductive rights in Washington State in the wake of the Dobbs decision. But will it work?\nThough crisis pregnancy centers\u2019 deceptive practices are well-documented, efforts to regulate them or encourage greater transparency in their advertising haven\u2019t succeeded, even in states like Washington that have well-established legal protections for reproductive health care.\nThe Limited Service Pregnancy Center Accountability Act, a State Senate bill introduced in 2011, would have required that crisis pregnancy centers disclose that they do not provide abortion services or protect client privacy. The bill received a public hearing that year but did not advance out of the Senate\u2019s Health & Long Term Care Committee. At the hearing, public testimony was delayed due to \u201cinflammatory pro-life rhetoric\u201d from Senate Republicans who spoke in opposition to the bill, according to contemporaneous reporting from The Stranger. (Full disclosure: I was an intern at The Stranger in 2011 and attended that hearing.)\nSara Ainsworth, senior legal and policy director at the reproductive justice law group If/When/How, remembers that hearing. Then working for the women\u2019s and LGBTQ advocacy group Legal Voice, Ainsworth testified in support of the bill. Legal Voice and Planned Parenthood had recently released a report on crisis pregnancy centers throughout Washington State. Through phone calls and visits, they\u2019d found misinformation and a lack of transparency around what type of care the centers actually offered.\n\u201cMany of them misled people into believing that they were actually going to get not just unbiased counseling, but either an abortion or potentially a referral for an abortion,\u201d said Ainsworth. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve only heightened their activities since that time.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also uniquely challenging to regulate, she says. \u201cThey are religiously affiliated, and they use that religious affiliation to essentially operate in ways that are either outside the law and hard to regulate or are actually protected by religious freedom,\u201d she said.\nConsumer protection laws require truth in advertising, but crisis pregnancy centers have an advantage in that they generally don\u2019t profit financially from their services. \u201cThere\u2019s some case law that indicates that an organization that doesn\u2019t charge for its services has a defense to the kinds of activities that it does that might otherwise violate that law,\u201d said Ainsworth. Filing lawsuits against the centers could also raise privacy concerns for people who have experienced the centers\u2019 deceptive practices firsthand. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard for people who have been harmed by a crisis pregnancy center to imagine themselves being the person that stands up publicly to the crisis pregnancy center,\u201d said Ainsworth. \u201cThe backlash is severe.\u201d\nLegal challenges can also stymie efforts to hold the centers accountable. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with a network of Christian-affiliated crisis pregnancy centers, striking down a California law requiring that centers providing services like ultrasounds without a medical license disclose that they are not medical clinics.\nAnd even when they succeed in establishing regulations for crisis pregnancy centers, local governments may struggle to implement them. In 2017, the King County Board of Health passed an ordinance requiring crisis pregnancy centers to disclose to consumers that they are not health care facilities. But the policy doesn\u2019t have the funding to be enforceable, Ainsworth says.\nStill, she says, it\u2019s possible new efforts could succeed. While the legislation is familiar, the political landscape is different. The legislature is less divided now than it was in 2011, and reproductive rights have dominated headlines since Roe v. Wade was overturned. \u201cThe politics have changed, in the sense that there\u2019s a lot more awareness to the need to protect abortion rights and to protect abortion access than we\u2019d seen in the years preceding Dobbs, from people that aren\u2019t normally in the fight,\u201d she said.\n\n\nMegan Burbank is a writer and editor based in Seattle.
