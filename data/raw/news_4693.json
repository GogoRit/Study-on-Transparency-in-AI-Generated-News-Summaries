But let us ask: Can we truly be free if a woman cannot make decisions about her own body?\u201d the vice president said on Sunday from Tallahassee, Florida.\n\u201cCan we truly be free if a doctor cannot care for her patients? Can we truly be free if families cannot make intimate decisions about the course of their own lives?\u201d\nPrior to the speech, the White House announced its latest efforts to shore up support for abortion rights, saying it was \u201cin consultation\u201d with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security \u201cto consider new guidance to support patients, providers, and pharmacies who wish to legally access, prescribe, or provide\u201d abortion medication and to consider new ways to \u201censure that patients can access legal reproductive care\u201d.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration also announced this month that so-called abortion pills would become more widely available at pharmacies and through the mail.\nStill, the administration of US President Joe Biden has been relatively limited in its ability to respond to the overturning of Roe v Wade without the passage of federal legislation. Such an effort is all but sure to fail amid opposition from Republicans, who control the House of Representatives and who last year introduced a bill that bans abortions nationwide at 15 weeks from conception, with few exceptions.\n\u201cSince the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Americans, time and time again, have made their voices heard: Women should be able to make these deeply personal decisions free from political interference,\u201d Biden said in a statement on Sunday.\n\u201cYet, Republicans in Congress and across the country continue to push for a national abortion ban, to criminalise doctors and nurses, and to make contraception harder to access. It\u2019s dangerous, extreme, and out of touch.\u201d\n\n#BiggerThanRoe rally to start any minute now. There are a couple hundred here so far.

About half of US states currently have some form of abortion bans in place.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Harris would be speaking in Florida because it is emblematic of battles playing out across the country.\nFlorida currently has a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of conception, a period before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. However, its restrictions are less stringent than those of its neighbouring states, making it an important resource for women in the region.\nStill, abortion rights advocates fear more restrictions could be considered by the Republican-controlled state legislature and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.\nThe governor is expected to seek the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election, a race where abortion rights are all but assured to loom large.\n\u201cSo we are fighting back,\u201d Harris said on Sunday. \u201cThe right of every woman in every state in this country to make decisions about her body is on the line. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: How dare they.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
