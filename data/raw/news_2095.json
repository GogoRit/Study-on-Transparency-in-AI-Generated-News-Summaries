No. 21. CNS illustration; photo by Paolo Cocco, Reuters\nOne of my assignments as a theology graduate assistant was to deliver a 90-minute lecture on St. John Paul II\u2019s 1995 encyclical \u201cEvangelium Vitae\u201d (\u201cThe Gospel of Life\u201d). The task was daunting: Not only was I to unpack more than 45,000 words, but I was to make the church\u2019s case for protecting life in highly personal circumstances, from reproductive decision-making to end-of-life care.\nWatching students respond positively to it was pivotal for me; it launched me into a teaching career focused on Catholic bioethics and moral decision-making.\nAs I reflect on the legacy of the document on its 25th anniversary, it\u2019s clear that all people of goodwill, not only people interested in theology, would benefit from encountering or revisiting its prophetic message of what it means to be consistently and joyfully pro-life.\nAccording to St. John Paul, to be pro-life is not to start with moral claims or a list of issues to accept or reject, but instead it is to begin with the God revealed by Jesus Christ and his plan for every person \u2014 salvation and eternal life.\nOur God is a God of living, so where there is human life, there is something of \u201cincomparable worth.\u201d Our responsibility to our brothers and sisters and the dignity of every life shape how we approach all moral issues, whether sexual or social, personal or communal.\n\u201cEvangelium Vitae\u201d takes a sweeping look at contemporary threats against life, which create what St. John Paul calls the \u201cculture of death.\u201d The issues he cites are many, including the unjust distribution of resources, the arms trade and armed conflicts, the \u201creckless tampering\u201d of the \u201cecological balance,\u201d the drug trade and sexual activity that risks human life in its earliest stages.\nAdd a refugee crisis and economy that disproportionately affect the poor and you have the issues to which Pope Francis has been drawing our consciences. The culture of death, the culture of indifference, the throwaway culture: a quarter century later it persists, no matter what we call it.\nThe encyclical focuses the bulk of its attention on the gravest threats to life that involve the direct killing of people. They are couched in the story of Cain and Abel, in which the killing of brother by brother reveals a rupture in the communion that God intended for us.\nThe two issues to which St. John Paul devotes the most attention are abortion and euthanasia, which involve the direct killing of a human being in two of its most vulnerable stages: its beginning and end. He argues that these actions have become sanitized to the point that many no longer recognize them as murder.\nInstead, they are increasingly protected in law as if they were rights and characterized as health care by some in the medical community. Adding to their moral gravity is the fact that they take place in the context of familial relationships: Nature normally impels us to protect the lives of our kin, not to end them.\nBut St. John Paul does not end on a note of despair. He challenges readers to contemplate how they can build up a \u201cculture of life.\u201d Christians must push back against secularism, which promotes materialism and relativism, and which obscures moral truths.\nScientists, medical professionals and engineers must ensure that technology and health care are aimed at human flourishing.\nTeachers and catechists must help younger generations understand and recognize anthropological and eternal realities. And families must commit to being \u201csanctuaries\u201d of life, where children experience firsthand the dignity of human life and learn to protect it.\nTwenty-five years later, threats to human life remain and are growing. Yet \u201cEvangelium Vitae\u201d reminds us of the good news, that life triumphs over death. The pro-life witness \u2014 which sees the sacred in unexpected places and people, and joyfully protects them with loving care \u2014 is needed still.\nA culture of life is always within reach and is built one moment and decision at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPreviousPandemic a stressful time for patients and health care workers \n\n\n\n\nNextFaith Alive, No. 21, Part 1: Memories of St. John Paul II on his 100th birthdayNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our email list\nKeep your finger on the pulse of Catholic life in Middle Tennessee by subscribing to the weekday\nE-Register here.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSt. Mary\u2019s Bookstore a stop on Fontanini Tour\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 27, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNashvilleCatholic.org: a robust choir\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 20, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAquinas College alumnus Col.
