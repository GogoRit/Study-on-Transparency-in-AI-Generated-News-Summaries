Courthouse on July 20, 2023, in Austin, Texas.\n\nSUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            On the second day of hearings addressing the emergency medical exception for abortion restrictions in Texas, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist gave emotional testimony about getting an abortion out of state last year after learning her fetus had a life-threatening condition. \n    \n\n            Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB/GYN from Dallas and a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking clarity in the state\u2019s abortion exceptions, testified Thursday her fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly, a condition where the brain and skull of a fetus don\u2019t completely form. \n    \n\n            The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, is asking the court to clarify what situations fall under the exception in the state\u2019s abortion restrictions. Plaintiffs also want the court to immediately block the state\u2019s abortion bans, as it applies to situations involving medical emergencies. \n    \n\n            Texas in 2021 banned abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. When the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother.\n    \n\n            The state defines a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d as a \u201clife-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.\u201d\n    \n\n            Dennard said the diagnosis of anencephaly poses a significant threat to pregnant patients and would be incompatible with life for the fetus. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators attend a rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin, Texas, May 14, 2022. \n\nEric Gay/AP/FILE\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly two years after Texas' six-week abortion ban, more infants are dying \n\n\n\n\n            \u201cThey essentially just gasp for air until they pass away,\u201d Dennard said, saying babies typically live for seconds, minutes, or maybe a day once born with this condition.\n    \n\n            Dennard said continuing with pregnancy would have put herself at \u201csignificant risk,\u201d but she did not feel confident a medical provider would give her an abortion in Texas over the diagnosis, given what she described as the confusing and vague parameters of the state\u2019s medical emergency exception.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt was just heart-breaking to think about how being pregnant and carrying to term would affect (my children),\u201d she said. \u201cBut more importantly my health and staying healthy so that I can be their mother and be a wife and be a physician and take care of my patients was my number one priority.\u201d\n    \n\n            Dennard, who is now 34 weeks pregnant, previously received a separate abortion in Texas after learning her fetus had a rare genetic disorder known as Noonan Syndrome. But Dennard is part of the suit against Texas for a more recent pregnancy, which occurred last year, when stricter abortion laws had gone into effect.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to describe in words what that feels like,\u201d she said, growing emotional when recalling the harder path she faced in getting an abortion. \u201cI felt like my pregnancy was not my own \u2013 that it belonged to the state, because I no longer had a choice of what I could do. I felt abandoned.\u201d\n    \n\n            Legal counsel for the state questioned Dennard, asking if Texas officials told her she could not have an abortion. Dennard said she never asked anyone in state government about her pregnancy. \n    \n\n            Asked if she felt she qualified for an abortion after learning about the diagnosis at 11 weeks, Dennard said the emergency medical exception is \u201cextremely nebulous and confusing.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cI recognized that day in that moment that I was not critically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI was not hemorrhaging, I was not septic. I was pregnant with a lethal anomaly, and I did not believe that I would be able to receive an abortion in my state at that time for the sole purpose of my lethal anomaly.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Illustration: Jason Lancaster/CNN/Adobe Stock/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nA 45-year-old got pregnant in a state with a ban on abortions. She flew across the country to get one\n\n\n\n\n            Dr. Ali Raja, an emergency medicine specialist, also testified as an expert witness at the hearing, saying the language as written in the Texas code creates a confusing gray zone for doctors that discourages them from providing abortions.   \n    \n\n            \u201cFor patients for whom it\u2019s unclear as to whether or not they have an emergent medical conditions, physicians are understandably going to err on the side of not treatment given those consequences,\u201d he said, citing punitive measures that physicians could face if they provide abortions to women who don\u2019t qualify for the exemptions under Texas law.\n    \n\n            Dr. Ingrid Skop, director of Medical Affairs for Charlotte Lozier Institute, testified as an expert witness for the State of Texas. The Charlotte Lozier Institute is a think tank made up of anti-abortion scholars and medical experts. \n    \n\n            Skop said the current language of Texas abortion laws is clear and offers objective guidelines on how doctors should treat pregnant patients. Skop said the confusion and fear medical providers have in providing abortion when a woman\u2019s life is in danger or a fetus is not viable is because they don\u2019t understand the law and are misinformed.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt appears their doctors did not understand what the law allowed and did not offer appropriate intervention,\u201d Skop said.\n    \n\n            At the end of the two-day hearing on Thursday, the judge said she would weigh the arguments for several weeks before issuing a decision. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
