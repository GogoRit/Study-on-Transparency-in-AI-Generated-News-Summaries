But, they have said, the doctors could not perform an abortion because of their interpretation of a Florida law that took effect after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade.Potter syndrome is a rare condition related to a fetus\u2019s development in the uterus. The syndrome is a result of abnormal kidney growth and function, which affects how much amniotic fluid surrounds the fetus during pregnancy.It has been deemed a \u201cdoubly lethal diagnosis\u201d because babies with malfunctioning kidneys can\u2019t remove deadly toxins from their bodies and can in turn experience renal failure. Additionally, the absence of amniotic fluid in a womb causes a baby to be born without the ability to breathe.According to Florida\u2019s Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality law, which was implemented last July, abortions are prohibited after 15 weeks of gestation, with a few exceptions, including one that would allow for a later abortion \u201cif two physicians certify in writing that the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality and has not reached viability\u201d.The \u2018rogue\u2019 Trump-appointed judge with abortion pill\u2019s future in his handsRead moreLast November, when the couple\u2019s baby was diagnosed with the syndrome, a maternal fetal medicine specialist told the Dorberts that some parents choose to continue to full term while others opt to terminate the pregnancy through surgery or preterm labor.The doctor added that he would consult with health system administrators regarding the new law, the Washington Post reports. The Dorberts eventually decided that they would like to terminate the pregnancy as early as they could because babies with the syndrome often die before they are born or end up suffocating within minutes or hours after their delivery.Deborah Dorbert told the outlet that she recalled the specialist saying that the termination might be possible \u2013 but not until between 28 and 32 weeks.Then, after the specialist consulted with health system administrators regarding the new law, the couple was told that they would have to wait to terminate the pregnancy until the 37th week of gestation \u2013 or near full term.According to a text message Deborah Dorbert received from the coordinator at a maternal fetal medicine office that she visits often, the specialist made his determination after having legal administrators \u201clook at the new law and the way it\u2019s written\u201d, the Washington Post reported.\u201cIt\u2019s horribly written,\u201d the message added.Despite the specialist telling the couple that other states had fewer restrictions on abortion access, the Dorberts told the Post that they were overwhelmed by travel costs and had only left their state a few times.The couple, who have not learned the baby\u2019s sex because its legs were crossed or the umbilical cord was in the way during each scan, eventually opted to provide palliative care to their child after the baby is born.\u201cThat\u2019s been very important to us, understanding that we do have that control back at least in some of these decisions,\u201d Lee Dorbert told the Washington Post.Nevertheless, the new law \u2013 which punishes physicians who violate it with penalties including license revocation, hefty fines and five years or more of jail time \u2013 has left the couple angry and frustrated.\u201cIt makes me angry, for politicians to decide what\u2019s best for my health,\u201d Deborah Dorbert told the Washington Post. \u201cWe would do anything to have this baby.\u201d\u201cWe have never really understood,\u201d Lee Dorbert said, adding: \u201cWe were told there was an exception \u2026 Obviously, [it\u2019s] not enough of an exception in some cases.\u201dDespite the pain that the Dorberts and couples in similar situations are experiencing, the state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has maintained a staunch anti-abortion stance.Earlier this month, DeSantis said that he would sign a six-week abortion ban if one passed.\u201cWe\u2019re for pro-life,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI urge the legislature to work, produce good stuff, and we will sign. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to do.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionFloridaHealthWomennewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
