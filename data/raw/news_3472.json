(CNS photo/Tyler Orsburn)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who don\u2019t like the pro-life movement often say it can\u2019t really be concerned about the baby. Its concern stops at birth, they say, so it must have a hidden agenda, like oppressing women\u2014especially poor minority women.\nTaken literally, the complaint makes no sense. The pro-life movement says there is no right to destroy babies before birth, and the same applies after birth. The whole point is to have the same rule in both cases. And why would a movement supported by women more than men\u00a0devote itself to oppressing women? Don\u2019t people have other things to do? And why is opposing the abortion of poor minority babies anti-poor and anti-minority?\nSo the rhetoric can\u2019t be taken at face value. The real complaint is that many people opposed to abortion also oppose a welfare state designed to ensure the well-being of every mother and child. And that, it is thought, proves they don\u2019t really care about babies, mothers, or poor people.\nFor many the complaint goes farther. They say\u00a0that the true pro-life cause is \u201cwoke\u201d progressivism. After all, in a progressive utopia abortion would disappear, along with inequality, poverty, and prisons. And how pro-life can it be to force women to be pro-life? So non-progressive people obviously can\u2019t be pro-life in any real sense.\nAs such, the complaint reflects beliefs common on the left.\nFirst, it reflects the belief that forbidding abortion is extreme. Progressives don\u2019t believe there is an essential human nature, and man is what we make of him. In its earliest stages a baby doesn\u2019t look like a baby, and it can be troublesome to treat it as one, so they see no reason to do so. That makes it hard to decide when to start treating it as a baby, so they put it off until it\u2019s born and they can look at it and decide what it is. To do otherwise, they believe, would be fanatical.\nThat\u2019s certainly a non-Catholic view, so Catholics influenced by it need to reconsider their position. And non-Catholics should ask themselves whether they really want to make respect for human life depend so much on current appearance, abilities, and visibility. We need a solid understanding of human dignity. Can the progressive view supply one?\n\n\n\nThe complaint also reflects the belief that opposition to progressive measures must be motivated by greed, hatred, lust for power, and so on.\nAmong its most ferocious proponents, that belief is no doubt based on projection. Haters think everything is hate. With most people, though, it\u2019s the result of incomprehension. Progressives find it hard to understand how their opponents see things. As a result, when they think something is good, they conclude that those who oppose it simply favor evil.\nSo the real issue is whether a comprehensive welfare state is obviously good. If it is, then there\u2019s something wrong with the position of pro-lifers who don\u2019t favor one.\nFor progressives the point is beyond argument. They accept the technocratic outlook now taken for granted in public life. That outlook tells them that rationality consists in the organized and technically efficient use of resources to satisfy human preferences. And that\u2019s what the welfare state tries to do. Ideally it would create a system that takes care of every human difficulty that seems remediable.\nAs such, its construction is part of the modern attempt to turn the world into a sort of industrial process for maximizing satisfactions. It is also supported by the democratic (or perhaps totalitarian) tendency to identify government action with the action of all the citizens. For government to do something and for me to do it are the same thing.\nFor progressives any limitation on the welfare state is a rejection of the rational and effective way for each of us to help people in difficult situations. They believe it\u2019s obvious what should be done, as obvious as turning up the thermostat when the room is too cold. And rejection of the obvious solution means indifference or malice.\nFor thoughtful Catholics the point hasn\u2019t been so obvious. Servant of God Dorothy Day, for example, looked askance at \u201cHoly Mother the State\u201d and called \u201cthe social security legislation now hailed as a great victory for the poor and the worker \u2026 a great defeat for Christianity.\u201d And Saint John Paul II famously condemned bureaucratization of social welfare in Centesimus Annus:\n\n\n\n\nBy intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the Social Assistance State leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies, which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients.\n\nOne reason they said these things is that they rejected the technocratic view that turns social life into the workings of a machine. Many people say that instead of banning abortion we should abolish the conditions that make abortions happen. That would work if we knew how to abolish human choice.\nBut we don\u2019t. People act on their own and with those around them. They respond to experience, habits, incentives, social ideals, and what they see, but mostly they do what they choose. Hence the traditional concern for subsidiarity and for personal responsibility. Circumstances can mitigate responsibility\u2014some abortions are hard cases for the mother\u2014but they can\u2019t remove it without removing our humanity. \u201cThou shalt nots\u201d are necessary to a life worthy of a human being.\nExperience with welfare systems, social programs generally, and Roe v. Wade itself shows how difficult it is to eliminate human mishaps. Legalize abortion and contraception, and unwed motherhood increases, because the links among mother, father, sex, child, and mutual loyalty disappear. Strengthen the welfare system, so it seems to deal with everything, and other systems\u2014family life, mutual aid, personal responsibility\u2014deteriorate. How could they not? The net effect may or may not be an improvement.\nThe point applies to other progressive demands. Every system has its own logic, and in today\u2019s world the logic of a state system won\u2019t be Catholic or even humane. A state system of education is a system of indoctrination, and state systems of medical care are turning into branches of the biotechnology industry devoted to maintaining human resources, scrapping them when surplus, and providing consumer goods\u2014children, abortions, sex change operations, extended lifespans\u2014when demand, money, and political support are there.\nThe modern state doesn\u2019t care about the good life, its actions are not the actions of the people, and it can\u2019t know what is going on in individual cases. So should Catholics want people\u2019s lives to be ever more integrated with state systems of social welfare? If we\u2019re concerned with the well-being of mothers and children aren\u2019t there things we should be doing instead of promoting such systems?\nMany people in the pro-life movement try to respond to that need. Crisis pregnancy centers are one example, and in my area the Sisters of Life are very active in the effort. And then there is, of course, adoption. Do Catholic critics of the pro-life movement do as much?\nNot everybody can do everything. Life is complicated, people are busy, and you can oppose an obvious gross evil without offering solutions to all related problems. You can oppose a military invasion without proposing solutions that will be accepted to the security and other concerns said to motivate it. Why isn\u2019t something of the sort true of abortion?\n\n\n\nPeople\u2014especially leaders\u2014need to think about the total picture, and we all need to do more out of love of God and neighbor. But that applies to everybody and every issue. So why so much hatred and outright slander on this one? Progressivism now tells us that the key to a better world is replacement of traditional arrangements by a flattened-out globally administered order that looks after all human concerns. That can\u2019t possibly be right. And if you disagree, that hardly means you hate babies, women, minorities, and the poor.\n\n\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

The \u201ctechnocratic\u201d mindset misses all this, because any particular person becomes simply a dot in time along a progressive trajectory\u2013in the same way that any scientific discovery is forever at the mercy of later discoveries. \nThe thing about the Incarnation, and our elevated human nature, is that the eternal doesn\u2019t fit inside of time\u2026\nOur non-technical or poetic, and then theological understanding does not devalue or even abort the eternal in time. Even the social scientist, Max Weber (who had no patience with metaphysics) still asserted that \u201ca work of art [unlike the, yes, useful scientific method] which is genuine \u2018fulfilment\u2019 is never surpassed; it will never be antiquated;\u201d and that \u201cbecause death [has become] meaningless, civilized life as such is meaningless; by its very \u2018progressiveness\u2019 [!] it gives death the imprint of meaninglessness\u201d (\u201cScience as a Vocation,\u201d 1918).\nWith Doctor Seuss (whose works are forbidden! Replaced by gender theory.), \u201ca person is a person, no matter how small.\u201d People become Pro-Life because we also still understand at this late hour that death, too, is not meaningless. \nAnd, as for the \u201cwelfare state,\u201d we actually do support a state that fosters the \u201cwelfare\u201d of its citizens\u2013by sustaining a political and economic environment (more broadly, the \u201cculture of life\u201d) wherein human persons and families and all of society\u2019s members, in this life, can flourish together (Subsidiarity and Solidarity). \nWhat we reject is the meaningless Death Star which by another name is not the \u201cwelfare state,\u201d but the terminal Provider State.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nkjh\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 7, 2023 at 12:11 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nWhy then aren\u2019t you anti-abortion people outraged at in vitro fertilization  (IVF) where thousands of embryos are thrown out. IVF discards embryos all the time and none of you care but a woman gets an abortion, the same thing and everyone is outraged. The reason is that in IVF there is no woman to control and punish for having sex.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeslie\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 15, 2023 at 6:34 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nI am outraged  by it, and disgusted.  It should be illegal.  It is part of a terrible mindset that views a child as an object  \u2013 \u201cI demand to have a baby, it is my absolute right to have a baby!\u201d  \nAdditionally, I am extremely weary of the ongoing whining by people who are so unintelligent that they can say \u201cHaving a baby is such a good thing that it doesn\u2019t matter if embryonic babies are destroyed in the process of IVF,\u201d and also \u201cHaving a baby is a punishment for women for having sexual intercourse,\u201d and don\u2019t see the contradiction.  Or else they subscribe to the evil notion that a person is worthy of life only if he is \u201cwanted,\u201d which is disgusting.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJack Williamsen\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 23, 2022 at 7:22 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nFor some time it has been difficult for me not to think that \u201cpro life\u201d equals \u201cpro fetus.\u201d I have read a bazillion articles on the evils of abortion, but many fewer (close to none) written by \u201cpro life\u201d advocates on the evils of poverty and the possibility of abuse faced by poor mothers and their infants. If \u201clife\u201d really is a \u201cseamless garment\u201d that continues from conception to death, it would seem to be long overdue for those who profess to be \u201cpro life\u201d to demonstrate their recognition of this proposition through publications such as this one and\nthrough helpful actions designed to support life after birth.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCarl E.

Similarly, would you agree that you cannot be against rape unless you do X, Y, and Z for rape victim? As I pointed out recently, \u201can objectively true and morally upright stance is not invalidated or swept away because Pro-Lifer Smith doesn\u2019t do X, does Y, or fails to pay lip service to Z.\u201d But, on this issue, apparently you have to be Mother Theresa, walk on water, and spend 25 hours a day doing things that few if any liberals/progressives do, even while they demand it of pro-lifers.\nNot only are there numerous pregnancy crisis centers run by various Christians groups, there are countless individuals who help young mothers in all sorts of ways. You rarely hear about this sort of work, I\u2019m certain, because not only is it \u201cboring\u201d, it doesn\u2019t fit the dominant narrative of pro-lifers as being only \u201cpro-fetus\u201d.  But that narrative is not only cliche, it\u2019s also convenient, as it is employed to undermine or even malign good people doing good things in a culture too often fixated on sensationalism and political targeting.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbrineyman\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 23, 2022 at 9:07 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nMr. Williamsen, what you\u2019re saying makes perfect sense. \nBut you\u2019re not including the fact that many pro-lifers fail to floss their teeth, insist upon tipping their waiters less than fifteen percent, and allow their children to go outside to play before making their beds. \nSo \u2014 quite obviously \u2014 you should be allowed to kill as many babies as you like, whenever and however you like. \nIt\u2019s only logical.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeter D.

THIS INCLUDES PRISONS AND THE BARBARIC NOTION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT\u2013which, by the way, the piece above failed to address. The Holy Father has made the Church\u2019s duty clear. And this includes opposition to ALL war. Consistency, people: consistency. That is the theological idea of the seamless garment and yet anger, revenge and so-called \u201cstate retribution\u201d still enthrall many Catholics. Sad. Mr. Beaulieu has appointed himself The Grand Inquisitor. Also\u2013don\u2019t paint all \u201cprogressives\u201d with the same brush.

Destroying life selfishly and arbitrarily simply because it is inconvenient is a grave moral evil. Honoring the rule of law and administering the appropriate punishment for a heinous act is necessary as a matter of justice. Portraying murderous criminals as victims dishonors the actual victims.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDavid Paul Deavel\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 23, 2022 at 12:49 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nSee my new piece on Denny and Margee Adrian.

That\u2019s one of the points of my piece. If that\u2019s your view it\u2019s easy to write articles for opinion and general-interest publications describing what the right program would be. So it\u2019s not surprising progressive publications publish a lot of articles doing just that.\nOthers think how people deal with each other and how they end up in life are complicated and impossible to control in any detail. People, after all, have agency. They note, for example, that crime and family disruption shot up, and long-term progress reducing poverty stopped came to an end, in the wake of the progressive reforms of the 1960s.\nThat was another point of my piece.\nSo non-progressive publications are much less interested in grand schemes to deal with such problems. They\u2019re more likely to worry about improving education, family stability, and the general level of opportunity \u2013 hence the interest in cultural issues and in economic freedom \u2013 and sometimes in particular personal and local projects like crisis centers and adoption.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRobert Mazzeo\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 27, 2022 at 6:28 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRegarding your last sentence, Mr. Williamsen, very many of us actually DO support mothers, children, and families after birth.

Thus, we have funding of Planned Parenthood. and other organizations that are in conflict with fundamental Catholic moral teaching.

To begin with the system is bankrupt with money being replaced by government IOU\u2019s.  That money is being paid back with taxpayer funds.  Too many funds were used for purposes other than those originally stated when medicare was put into effect.

Just like Saint Mother Teresa was attacked for not being able to end all poverty. Evil is always using deceptions. It did so in the Garden of Eden, and it attacked Christ, even accusing him of allowing a woman to \u201cwaste\u201d expensive oil to anoint Him, when it could have been sold to give to the poor. These tactics of Evil are always using deceptions. The pro-abortion side could give a wit about funding poor women. It\u2019s all fake concern for the poor. Just look at the pro abort\u2019s personal donations. They give very little to the poor. Every pro-lifer could give all their money away, and still you would be attacked for not doing enough. It\u2019s all a fake argument. They don\u2019t mind spending other people\u2019s money by way of taxation. But they never give their own money away. The real issue at hand is a complete attack against God. Many pro-aborts are upset that women have to bear the burden of pregnancy. They think that it is not fair and that men got off easy. They are angry that men don\u2019t have to carry babies and give birth. God has not treated them as being equal in their eyes. The only way to fix this injustice and to remove the burdens of childbearing is the right to abortion. Period. No matter what the pro-life side does, or says, it will never be enough. It\u2019s not really about hard cases. It\u2019s not really about poverty. It\u2019s about creation. At its core it\u2019s a rebellion against God\u2019s created order. Their real anger is at God. And it is pure Evil at its root. Debating those promoters of abortion will get you nowhere and is a waste of time. As Christ said, some Evil is only driven out by prayer AND FASTING. Yes, we must make sure women and children who face poverty are taken care of. But not out of any appeasement of the pro-aborts, but out of our obligation as Catholics, to feed the poor, and take care of the widow and orphan.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJohn Hinshaw\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 24, 2022 at 8:22 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAs one who has worked daily with the poor and disabled for 35 years, I have always found Pro-Lifers to be more compassionate toward the marginalized than the social workers and \u201cprofessionals\u201d paid to help them.

Dorothy Day, a sort of anarchist, would have gone much farther.\nWhich leads to the real point of the piece, that failure to prescribe how a world should be brought about that would work better for mothers, fathers, children, and families does not demonstrate pro-life hypocrisy.\nThat\u2019s an extraordinarily difficult question in a world as radically adverse to such things as our own, and good-faith answers will differ wildly.

The left might be able to achieve some good things in the welfare rolls but this area is getting more challenging and it can\u2019t be addressed with generalizations.

Concentrations of unaccountable power so great that it ends up corrupting those who wield this power. A government that becomes the people\u2019s totalitarian master. The U. S. Constitution is structured to decentralize power and create the separation of powers to safeguard the people from such governmental usurpations and abuses of power.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmeiron\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 2, 2022 at 3:45 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nHuman life typically begins in the womb and ends in a tomb.  \nAborted human fetal tissue, on the other hand, may end in a lab where, preserved in extremis, it may undergo (sans \u2018choice\u2019) scientific testing and observation, including but not limited to interspecies genetic manipulation.  It may also end in the medical waste incinerator.  \nAborted human fetal tissue has no tomb or funeral where Catholics could honor its life and untimely death so as to perform a work of mercy.  Mercy.\nCatholics are blamed for wanting a child to be born alive.  Then Catholics are accused, preemptively and hypothetically, of not rendering due charity to the lives of other fellow human beings.

It is highly doubtful that they shared with Herod or Caesar and Herod and Caesar likely didn\u2019t share with them (as they would rather have them dead).  Jesus himself distinguished between giving to Cesar and giving to God (Who Is Charity).  Peter says to have charity \u201camong yourselves\u201d (1Peter4:8).\nGovernment-sponsored social \u2018welfare\u2019 programs create more ill than they claim to solve.  \nHas anyone ever heard more than a rare note of \u2018thanks\u2019 from government beneficiaries?

Particularly when it hobbles the messaging in the media forum while the its proponent is channeling its own conclusions in the log rolling forum.\nWhere the conclusions being crafted are well less than desirable; and hardly anything like optimum.\nI don\u2019t mean to diminish abortion. Abortion has to be established as intrinsically evil regardless of whatever anyone tries to scale it against; and it could be that the pro-life side in the log rolling forum has been regularly naive or inconsistent or too easily coyed or it is just too softy-softy.\nYou must not trade on abortion. Never. What you have to do is jawbone things on their own terms.\nWelfare state is an archaism. The left might be able to achieve some good things in the welfare rolls but this area is getting more challenging and it can\u2019t be addressed with generalizations. In the public forum the generalizations should get called out more and more by specifics within the subject matter.\nFor example, I see nothing in principle standing against people having more than one medical insurance plan with mixtures in self-pay, group plan, tax credits and partial subsidy direct/indirect, etc.; where multiple separate and different medical resource groups are open to them.\nAt which point the problem with the killing of children in the womb would still be the problem of evil!\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTimothy\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 18, 2022 at 12:04 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nIn what follows I assume Catholic Social Teaching is the best possible guide and I also assume that all Catholics have an obligation to receive its continued developments with the submission of mind and will of which the Catechism speaks about the ordinary magisterium:\n(1) In each of the two major U.S. parties there is a union between elements of Catholic Social Teaching and that which opposes it.\n(2) Catholic Social Teaching opposes legal abortion, supports legal protection of innocent human life, supports school choice, opposes same sex marriage and gender ideology. This is clearly a problem for many Catholic Democrats.\n(3) Catholic Social Teaching does not oppose things like social welfare systems, worker unions, welcoming of immigrants, progressive tax rates, climate change concerns but requires a judicious and prudent implementation and support which involves the complementary principles of subsidiarity and solidarity. This is clearly a problem for many Catholic Republicans.  \n(4) The willingness of individual Catholics to prefer their political allegiance above their Catholic seems to me a pervasive moral and spiritual evil.  \nThank you for your consideration.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmark seldon\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 6, 2023 at 8:32 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe Church has been covering up sexual abuse of chidren for roughly 2000 years.

The bottom line is this, if women don\u2019t have paid parental leave, can\u2019t afford childcare or housing, they are going to get abortions no matter what the law says. Any pregnant woman can go online and order pills and they do so all the time in abortion ban states. It is now common for women who are not pregnant  to order pills and keep them on hand just in case in many states  that have banned abortion. Conservatives and religious people usually oppose paid parental leave, low cost partly subsidized childcare despite the fact that numerous countries have these things. The USA is probably the hardest country in the developed world to be a mother in thanks to anti-abortion people and the religious right conservative. I\u2019m not saying we should have a Swedish welfare state, that would be too costly however we could do a lot more to make raising kids easier. So you anti-abortion people can pass all the laws you want and women will still get abortions.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCarl E.

It\u2019s the truth, thousands of embryos in in-vitro are discarded at IVF clinics all the time, yet the anti-abortion people don\u2019t care. Nobody is outside and IVF clinic screaming at people or threatening doctors or trying to have it outlawed.  Yet a woman goes to a clinic has the embryo discarded, same thing and all of you religious people are outraged. Why is that???   It\u2019s the religious right\u2019s modern day version of \u201ckeep them barefoot and pregnant\u201d however if they come out and say that, they look sexist. Abortion is perfect for them, they can fake concern for a \u201cbaby\u201d and look righteous while trying to keep women barefoot and pregnant. They believe a woman\u2019s ONLY purpose is to procreate and they want to force what they think should be her \u201crole\u201d. The religious right also hates women\u2019s equality, these types rant and rave against it so they see anti-abortion laws as taking away women\u2019s freedom and and making it harder for her to get an education or make money thus keeping women down more. Last but not least, they dislike the fact that unmarried women have sex and see them as irresponsible and thus they should not be allowed to escape their \u201cpunishment\u201d which to them is a baby. The religious right really hates the abortion pill because women can safely and easily get around their bans so the icing on the cake for them would be to somehow get rid of the pill and return women to the back alley days, they\u2019d LOVE that. Of course they say very little about men because you know boys will be boys, you don\u2019t see the religious right go after men or try to curtail their bodily autonomy and you don\u2019t see them caring a whit about a baby after it is born, quite the opposite, the religious right opposes anything that would make it easier to have and raise kids like paid parental leave. The religious right doesn\u2019t care if embryos are discarded in IVF because the woman is doing what any woman should do, trying to fulfill her one and only purpose to be a mother, there is also no woman to control or punish for having sex so they couldn\u2019t care less. The anti-abortion movement is largely about women\u2019s roles, anti-woman\u2019s rights, controlling women and punishment for women. I find it\u2019s mostly males that are hung up on this though some women too. I\u2019m a female of child bearing age and I\u2019ll tell you religious right people you will NOT keep me or any other woman down as much as you\u2019d like to.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nkjh\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 7, 2023 at 12:20 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAny pregnancy and birth can unexpectedly cause serious or life threatening complications, now most don\u2019t but on occasion they do. Many births are c-sections which is major abdominal surgery. I don\u2019t believe life begins at conception but hypothetically even if it did it wouldn\u2019t matter. Why? In no other instance, can someone use somebody else\u2019s body to stay alive. No already born person could force that on another. We would never pass a law demanding that a father be forced to undergo surgery to give his son a kidney to save his life, he couldn\u2019t even  be forced to give blood. We can\u2019t even get organs to save lives from a corpse unless that person gave consent why they were alive. Yet we say that a woman should be forced to possibly risk her life and health and undergo major surgery to keep a fertilized egg when nobody can say when \u201clife\u201d begins as everyone has differing views on it. The anti-abortion movement does not see women as equal human beings but second class citizens who don\u2019t really own their bodies. If men got pregnant and had these risks, do you think we would have anti-abortion laws? The answer is absolutely not.\n\nReply \n\n\n \n \n\n                2 Trackbacks / Pingbacks            \n\n\n\nAre pro-lifers really pro-life? \u2013 Via Nova Media \n\nAre pro-lifers really pro-life? \u2013 Catholic World Report - Corruption Buzz \n \nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.All comments posted at Catholic World Report are moderated.
