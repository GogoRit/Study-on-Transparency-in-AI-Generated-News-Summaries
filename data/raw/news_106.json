The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is about granting the proper healthcare to precious babies who have survived botched abortion procedures. I will not allow the intentional suffering and death of any child. All lives are intrinsically valuable and we must do everything to grant children access to their God-given right to live,\u201d Scott said.\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act\u00a0would amend\u00a0the criminal code to \u201cprohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.\u201d Currently, only some states have protections for the survivors; this legislation would set a federal standard.\nScott delivered a powerful speech on the legislation\u00a0last year.\nTo watch the speech in its entirety, click\u00a0here.\nScott also voted for S.3275, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill Scott cosponsored with\u00a0Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC),\u00a0prohibits elective abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Scientific studies show that after 20 weeks of pregnancy, an unborn child is able to experience physical\u00a0pain.\u00a0The United States is one of only seven countries worldwide that allows elective abortion so late in a pregnancy.\nFor more information on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, please click\u00a0here.\n###\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrint\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLike\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPrevious Article \n\nNext ArticleNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nServices\nMedia Center\nContact\n \n\nAbout\nServices\nMedia Center\nContact\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nServices\nMedia Center\nContact\n \n\nAbout\nServices\nMedia Center\nContact\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLeave Your Opinion on Legislation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nX Logo\nX \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nLinkedin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Privacy Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLeave Your Opinion on Legislation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
