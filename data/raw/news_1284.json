These amendments, which were instigated by doctors, are expected to be tabled in parliament early next week.\nAs it stands, Malta has the strictest laws in the bloc, with abortion illegal under any circumstances. In practice, termination of pregnancies that pose a serious threat to the health or life of the woman are \u201calready a standard practice at Mater Dei Hospital [the largest hospital in Malta],\u201d the officials said in a statement. The new amendments would offer \"peace of mind\" to medical professionals, said Buttigieg.Wednesday's announcement comes after an American woman, Andrea Prudente, was refused an abortion in Malta despite the risk to her life. The woman filed a constitutional case against the country\u2019s health minister and parliamentary secretary for reforms and equality. She was eventually able to fly to Spain for further care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Tags\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoctors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealth professionals/workforce\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealth systems\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHospitals\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPatient rights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPatients\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen's Health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Countries\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalta\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUK strikes energy deal with firm linked to Putin\u2019s gas exports\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t21 HRS ago \t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome advice for Russia\u2019s newest opposition leader\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n8 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT FROM ASTRAZENECA\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUrgent call to policymakers \u2013 make chronic kidney disease a public health priority\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Gaza aid ship unloads supplies at besieged enclave\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 16\t\t\n\n3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMore from Sarah-Ta\u00efssir Bencharif\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom cell to cell: Eliminating HIV in prisons\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPresented by Gilead.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJun 27\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe life-or-death fight over car pollution rules\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nEfforts to delay new EU car emission standards risks worsening the bloc\u2019s pollution problem.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMay 10\t\t\n\n5 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEU pharma reform: Winners and losers\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe Commission has published its first major overhaul to the bloc\u2019s medicines regulations in 20 years.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 26\t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBan, ignore or regulate?
