Lindsey Graham introduced on Tuesday a bill that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, the most significant proposal by Republicans in Congress to curtail the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three months ago.\n    \n\n            Senate Democratic candidates immediately tried to link their Republican opponents to Graham\u2019s bill, but the South Carolina Republican defended his legislation as a bulwark against late-term abortions.\n    \n\n            \u201cI think the Democrats made a huge mistake in introducing legislation in Washington that would basically allow abortion up to the moment of birth,\u201d Graham told CNN. \u201cNow we have an alternative to that.\u201d\n    \n\n            The court\u2019s decision in June set off a nationwide scramble to define the legal rights to an abortion, after it found nearly 50 years ago a constitutional right to it. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Senator Susan Glick, author of Senate Bill 1, debates Senator Greg Taylor shortly before the vote to accept Senate Bill 1, which was passed by the House earlier in the day, making the Indiana legislature the first in the nation to restrict abortions, in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. August 5, 2022.

Here's where things stand\n\n\n\n\n            In May, the Senate failed to advance a Democratic bill establishing a federal right to terminate a pregnancy until fetal viability, or later if there\u2019s \u201ca risk to the pregnant patient\u2019s life or health.\u201d (Fetal viability occurs around 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.) Graham\u2019s bill, which has no chance of passing in a Democratic-controlled Senate, provides exceptions for abortions required to protect the life of the mother, and if the woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest.\n    \n\n            Senate Republicans were slow on Tuesday to embrace Graham\u2019s plan.\n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ll look at it,\u201d said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Senate GOP campaign committee.\n    \n\n            Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who is in a tough reelection race, would not directly answer when asked if he backs Graham\u2019s bill. Johnson said abortion laws should be decided by \u201cwe the people\u201d in the 50 states. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision resurrected Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban, which was passed in 1849.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - New Hampshire Republican U.S. Senate candidates from left Bruce Fenton, Chuck Morse, Vikram Mansharamani, Kevin Smith, and Don Bolduc participate in a debate, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022, in Henniker, N.H.

John Thune, the GOP Whip, defended the new legislation, saying it will give GOP candidates a \u201cplace to land\u201d as they get hammered by Democrats on the issue. He said most Republicans favor abortion restrictions, not an outright ban. Thune told CNN he supported the 15-week ban.\n    \n\n            \u201cI would expect there would be pretty good support for that among, you know, pro-life Republicans and maybe some pro-life Democrats,\u201d Thune said. \n    \n\n            \u201cI also think that because the Democrats have tried to convert this into a one-sided argument that represents their singular view of the world, which is all Republicans are for an outright ban,\u201d Thune added. \u201cI think this changes that narrative and gives candidates a place to be for something that reflects their views and doesn\u2019t fit the Democrats\u2019 narrative.\u201d\n    \n\n            But Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership, had a different view of Graham\u2019s bill. \n    \n\n            \u201cI think there are going to be some differences of opinion,\u201d said Cornyn. \u201cMy preference is to have each state handle those issues.\u201d\n    \n\n            Asked why he thought Graham put forward the legislation, Cornyn responded, \u201cAsk Sen. Graham.\u201d\n    \n\n            North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he wanted to \u201cfocus on\u201d inflation \u2013 the Consumer Price Index jumped 8.3% from August 2021 to last month even as gas prices decreased \u2013 and a potential strike by railroad workers.\n    \n\n            \u201cThat\u2019s what we ought to be focusing on,\u201d Tillis added.\n    \n\n            And Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a third GOP member of leadership, said he supported Graham\u2019s previous anti-abortion proposals, but would not answer directly when asked if it was politically advantageous for the GOP to be introducing such a bill before the midterm elections.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Lt.

Pat Toomey, who is retiring. \n\nMichael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThis lingering issue isn't going away for John Fetterman\n\n\n\n\n            The division within the Senate Republican conference in Washington extended to the campaign trail. Herschel Walker, Georgia\u2019s GOP Senate nominee, said he supports a 15-week abortion ban, writing in a statement, \u201cthe issue should be decided at the state level, but I WOULD support this policy.\u201d When asked to clarify whether Walker would vote for a federal bill like Graham\u2019s despite saying the issue should be decided by the states, a spokesman for Walker responded, \u201cSeems clear to me, that\u2019s why it says \u2018support.\u2019\u201d\n    \n\n            But Joe O\u2019Dea, the Colorado Senate Republican nominee, said that he opposed the legislation, calling for Congress to \u201cpass a bill protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose early in pregnancy,\u201d while providing for \u201csensible limits on non-medically necessary, late-term abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n            Senate Democratic candidates immediately seized on Graham\u2019s bill. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who\u2019s running against Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz, asked his opponent if he would support the legislation. He and other candidates including Rep. Val Demings in Florida and New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan quickly touted their own pro-abortion rights view. \n    \n\n            \u201cRepublicans\u2019 national abortion ban will be on the ballot, in every Senate race,\u201d said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman. \u201cThe GOP has shown, once again, the threat they pose to a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions \u2013 and voters will make their voices heard by standing with Senate Democrats in November.\u201d\n    \n\n            It\u2019s unclear if Republicans would put the Graham bill on the Senate floor if they win back the chamber this fall. \n    \n\n            \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d Thune told CNN. \u201cMy expectation, as I said before, is that anything we put on the floor would be at 60 votes, and there aren\u2019t 60 votes, probably for anything at the moment on either side.\u201d\n    \n\n            House Republicans also plan on introducing a 15-week abortion ban bill. House GOP leaders have not committed to putting the measure on the floor if they recapture the majority, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has previously told CNN he supports banning abortions at 15 weeks.\n    \n\n            McCarthy\u2019s \u201cCommitment to America\u201d \u2013 a policy and messaging document that he is formally rolling out next week \u2013 only makes one passing reference to abortion, according to a source familiar with the document.\n    \n\n            The document says Republicans will \u201cprotect the lives of unborn children and mothers,\u201d the source said.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n\nCNN\u2019s Ali Zaslav, Melanie Zanona and Michael Warren contributed to this
