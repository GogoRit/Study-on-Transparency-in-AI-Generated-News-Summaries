Here's how we navigate this moral duty.Trent Horn \u2022 10/7/2020 ShareFaith, Abortion, and Voting, Part 4\u00a0\nIn this series leading up to Election Day, we will explain why\u00a0abortion is the most serious and urgent social issue of our time\u00a0and what this means for Catholic voters. Are we simply free to vote for whatever candidate we prefer, for any reason that\u2019s in our conscience? Or does our right to vote come with objective moral responsibilities that we must consider before casting our ballot?\n\nIn part 3 of this series we talked about principles Catholic voters should observe regarding the preeminent issue of abortion. But are those rules absolute? And what if there is no pro-life candidate?\nEven little decisions we make in life can bring us into contact with evil done by others. For example, a company can take the money I spend in its stores and use it to support immoral causes. Theologians call this moral cooperation with evil, and there are two basic kinds.\nFormal cooperation is when I intend to promote the evil\u2014for example, by giving money to Planned Parenthood so it can perform abortions.\nMaterial cooperation, on the other hand, occurs when I provide some of the means for the evil but don\u2019t intend the evil, such as when I buy goods at a store, and the store donates some of that money to Planned Parenthood.\nCatholics may never formally cooperate with evil, but we may materially cooperate under certain circumstances.\nFirst, our cooperation must be remote, that is, far removed from the evil that it supports. Much of our activity as consumers falls into this category. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not a sin to buy groceries at a store that\u2019s part of a chain that donates to a foundation that supports charities that may fund contraception distribution.\nSecond, there must be a proportionately good reason to justify the cooperation. The good being sought must outweigh the harm caused by our relatively negligible cooperation. Frivolous consumer activity that materially supports a serious evil may not be justifiable even if it is fairly remote.\nIn our previous essays we showed that it is gravely sinful to formally cooperate with abortion. We may never directly vote to support it or vote for a candidate because he will support it. But in rare cases, a Catholic could materially cooperate even in the evil of abortion if the cooperation is remote and there is a proportionately good reason for doing so.\nAs Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI) put it, \u201cWhen a Catholic does not share a candidate\u2019s stand in favor of abortion and/or euthanasia, but votes for that candidate\u00a0for other reasons, it is considered remote material cooperation,\u00a0which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons.\u201d \nThese proportionate reasons would have to show that the candidate who is an alternative to a pro-abortion candidate actually supports more evils of a gravity equal to abortion than that pro-abortion candidate. Since abortion is so grave, this is a very rare circumstance, and accordingly the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops says, \u201cVoting in this way would be permissible only for truly grave moral reasons, not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences or to ignore a fundamental moral evil.\u201d\nThis means that Catholics could not vote for a candidate who endorses an intrinsic evil such as legal abortion merely because they prefer that candidate\u2019s party or because they find the other candidate unlikeable or even morally reprehensible in his personal conduct. And as we noted last time, voting for a pro-abortion candidate also wouldn\u2019t be justified merely because you disagreed with the other candidate\u2019s views on an issue Catholics could reasonably disagree about.\nThe only reason that could justify voting for someone who endorses an intrinsic evil like abortion would be in the super-rare case that the alternative candidate endorsed even worse evils. These issues couldn\u2019t just be other intrinsic evils; they would have to be intrinsic evils that reach a scale that is worse than abortion, which the USCCB calls the preeminent social issue of our time. Thus, a Catholic couldn\u2019t justify voting for a pro-abortion candidate even if the anti-abortion candidate endorsed another intrinsic evil, such as human cloning, that causes far less harm than abortion.\nBut what should we do if two viable candidates in an election both support legal abortion? In this case, a Catholic may vote for the one who, as the USCCB says, is \u201cdeemed less likely to advance such a morally flawed position and more likely to pursue other authentic human goods.\u201d\nFor example, a Catholic could vote for a candidate in spite of his support of legal abortion if the other pro-abortion candidate also wanted to force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions. In this case, the pro-abortion candidate is merely tolerated in order to prevent the election of a candidate who endorses even more evil.\nHowever, if the only relevant difference between two candidates were that one supports the legal killing of unborn human beings and the other does not, then there would be almost no chance there is a proportionate reason to vote for the pro-legal-child-killing candidate.\nBut what if a Catholic thought that the candidate who supports legal abortion would nonetheless, thanks to his other policies, do a better job at reducing abortion rates? Some say that we could vote for a supporter of legal abortion over an opponent of legal abortion if we thought he would better address abortion\u2019s \u201croot causes.\u201d\nIn our last entry, we\u2019ll see if this reason stands up to scrutiny.\n\u00a0\nWatch the Video:\n\nDid you like this content?
