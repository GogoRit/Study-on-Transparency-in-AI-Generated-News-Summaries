Wade has brought new attention to a small but growing group of pro-life Christians who identify as \u201cabortion abolitionists.\u201d\nThis vocal minority rejects incremental steps toward outlawing abortion and reserves strong criticism for those who accept anything other than a federal ban equipped with criminal penalties for all involved.\n\u201cThe very foundation of the gospel is the law of God,\u201d said Tom Ascol, the president of Founders Ministries, in a recent documentary from abolitionist group End Abortion Now. \u201cGod defines what\u2019s sin: You shall not murder. And that\u2019s true from the moment of conception until the natural ending of life.\u201d\nAscol is also a pastor who ran for president of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) in June. For two years in a row, abolitionists like Ascol spoke up at the SBC\u2019s annual meeting to push the denomination to take an abolitionist stance.\nIn 2021, they proposed a rigid resolution for \u201cimmediate abolition of abortion without exception or compromise.\u201d It passed only when amended to allow for an \u201cincremental approach,\u201d the opposite of what they wanted. This year\u2019s proposal was not brought for a vote, though several pastors criticized the SBC\u2019s Ethics and Religious Liberty (ERLC) Commission\u2019s campaign to make abortion not just illegal but \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\nThe move to entirely abolish abortion, rather than cut back or adjust laws to restrict the procedure, is inspired by slavery abolitionists like William Wilberforce, who was monumental in ending Britain\u2019s participation in the slave trade in 1807. As a whole, many pro-lifers (not just abolitionists) view abortion as parallel to slavery, in that it treats a particular kind of human being as less than human and undeserving of human rights.\nThe pro-life movement has long contained differing strategies and approaches to the common goal of ending abortion. Before this year\u2019s Dobbs decision, some pro-lifers pushed to prioritize the kinds of state bans not at risk of being shot down by the Court under Roe v. Wade, others wanted to see more restrictive but legally risky \u201cheartbeat bans\u201d move forward on principle, and an abolitionist minority considered more \u201cincrementalist\u201d moves\u2014anything short of an outright ban\u2014as immoral compromise.\nWithout Roe limiting the states, abolitionists have become more outspoken and strident. Christians in the pro-life movement also want to see abortion eliminated but are largely in favor of the intermediary legal steps.\n\u201cWe believe that if full abolition of abortion is possible, then \u2018incrementalist\u2019 and \u2018abolition\u2019 mean the exact same thing,\u201d said Emily Albrecht, a speaker with the Equal Rights Institute (ERI).\nShe noted that abolitionists seek laws that would \u201ccause society to backtrack because they will easily turn into injunctions \u2026 and go to the Supreme Court.\u201d (Already, abortion bans in several states have been temporarily blocked by lawsuits.)\nMost pro-life Christians also want to address the societal factors that lead to abortion and care for women as the \u201csecond victims\u201d when they choose to abort. Abolitionists, however, are more likely to see them as perpetrators, along with the abortionists who perform the procedures. Some abolitionists also reject humane exceptions, like abortion permitted to save the mother\u2019s life.\n\u201cMany women who have abortions are pressured to abort by abusive partners, by family members, or through dire economic circumstances,\u201d said Chelsey Youman, senior legislative director for the Human Coalition, a national pro-life organization. \u201cThese women need care, compassion, and support, not punishment.\u201d\nThe abortion industry, which disproportionately impacts vulnerable demographics (Black women, for example, abort at four times the rate of white women), is the target of pro-lifers\u2019 ire.\n\u201cThey should be held to account for taking advantage of vulnerable women, as well as abusive partners who push them to abort,\u201d said Youman.\nSBC leaders made it clear at this year\u2019s meeting that they do not support criminal penalties against women. \u201cYou are not going to get me to say I want to throw mothers behind bars,\u201d said Brent Leatherwood, acting president of ERLC.\nLeatherwood\u2019s comments align with the dominant narrative of the pro-life movement, which has always been compassion and care for pre- and post-abortive women. Abortion abolitionists, however, say this position is \u201cheretical,\u201d \u201cnot Christian,\u201d and that incremental attempts to eliminate abortion are \u201cunbiblical.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a personal feeling; it\u2019s a moral absolute,\u201d said Dave Arcudi, a self-identified abortion abolitionist from South Dakota, in an interview with Christianity Today. \u201cWe are not making religious decisions but [scientific ones].\u201d\nSome, like Arcudi, aren\u2019t part of a specific abolitionist organization but prefer the terminology in positioning themselves in the fight against abortion. Arcudi also noted that he holds abortionists, not women, criminally responsible for pregnancy termination.\nGregory Diacogiannis, a 38-year-old from Idaho, said he shifted from self-identifying as \u201cpro-life\u201d to \u201cabortion abolitionist\u201d because the former phrasing was too passive. \u201cWe should stop using euphemisms and be forthright with what our goals are,\u201d Diacogiannis told CT. \u201cThe complete and total end to abortion. Period.\u201d\nThough he is an abolitionist, Diacogiannis said he doesn\u2019t hold to the view that women should be charged with a crime either. Many in the movement do support holding women responsible in the name of \u201cequal justice,\u201d however.\nEqual justice is a prevailing phrase in the movement, a call to provide consistent application of the Christian belief that every human being bears God\u2019s image and deserves legal protection. That\u2019s what Alan Maricle, a representative of the group Abolish Human Abortion, said he stands for in holding women accountable.\nMaricle told CT that mothers shouldn\u2019t be treated as \u201chelpless, innocent victims.\u201d Rather, they must take responsibility for their actions. Maricle viewed the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade not as victory but as \u201can ongoing demonstration of tyranny and wickedness,\u201d given they didn\u2019t abolish abortion completely.\n\u201cThey should have said abortion is murder and nobody is allowed to murder anyone according to the Constitution and the law of God,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, they say states can decide if they want to allow murder within their borders.\u201d\nPro-life representatives are quick to push back against the abortion abolition narrative. National Right to Life, one the nation\u2019s largest pro-life organizations, published a public letter signed by over 70 pro-life allies in May declaring that \u201ccriminalizing women is antithetical\u201d to the pro-life charge and that women are victims of \u201ca callous industry created to take lives\u201d\u2014an industry that also denies abortion\u2019s devastating physical and psychological consequences for women.It\u2019s important to note that prior to 1973\u2019s Roe, state laws did not criminalize women who had abortions. Juries of that time considered them \u201cvictims\u201d and sought only to punish abortion providers, so the view of abortive mothers as criminals is rather new.\nAnd though the country has seen more than 63 million abortions since Roe, both grassroots and political pro-life activists have helped lower the annual rate nearly every year since the early 1980s through incrementalist laws and tactics.\nThe SBC\u2019s decision not to allow the abolition resolution to the floor this year shows their resistance, which is important given their massive influence as the largest non-Catholic denomination in the country. Prominent SBC pastor and professor Denny Burk urged Christians away from abolitionists, noting the group\u2019s statement that positions contrary to their own are a \u201ccompromise with evil.\u201d\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is the abolition of abortion,\u201d Burk and seven other academics wrote in a joint essay in Public Discourse. \u201cBut even if we can\u2019t reach that goal today, we are going to take as much ground as we can today and tomorrow and every day until we achieve total victory.\u201d\nThe abolitionist stance for criminalizing the actions of abortive mothers is perhaps the most controversial of positions\u2014one that the majority of pro-lifers reject. Pew Research Center found that only 14 percent of Americans would support jail time for a woman in the case of an illegal abortion.\n\u201cIn our desire for justice for the child, we can\u2019t forget to see the needs of the woman and her value as a person,\u201d said Lauren Green McAfee, founder of Stand For Life and a CT board member. \u201cSeeing the mother as the villain does not uphold and apply a full understanding of the imago Dei.\u201d\nDespite the strong difference in opinion regarding how to eliminate abortion, some pro-lifers retreat from criticizing allies in the comprehensive anti-abortion movement. They worry disunity may distract from the ultimate goal of fewer abortions. Some told CT they even were concerned about highlighting abolitionists in news coverage.Though there are no prominent, national pro-life groups that support abolitionist tactics, abolitionists\u2019 influence could grow in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision. Experts say they\u2019ll be looking for how abolitionist stances influence pro-life platforms in coming elections.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionLaw and LegislationPro-Life Movement\n\nPosted by:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEricka Andersen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust 1, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead These NextRelated\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIndian State Moves to Criminalize Praying for the Sick\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA proposed ban on \u201cmagical healing\u201d is the latest government initiative targeting Christian practice and evangelism in Assam.\r\n\t\t\nSurinder Kaur\nTrending\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter 140 Years, Alliance University Will Close\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFormerly Nyack College, the school was in bad financial shape for several years.
