In Bogot\u00e1's Plaza de Bol\u00edvar alone, between 70,000 and 100,000 citizens gathered, he said.\nAll the country's pro-life associations and people of different religions took part in the marches, which took place in an atmosphere \"of great distress and indignation but at the same time of joy and enthusiasm,\" United for Life said.\nDuring the Feb. 27 rally, a \"Manifesto for the Defense of Life\" was made public, stating that the Colombian people \"are hurt, in great pain, because they don\u2019t accept these five people imposing on the country a death sentence.\"\nColombia \"will not rest until the right to life is restored and guaranteed from the moment of fertilization until natural death.\"\n\u201cThe Colombian people will fight for this disastrous ruling to be annulled. We will use all the legal, political, cultural and social means that the rule of law offers us to precisely restore the right to life, which has been systematically violated by the rulings of the Constitutional Court for decades,\u201d the manifesto states.\nIt also calls on the five judges who handed down the sentence, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Lizarazo Ocampo, Jos\u00e9 Fernando Reyes, Julio Andr\u00e9s Ossa, Diana Fajardo, and the outgoing Alberto Rojas, to \"resign their posts and be removed from any public office, and that they also answer in court before the people for this abuse of power.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe welcome mothers who are going through unexpected or difficult pregnancies and we demand that they be given all the information and support from the State through public policies that allow them to carry their pregnancy to a successful conclusion,\u201d the manifesto continues.\nThe declaration calls on the country\u00a0 \"to rethink the role and function of the Constitutional Court, which has become a body which breaks the balance of powers, destroys the democratic system, constantly and without limits distorts the Constitution that it swore to protect, thus betraying the reason for which it was created, which is fundamentally to safeguard it.\u201d\n\u201cColombia is a country that loves and respects life, that doesn\u2019t want new violence worked up in the offices of the Constitutional Court, especially which allows and promotes the massacre of our unborn babies. We will continue to mobilize until this massacre is stopped,\u201d the manifesto concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nprolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACI Prensa is the Catholic News Agency's sister agency, which was founded in Lima, Peru, in 1980 by Fr.
