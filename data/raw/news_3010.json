Death penalty isn't closure\"With such an obviously flawed criminal justice system, we pro-lifers cannot continue to allow the very real possibility that an innocent person might be executed,\" Rich NathanRich NathanGuest columnistRich\u00a0Nathan is the founding pastor of Vineyard Columbus.Many of my fellow Christians, including those in the Ohio legislature, are pro-life (like me) when it pertains to abortion, but either support capital punishment for convicted murderers or have never really thought about it.Pro-lifer:Pro-lifer: 'I am prepared to stay in it for the long haul.' Work for babies, moms not overI\u2019d like to offer several reasons why we pro-lifers ought to apply our pro-life convictions to capital punishment as well.\u00a0We pro-lifers have always argued that a person\u2019s right to life should not depend upon anyone else\u2019s judgment (whether a mother or her doctor).Right to life is not earnedWe have been unwilling to surrender the right to life to society\u2019s valuation of a person\u2019s \"wantedness\" or potential capabilities. We have always argued that the right to life is not earned so that it could be forfeited, but is instead a gift of God, founded upon God\u2019s image in each of us from conception to natural death.Hamlar: Right to life vs. right to live: Banning weapons, not abortion, saves kids' lives.Our pro-life arguments about the inherent worth of each human being apply to everyone \u2014 whether in the womb, severely disabled, institutionalized due to Alzheimer\u2019s, or convicted of murder.\u00a0But doesn\u2019t the Old Testament support capital punishment?Like the practice of slavery or polygamy, capital punishment was\u00a0a divine accommodation\u00a0to the cultural conditions of the ancient Israelites.It\u2019s important to remember that the Old Testament commanded capital punishment for a variety of crimes including striking or cursing a parent, adultery, rape, oppressing the weak, witchcraft, incorrigible delinquency, and other transgressions.Few today would support executions for these crimes.There simply was no other way in ancient Israel for society to protect itself from criminals. But today, when we can protect ourselves\u00a0without ending a human life\u00a0through other means, such as life in prison without parole, we pro-lifers should always choose a non-lethal alternative.\u00a0Further, in the Old Testament, the land was considered to be polluted by murder.Capital punishment was the way to purify the land. But we Christians believe that all pollution is taken care of by the death of Christ. No other death is necessary to cleanse from sin.\u00a0Limiting\u00a0relentless revengeWhat about \u201can eye for an eye?\"The famous \u201clex taliones\u201d of Exodus 21:24 was originally written\u00a0to limit\u00a0relentless revenge so that a person wouldn\u2019t be killed for stealing a goat. It was not written\u00a0to require\u00a0the actual taking of an eye for an eye or a life for a life.The Old Testament required two witnesses before capital punishment could be carried out to ensure against the execution of innocent people. But\u00a0the execution of innocent people\u00a0is exactly the situation we currently have in America today.Since 1973, 190\u00a0death row inmates have been fully exonerated of all charges and released.\u00a0In Ohio, 11 death row exonerees spent a collective 216 years incarcerated for crimes they did not commit.With such an obviously flawed criminal justice system, we pro-lifers cannot continue to allow the very real possibility that an innocent person might be executed.\u00a0More:Ohio man wins $45 million in lawsuit after being wrongfully imprisoned for 20 yearsOur hearts break for the families of murder victims.As a pastor, I have presided over the funerals of murder victims, including one involving a young mother killed with her two elementary school-aged children.For years, our church did free funerals for murder victims, helped with all funeral expenses, and offered follow up care to family members left behind.Compassion demands that we come alongside of families impacted by murder in their quest for justice. But capital punishment is not compassionate.It does not bring closure to a victim\u2019s family.Rather, it prolongs a family\u2019s agony through the twists and turns of decades-long appeals processes which often result in a different sentence in the end. Pro-lifers including pro-life legislators here in Ohio should abolish capital punishment and become fully pro-life.Rich\u00a0Nathan is the founding pastor of Vineyard Columbus. \u00a0Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper Archives ThisWeek News ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best Events LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.dispatch.com.
