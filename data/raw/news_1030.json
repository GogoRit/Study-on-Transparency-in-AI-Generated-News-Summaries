Wade has advocates, prosecutors and residents of red states facing a legal morass created by decades of often conflicting anti-abortion legislation.\nPoliticians and state government attorneys are trying to sort out which laws and which provisions are in force. And abortion rights advocates who are going to court to protect the right to terminate a pregnancy are finding themselves doing battle on multiple fronts.\nLawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden\u2019s office are going through all the state\u2019s abortion statutes with a fine-tooth comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf.\n\u201cFollowing last week\u2019s decision, part of our subsequent work is to now review Idaho\u2019s existing abortion-related laws and examine them through a post-Roe legal lens,\u201d Graf said. \u201cThat work has commenced and will continue in the weeks ahead.\u201d\nIn West Virginia, the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit challenging an abortion ban that was put on the books in 1882. The organization says the law conflicts with newer ones and so should be void.\n\u201cWe will not stand by while this state is dragged back to the 1800s,\u201d the organization\u2019s legal director, Loree Stark, said in a statement. \u201cEvery day that uncertainty remains about the enforceability of this statute is another day that West Virginians are being denied critical, lifesaving health care.\u201d\nIn Wisconsin, Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a 173-year-old abortion ban, arguing that modern generations never consented to it. The 1849 law prohibits abortion in every instance except to save the pregnant person\u2019s life \u2014 conflicting with Wisconsin laws from the mid-1980s that ban the procedure after a fetus reaches the point that it could survive outside the womb with medical intervention.\nArizona GOP officials disagree over which abortion laws are enforceable. Attorney General Mark Brnovich announced Wednesday that a pre-statehood law banning all abortions is now enforceable, but Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has said a law he signed in March takes precedence over the 1901 ban.\nREAD MORE: Biden supports filibuster exception to protect abortion access\nWhen the Idaho Legislature passed a \u201ctrigger law\u201d in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year, saying the 2020 law would take precedence.\nBut they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes.\nThe 2020 trigger law says specifically that the person seeking the abortion can\u2019t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the abortion provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it\u2019s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how much of it survives, because of all the conflicts,\u201d Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs said of the nearly three dozen anti-abortion laws on the books in Idaho.\nIt will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out.\nUltimately, he expects Idaho legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\u201cI think every state doing this is going to have the same problems,\u201d Loebs said.\nIt all means a lot of juggling for abortion rights advocates.\nPlanned Parenthood is suing over both of Idaho\u2019s newer laws. It has asked the Idaho Supreme Court to hear arguments in both cases on the same day in early August in hopes of getting a ruling before the trigger law takes effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Pro-life activists counter-demonstrate as pro-choice activists participate in a \"flash-mob\" demonstration outside of the US Supreme Court on January 22, 2022 in Washington, DC. - January 22 marks the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that established the constitutional right to abortion care in the United States.
