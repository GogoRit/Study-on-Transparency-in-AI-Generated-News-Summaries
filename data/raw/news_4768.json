In that time, a concerted effort to place anti-abortion views at the core of the religious right has succeeded in rallying conservative Christians against reproductive rights.AdvertisementBut the success of the Christian anti-abortion movement has overshadowed another group of religious Americans: those who say that the right to abortion is part of their religion. This group includes Jews, Muslims, and even Christians who believe their faith allows\u2014and sometimes even requires\u2014abortion under certain circumstances. They say the right to abortion is a constitutional one, protected not only by the right to privacy, but by the freedom to exercise religion.\u201cThere's a lot of folks who are pro-choice or support reproductive dignity and freedom because of their faith and not in spite of it,\u201d said Rev. Katey Zeh, an ordained Baptist minister and CEO of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.As Roe v. Wade is threatened by increasingly restrictive state bills and a Supreme Court stacked against reproductive rights, pro-choice Jews, Muslims, and Christians may soon be forced to come to the legal defense of abortion in a way its never been argued before: as a religious right.Abortion as a religious right in JudaismThe clearest argument for abortion as a religious liberty belongs to the Jewish faith. Eighty-three percent of Jewish Americans say abortion should be legal, which makes them the most pro-abortion group of all affiliations, including the non-religious.\u201cThis isn't something that's a huge controversy in the Jewish community,\u201d said Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, who has authored two books on sex and feminism within Judaism. \u201cIt is universally understood that there are times when abortion is actually required, according to Jewish law.\u201d This is the case when a pregnant person\u2019s life is in danger. In that circumstance, there is consensus among Jewish decisors (rabbis who decide on matters in Jewish law) that an abortion is not just allowed but is necessary.Advertisement\u201cAs long as the unborn remains a fetus, it does not have a status of personhood equal to its mother, and therefore may be sacrificed to save the life of the mother,\u201d wrote scholar and researcher Rabbi Yehuda Shurpin. In Judaism, the fetus is regarded as a part of the mother, \u201clike a hand or a foot,\u201d Rabbi Ruttenberg said.These positions are largely based on Oholot 7:6, which reads:A woman who was having trouble giving birth, they cut up the fetus inside her and take it out limb by limb, because her life comes before its life.In this circumstance, if the government were to deny an abortion to a Jewish person, many Jewish authorities argue that the government would be preventing them from exercising the duties of their faith. \u201cIf you make it impossible for them to have this procedure then you are saying that your law is more important than my life, your law is more important than my traditions and commandments to our people,\u201d Rabbi Ruttenberg said.While there is a near consensus on abortion in cases where a pregnancy endangers a person\u2019s life, attitudes on abortion in other cases differ among Jewish authorities. Some believe abortion is permissible if having a child will cause a mother extreme suffering or distress, while others prefer to judge circumstances individually.\u201cThere are a lot of even ultra-Orthodox decisors that say if this pregnancy is going to cause the woman pain, suffering of some kind\u2014and there's understanding that sometimes suffering is material, sometimes suffering is mental\u2014that is something that our tradition says is a reason to have an abortion,\u201d Rabbi Ruttenberg said.AdvertisementIn the United States, Reform and Conservative Jewish groups have been strong supporters of the broad legalization of abortion since before Roe v. Wade. The founder of the Jane Collective, one of the first underground abortion access networks, was a Jewish woman named Heather Booth. While Orthodox organizations supporting the broad legalization of abortion are less common, they too have been involved in abortion politics. Notably, in 2016, the ultra-Orthodox group Agudath Israel of America sent a letter to the governor stating their opposition to an Ohio bill that proposed restricting abortion at six weeks. The bill, they said, would violate their religious freedom.Abortion as a religious right in IslamThough perhaps the strongest evidence for abortion as a religious right belongs to Judaism, it is not the only religion under which abortion is permitted.Many Muslims, for example, believe in the permissability of abortion under specific circumstances\u2014though opinions on abortion in Islam vary depending who you ask. \u201cVarious forms of Muslim religious authority don't always agree on the permissibility of abortion and under what circumstances it would be permissible,\u201d said Zahra Ayubi, an assistant professor of gender and Islamic bioethics at Dartmouth College.Still, there are some perspectives on abortion in Islam that are more mainstream than others, like the belief that abortion before the fifth month of pregnancy is permissable. This opinion is largely based on a Hadith that says the ensoulment of a fetus occurs 120 days after conception.AdvertisementSimilar to Judaism, many Muslims also believe in life-saving abortion. \u201cIn a scenario in which there is fatal harm to the mother, I would say a majority of Muslim authority figures would agree abortion would be permissible,\u201d Ayubi said.While there are certainly anti-abortion Muslims, for Muslims who are pro-choice \u201cbecause of their faith and not in spite of it\u201d\u2014as Rev. Zeh put it\u2014banning life-saving abortion or abortion before 17 weeks, or 120 days, could be considered infringing on their religious freedoms. And a reality in which that happens isn\u2019t far-fetched: in 2019, six states passed six to eight week abortion bans that have been blocked from becoming law\u2014so far.Also last year, Alabama, which has one of the highest Muslim populations in the country, passed a temporarily blocked abortion ban that prohibits abortion at all stages of a pregnancy and even in the case of rape or incest, making only one exception for the endangerment of the mother\u2019s life. In response, local and national Jewish groups and figures largely condemned the ban.Like in Islam, many Buddhists and Hindus disagree on the permissability of abortion within their respective religions. Still, the majority of Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus in America support legal abortion.Abortion as a religious right in ChristianityAs Catholicism and evangelicalism dominate the conversation on abortion and religion within the U.S., pro-choice Christian voices, like that of Rev. Zeh, have been drowned out.\u201cAs a follower of Christianity, as a minister of Christianity,\u201d she said, \u201cto me the core message is really about, first of all, love and compassion and care for the neighbor but also really eliminating systems of oppression no matter what kind they are.\u201dThough Christian scripture does not mention abortion specifically, popular attitudes towards abortion in Christianity have changed with the ages, as ordained minister Rebecca Todd Peters points out in her book Trust Women: A Progressive Christian Argument for Reproductive Justice. \u201cAbortion is not a major topic of concern in the church until the late twentieth century,\u201d she writes.It was then that a political\u2014not theological\u2014effort was made by Republicans, specifically Richard Nixon, to recruit Catholic Democratic voters by polarizing the issue of abortion. Evangelicals and Protestants later followed as a result of targeted political campaigns hoping to unite Christians under conservative cultural issues. In the late 1960s, very few evangelical Protestants mobilized alongside Catholics against abortion. Today, 77 percent of white, evangelical Protestants say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, even more than Catholics, who fall at 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center.Rev. Zeh sees her work at the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice as a continuation of her religious tradition. The organization follows in the footsteps of groups like the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a group of Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis who opened a clinic in 1970 in order to provide affordable and accessible abortion to women.In other words, advocacy for abortion as a religious right is not new. The religious right, Zeh said, \u201cdoesn't speak for everybody. But it's almost served as an erasure of the prophetic work that people were doing, you know, before the 1980s. We're trying to disrupt the idea that religion equals anti-choice.\u201dTagged:PoliticsReligionJudaismIslamChristianityreproductive rightsroe v. wadefirst amendmentORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.0AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement\u00a9 2024 VICE MEDIA GROUP"
