Ron DeSantis is poised to sign into a law a bill that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, allowing only for exceptions involving \u201cserious risk\u201d to the pregnant person and fatal fetal abnormality but with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n    \n\n            The Republican-sponsored bill was passed by the state Senate on Thursday night, and was swiftly condemned by President Joe Biden. DeSantis said Friday that he will sign the ban \u201cin short order.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThese are protections for babies that have heartbeats, that can feel pain, and this is very, very late,\u201d DeSantis said at an event in Jacksonville Friday morning. \u201cAnd so, I think when you\u2019re talking about late term, you know, that\u2019s one thing. And so, you know, I think the protections are warranted.\u201d\n    \n\n            The bill makes Florida the latest Republican-led state, along with West Virginia and Arizona, to advance a 15-week abortion ban bill this session. Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a similar Mississippi law that bars abortion after 15 weeks. The fate of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, also hangs in the balance, and anti-abortion activists are hopeful that the court\u2019s conservative majority will strike it down. \n    \n\n            Florida\u2019s abortion bill also adds to the list of recent measures endorsed by DeSantis that strike at sensitive cultural issues, particularly ones involving LGBTQ rights and education, as he continues to solidify his standing as one of the most prominent Republican leaders in the country. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks to reporters after speaking in the Senate Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on February 17, 2022 in Washington, DC. On Thursday, the Senate is trying to pass another short-term spending bill that would fund the government through March 11 and avoid a potential government shutdown.

It allows exceptions if the procedure is necessary to save the pregnant woman\u2019s life or avert \u201cserious risk of imminent substantial and irreversible physical impairment\u201d to a pregnant woman. \n    \n\n            The bill passed by both chambers would keep those exemptions and add another: if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.\n    \n\n            The more than a dozen amendments proposed by Democrats, including one that would provide an exception for rape and incest, failed.\n    \n\n            Senators voted along party lines 23-15 in favor of the legislation, which, if signed into law by DeSantis, would go into effect July 1.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe have a duty to protect life. This bill safeguards innocent, unborn children with beating hearts, who can move, taste, see, and feel pain,\u201d Republican state Sen. Kelli Stargel, who was the bill\u2019s main sponsor in the Senate, said in a statement.\n\n\n            Democrats were quick to voice their opposition, with Biden calling the bill \u201cdangerous\u201d in a tweet Friday morning.\n    \n\n            \u201cMy Administration will not stand for the continued erosion of women\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d Biden said. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, called the legislation \u201cextreme by any standard.\u201d\n    \n\n            Florida Democratic House members called it \u201ca direct assault on the people of Florida and our constitutional rights,\u201d and Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, said that the measure would roll back a basic dignity for women. \n    \n\n            \u201cMore troubling is rejecting exceptions for rape and incest, even for young girls. Abortion is a deeply personal decision, and silencing that decision is outrageous and wrong,\u201d she said on social media.\n    \n\n            If enacted, the bill would be the strictest law on abortion in the state\u2019s history, according to Planned Parenthood. \n    \n\n            Florida now joins West Virginia and Arizona as conservative-led states advancing a 15-week abortion ban bill this session, one of several controversial bills the Republican-led legislature is pushing.\n    \n\n            State GOP lawmakers have advanced a bill, dubbed by opponents as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, that would prohibit schools from \u201cencouraging\u201d talk of sexual orientation and gender identity in some classrooms. Another bill that DeSantis backs would shield people from feeling \u201cdiscomfort\u201d or \u201cguilt\u201d based on their race, sex or national origin.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated to add
