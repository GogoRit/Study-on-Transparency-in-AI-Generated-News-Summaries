This is why we put ourselves through the pain and the trauma over and over again to share our experiences and the harms caused by these awful laws.\u201dTexas women give harrowing testimony on impact of extreme abortion banRead moreMangrum\u2019s decision said the injunction would run until the completion of the case, which is scheduled for a trial to begin next March.However, the first assistant attorney general Brent Webster said in a statement that the state\u2019s appeal \u201cstays an activist Austin judge\u2019s attempt to override Texas abortion laws pending a ruling by the Texas supreme court\u201d.The immediate impact of Mangrum\u2019s decision was unclear in a state where all abortion clinics have shut in the past year.The challenge to the state law is believed to be the first in the US brought by women who have been denied abortions since the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v Wade, which for nearly 50 years had affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion.In a six-page ruling, the judge found that portions of the abortion law violated the rights afforded to pregnant people under the Texas Constitution.The court found that the patients who were challenging the law each experienced \u201cemergent medical conditions\u201d during pregnancy that risked their health or lives \u201cand required abortion care\u201d.However, they were delayed or denied access to such care because of widespread uncertainty about the impact on physicians, the ruling said.\u201cToday\u2019s ruling should prevent other Texans from suffering the unthinkable trauma our plaintiffs endured,\u201d said Nancy Northup, the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which helped bring the lawsuit.During two days of emotional testimony in an Austin courtroom, women gave accounts of learning their babies would not survive birth and being unable to travel long distances to states where abortion was still legal.The challenge, filed in March, does not seek to repeal Texas\u2019s abortion ban, but aims to force more clarity on when exceptions are allowed under the law, which is one of the most restrictive in the US.In Texas, doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to $100,000. Opponents say that has left some women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy.The majority of US adults, including those living in states with the strictest limits on abortion, want it to be legal at least through the initial stages of pregnancy, according to a poll released in late June by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Explore more on these topicsAbortionTexasWomennewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUS\u00a0appeals court upholds restrictions on abortion pill access16 Aug 2023Girl, 13, gives birth after she was raped and denied abortion in Mississippi14 Aug 2023Texas questions rights of fetus in prison guard lawsuit despite arguing opposite on abortion12 Aug 2023\u2018Ohio saw through the con\u2019: abortion rights advocates celebrate Issue 1 result9 Aug 2023Republicans pushed a special election in Ohio \u2013 what does it mean for abortion rights?8 Aug 2023Judge blocks Idaho from prosecuting doctors who refer patients out of state for abortions1 Aug 2023Republicans target abortion pill access as government shutdown threat looms25 Jul 2023\u2018They railroad them\u2019: the states using \u2018fetal personhood\u2019 laws to criminalize mothers25 Jul 2023Group using \u2018shield laws\u2019 to provide abortion care in states that ban it23 Jul 2023Why\u00a0Maryland became a haven for abortion care after Roe\u2019s fall22 Jul 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
