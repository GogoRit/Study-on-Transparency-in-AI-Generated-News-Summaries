Madeleine Dean on recent pro-life bills passed by red states. MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace was in total agreement with her Democrat guest on Thursday that Florida\u2019s 15-week-abortion ban was \"extreme\" and \"grotesque.\"    The bill signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., prohibits abortions after 15-weeks of pregnancy, which is during the second trimester of pregnancy. Recent polls show the majority of Americans believe that abortions should be illegal once in the second trimester.However, Wallace claimed this was a radical move by the GOP.  ACTIVIST SLAMMED FOR PUSHING ABORTION \u2018BEDTIME STORY\u2019 ON HER NIECES: \u2018THIS WON\u2019T END WELL\u2019  \"As the United States Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade as soon as next month, Republican state legislators are rushing to pass abortion bans. And these bans are becoming more and more extreme. Today, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban into law. It contains a chilling requirement that all abortions must be reported to the state along with the reason why they were performed, all of them,\" Wallace said.Citing other abortion laws passed in Kentucky and Oklahoma, the MSNBC host asserted that because these particular laws didn\u2019t provide exceptions for rape and incest, this was a \"sign of the growing extremism in the current version of the Republican Party.\" \u00a0According to the Guttmacher Institute, a majority of abortions are not due to rape and incest, which are reportedly only 0.5% to 1% of cases.  MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace pondered Monday if it\u2019s time to label it a \"failure\" that more kids haven\u2019t gotten the COVID vaccine.\u00a0 (NBC Universal/Getty)  Her guest, Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., decried the recently passed GOP laws as \"grotesque\" decisions made by \"predominantly male\" legislators who don\u2019t understand \"what abortions services are\" and that have \"nothing to do with health care.\".\"\"[T]hey have nothing to do with health care. They have nothing to do with the laws or the constitutional right to abortion, to abortion services because abortion services are health care services. These are cynical, grotesque, lacking in compassion and understanding of what abortion services are,\" Dean said.\u00a0  DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER CALLS REPUBLICANS \u2018THE MOUTHS OF A CULT\u2019 THAT HAS NO AGENDAAfter the pair agreed these laws would disproportionately harm poor women and women of color, Wallace pleaded for Democrats to codify Roe v. Wade because \"women are suffering.\"  \"Women are suffering, and\u00a0women will suffer.\u00a0Democrats control the House and\u00a0the Senate and the White House.\u00a0Does it -- are there\u00a0conversations behind the scenes?\u00a0Are these bills changing the\u00a0priorities for you in Congress\u00a0to try to do something\u00a0legislatively?\" she asked.    Agreeing that codifying Roe was the next step for the Senate, Dean asserted these laws would cause women to die, with no pushback from Wallace.\"Something I want to turn on its head because I'm so tired of it is the governor in Oklahoma, when he signed the bill, he said 'I want this to be the most pro-life state in the nation.' This is not a pro-life bill. In fact, it will risk and cause the death of women. This is not pro-life,\" she insisted.  Anti-abortion rights activists protest outside the Supreme Court building, ahead of arguments in the Mississippi abortion rights case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, in Washington, December 1, 2021.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)Dean predicted \"abortion rights\" will be the focus of the upcoming midterm elections.    \"But I fear \u2014 I hope the Supreme Court does not overturn or handicap and cripple Roe v. Wade. But if it does, this election cycle will be about abortion \u2014 constitutional abortion services,\" she said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile the media focuses on Republican laws restriction abortions, Democrat pushes to increase abortions do not draw the same media fervor or attention. In Maryland this week, Democrat lawmakers overrode Republican Governor Larry Hogan\u2019s veto, to allow health practitioners who are not medical doctors the right to perform abortions in the state.\u00a0  In Colorado, the state\u2019s Democrat governor signed a law making abortion a \"fundamental right\" for \"pregnant individuals,\" while explicitly denying any rights to the unborn.\u00a0  Kristine Parks is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.
