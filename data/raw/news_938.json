In response, the ACLU of Nebraska is again urging state senators to respect Nebraskans\u2019 rights by leaving medical decisions to patients and their health providers.\nToday, Nebraska State Senator Suzanne Geist introduced LB1086, which would further restrict access to medication abortion care by limiting the window in which medication abortion pills can be prescribed. It would also add new reporting requirements and subject doctors to felony charges for violations of its provisions.\nThe new bill follows introduction of LB933, a\u00a0so-called trigger ban\u00a0that would ban abortion entirely if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns\u00a0Roe v. Wade, and LB781, a bill that would\u00a0ban abortions at about six weeks of pregnancy, before many Nebraskans know they are pregnant. LB963, a bill that would allow health workers to deny care based on personal beliefs, could also create new barriers to abortion.\nACLU of Nebraska Legal and Policy Counsel Scout Richters said each bill has a common theme: politicians shaming Nebraskans and pushing their personal\u00a0 beliefs on the individual healthcare decisions of those needing abortion care.\n\u201cThis is another attack on our rights and access to medical care,\u201d Richters said. \u201cMedication abortion is safe, effective and FDA-approved with a decades-long track record. While access to medication abortion is\u00a0expanding nationally\u00a0because of its efficacy and safety, Nebraska politicians are trying to move our state backwards. This measure would fall hardest on those who are struggling financially, people of color, young people and those who live in rural areas. The bottom line is that no one can know someone else\u2019s personal circumstances. That\u2019s why health, not politicians, should drive important medical decisions. Lawmakers need to stop restricting abortion care and stop judging and shaming Nebraskans who need it.\u201d\nThe ACLU of Nebraska opposes any interference by politicians in Nebraskans\u2019 reproductive rights and\u00a0supports efforts to repeal politically motivated and medically unnecessary state restrictions. The Guttmacher Institute, a national reproductive and sexual health research and policy organization, currently\u00a0categorizes Nebraska as hostile to reproductive rights\u00a0based on the significant\u00a0current abortion restrictions in the state.\nThe Pew Research Center reports a majority of Nebraskans believe\u00a0abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nReady to help fight?\nSend an email to your state senator with our action form\u00a0at this link.
