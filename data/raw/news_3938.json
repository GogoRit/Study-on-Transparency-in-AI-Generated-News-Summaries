The mental energy would be too draining and jeopardize reproductive health. And if women do not have the physical capacity to defend the United States, they should have no involvement in determining its policies.\n\nWomen\u2019s History Month at UC San Diego\nJoin in a series of events celebrating the contributions of diverse women.\n\nFebruary 28: The Black Studies Project presents NYT bestselling poet and MacArthur fellowship recipient Claudia Rankine, who will speak on \u201cThe Racial Imaginary at Work, Poetry and the Visual Arts.\u201d\nMarch 4: Untold Stories: Black Women and the Vote will feature filmmaker Robin Hamilton and highlight the activism of two black women who fought to secure the right to vote.\nMarch 6: Attend a Gender Buffet with special guest Maryam Zaringhalam, who will speak on \u201cHarnessing the Power of Wikipedia to Promote Women in STEM.\u201d\nMarch 7: Join the International Women's Day Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon to help create and improve Wikipedia pages for women in academia\u2014only 18.2 percent of English Wikipedia biographies feature women\u2014with a keynote by Maryam Zaringhalam.\nMarch 11: Watch \u201cToni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,\u201d an intimate film on the life and works of the legendary storyteller and Nobel prize-winner.\n\nLearn more by visiting the Women\u2019s Center website.\n\nThese were the widely accepted (and completely false) beliefs that permeated the ideology of the United States in the middle of the 19th century as women across the nation began to mobilize and demand their right as citizens to vote. It took eight decades and three generations of women to convince Congress to pass the 19th Amendment in June 1919 and implement the law in August 1920.\nBut as we celebrate the centennial of the historic achievement, it is important to remember that not all women benefitted. It would take another 45 years and the passage of the Voting Rights Act before black women became truly enfranchised. Despite the significant contributions of black women in making the 19th Amendment a reality, their role is often unsung.\n\u201cWe often think about the heroes of the women\u2019s suffrage movement as being people like Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton, but we forget or pay less attention to some of the equally important women of color leaders like Sojourner Truth, a former slave, educator Mary Church Terrell or journalist Ida B. Wells,\u201d explained Sara Clarke Kaplan, an associate professor of Ethnic Studies and director of Critical Gender Studies at UC San Diego.\nShe continued, \u201cThese are people who fought every step of the way, marched at every rally\u2014even when they were told they had to march at the back\u2014created their own organizations and continued to fight for universal suffrage after being denied twice.\u201d\nKaplan is a scholar of historical and contemporary black feminist thought. She co-leads the UC San Diego Black Studies Project with Dayo Gore, chair of the Department of Ethnic Studies.\nBridges burned\nAfter the Civil War, what began as a united front to achieve voting rights for all citizens in the U.S. eventually diverged into separate campaigns for black men\u2019s suffrage versus white women\u2019s suffrage. Although they attempted to join and participate in both, black women were often excluded from white women\u2019s organizations and activities. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was created in 1890, and the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) launched in 1896.\n\u201cThe passage of the 19th Amendment took longer because white women suffragists refused to work in solidarity with black women suffragists, alienating and treating them as second class citizens,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cIt was a set of race and gender-based political struggles that were at times collaborative and at times in huge conflict around this question of who has access to rights of full citizenship.\u201d\n\nMary Church Terrell, a teacher and civil rights activist, helped launch the National Association of Colored Women in 1896 and led the organization for the next four years, with a goal of attaining women\u2019s suffrage and achieving civil rights for all black women and men.

When the 19th Amendment was proposed, U.S. Senators were in opposition because they feared it would require the 15th Amendment to be enforced.\nKaplan explained that whereas white suffragists focused primarily on achieving gender equity, black suffragists were driven to improve civil rights for all people\u2014including gender, race and class equity. At a NAWSA convention on Feb. 10, 1900, black suffragist Mary Church Terrell spoke about the unfairness of some inheriting voting rights simply because of their gender or race.\n\u201cThe elective franchise is withheld from one half of its citizens, many of whom are intelligent, cultured and virtuous, while it is unstintingly bestowed upon the other, some of whom are illiterate, debauched and vicious, because the word \u2018people,\u2019 by an unparalleled exhibition of lexicographical acrobatics, has been turned and twisted to mean all who were shrewd and wise enough to have themselves born boys instead of girls, or who took the trouble to be born white instead of black,\u201d said Terrell, as quoted in the Washington Post.\nUnfinished work\n\u201cThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\u201d The 19th Amendment became law in 1920, yet almost immediately, barriers were enacted in the South to prevent black women from taking part in elections. Kaplan explained that it was not until the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 that both black men and women were afforded access to the polls. In 1975, an Amendment was added to prohibit discrimination against language minority citizens, extending overdue voting accessibility to Native, Latinx and other diverse populations.\n\nAlthough the 19th Amendment became law in 1920, it was not until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that many black women\u2014as well as black men\u2014could access the polls without barriers.

A political science and global health major, she serves as the Social Justice Peer Educator Community Liaison at the campus Women\u2019s Center. \u201cIn some states, policies such as restrictive voter ID laws remain that make access to voting difficult, especially for lower socio-economic communities of color,\u201d she said.\nKaplan echoed that there continue to be issues surrounding gerrymandering, or drawing electoral district boundaries based on party lines or valuable voter populations. Voting obstacles remain, from polls closing early to requiring drivers licenses. Kaplan explained that these requirements disproportionately affect women of color, who have the lowest income and often have less flexible work hours.\nUltimately, Kotikawatta has a positive outlook about the future. \u201cI do feel that this generation of women is doing a phenomenal job of advocating for equity and inclusion. Seeing incredible female leaders such as Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and many others in my community, I believe that a lot of intersectional issues women face are finally coming to light and are being discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      You May Also Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Say Hello to TritonGPT\n                             \n\nTechnology & Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Alumna Becomes Newest NASA Astronaut\n\n\n\t\t\t                                 Awards & Accolades\n\t\t\t                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Imaging Tool Advances Study of Lipid Biology\n\n\n\t\t\t                                 Technology & Engineering\n\t\t\t                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadening Access to Bridge the Gap between Data Innovation and Computing Infrastructure\n\n\n\t\t\t                                 Technology & Engineering\n\t\t\t                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Alumna Becomes Newest NASA Astronaut\n\n\n\t\t                                    Awards & Accolades\n\t\t                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Imaging Tool Advances Study of Lipid Biology\n\n\n\t\t                                    Technology & Engineering\n\t\t                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadening Access to Bridge the Gap between Data Innovation and Computing Infrastructure\n\n\n\t\t                                    Technology & Engineering\n\t\t                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Say Hello to TritonGPT\n                                \n\n\n\t\t                                Technology & Engineering\n\t\t                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay in the Know\nKeep up with all the latest from UC San Diego.
