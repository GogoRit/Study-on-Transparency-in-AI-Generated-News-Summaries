Brandon Smith/IPB News\r\n\tPlanned Parenthood said it has stopped providing abortions in Indiana despite a last-minute pause on the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\n\r\n\tThat move stems from uncertainty surrounding the ban that was supposed to take effect Tuesday.\n\r\n\tThe ACLU of Indiana, on behalf of abortion providers, filed a last-minute petition with the state Supreme Court, asking it to stop the abortion ban from taking effect while further litigation continues.\n\r\n\tThe ban can\u2019t take effect at least until the court answers that petition, which could take days or even weeks.\n\r\n\tBut Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai\u2019i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky CEO Rebecca Gibron said her clinics aren\u2019t waiting to find out what happens, no longer providing abortions.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not patient-centered care to try to have patients navigate through this chaos and turbulence at the whims of extreme lawmakers,\u201d Gibron said.\n\r\n\tGibron said Planned Parenthood\u2019s 11 Indiana clinics will remain open for other health care needs and to help patients find legal abortion resources.\n\r\n\t\u201cSTI testing and treatment, pregnancy consultation and ultrasounds, cancer screenings, gender-affirming hormone care for people over 18, wellness visits and so much more.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban was set to take effect Aug. 1. Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\r\n\tDr. Katie McHugh, an OB-GYN with Planned Parenthood, said the clinics will also do what they can to help patients seeking abortion care.\n\r\n\t\u201cWe will still be here to help get you the care that you need \u2013 even if that is not with us, even if that is not in our state,\u201d McHugh said.\n\r\n\tGibron and McHugh called the state\u2019s abortion ban \u201cunconscionable\u201d and said Planned Parenthood will not be \u201cintimated,\u201d \u201cbullied\u201d or \u201csilenced\u201d as it continues to provide health care to thousands of patients.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nBrandon is our Statehouse bureau chief.
