And while elective abortions at any point during pregnancy are now illegal in nearly a third of all U.S. states, clinicians and policymakers have sparred over the legality of abortion procedures in cases where a pregnant patient\u2019s life is in danger.\nEven though every state has an exception that allows for an abortion needed to save the life of the pregnant person, some physicians report that the political rhetoric around the issue has caused a chilling effect, scaring doctors away from providing needed emergency care. Many physicians fear that if they provide a medically indicated abortion, they will lose their medical license, be sued, or \u2014 in some states \u2014 be charged with a felony.\nThere have been several nationally publicized incidents where women experiencing pregnancy complications were turned away at hospitals due to fear that performing an abortion would be ruled as illegal. In those highly publicized cases, some of the women went out of state for the procedures; others had to wait until their physical condition deteriorated to receive an abortion; and others carried the pregnancies until their babies with severe \u2014 and, in some cases, fatal \u2014 medical conditions could be delivered preterm.\nTo date, no physician has been criminally prosecuted in any state for providing an abortion that was due to a medical emergency. Still, some doctors say that the exceptions to abortion bans are not clear enough to dissuade their fears of repercussions should they perform an abortion. And some physicians have opted to leave states with abortion restrictions, or even the field of OB-GYN altogether, as AAMCNews reported in August.\nLack of clarity on qualifying exceptions\nIn the flurry of changing legislation on abortion and ongoing court challenges since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization Supreme Court decision last year, many hospital systems and clinicians are uncertain about under which circumstances they can legally perform an abortion, says Molly Meegan, JD, chief legal officer and general counsel for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).\n\u201cThe laws are drafted in a way that is very confusing, vague, and open to interpretation,\u201d she says. \u201cOur doctors are doctors, they\u2019re not lawyers\u2026 without guidance from a hospital or employer, it is almost impossible for a clinician to know what the lines are.\u201d\nAdding to the confusion, each state law varies its wording for exceptions. In Idaho, for example, an abortion is legal if the physician determines in \u201cgood faith medical judgment and based on the facts known to the physician at the time that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d\nTexas allows abortions when \u201cin the exercise of reasonable medical judgment\u201d the pregnant person has a life-threatening condition \u201caggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\nIn April, Tennessee\u2019s governor signed a bill that clarified some exceptions to its abortion ban, allowing a physician to use \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d to determine when an abortion is necessary to prevent death or severe impairment to a major bodily function. The new bill also clarifies that treatment for ectopic pregnancy \u2013 when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, which, without removal, can result in the death of the pregnant person \u2013 and miscarriage management are allowed under the law.\nShortly after the Supreme Court issued its Dobbs ruling last June, ACOG published a series of questions that hospital system leaders should consider in light of the changing laws, including: questions about creating task forces (much like existing ethics committees); what kinds of experts should be on those task forces; and how a hospital might prepare to either transfer complex cases out of state, or in states with fewer restrictions, receive more complex cases from other states.\nIn August 2022, ACOG also published guidance for physicians navigating \u201cemergency abortions\u201d in states with abortion bans, emphasizing the need for clinicians to exercise their medical expertise specific to the circumstances and stating that, \u201cit is impossible to create an inclusive list of conditions that qualify as \u2018medical emergencies.\u2019\u201d\nA Kaiser Family Foundation survey conducted in spring 2023 found that 68% of office-based OB-GYNs said that the Dobbs ruling has worsened their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies and 40% of OB-GYNs practicing in a state with a ban said they personally felt constrained in their ability to manage miscarriages and pregnancy-related medical emergencies.\nThe legal confusion is further compounded by the fact that those physicians who decline to provide an abortion when the pregnant person\u2019s life may be at risk for fear of running afoul of state law could be in violation of federal law.\nIn May 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a letter to hospital and provider associations across the country reminding them of their legal requirement under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires medical providers to stabilize a patient in an emergency \u2014 including performing an abortion when necessary. The HHS investigated two hospitals: one in Missouri, where abortion is illegal \u201cexcept in cases of medical emergency\u201d; and one in Kansas, where abortion is legal up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. The investigation found that both hospitals violated federal law for refusing an abortion to a woman whose water broke at 17 weeks. The woman, who was turned away from both hospitals, ended up traveling to Illinois to obtain an abortion.\nIn Idaho, the state Supreme Court ruled that emergency physicians could not be prosecuted under the state\u2019s abortion law when providing an abortion to a pregnant patient whose life is endangered because the law conflicts with EMTALA. The state attorney general argued that the ruling was unnecessary, since the law already allowed for such exceptions, but a federal judge upheld it, saying that the law was vague enough to cause confusion that could result in delayed emergency care for a pregnant person.\nThat confusion calls for better education on the application of these laws so that physicians feel more confident in providing appropriate care to their patients, says Christina Francis, MD, an OB-GYN and CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an anti-abortion medical organization.\n\u201cThere is not a single law in this country that protects life that prevents physicians from being able to act immediately when a patient\u2019s life is in danger,\u201d she says. \u201cHospital lawyers and systems need to do a better job of educating their physicians about what their state law says.\u201d\nFrancis, who has been a practicing board-certified OB-GYN for 15 years, says that she sees the laws as consistent with how she has practiced medicine throughout her career.\nIn difficult cases, Francis says she closely monitors her patients and intervenes by inducing birth or by emergency cesarean section (C-section) if necessary.\n\u201cIf you have good training in obstetrics, you do understand when you need to make that call,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require waiting until a woman is on her deathbed to intervene.\u201d\nAdvising patients in the most difficult situations\nBut for Sarah Osmundson, MD, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and associate professor of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, the Tennessee abortion law does not seem so cut-and-dried.\nLife-threatening pregnancy complications are rare. Ectopic pregnancies make up less than 2% of all pregnancies; molar pregnancies \u2014 when abnormal tissue grows from a genetic error during fertilization, resulting in a dangerous, nonviable pregnancy \u2014 occur in 1 out of every 1,000 pregnancies; and Preterm Premature Rupture of Membrane (PPROM) \u2014 when a pregnant person\u2019s water breaks before 37 weeks, putting them at risk of infection \u2014 occurs in less than 10% of pregnancies. However, Osmundson, and other maternal-fetal medicine specialists at major academic health centers, see the rare cases on a regular basis.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have patients who have very desired pregnancies, but for whatever reason cannot continue for maternal [complications],\u201d Osmundson says. \u201cBefore the law, these were always difficult discussions to have. Now, it\u2019s complicated by the overarching situation.\u201d\nOsmundson says that she and many of her colleagues have agreed amongst themselves that they will provide whatever lifesaving care they believe is necessary and will refer their patients out of state for abortions that don\u2019t fall under the exceptions in the law. Should there ever be a situation where she is criminally charged for providing what she saw as medically necessary care, Osmundson is depending on a strong defense from her institution\u2019s legal team. However, she knows not all physicians have that option.\n\u201cI feel for physicians practicing by themselves who don\u2019t have the backing of a large organization,\u201d she says. In the last year, she\u2019s noticed she\u2019s getting more referrals of complicated pregnancies than she has in the past. She attributes it to other physicians worrying about having to defend a medical judgment call in court.\n\u201cIt puts physicians in a horrible situation,\u201d Osmundson says.\nShe adds that she appreciates the Tennessee law clarifying that an abortion performed to save the pregnant person in an emergency is legal, but would like further clarity from lawmakers on cases where abortion is not needed to immediately save the pregnant person, but could increase their chances of survival in the long-term, such as when the pregnant person has cancer or is at risk of infection from PPROM.\n\u201cA lot of my patients don\u2019t even realize that what they\u2019re asking for is an abortion,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would love to make this a decision that happens between patients and physicians and leave everyone else out of it.\u201d\nUniting the field behind patient care\nTo Matthew Wynia, MD, MPH, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the current climate surrounding medically indicated abortions is part of a larger trend of right-wing politicians attacking the integrity and authority of the medical field.\n\u201cWhen we had debates before, such as about improving access to care, politicians on either side didn\u2019t generally accuse the medical community of bad intentions or of being untrustworthy,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were political disagreements about how to spend money and differing values. But now it's really a very targeted attack on the medical profession.\u201d\nLast September, Wynia published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine calling on the medical profession to collectively discuss whether there should be a civil disobedience movement \u2014 where physicians, as a group, agree to disobey a law if they believe it is endangering their patients.\nSo far, however, no such movement has taken off, he says. He believes many physicians are making judgment calls that may or may not fall under state abortion law exceptions, but they are doing so quietly. He also points out that state attorneys general and local district attorneys are not jumping to prosecute physicians. Though future criminal and civil action against physicians is possible, Wynia believes both prosecutors and physicians are treading carefully because of the sensitivity and nuances around the issue.\n\u201cNo one wants to be that test case,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone's involving their lawyers [in medical practice] and the consequences there are that, tragically, some women are undoubtedly being put at more risk in order to protect against the potential for legal risk of the institution.\u201d\nAnother challenge physicians face is that their malpractice insurance doesn\u2019t cover potential criminal charges, Wynia says. He believes this is something that insurance providers will have to address as the medical field adjusts to the developing legal landscape around abortion.\nAnd although he supports the repeal of abortion restrictions, in the meantime, Wynia says the medical field should band together to practice within the current framework for the sake of the patients.\n\u201cWe get to set the standard for medical practice,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd yes, we're trying to operate within the bounds of these laws, but the laws don't tell us what counts as necessary to save the life of the mother, so we get to set those standards until it gets taken away from us. That is our authority and we should exercise it responsibly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridget  Balch, Staff Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE:\nTopic:\n                Legislation\n        \n                Health Care\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive weekly news and insights from the AAMC in your inbox.\n\n\n\nFirst Name:\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name:\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Press\n                \n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\n\n\nPress Contacts\n\n\n\n\n\n                Help\n                \n\n\n\n\nOnline Account Help\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n                Employment\n                \n\n\n\n\nJobs in Academic Medicine\n\n\nCareers at the AAMC\n\n\n\n\n\n                Journals\n                \n\n\n\n\nAcademic Medicine\nAdvancing academic medicine through scholarship\n\n\nMedEdPORTAL\nOpen-access journal of teaching and learning resources\n\n\n\n\n\n                Connect With Us\n                \n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nAAMC Communities Network\n\n\nSign up for AAMC Newsletters\n\n\nView all Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    \n    Association of\n    American Medical Colleges\n\n\n\n    655 K Street, NW, Suite 100\n    Washington, DC 20001-2399\n\n202-828-0400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTerms & ConditionsPrivacy StatementAccessibility\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 AAMC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
