Wade. Our original essay published September 17 is below Dominik\u2019s interview, published September 28.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the movie is anti-pro choice. I don\u2019t think it is at all,\u201d Dominik told The Wrap. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not convinced that she actually wants to have a baby. I think she has feelings about not having a baby, but I\u2019m not convinced that what she\u2019s doing \u2013 I mean, she doesn\u2019t end up having one. [\u2026] There\u2019s a wish for baby but there\u2019s a fear of baby, and I think that\u2019s kind of the central stressor on her.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominik continued, \u201cI think sort of this desire to look at \u2018Blonde\u2019 through this Roe v. Wade lens is everybody else doing the same thing. They\u2019ve got a certain agenda where they feel like the freedoms of women are being compromised, and they look at \u2018Blonde\u2019 and they see a demon, but it\u2019s not really about that. I think it\u2019s very difficult for people to step outside of the stories they carry inside themselves and see things of their own volition. And I think that\u2019s really what the movie is about: the dangers of that.\u201d\nRelated Stories Netflix\u2019s Disability Dating Shows Need to Be Rethought How to Release an Oscar-Winning Movie \nThe filmmaker concluded, \u201cI actually see that as a measure of the film\u2019s success, that it inspires that kind of reaction. [\u2026] I think the movie is pretty nuanced actually, and I think it\u2019s very complex, but that doesn\u2019t fit \u2014 people are obviously concerned with losses of freedoms, obviously they are. But, I mean, no one would have given a shit about that if I\u2019d made the movie in 2008, and probably no one\u2019s going to care about it in four years\u2019 time. And the movie won\u2019t have changed. It\u2019s just what sort of going on.\u201d\nEarlier: Andrew Dominik warned us that his NC-17 portrait of Marilyn Monroe would \u201coffend everyone.\u201d Or rather, he boasted.\nThe writer-director helmed a three-hour epic adapted from Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 novel of the same name, cast Cuban actress Ana de Armas to play the blonde bombshell, and credited the #MeToo movement for finally leading to the film getting financed. Oates called Dominik\u2019s film \u201cmost surprisingly an utterly \u2018feminist\u2019 interpretation\u201d of her novel,\u00a0tweeting that the \u201cdisturbing\u201d feature makes a first for a male director to \u201cachieve something [like] this.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s one way of putting it.\nAnother would be to say that \u201cBlonde\u201d is a horrific, tone-deaf reminder of why a female perspective should be included, or at least asked for, when writing about abortion. Yes, while \u201cBlonde\u201d made headlines on gossip sites like DeuxMoi for months ahead of its release for disturbing rape sequences (one such rumor that Dominik dispelled included de Armas as Monroe being assaulted while on her period), the real trigger warning is for a trio of CGI fetuses asking why Monroe murdered them.\nThis is our \u201cfeminist\u201d statement in post-Roe v. Wade America, according to Oates, according to Dominik, and, presumably, according to Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Productions?\nDominik\u2019s saga of Monroe being an \u201cunwanted child who becomes the most wanted person in the world\u201d didn\u2019t have to include three\u00a0wanted\u00a0children of her own. Dominik relies on the waking nightmare surrealist sensation of Monroe\u2019s body not belonging to herself: She is raped by a studio head, forced to give JFK a blowjob while high, and kidnapped and held down twice by doctors as she begs to keep her babies. The other fetus \u2014\u00a0 the one who actually speaks to Monroe while she is gardening and asks if she will \u201cdo the same\u201d to it as she did to the other, i.e. terminate her pregnancy \u2014 results in a violently bloody miscarriage after Monroe trips over a rock at the beach and collapses in sand.\nMonroe, whose body is simply being invoked here for shock value, frequently disassociates from her flesh to survive fame. Dominik categorized his film as capturing \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to go through the Hollywood meat-grinder\u201d and bragged that his magnum opus is like \u201c\u2018Citizen Kane\u2019 and \u2018Raging Bull\u2019 had a baby daughter\u201c\u2026 one who seems to have grown up to be Amy Coney Barrett.\nLet\u2019s dissect the \u201cBlonde\u201d abortion scenes: Her first terminated pregnancy starts with Monroe requesting for the studio secretary to help her \u201chandle\u201d her pregnancy after realizing her mother\u2019s mental health disorder is genetic. Monroe has wanted nothing more than to be a parent, but with fears of her own abusive mother, she makes the tough decision to terminate her pregnancy, complete with a funeral procession of wearing black Ray-Ban sunglasses and being driven off in a Hearst-like limo. It\u2019s in that very car in which Monroe has second thoughts, sees a literal stop sign, and decides she wants to keep the baby instead. Yet the driver doesn\u2019t turn around or even flinch when she starts screaming. Her screams echo through the halls of a hospital as her feet are forced onto stirrups, and the camera follows a DNC tube gliding through her vaginal walls. The audience is trapped watching this sequence, much like Monroe is held down on the table by the aforementioned tube, and it\u2019s clear Dominik\u2019s comments on offensive content are not about sexual assault but rather surgical assault on the \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d star.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world, the one that Dominik\u2019s twisted fantasy has no desire to acknowledge, one in three women has admitted to receiving abortions. But right-wing politics have argued that a high percentage of those are forced abortions, instead demanding forced births for pregnant women, even those with health risks or victims of rape. According to Dominik, which is more traumatic?\nThis type of abortion sequence does not happen once, but twice: It is years later, when Monroe is implied to have been impregnated by the philandering president John F. Kennedy. His goons kidnap and drug Monroe in the middle of the night; she is convinced the procedure is a horrible dream, but as she wakes up covered in blood smeared all over her abdomen, it\u2019s clear the nightmare is only just beginning. There would never be that much blood afterward, but that\u2019s not the point: Dominik is determined to shock and disgust, but at what cost?\nSure, \u201cBlonde\u201d has been close to two decades in the making, 20 years when most Americans believed Roe v. Wade would be upheld. As of 2022, the landmark Supreme Court ruling supporting women\u2019s healthcare and fundamental right to body autonomy was struck down, leaving more than half of American women living in anti-choice states in peril.\nUnlike Dominik\u2019s Monroe, more than 95 percent of women who have received abortions say that they do not regret the procedure five years later. Instead, dire consequences for women who have been denied abortions are proven by the University of California San Francisco\u2019s decade-long report, The Turnaway Study. The concept for the study was a reaction to the 2007 Supreme Court abortion case Gonzales v. Carhart, in which Justice Anthony Kennedy (not related to Monroe\u2019s Kennedy, to note) speculated that abortions led to \u201csevere depression and loss of esteem\u201d in women.\nThe Turnaway Study disproved that assumption. Turnaway Study demographer Diana Greene Foster called the overturn of Roe v. Wade unfathomable even in her \u201cworst nightmares\u201d in an interview with NPR.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Hollywood has issued a call to action, with \u201cBlonde\u201d distributor Netflix among the companies supporting employee travel costs for out-of-state abortions. More than a thousand showrunners and filmmakers penned a letter for production companies to disclose if they were funding anti-abortion politicians and also to cease filming in anti-choice states.\nIndie films like Eliza Hittman\u2019s \u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always\u201d and Venice winner \u201cHappening\u201d have also struck a chord with audiences, humanizing this essential surgery because, for so long, Hollywood and Americans as a whole have turned away from seeing specifics behind the necessity of abortion rights onscreen.\nEven \u201cJuno\u201d writer-director Diablo Cody reflected on her 2007 dramedy featuring a teen pregnancy and adoption journey. \u201cI am emphatically pro-choice and have been my entire life. And it is important to me to make that clear,\u201d Cody told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cBut, you know, I can understand why people would misunderstand the movie. Looking back at it, I can see how it could be perceived as anti-choice. And that horrifies me.\u201d\nCody continued, \u201cIf somebody had said to me at the time \u2014 as a carefree, younger, third-wave feminist \u2014 that in 2022, Roe v. Wade would be overturned, I would have been horrified and I would have assumed we were hurtling toward some kind of inconceivable dystopia, and maybe I would have been right. But at the time, it just seemed impossible. I took Roe for granted, and many of us did. I was just creating; I never intended the movie as any kind of political statement at all. I can\u2019t imagine being that innocent again.\u201d\nIs Dominik really that \u201cinnocent\u201d or does he just not care?\n\u201cUnpregnant\u201d writer Jennifer Kaityn Robinson made seeking an abortion a kind of road trip dramedy, one that felt relatable, honest, and without the stigmatized shame that is prescribed to women post-abortion. Robinson\u2019s latest indie film, \u201cDo Revenge,\u201d is also streaming on Netflix, right alongside \u201cBlonde.\u201d It only takes a moment to wonder what a big budget \u201cBlonde\u201d would look like from Robinson instead.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBlonde\u201d shows us that Monroe\u2019s body is not her own. Her famed curves and iconic smile belong to America as she\u2019s slowly suffocated by Hollywood and her male admirers, both presumably stopping her from having a white picket fence and nuclear family. But because Roe was overturned, all women\u2019s bodies are now at the mercy of the United States \u2014 and we can\u2019t just lay down and take it.\n\u201cBlonde\u201d is now in select theaters and will be streaming on Netflix on Wednesday, September 28.\u00a0\nRead More: Ana de Armas Andrew Dominik Blonde Netflix Daily HeadlinesDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.Subscribe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from IndieWire FeaturesWhy TikTok Become the De Facto Place to Discuss Child Abuse in Hollywood Bob Iger's QueueEverything Coming to Hulu and Disney+ in April 2024 FeaturesOn \u2018Problemista,\u2019 Julio Torres Discovered Tilda Swinton Was Not \u2018This Untouchable Being in the Clouds\u2019 FeaturesWill \u2018Apples Never Fall\u2019 Get a Season 2?
