The final vote was 46-48 against the bill, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (WHPA), meaning Democrats could not open debate on the legislation. The bill had not been expected to advance in the closely divided Senate\u2014but as the Supreme Court weighs a case that could unravel abortion rights in the U.S., Democratic leaders are hoping to leverage the vote as a key messaging tool as they head into this year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cThe American people deserve to see that while Democrats are fighting to protect their constitutional rights, Republicans are hoping the Supreme Court rolls back Roe and are actively blocking Congress from acting to protect reproductive rights,\u201d Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, one of the bill\u2019s lead sponsors in the Senate, told TIME before the vote.The Supreme Court is considering a case focused on a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Its ruling, expected this spring, could undermine or overturn the 1973 decision Roe vs. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion. Republican-controlled states are also rushing to pass a host of other abortion restrictions in anticipation that the Court will rule in Mississippi\u2019s favor. March 1 will mark six months since Texas passed its six-week abortion ban, which deputizes private citizens to enforce the law, and other states are trying to follow its lead in limiting abortion in more aggressive ways.Abortion rights advocates see the federal legislation as their best shot at codifying the right to abortion more permanently. But it\u2019s unlikely to become law anytime soon. While the House of Representatives passed the bill in September, Democrats would have needed at least 10 Republican votes to advance the bill in the Senate. Because of the filibuster, the bill would require 60 votes to pass. Forty-eight Senators\u201446 Democrats and two Independents\u2014signed on as cosponsors of the WHPA, making Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania the only Democrats not to explicitly endorse it. Casey voted to allow debate, which he said in advance he would do. Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have a record of supporting abortion rights, introduced an amendment ahead of the vote that would still codify Roe and would remove portions of the WHPA that they found too broad. In the end, though, they both voted against the bill.The legislation was first introduced in Congress in 2013, but it was only after Texas passed a ban last year on abortion after six-weeks of pregnancy that it received a vote in either chamber. Democrats on Monday hailed the milestone of getting the Senate to vote on the legislation for the first time and condemned their Republican colleagues for opposing debate on the issue.\u201cThis vote comes at a really critical time,\u201d Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, chair of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said in a press conference ahead of the vote. \u201cRepublicans are actually hoping Roe will fall. And of course we know that\u2019s been their plan all along. Republicans have made it abundantly clear that they want a world in which, they, as politicians, get to decide what women can do with their bodies, their lives and their futures. That is not what the vast majority of Americans want.\u201dDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the lead sponsor of the bill, went even further. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold accountable every senator who votes against this bill. Make no mistake, reproductive freedoms will be on the ballot this November,\u201d he said at the news conference. Despite the vote count, the situation was the best outcome that Democrats could have hoped for right now, and could actually help them campaign against Republicans, says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s laying the groundwork for a very powerful contrast,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the biggest problems we have is convincing voters that any rights they have would ever be taken away, or that we would ever backtrack,\u201d Lake adds. While most Americans don\u2019t list abortion as their top concern when voting, the majority do oppose overturning Roe vs. Wade. With this vote, Lake says that Democrats can run campaign ads or tell constituents that their Republican opponents not only don\u2019t support abortion rights, but also that they are serious about removing the right at the national level.The message can be \u201cthey really mean that,\u201d Lake says. \u201cThe Supreme Court made this decision, they already voted the legislation down. They really mean it. They\u2019re really going to act on it unless you fire them.\u201d More Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
