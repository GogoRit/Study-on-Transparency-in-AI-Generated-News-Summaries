On Thursday, state District Judge Aaron Haas in Bexar County said people who have no connection to the prohibited abortion and have not been harmed by it do not have standing to bring these lawsuits.\nThursday\u2019s ruling sets an important precedent but does not overturn the law, said Marc Hearron, senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen SB 8 went into effect in September 2021, it was the most restrictive abortion law in the nation. The law banned abortions after the detection of fetal cardiac activity, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, a point at which many people don\u2019t yet know they are pregnant.\nAlmost all of the clinics in the state immediately stopped providing abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The law\u2019s unique civil enforcement mechanism made it difficult to challenge in court without a test case. Dr. Alan Braid, a San Antonio doctor who had provided abortions in Texas since Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973, decided to intentionally violate the law to attract one of these private lawsuits.\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that Texas didn\u2019t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested,\u201d Braid wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post.\nThree lawsuits were filed against Braid immediately. Two were never formally served, Hearron said, but one, filed by a Chicago resident named Felipe Gomez, proceeded through the courts. Thursday\u2019s ruling in the Gomez case is the first and only SB 8 case to be resolved in court. Hearron said he anticipated that Gomez, who represented himself, would appeal the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGomez could not immediately be reached for comment.\nIn addition to the six-week ban, which is civilly enforced, Texas is also operating under several criminal abortion bans that went into effect after the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June. Doctors who provide abortions in Texas can face up to life in prison.\nIn the wake of those laws going into effect, Braid closed his clinic in San Antonio, as well as its sister facility in Tulsa.\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking that Texans still can\u2019t get essential health care in their home state and that providers are left afraid to do their jobs,\u201d Braid said in a statement. \u201cThough we were forced to close our Texas clinic, I will continue serving patients across the region with the care they deserve at new clinics in Illinois and New Mexico.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story will be updated. \n\n\nCorrection, Dec. 8, 2022 at 2:10 p.m.:\n\n\nThe name of the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights was misspelled in an earlier version.
