Kim Reynolds signs a 6-week 'fetal heartbeat' abortion ban during the Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines, Friday, July 14, 2023.\n\nZach Boyden-Holmes/The Register/USA Today Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill into law Friday that bans most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy.\n    \n\n            \u201cThis week, in a rare and historic special session, the Iowa legislature voted for a second time to reject the inhumanity of abortion and pass the fetal heartbeat law,\u201d she said in remarks ahead of signing the bill at the Family Leadership Summit.\n    \n\n            The law, which is effective immediately, comes after Reynolds ordered a special legislative session last week with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state. But it is already facing a legal challenge after a group of abortion providers in the state filed a suit to try and stop the law.  \n    \n\n            The bill, which passed the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature earlier this week, prohibits physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. \n    \n\n            It includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant\u2019s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtestors fill the Iowa State Capitol rotunda, as the Iowa Legislature convenes for special session to pass 6-week 'fetal heartbeat' abortion ban Tuesday, July 11, 2023. \n\nZach Boyden-Holmes/The Des Moines Register/AP\n\n\n\n            While the bill language makes clear it is \u201cnot to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division,\u201d guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowa\u2019s board of medicine to decide \u2013 leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim.\n    \n\n            Iowa joins a growing list of Republican-led states that have championed sweeping abortion restrictions in the wake of last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.\n    \n\n            Reynolds\u2019 push for abortion restrictions in the state comes weeks after Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state\u2019s 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the law unconstitutional. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer,\u201d Reynolds said Tuesday in a statement following the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cThe voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Abortion rights supporters have been speaking out against the abortion ban in the state. National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison called the ban the \u201clatest show of abortion extremism from MAGA Republicans.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cGovernor Kim Reynolds just signed a cruel abortion ban into law among a crowd of extremists who cheered as Iowan women\u2019s abortion rights were stripped away,\u201d Harrison said in a statement Friday.\n    \n\n            Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups, including National Right to Life and Iowa Right to Life, praised Reynolds and the law\u2019s supporters in the state legislature for the abortion ban. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe will continue to advocate for life and will not stop fighting until abortion becomes unthinkable,\u201d Kristi Judkins, executive director of Iowa Right to Life said in a statement. \u201cWe want to see lives saved and women no longer placed in harm\u2019s way because of abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n This story has been updated with additional information. \n\n\n  CNN\u2019s Veronica
