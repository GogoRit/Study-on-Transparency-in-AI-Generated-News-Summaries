Wade for decades. So it was striking that in the wake of Roe\u2019s demise, the pro-life Americans who participated in one of our latest focus groups expressed a range of emotions about last month\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. \u201cComplicated\u201d and \u201cdebatable\u201d were a few of the words participants used to describe the decision, with several calling it \u201cchallenging\u201d and expressing surprise that it happened. One participant said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that the government is in sync with the public opinion, but I don\u2019t think they are.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\tSome of the participants, who spoke with us last week from around the country, said that despite identifying as pro-life, they believed that women should be able to make the choice about whether to have an abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s their bodies,\u201d said one man. Many from the group said that abortion should be available in some circumstances, such as early in pregnancy or when a woman is the victim of rape or incest.\r\n\n\r\n\tAbortion was an obviously emotional issue for the group, with several participants expressing a desire for women who get pregnant unexpectedly to take responsibility for their actions. A number were clearly moved by the claims of anti-abortion lawmakers who have worked to ban abortion after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, starting around six weeks of pregnancy. Most medical experts say there is no real heartbeat at six weeks, and many women do not know they\u2019re pregnant at that stage. But those claims have a clear emotional pull, as expressed by the group: They believe that even very early pregnancies are babies, with rights of their own.\r\n\n\r\n\tAs with the pro-choice focus group we conducted on the same evening, many of the pro-life participants thought abortion to be much more dangerous than it is. Fewer than a quarter of 1 percent of abortions result in serious complications, and childbirth is 14 times as likely to result in death as an early abortion.\r\n\n\r\n\tBut it was the emotional weight of this moment in American history that the participants came back to again and again in our conversation. As one participant said, \u201cI feel like the good days are long gone. Raising my 2-year-old in this world terrifies me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\tIn both focus groups, participants used the phrases \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-choice\u201d to describe themselves as well as others, and to describe viewpoints; these edited versions retain that language to reflect how the participants spoke about these issues.\r\n\n\n\r\n  Vanessa Mobley and Adrian J.

But educate, educate, educate. I\u2019m a mother of three, and I wanted an abortion at some point. But from my own research, at four weeks, there\u2019s a heartbeat. I couldn\u2019t do it. Who is going to speak up for that baby at five weeks, six weeks, seven weeks ? You\u2019re killing someone. In the case of incest or rape, you\u2019re going to find out you\u2019re pregnant before you get that baby to three weeks, four weeks. You can dissolve that clot of blood. But after four weeks, there\u2019s a heartbeat, so I don\u2019t think that women should have that right.

But across the board, there are tons of families that are willing to adopt. And that is why I am so pro-life. Even though it might not be the best situation for you or your life at that point, there is someone who would love to love that baby, and that\u2019s how I see it. And people believe that abortion should be fine up to 16 weeks. I could feel my baby move at 14 weeks, and she reacted to my touch by 16 weeks. So that just is mind-blowing to me.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Kai Chen Yeo\r\n            \n\n\r\n          If you were describing someone who feels differently than you on this issue, how would you characterize them?\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Sue,\r\n            \n\r\n              60, Illinois, white, leans Republican, benefits director\r\n            \n\n\r\n          It\u2019s a complicated topic.

Well, I shouldn\u2019t say that. I do have a young daughter. She and I did talk about it, and she asked me what was my stance on it. And I did tell her I was more pro-life than pro-choice. And she, being 13 \u2014 she\u2019s, I guess, leaning more pro-choice.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Vanessa Mobley\r\n            \n\n\r\n          And what about the impact on women overall?\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Marcia,\r\n            \n\r\n              57, Georgia, Black, independent, customer service\r\n            \n\n\r\n          Are you asking me that question?\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Vanessa Mobley\r\n            \n\n\r\n          Yes.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Marcia,\r\n            \n\r\n              57, Georgia, Black, independent, customer service\r\n            \n\n\r\n          Well, it\u2019s like this.

You need to report to the police. You need to go to the hospital, have them do an exam, because now that this is illegal in some states, everybody\u2019s going to be saying that they were raped.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Kai Chen Yeo\r\n            \n\n\r\n          \u201cMake sure abortion laws have exceptions for the health of the woman\u201d \u2014 what\u2019s your reaction to that?\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Sue,\r\n            \n\r\n              60, Illinois, white, leans Republican, benefits director\r\n            \n\n\r\n          I think you have to have exceptions because sometimes it\u2019s not till just before the birth that they know that there has to be a decision between the life of the mother and the life of the baby.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Vincent,\r\n            \n\r\n              51, Georgia, Black, independent, social worker\r\n            \n\n\r\n          I agree, and not just physically.

Ms. Chen Yeo does similar work for political candidates, parties and special interest groups. She chose the participants. (Times Opinion paid her for the work.) The participants identified themselves as pro-life, and that term is reflected in the article and group discussion. The same numbers of people were chosen to participate in this focus group and a companion focus group of abortion rights supporters; in the end, 12 participants chose to show up for this group, and 10 for the companion group.This transcript has been edited for length and clarity; an audio recording of the session is also included. Participants provided their biographical details. As is customary in focus groups, our role as moderators was not to argue with or fact-check the speakers, and some participants expressed opinions not rooted in facts.Illustrations by Lucinda Rogers.Share full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation\u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
