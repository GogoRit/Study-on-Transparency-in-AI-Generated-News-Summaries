(Illustration courtesy of Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral advocacy organizations and a civil rights attorney filed a lawsuit against Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador\u2019s office Tuesday alleging a law that criminalizes the act of transporting minors across state lines to obtain an abortion violates constitutionally protected rights and is too vague to be enforceable.\nThe federal lawsuit asks the Idaho District Court to grant a temporary injunction that would block the law from being enforced while the case proceeds.\nThe Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 242 at the end of March that created a new law dubbed \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d to punish an adult who helps a minor seek an abortion in another state or obtain medication that will induce an abortion. The law states if the adult intended to conceal the abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant minor, they are subject to a felony punishable by two to five years in prison. Even if a parent or guardian gave permission, the adult who aided the minor could still be prosecuted and use that defense in court, according to the bill text.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nIdaho has a near-total ban on abortions at any stage of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape and incest victims who provide a police report documenting the crime and who are no more than 12 weeks pregnant. It is surrounded by several states where abortion is legal, including Washington, Oregon and Montana. Washington allows minors to obtain an abortion without parental permission, and Oregon requires parental consent for girls under the age of 14.\nThe law, which took effect May 1, also gives sole discretion to the Idaho attorney general to bring charges if a county prosecutor declines to do so. Legislators who supported the bill and Gov. Brad Little, who signed it into law, framed it as a parental rights bill that did not restrict interstate travel.\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t comment on pending litigation, our office is always prepared to vigorously defend the constitutionality of statutes duly passed by the Legislature,\u201d said Emily Kleinworth, spokesperson for Labrador\u2019s office, in an emailed statement.\n Law does not account for complicated family situations, Idaho plaintiff says\n\nLourdes Matsumoto, an attorney who assists victims of domestic and sexual violence in southwestern Idaho, including minors, is the first named plaintiff in the lawsuit. Her work includes representing victims of sexual violence who become pregnant, according to the complaint, and Matsumoto said she now feels limited in what advice she can give to her clients.\n  Lourdes Matsumoto is an Idaho-based attorney who is one of the plaintiffs suing Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador over the state\u2019s new law prohibiting adults from assisting minors seeking abortion care in states where it is legal. (Courtesy of Lourdes Matsumoto)\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear of what they even want to tell me. I have a little bit extra protection because as their attorney we have privilege, but it\u2019s still illegal potentially for me to tell them what they can do, it\u2019s still potentially illegal for me to direct them to programs out of state,\u201d Matsumoto told States Newsroom.\nMatsumoto said the law does not account for many complicated situations and family structures where parents may be abusive or otherwise absent, including immigrant families and situations where a minor lives in Idaho and their parents are in a different country.\n\u201cWe try to reach communities that have been traditionally marginalized, and those people are already afraid of law enforcement and seeking help,\u201d Matsumoto said. \u201cBy the time those people reach out and trust one individual, one adult, that\u2019s a huge step. So if you are not able to be trusted, the whole community is going to go backwards, and they\u2019ll go back and tell their community it\u2019s not a safe place.\u201d\nPlaintiff Northwest Abortion Access Fund assists people in Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska who need abortion care with financial support and transportation. According to the complaint, the fund\u2019s volunteers and staffers assisted 768 people in those states within the past year, and 166 of them were Idahoans, including minors.\nThe third plaintiff is the Indigenous Idaho Alliance, a nonprofit organization led by Nez Perce Tribe member Tai Simpson. Simpson and others affiliated with the alliance have assisted pregnant people, including Idaho minors, with accessing abortion care. The complaint says the abortion access fund and the alliance both want to continue providing that assistance to minors but fear prosecution under the trafficking law.\n Complaint argues law infringes on basic rights\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe groups are represented by Idaho-based attorney Wendy Olson, Legal Voice attorney Wendy Heipt, and attorneys for The Lawyering Project. Legal Voice is a Seattle-based gender equity advocacy organization.\nHeipt said community members working in Idaho have reached out to Legal Voice over the past few months for help navigating the law and are genuinely unsure how to avoid crossing any lines.\u00a0\n\u201cOur belief is that although this lawsuit is targeting adults, it\u2019s actually restricting minors, and if this is allowed to stand, they will move to adults,\u201d Heipt told States Newsroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that people understand once they start infringing on your basic rights as a U.S. citizen because someone disagrees with what you\u2019re doing, there\u2019s no end to it. That is a pretty slippery slope.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the complaint, the law restricts freedom of speech, the right to travel and the right to freely associate, including the language in the law that prohibits obtaining an abortion by \u201crecruiting, harboring, or transporting\u201d a minor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201c(The statute) criminalizes only speech that supports those seeking abortion care,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cUnder the First Amendment, the \u2018government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\u2019\u201d\nMatsumoto said those arguments are why the law is about more than ideological perspectives on the morality of abortion or the wisdom of an abortion ban.\n\u201cIf you take the word \u2018abortion\u2019 out of it, these are very problematic issues that restrict people\u2019s rights,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s getting the attention it deserves.\u201d\nThe lawsuit is assigned to District Judge Debora K. Grasham\u00a0and will proceed in Idaho District Court in the coming weeks.\u00a0\n20230711 Matsumoto v.
