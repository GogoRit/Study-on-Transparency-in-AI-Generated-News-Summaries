It also centres substantive equality and requests States to consider incorporating, inter alia, temporary special measures as essential. It mandates states to take a human rights and gender responsive approach in their measures to deal with COVID 19, such as socio economic opportunities, health care services, vaccines and treatments options and underlying determinants of health, including food, adequate housing, safe drinking water and sanitation. However, the resolution fails\u00a0 to address the gendered impact of the systematic paring down of health systems (almost universally, with only a few exceptions) and the likely further weakening of systems resulting from structural adjustment aid conditionalities and also State's misguided and lethal commitment to neo-liberal macroeconomic policies and market logics.\nThe resolution also urges States to \u201crepeal all laws and policies that exclusively or disproportionately target or criminalize the actions or behaviour of women and girls\u201d and requests States to review their legislative frameworks using a gender-responsive and intersectional approach. It by-annualizes the resolution on the elimination of discrimination against women and girls. Significantly, the resolution highlights the gendered impacts of the pandemic on health including the need to prioritise sexual and reproductive health information and services. In this context the resolution recognises sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights free from coercion and violence, requests States to respect, protect and fulfil the right to sexual and reproductive health and the right to bodily autonomy. It is the first ever Human Rights Council resolution  to not include Beijing and ICPD qualifiers, and therefore the sovereignty clauses contained in both these documents,\u00a0 (terms that restrict the scope) when dealing with issues and concepts related to sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nThis resolution represents a major advance in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 human rights by:\n\n\nAcknowledging and recognising the impact of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\u00a0faced by women and girls\n\n\nRecognising that substantive equality can be achieved by eliminating root causes of structural and systemic discrimination which includes, deep rooted patriarchal and gender stereotypes, socio-political and economic inequalities, systemic racism.\n\n\nReaffirming that full enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls includes sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence\n\n\nUrging states to respect, protect and fulfil the right to sexual and reproductive health and including by addressing social determinants of health and upholding the right to bodily autonomy \n\n\nEnsuring universal access to evidence based comprehensive sexuality education\n\n\nCalling upon states to implement policies and actions designed to eliminate racist, xenophobic, patriarchal, ablest and gender stereotypes that perpetuate multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination against women and girls.\n\n\nUrging states to enable the full effective meaningful participation of feminist groups, women and girls human rights defenders, girl and youth led organisations in the creation, design, implementation and monitoring of all legislation and policies relevant to achieving substantive equality.\n\n\nWhile the significance of these concepts in the resolution cannot be overemphasised, we are disappointed that the term \u2018sexual and reproductive health and rights\u2019 was not retained in\u00a0 the resolution. While included in the first draft, it was removed during the negotiation process.\nWe are concerned by the manner in which states politically instrumentalize the Human Rights Council and its resolutions as a forum for political point-scoring and posturing, instead of meeting their legal obligations in ensuring women and girls\u2019 human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled and upholding the highest standards of international human rights law, as should be the role of the HRC.\u00a0 As the resolution points out, \u201cwomen make up 70 percent of front line workers in the health and social sector across a range of occupations,\u201d yet women\u2019s and girl\u2019s fundamental human rights were up to discussions. The (defeated) amendments put forward by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the Russian Federation and statements of disassociation against progressive paras of the resolution highlight this trend. We are also concerned by the global trend of coordinated attacks against women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights by conservative and anti-choice organizations and groups at the HRC, negating women\u2019s and girls\u2019 experiences and realities and bringing social control over their lives and bodies to the negotiating rooms of the Council.\nThe 44th session of the Human Rights Council was held during a pandemic with severe restrictions on participation. This was especially true of Global South civil society actors. The COVID 19 pandemic has made it startlingly clear we live in a deeply unequal world. Inequalities on gender, racial, ethnic, class lines in every state cannot be ignored.\u00a0 While the Council has started to address these patterns of intersectional discrimination, it needs to remind itself that it is primarily accountable to women and girls themselves and put them at the centre of any and all of its deliberations.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TopicFeminist internetHuman rights and ICTsICT policy APC-wide activitiesHuman rightsFeminist internet TagsCloser than everHuman Rights Councilwomen's rightsreproductive rightsdiscrimination against women RegionGlobal PartnerAssociation for Women's Rights in Development (AWID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n English\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFollow APC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights \n\nFeminist internet \n\nFeminist internet \n\nDigital inclusion \n\nInternet governance \n\nFreedom of expression \n\nHuman rights and ICTs \n\nInternet governance \n\nSecurity and privacy \n\nAccess \n\nICT policy \n\nAccess to information \n\n\nMore tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00ab Go back\n\n        \u00a0\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\nAPC policies\nMedia\nLogout\nLogin\nAPC Inside\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation for Progressive Communications (APC) 2022\nUnless otherwise stated, content on the APC website is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
