They say they will repeat their demands on the government to decriminalise terminations and to ensure access to safe and legal abortion for all.\nThey also plan to commemorate several pregnant women known to have died in Poland since the tribunal\u2019s ruling, after doctors\u00a0refused\u00a0to give them abortions. One death resulted in\u00a0criminal charges\u00a0against the doctors.\nThe Polish authorities should heed the protesters\u2019 demands and stop repressing the reproductive rights movement. They should ensure that police respect the right to peaceful protest and do not use disproportionate force. They should drop vexatious charges against protesters, and discipline or punish security officers who abuse protesters\u2019 rights.\nThe European Union can play a key role too, by insisting on such reforms.\nPolice violence against protesters\nDuring intermittent rallies across the country, from the tribunal ruling on 22 October 2020 into 2021 when the ruling took effect, police\u00a0dispersed demonstrators\u00a0with batons, pepper spray and tear gas.\nGovernment authorities said the protesters were defying a pandemic-related ban on gatherings \u2013 although the police \u2018kettled\u2019 them into cordoned-off areas for hours, which only increased the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nActivists, protesters and lawyers countered that the authorities were targeting critics of the government, which has been led by the Law and Justice Party since 2015. Since coming to power, the government has also\u00a0curbed sex education, denounced\u00a0LGBTQ+ rights, attacked\u00a0women\u2019s rights activists\u00a0and eroded the rule of law.\nProtesters described being \u201chit in the face\u201d, \u201chit with a truncheon\u201d and \u201ckicked in the groin\u201d by police, in some cases after being pinned to the ground, according to a\u00a0damning 2021 report\u00a0from Poland\u2019s independent torture prevention body.\nThe police also hauled handcuffed protesters from Warsaw to police stations up to 130km away on an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d, even though at least five police lockups in the capital had space for them, according to the anti-torture unit. In April 2021, Adam Bodnar, then Poland\u2019s human rights commissioner,\u00a0accused the authorities\u00a0of transferring the detainees \u201cto hinder contact with lawyers\u201d.\nThe independent report also said that police laughed at a detained protester with epilepsy who was having difficulty breathing. They choked, punched and kicked another protester and used homophobic slurs and threats against him. In several cases, the police\u00a0reportedly\u00a0denied or delayed access to medical care or counsel for detained protesters, and ordered apparently unnecessary strip searches.\nMarta Puczynska of the Szpila Collective, which provides legal aid to protesters, told me that a\u00a0few thousand protesters\u00a0were charged, about half of them for violating the pandemic-related ban on large gatherings. Most charges were for minor infractions and were dismissed. But Puczynska said several dozen protesters are still awaiting trial for offences that carry prison terms.\nThose charged with being an \u201cepidemiological threat\u201d \u2013 an offence punishable by eight years in prison \u2013 include\u00a0Marta Lempart, co-founder of the All-Poland Women\u2019s Strike (Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet) protest group. A judge dismissed the case against Lempart on technical grounds, but prosecutors reinstated it in September, Lempart told me. It is one of 80 pending cases against Lempart \u2014 not only for her involvement in pro-abortion protests but for pro-democracy ones, too. She says the accusations are\u00a0politically motivated.\nMeanwhile, most cases against government forces for abusing protesters are stalled or have been dropped, according to protesters\u2019 lawyers. For example, in 2021, the Warsaw prosecutor\u2019s office\u00a0dismissed\u00a0a criminal case against a member of Poland\u2019s internal security agency who was accused of driving his car into a demonstration in October 2020, injuring two women.\nDuring public health emergencies, international law allows governments to restrict certain rights to protect the public. But such restrictions must always\u00a0meet the requirements\u00a0of legality, necessity and proportionality, including the use of force and on peaceful assembly.\nNear-total ban on abortion\nThe anti-abortion ruling was made by came from the country\u2019s\u00a0politically compromised\u00a0Constitutional Tribunal, which\u00a0held that\u00a0abortion because of \u201csevere and irreversible foetal defect or incurable illness that threatens the foetus\u2019s life\u201d was unconstitutional. The tribunal approved the abortion rollback after the executive branch had\u00a0failed\u00a0to push it through parliament.\nThe tribunal\u2019s decision\u00a0eliminated\u00a0one of the very few remaining legal grounds for abortion in Poland. Now, although\u00a0two-thirds of Poles support the right to abortion, the law\u00a0forbids\u00a0the procedure unless pregnancy threatens the pregnant person\u2019s life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.\nEven in such cases, significant barriers remain. The requirement to show proof of rape makes it almost\u00a0impossible\u00a0for rape survivors to obtain abortions,\u00a0including people who have fled the war\u00a0in neighbouring Ukraine, reproductive rights activists told me. (Sexual violence by armed groups in wartime is a\u00a0war crime.)\nMany medical professionals also refuse to provide abortions, including on grounds of conscientious objection \u2013 in some cases, when a women\u2019s life has been at risk.\nThe role of the EU\nThe Polish government should take genuine steps to reform its\u00a0politically compromised\u00a0judiciary, which was instrumental in rolling back abortion rights. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, can help by standing firm on its position that the Polish government must relinquish executive power over judges to receive\u00a0tens of billions of euros in grants and loans.\nPoland\u2019s government\u00a0approved some judiciary reforms\u00a0in June, but independent judges and rights defenders have\u00a0denounced\u00a0the changes as\u00a0superficial.\nThe EU should also insist that Poland \u2013 and all member states \u2013 uphold the right to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care as part of their fundamental rights obligations.\nWithout an independent judiciary to ward against potential police abuses,\u00a0the right to peacefully protest\u00a0for\u00a0the right to safe abortion access\u00a0will remain elusive at best. And more pregnant people will suffer the consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nChildren's Rights Crisis and Conflict \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nFrance: Migrant Children Sleep in the Street in Marseille\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nGetting All the World\u2019s Children Back to School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cNot the France I Imagined\u201d\n\n\nHousing, Health, and Education for Unaccompanied Migrant Children in Marseille\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cTanks on the Playground\u201d\n\n\nAttacks on Schools and Military Use of Schools in Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nFrance: Migrant Children Sleep in the Street in Marseille\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nGetting All the World\u2019s Children Back to School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
