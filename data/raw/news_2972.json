Wade with guest Seth Dillon on his Tuesday episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\"There are women who have been raped who should not have to carry a rapist's baby,\" Rogan decried. \"There are women who were sexually assaulted before the age of 14.\"Dillon is a pro lifeDillon - who is the founder and CEO of the satirical news site The Babylon Bee - fired back, expressing his pro-life views.\"There are people who were born of rape and are alive right now who are pro-life,\" Dillon said. \"They're speaking up and saying, 'I had a right to live.' They're going around and making a case, and they were born of rape.Rogan had a lively discussion with Babylon Bee founder Seth Dillon, who was a guest on his podcast.Rogan spoke about his daughterRogan strongly disagreed, responding, \"You have no right to tell a 14-year-old girl that she has to carry the baby of a rapist. Do you understand what you are saying? You have no right to tell my 14-year-old daughter that she must carry her rapist's baby.The star is the father of 14-year-old Lola, whom he shares with his wife, Jessica Ditzel. The couple also has a younger daughter, Rosy, 12. Rogan is also the stepfather to Ditzel's older daughter, Kayja Rose, 23, from a previous relationship.Clearly passionate about the topic, the podcaster continued, \"You understand this is a 14-year-old. A 14-year-old gets raped, you say they have to carry this baby?\"Dillon remained firm in his view, responding, \"I don't think two wrongs make a right. I don't think murder fixes a rape.\nVer esta publicaci\u00f3n en Instagram\nThe exchange was shared on Twitter by pro-life advocate Lola Rose, with some viewers surprised that Rogan would be pro-choice given that the popular expert is often considered a conservative.However, in an episode of his podcast late last month, the star insisted that he was in fact a \"bleeding heart liberal when it comes to a lot of bullshit.\"\"People will say like, 'Oh, you know, you're a secret conservative.' Like you can suck my d - k,\" Rogan said.\"You don't know what you're talking about. I'm so far from being a Republican,\" he said. \"Just because I believe in the Second Amendment and just because I support the military and just because I support the police.\"Rogan went on to say that he supports left-wing social policies, saying, \"I was on welfare as a kid. I think it's important. I think having a social safety net is crucial. We should help each other. We're supposed to be one big community.The star, who signed a $200 million exclusive licensing deal with Spotify in 2020, made headlines earlier this year when rockers like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled their catalogs from the streaming service, accusing Rogan of spreading \"misinformation\" about COVID-19.Joe Rogan - EnglishCelebrities - English\nCelebritiesJoe Rogan on his podcast: 'Maybe you should go and shoot homeless people in LA'\n\nCelebritiesZachary Levi thinks Amber Heard's televised trial wasn't humane but still mocked her\n\nCelebritiesWhy did Melissa and Joe Gorga skip Teresa Giudice's wedding?\nSee links of interest\nLatest Sports News\n\nNFL Scores\n\nSuper Bowl Winners List\n\nNFL Schedule\n\nMLB Scores\n\nSuper Bowl news\n\nNBA Winners List\n\nNFL Standings\n\nMLB Schedule\n\nNFL Teams\n\nNBA Scores\n\nNBA Schedule\n\nNBA Teams\n\nNFL News\n\nFantasy Football\n\nCargando siguiente contenido\n\n\n\nOther Unidad Editorial sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Sports\nNFL Scores\nNFL Schedule\nNFL News\nNBA Scores\nNBA Schedule\nMLB Schedule\n\n\nGlobal Sports\nLive Scores\nSoccer\nBoxing\nF1\nGolf\nOlympic Games\n\n\nLifestyle\nGaming\nTechnology\nUS News\nFashion [ES]\nTranslator\nMARCA TV\n\n\nUnidad Editorial\nUnidad Editorial [ES]\nExpansi\u00f3n [ES]\nEl Mundo [ES]\nCu\u00eddatePlus [ES]\nDiario M\u00e9dico [ES]\nEM America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9  Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n Deportiva, S.L.U.
