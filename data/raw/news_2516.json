Meanwhile, human rights activist Rosa Namises told The Namibian legalising abortion would allow women to make decisions about their own bodies.\n\u201cIt would be a choice given to women and it would also be a health and safety measure to prevent backyard abortions. I don\u2019t think women will line up every six months to abort, because that is not what it means. It means a woman is given the opportunity to decide about the pregnancy,\u201d she said.\nNamises said the laws that regulate women\u2019s bodies need to consider how this is done.\n\u201cWomen are given contraceptives, such as a chip in their bodies, but nobody properly explains the effects thereof on their bodies,\u201d she said, adding the contraceptive pill and injection have also not been fully explained to women who use such option.\nNamises said the country has researched abortion since 1996 when Libertina Amathila, when she was the health minister, introduced a draft abortion and sterilisation bill for public debate.\nThe bill was later withdrawn and any plans on the topic shelved.\nFormer minister of health and social services Bernard Haufiku has touched on the issue in parliament, but the debate never saw the light of day. Namises said there is a mentality emanating from churches, which speaks without understanding.\nThey wish to control women\u2019s bodies in line with their pro-life beliefs, she said.\nAbortion needs to be discussed objectively considering all aspects, Namises said.\nShe asked why certain aspects of abortion are presented to the public, such as unborn babies thrown into plastic bags, but images of abandoned or starving children are excluded.\nPresident Hage Geingob last year acknowledged that the government would have to legalise abortion to prevent deaths due to backstreet abortions.\n\u201cWe cannot deny it, it is happening. But it\u2019s better to control it so people can [access reproductive health services] legally, to be supervised and advised,\u201d Geingob said.\nThe petition can be signed at www.change.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Stay informed with The Namibian \u2013 your source for credible journalism.
