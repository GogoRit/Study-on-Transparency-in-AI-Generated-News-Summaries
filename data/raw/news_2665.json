In the months that followed, a 39-year-old man named Zachary Braddy would emerge as their ringleader. In one of his earliest city council appearances, on April 2, 2019, Braddy used the public comments portion of the meeting to warn of a \u201cgreat evil occurring in the city of Raleigh, that there are citizens in our very midst that are being led away to death.\u201d[1]\n\u201cThat is,\u201d Braddy continued, \u201cthe pre-born, children in the wombs of their\u00a0mothers.\u201d\u00a0\nBraddy is an open-air preacher with Gospel of God Ministries, an evangelical Christian group that relies heavily on social media and street preaching to recruit new members and share the gospel. Braddy and other members of the ministry have posts where they preach to the public, mostly about abortion, homosexuality, and salvation. Braddy\u2019s territory was outside one of Raleigh\u2019s two abortion clinics, where he became well known for harassing people who entered and exited the\u00a0building. \nBut that spring, Braddy shifted his venue from outside the clinic to inside the Raleigh Municipal Building. Nearly every month for a year, Braddy and his crew of five to 10 men attended council meetings there, claiming three-minute public comment slots to compare abortion to slavery and the Holocaust and urge councilmembers to turn the state capital into a \u201csanctuary city for the unborn.\u201d\u00a0Sometimes so many of them came that Braddy\u2019s crew effectively monopolized the entire public comment period of the\u00a0meetings.\n\n\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the reproductive rights movement has largely focused on protecting Roe v. Wade, and far less on the symbolic victories of abortion abolitionists. But it would be unwise to overlook how this network is mobilizing and building alliances across far-right\u00a0sectors.\n\n\n\n\nOne session made national headlines in 2019, when meeting attendees jeered at 13-year-old Addison Woosley, who challenged councilmembers: \u201cAre you choosing to be like the plantation owner flogging the little black child? Or are you going to protest [abortion] even if it going to cost you your life like Martin Luther King, Jr.?\u201d[2]\nWeeks later, Woosley appeared on Gospel of God\u2019s podcast, \u201cTruth That Transforms,\u201d[3] alongside Braddy, who explained their focus on city council meetings as following from Christians\u2019 obligation to call on \u201clocal magistrates\u201d to \u201cdo justice\u201d by ending\u00a0abortion.\nThe rhetoric sounded a lot like Matthew Trewhella, a pastor and prominent leader of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s pro-violence wing in the 1990s, who discussed this principle in his 2013 book, The Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates. As he wrote, \u201cThe lesser magistrate doctrine declares that when the superior or higher civil authority makes unjust/immoral laws or decrees, the lesser or lower ranking civil authority has both a right and a duty to refuse obedience to that superior authority. If necessary, the lesser authorities even have the right and obligation to actively resist the superior\u00a0authority.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to Raleigh councilmembers and residents, Braddy considers himself an abortion abolitionist: part of a nationwide network of far-right Christians who compare themselves to 19th Century anti-slavery activists. Like Braddy, the network advocates for \u201cministering\u201d in front of municipal and county councils to declare a city or county a \u201csanctuary for the unborn\u201d\u2014policies that generally seek to ban abortion within city or county limits, criminalize abortion providers and people seeking abortion care, and block pro-choice groups from operating within the jurisdiction. Abortion abolitionists have also worked closely with state legislators to introduce state abortion abolitionist bills. For them, the work is guided by the need to bring the \u201cGospel into conflict with the evil of the age.\u201d[4]\nUnder the Trump administration, the reproductive rights movement has largely\u2014and understandably\u2014focused on the potential fall of Roe v. Wade, and far less on the symbolic victories of groups like the abortion abolitionists. But it would be unwise to overlook the successful ways this network is mobilizing for policy and legislative change and building alliances across far-right sectors. Through their policy activism, abortion abolitionists are normalizing the criminalization of abortion at all stages and creating small but meaningful shifts toward theocracy. If history tells us anything, it\u2019s that fanatical, uncompromising activists can push the Overton Window, creating space for political violence and moving ideas that once seemed radical from the margins to the\u00a0mainstream.\nThe Abortion Abolitionist\u00a0Network\nArizona Apologia Church pastor Jeff Durbin\u2019s long brown beard, tattoo-filled arms, and appearances (as a martial arts stuntman) on MTV\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles[5] make him an unlikely fit for the founder of End Abortion Now, one of the country\u2019s leading abortion abolitionist organizations.[6] Like generations of anti-abortion activists before him, Durbin cites as inspiration anti-slavery abolitionist leaders like John Brown, who died fighting for their cause.[7] But in Durbin\u2019s view, the contemporary anti-abortion movement has become mired in incrementalism, leading to moral and strategic failures, and the need for a more uncompromising approach\u00a0instead.\nDurbin claims to have over 350 churches globally in his End Abortion Now network,[8] which until recently was dedicated to forming \u201cabortion clinic ministries\u201d to deter people from accessing abortion care. But in November 2018, Durbin expanded the organization\u2019s focus to target legislators and elected officials.[9] The organization developed a\u00a0six-point plan\u00a0to \u201cminister\u201d to city councilmembers \u201con their duty to preserve innocent life within their jurisdiction.\u201d In practical terms, they lobby city councilmembers to declare their jurisdictions \u201csanctuaries for the unborn.\u201d (Though abolitionists\u2019 core framework is steeped in anti-slavery metaphors, their tactic of proposing abortion \u201csanctuary cities\u201d evokes a different racial justice framework, muddling the boundaries between the groups\u2019 appropriation of anti-slavery history and contemporary immigrant rights advocacy.[10])\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, six state-level abolitionist bills have been introduced in Oklahoma, Texas, Indiana, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, all seeking to nullify Roe v. Wade and treat abortion as murder from the moment of conception on.\n\n\n\nTweet this\n\n\nBefore he made his Facebook page largely private, Zachary Braddy\u2019s posts showed he was highly networked with Durbin\u2019s ministry. And he wasn\u2019t the only one. Durbin\u2019s fellow Apologia Church pastor James White called on the Phoenix City Council to adopt an abolitionist measure in April 2019,[11] and that February in New York, bookstore owner Jon Speed[12] requested the same of the Batavia City Council.[13] In addresses to their respective city councils, both White and Speed compared abortion to the Holocaust and urged councilmembers to make their cities sanctuaries for the \u201cpre-born\u201d and \u201cunborn,\u201d respectively. Speed appears in Babies Are Murdered Here, a documentary produced by Apologia Studios, the media arm of Durbin\u2019s ministry, which has more than 200,000 YouTube subscribers.[14]\nSome jurisdictions successfully adopted abortion sanctuary policies. Before they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) this spring, 10 Texas towns sought to render Roe v. Wade illegitimate by banning abortion within city limits and criminalizing abortion.[15] Although the policies in Waskom, Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells were largely symbolic, they were successful in further stigmatizing people seeking abortion care and spreading misinformation about abortion access. And there is evidence to suggest that the network of so-called abortion abolitionists is growing and increasingly influencing more mainstream anti-abortion advocates\u00a0nationwide.\nIn February 2020, state and national abortion abolitionist leaders, including Durbin, Speed, and Trewhella, gathered at the \u201cAbolition Now!\u201d conference in Oklahoma City. The conference brought together young, contemporary abortion abolitionists; their forebears, who led the violent wing of the 1990s anti-abortion movement; grassroots activists disillusioned with the mainstream anti-abortion movement\u2019s incremental approach; and Oklahoma state representatives\u2014all strategizing how best to fuse church and state through an abortion abolitionist approach to legislative\u00a0action.\nHosted by the Norman, Oklahoma-based group Free the States,[16] the conference was the culmination of years of networking and activism, sparked in the early 2010s after movement leaders called for a \u201creformation\u201d in how Christians fight abortion. One of those leaders was T. Russell Hunter, a former University of Oklahoma grad student turned full-time anti-abortion activist who founded both Free the States and Abolish Human Abortion,[17] which together have helped turn Norman into the center of abortion abolitionist\u00a0organizing.\nFor Hunter and his peers, the abortion abolitionist movement is markedly different from its mainstream counterpart. \u201cThe pro-life movement has opposed abortion by seeking to compromise with it. Pro-life strategists have accepted\u00a0Roe\u00a0as the \u2018law of the land\u2019 and have focused on trying to regulate the murder of children in the womb to the greatest degree the courts will allow,\u201d[18] Hunter wrote. \u201cAs abolitionists we are attempting to bring the Gospel of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ into conflict with the culture of death\u2026 The abolitionist calls for the total and immediate criminalization of abortion as murder and never attempts to simply regulate or reduce abortion by treating it as healthcare.\u201d[19]\nConference panels reflected this idea. One session entitled, \u201cIgnore Roe: Why Incrementalism Hurts the Cause to End Abortion,\u201d[20] was led by the co-founder of Abolish Abortion Texas, Bradley Pierce. Pierce\u2019s group claims to have 90,000 members. The group also takes credit for convincing the Texas GOP to propose criminalizing abortion in their official party platform for 2016.[21]\nAs vice president and co-founding attorney of the Christian homeschooling legal advocacy firm Heritage Defense,[22] Pierce used his panel to describe how he took his legislative approach to abortion abolitionism to a new level. Founded in 2016, Abolish Abortion Texas quickly built a following by appearing at Texas legislative hearings on abortion. In a post on its Facebook page, the group describe itself as \u201ca grassroots network of Christians in Texas who desire to glorify God and in doing so abolish what He hates\u2014the murder of tens of thousands of babies in Texas every year.\u201d[23] In 2019, Pierce\u2019s group authored a bill, the Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act, which proposed charging abortion providers and their patients with murder. State Representative Tony Tinderholt,[24] whom Abolish Abortion Texas claims as a member,[25] introduced the\u00a0act.\nAlthough the bill failed to pass, Pierce claims that the publicity it generated led Abolish Abortion Texas\u2019 membership to skyrocket and influenced a wave of new proposals for abortion sanctuaries across the state. Ultimately a dozen[26] anti-abortion ordinances were proposed in Texas, all of which described abortion as murder and made abortion illegal within city limits.\u201d[27]\nPierce\u2019s victories were just one example of legislative success showcased at the conference. Since 2018, six state-level abolitionist bills have been introduced in Oklahoma,[28] Texas,[29] Indiana,[30] Washington,[31] Idaho,[32] and Alaska,[33] all seeking to nullify Roe v. Wade and treat abortion as murder from the moment of conception on, even in instances of rape and incest. Some bills seek to only criminalize abortion providers, while others would subject people accessing abortion care to murder charges, life in prison, and even the death\u00a0penalty.\nWhile much of the Oklahoma conference showcased the efforts of a new generation of anti-abortion activists, the speaker line-up also made clear how much this contemporary network is borrowing approaches and theories from the violent anti-abortion leaders of the\u00a01990s.\nTrewhella, an early Operation Rescue activist known for distributing how-to manuals on creating paramilitary militias, was present at the event.[34] While these days Trewhella mostly makes the rounds in the abortion abolition circuit as a pastor and the founder of the Wisconsin-based group Missionaries to the Preborn, he is also lauded as the architect of the Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates, a real paradigm shift for the anti-abortion movement. Trewhella\u2019s book makes a \u201cmilitia-like argument\u201d for defying the federal government when it comes to Roe V. Wade. At the Abolition Now! conference, Trewhella gave a talk, \u201cWhy We Must Disobey the Despotic Court,\u201d outlining the necessity of defying federal laws. And in a recent post on his website, Trewhella continued the theme, writing, \u201cWe must quit the nonsense that the pro-life movement has taught us for the last 46 years, namely, that our only hope to protect the preborn is to go with hat in hand to the tyrant and ask the Supreme Court to undo their evil. You cannot appease a tyrant. Tyranny must be confronted.\u201d[35]\nAlso featured prominently at the conference was Rusty Thomas, national director of Operation Save America (OSA), a longstanding anti-abortion organization known for its targeted harassment of abortion providers.[36] Thomas has been part of the effort\u00a0in Texas to establish \u201csanctuaries for the unborn,\u201d and testified\u00a0in favor of one at a city council meeting in Waskom, Texas, as well.[37]\nCommon\u00a0Cause\nRecent events have made it clear that the abolitionist approach resonates across other sectors of the Far Right, particularly among supporters of the Patriot and militia movements. Many anti-abortion and Christian Right activists share the anti-government ideology and revolutionary rhetoric of militia groups, which see abortion not only as murder, but as proof of an increasingly secular, tyrannical, and explicitly anti-Christian government.[38]\nIn January 2020, a pastor named Jordan Hall[39] teamed up with the Richland County Republican Party in Montana to introduce the first-ever resolution proposing a joint sanctuary for the unborn and for Second Amendment rights.[40] The resolution, which is still under consideration, would simultaneously ban abortion and any kind of gun restriction from being enforced in the county. (Since 2018, gun advocates, members of the Patriot movement, and constitutional sheriffs have used the sanctuary framework to block the enforcement of gun-control measures, including universal background checks and bans on assault weapons through introducing \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary\u201d resolutions and ordinances across the country.[41])\nHall often promotes Patriot movement rhetoric on his Facebook page, where his profile picture depicts him wielding a shotgun. He defended his joint resolution by speaking disparagingly about pro-immigrant \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies in an interview with Redoubt News,[42] a small outlet that calls for Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and eastern parts of Washington and Oregon to become a safe haven or \u201credoubt\u201d [43] for militia members and other anti-government activists.[44]\n\u201c[W]e thought to ourselves as the pro-life community,\u201d Hall said, \u201cif they can declare themselves a sanctuary and resist federal law when it comes to unrighteous causes, why can\u2019t we do it when it comes to righteous causes?\u201d[45]\nRedoubt News has been a hub for other supporters of abortion abolitionist and militia movement causes. In an April 2020 video on Redoubt News\u2019 YouTube channel, Idaho state legislator Heather Scott compared the governor\u2019s COVID-19 shelter-in-place order to a global socialist agenda and called on residents to defy it, reflecting a popular position within the Patriot movement.[46] In 2019, Scott sponsored the Idaho Abortion Human Rights Act, which would criminalize all abortions in the state[47] and was championed by the local abortion abolitionist group Abolish Abortion Idaho.[48]\nAlong with Washington State Rep. Matt Shea, Scott is well known for supporting the 41-day armed takeover at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. In his own legislature, Shea also sponsored a 2019 state bill, the Abolition of Abortion in Washington Act (HB 2154),[49] demonstrating the striking overlap in networks between abortion abolitionists and Patriot movement leaders. Like the Idaho and Texas bills, HB 2154 would ban all abortions and nullify any federal law protecting reproductive rights in Washington, and subject all parties involved in abortion to murder charges.[50] (There is one exception: if a medical provider accidentally kills a fetus while attempting to save the life of the pregnant person.) Shea was notoriously accused of engaging in domestic terrorism[51] when he collaborated with militia leaders to plan and execute the Oregon occupation.[52] And in a manifesto leaked to the press in 2018,[53] \u201cThe Biblical Basis for War,\u201d Shea argues that Christians have a right to \u201ckill all males\u201d who support abortion, same sex marriage, or Communism.[54]\nIntersections between radical anti-abortion, White supremacist, gun rights and militia movements is not a new concept.[55] Rather, it\u2019s a convergence that dates back decades. In the 1990s, formidable Christian Reconstructionist Larry Pratt\u2014also executive director of the libertarian group Gun Owners of America\u2014met with neonazis and Christian Identity groups to discuss the idea of forming Christian militias: something many see as the inception of that era\u2019s militia movement.[56] In 1995, when PRA senior research analyst Frederick Clarkson was working for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, he noted that many of the same people were involved in both the violent wing of the anti-abortion movement and 1990s militias.[57]\nAs Goes\u00a0the\u00a0South\nBack in Raleigh, abortion rights advocates were troubled to learn that Zachary Braddy\u2014whom had first been identified through his street preaching outside abortion clinics\u2014had shifted his focus to harassing city councilmembers and trying to turn the city into a sanctuary for the\u00a0unborn.\nStill of Gospel of God Ministries Youtube video of Zachary Braddy preaching against abortion in the streets of Charleston, North Carolina (Credit: Gospel of God Ministries/YouTube).NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina, a statewide abortion and reproductive rights advocacy group, worked with local clinic escorts to organize abortion rights supporters to attend and speak at these city council meetings in order to counter this new presence. In a statement, NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina said: \u201cSeeing these groups of mostly men, many of whom don\u2019t live in Raleigh, converge on Raleigh City Council month after month to push for closing abortion clinics and punishing patients underscores the misogyny at the root of anti-abortion politics. That they\u2019re choosing this forum to escalate their anti-abortion rhetoric isn\u2019t necessarily about turning Raleigh into a sanctuary city, but using the public platform to build\u00a0power.\u201d\nKamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access (TEA) Fund, an organization that helps low-income people in Northern Texas cover the cost of abortion services, has actively fought abortion sanctuary ordinances because she understands the dangers of hyper-local anti-choice activism and how effective their disinformation can\u00a0be.\nConner warns against dismissing attacks on abortion access in states like Texas and North Carolina as issues limited to the \u201cbackwards\u201d South. On the contrary, she said, the South is often a vanguard, with right-wing lawmakers using Texas to pilot draconian policies before rolling them out nationwide. Under the Trump administration, this has certainly been true regarding attacks on asylum seekers and other migrants, and Conner said this has always been the case when it comes to abortion\u00a0access.\nHistorically, Texas has always been an abortion battleground. After all, Roe v. Wade originated there. Conner said she would never downplay the importance of the landmark case, but she questions what good it is if people can\u2019t access the abortion care they need because of the ever-growing patchwork of anti-choice state laws. The spread of sanctuaries for the unborn ordinances across Texas, aiming to restrict abortion at the local level, has only made things worse. Conner warns that it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see similar efforts\u00a0nationwide.\nEarlier this year, the ACLU sued the seven Texas towns that declared themselves sanctuaries for the unborn\u2014and sought to outlaw abortion in their city limits\u2014on behalf of the TEA Fund and the Lilith Fund. Even if the ordinances were largely symbolic, the ACLU argued, they suppressed free speech and created confusion about Texans\u2019 legal right to access abortion care. In May, the ACLU dropped the lawsuit after the cities backed down and revised their ordinances, allowing pro-choice organizations to operate. The jurisdictions also agreed to stop calling Conner and her associates \u201ccriminal\u201d\u2014one of the primary reasons Conner had\u00a0sued.\nEven in its early stages, the sanctuaries for the unborn movement has drained precious time, energy, and resources from organizations focused on reproductive health, rights, and justice. However, what the ACLU lawsuit illustrated is that these local battles can be won, if pro-choice advocates take them seriously enough to fight\u00a0back.\n\u201cAnti-abortion extremists are crisscrossing the state in order to limit access to abortion in rural communities that already face barriers to health care,\u201d Conner said. \u201cPoliticians could be working to expand access to care that could actually help communities thrive. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to prioritize the political ideology of anti-abortion extremists.
