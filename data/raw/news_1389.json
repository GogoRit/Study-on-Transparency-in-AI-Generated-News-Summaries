Wade\u2019s overturn may have meaningfully shifted public opinion on abortion for the first time in years, a change that could affect what kinds of bans or restrictions abortion rights opponents can safely consider.\nPolling on abortion, while complicated to pull off, had long been relatively static. For decades, most Americans have identified as \u201cpro-choice,\u201d believing that abortion should be legal \u201cunder certain circumstances,\u201d according to Gallup. Since the 1990s, around 60 percent of Americans have also supported the right to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. And for just as long, polling has also found that support for abortions in the second trimester has consistently been lower than for those in the first, Gallup has found \u2014 falling from that 60 percent approval to somewhere between 25 and 30 percent of Americans.\nPublic opinion on second-trimester abortions has informed how some Republicans \u2014 including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 have framed abortion access in the post-Roe world, pushing for laws that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut sharp backlash to those proposals\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0alongside shifting public opinion data \u2014 suggests that when 15-week abortion bans go from theoretical to looming reality, Americans may be less likely to favor banning abortion in the second trimester.\nRepublicans quickly distanced themselves this week from Graham\u2019s bill for a 15-week national abortion ban, which only has three cosponsors. (A comparable bill in the House of Representatives has 86 cosponsors, which is sizable but still less than half of the Republican caucus.)\nThat hesitation may reflect a nascent shift, some public opinion experts said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Wade was overturned in the case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2014 found that most Americans favored laws banning abortions after 15 weeks. A poll done in August, after the Dobbs decision was released, found the opposite.\u00a0\nThe results can\u2019t be perfectly compared. In March, respondents were asked about a 15-week ban that had exceptions for cases of pregnancy resulting from rape and incest. In August, the hypothetical 15-week ban lacked such exceptions.\u00a0 But they fit within a larger pattern, Murphy said. In March, 11 percent of people in that poll were likely to say abortion should be outlawed in all cases, and 55 percent said it should be legal in all or most cases. In August, the percentage of people who favored total bans fell to 6 percent; the percentage supporting abortion in all or most cases rose to 60 percent. A 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll done in August also found 60 percent of American adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\u201cThe average voter doesn\u2019t spend much time thinking about abortion and they don\u2019t spend much time rethinking their beliefs unless they have to,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWhat the Dobbs decision has done has forced people to reexamine their beliefs, and as they have, they\u2019ve moved toward more abortion access.\u201d\nMeanwhile, polling from the Public Research Religion Institute \u2013\u00a0also conducted after the Dobbs decision \u2014 found that 52 percent of Americans opposed laws banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Most Democrats and most independents opposed such bans, PRRI found.\u00a0\nPRRI doesn\u2019t have historical data on 15-week bans, specifically. But that organization has also seen a meaningful increase in the number of Americans saying abortions should be legal in all cases. In 2010, only 18 percent of Americans favored that policy, per data shared with The 19th. In the most recent post-Dobbs polling, 33 percent said so. In that same time period, the percentage of Americans who said abortions should be banned entirely fell from 15 to 8.\u00a0\nThe change likely reflects the fact that overturning Roe made more Americans revisit their views on abortion, said Melissa Deckman, PRRI\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cIt was one thing to say, \u2018It\u2019s reasonable to have restrictions\u2019 when Roe was law of the land. It was more abstract,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a situation where [people are asking] \u2018what should those restrictions, if any, look like.\u2019 It\u2019s rejiggered the conversation.\u201d\nStill, if Republicans take back both chambers of Congress in the November midterm elections \u2014\u00a0which seems less likely, with Democrats\u2019 odds of holding the Senate improving \u2013 and win the White House in 2024, it\u2019s not clear if the shifting public consensus would deter them from pursuing an abortion ban, Deckman said.\nOn a state level, the impact of shifting public opinion is perhaps even less, suggested Michael Binder, a pollster at the University of North Florida. Polling conducted by the university found that most Floridians opposed a 15-week abortion ban \u2014\u00a0but because many Republicans, who control the state legislature, still favor restrictions, public opinion did not stop the state from passing and enforcing such a law.\u00a0\nIn the coming years, he said, Republican support for abortion restrictions will likely matter more \u2014 at least in shaping policy in the states where the GOP retains power.\n\u201cStatewide or national public opinion isn\u2019t particularly meaningful. What matters is the partisan support or opposition within the party in power,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nNear record numbers of women believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances\n\n\n\n\nAmericans are becoming more supportive of abortion.
