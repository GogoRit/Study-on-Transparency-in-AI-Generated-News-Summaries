This includes the city and state where each patient lived, the names of the abortion providers, and the identities of nearly every person who helped the patients access abortion care.\nEarlier this month, Jonathan Mitchell \u2014 himself not a Texan but based in Washington state \u2014 served requests to nine Texas abortion funds and one Texas doctor. The brazen attempt to acquire sensitive information about abortion patients and the funds that assist them is a disturbing turn in the ongoing legal battle over Texas\u2019s six-week abortion ban.\nIn August of last year, a coalition of abortion funds and doctors filed a class action lawsuit against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and other state officials. The suit, Fund Texas Choice v. Paxton, aims to challenge Senate Bill 8, or S.B. 8, and its devious method of civil enforcement to evade federal court scrutiny. In response, Mitchell, on behalf of the Texas government, is using the legal discovery process to harass those defending reproductive freedoms.\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a stunning escalation attacking the free speech and privacy rights of so many people,\u201d Neesha Dav\u00e9, executive director of Lilith Fund, one of the abortion funds in the case, said in a statement. \u201cWe are talking about thousands of people among Lilith Fund\u2019s supporters, followers, donors, clients, and volunteers. It is objectively terrifying to think about what anti-abortion extremists want to do with this personal information and how low they are willing to go to get it. But let\u2019s be clear: under no circumstances will we ever willingly hand over this personal information.\u201d\nThe abortion funds\u2019 case asks a question of law: whether S.B. 8 is constitutional. Details about abortion fund patrons and their medical procedures\u00a0have no bearing on this specific legal question. Mitchell and his clients in the Texas government are no doubt aware of this; the discovery requests are an intimidation tactic, in the spirit of the bounty-hunter law itself.\nS.B. 8 introduced a novel approach for banning abortion through civil litigation while Roe v. Wade was still on the books. The law permits any private individual, even from outside the state, to file suits against anyone they speculate has \u201cabetted\u201d an abortion. This could include an Uber driver who takes a patient to an appointment or a pastor who has counseled a person on ending a pregnancy. The plaintiff need not even prove that they have been harmed in any way. Those who bring successful suits are promised $10,000, hence the \u201cbounty hunter\u201d moniker.\u00a0\nWhile Mitchell has not yet been forced by the court to give reasons for his discovery requests, The Guardian reported, \u201cIn past litigation, Mitchell has argued that, in order to sue over the six-week ban, someone must show they have either violated it already or plan to do so in the future.\u201d Discovery could thus be used to undermine the plaintiffs\u2019 standing in the case or to place targets on the backs of abortion \u201cabettors\u201d in S.B. 8 civil suits.\u00a0\nIn response, the abortion funds filed a motion this week for a protective order to keep the names and information of clients and workers private.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting.

And as proven by the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, among other troubling rulings from our activist Supreme Court, Republicans have every reason to believe the law can be bent to their agenda.\n\n\n\n \n\n        Related      \nTestifying Against Texas, Women Denied Abortions Relive the Pregnancies That Almost Killed Them\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhether or not the anti-abortion lawyers here are successful or not, the very presence of the inquiry will likely cause chilling effects: Patients, funds, and providers will be continuing to operate in states of uncertainty, unsure if the law will protect them,\u201d Greer Donley, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who focuses on abortion and the law, told me. \u201cPatients are leaving their homes in the dark of night to get abortions out of state, telling no one what they are doing, thinking they are committing a crime. They are not, but creating a culture of fear is the point. And it\u2019s horrible.\u201d\nThe Fund Texas Choice case, even if successful, can\u2019t return robust reproductive care to the vast abortion desert that is Texas. The fall of Roe has ensured that Texas will be a state where abortion is banned, with or without S.B. 8 on the books. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights and health research organization, the average Texan has to travel more than 500 miles to the nearest out-of-state clinic for care.\nAssisting with this travel and access to reproductive care is the core work of Texas abortion funds \u2014 and the very activities Paxton seeks to criminalize. In February, Pitman temporarily blocked prosecutors in eight counties from pursuing charges against anyone who helps abortion seekers obtain care out of state. This ruling should be made permanent and expanded.\nA successful challenge to S.B. 8\u2019s vigilante enforcement mechanism would also be crucial amid the rising tide of similar astroturfed laws. Bounty-hunter bills, including ones that would de facto ban gender-affirming care and drag shows, have been proposed or passed in several Republican-led states. Mitchell\u2019s discovery requests deliver the same message: Those fighting for bodily autonomy will be personally targeted.\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Natasha Lennard          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @natashalennard                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Abortion Bans or Democracy \u2014 You Can\u2019t Have Both      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Testifying Against Texas, Women Denied Abortions Relive the Pregnancies That Almost Killed Them      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The First \u201cWrongful Death\u201d Case for Helping a Friend Get an Abortion      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        As Texas Judge Stalls, the Abortion Rights Movement Won\u2019t Wait      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
