Morrison along with Wu were recognized by Curry in celebration of International Women\u2019s Day. Morrison earned widespread attention last November when she wrote Curry a letter explaining that she had tried to buy his Under Armour sneakers online, only to discover that they weren\u2019t available in girls\u2019 sizes. Curry responded to Morrison saying he was working with the company to change things. Curry marked International Women\u2019s Day by releasing his newest namesake sneaker, which he co-designed with Morrison. Wu is the recipient of the Stephen and Ayesha Curry Family Foundation scholarship. (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group)\t\t\n\nBy Martha Ross | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: September 13, 2022 at 11:03 a.m. | UPDATED: September 14, 2022 at 4:31 a.m.Steph Curry may have won lots of feminist fans for speaking out on behalf of gender equality in sports, but some are asking how the Golden State Warriors star can truly call himself an ally of women\u2019s rights when he declines to say in a new interview that he\u2019s pro-choice or to denounce the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cI have certain beliefs that not everybody vibes with,\u201d Curry said\u00a0in a lengthy Rolling Stone cover story that focuses a great deal on the NBA player\u2019s political activism.\nThe abortion issue came up when he admitted that he and his wife, Ayesha, were initially reluctant to participate in the 2020 Democratic National Convention by taping a segment on the importance of voting.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure, more so from a faith perspective, especially around abortion,\u201d Curry told writer Matt Sullivan. \u201cWhen you endorse a president, you have a lot of noise comin\u2019 at you: \u2018Daughter killer! Baby killer!\u2019\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009That\u2019s the fine line of knowing the beast of politics, where, especially when we\u2019re talking about presidential elections, being active is more important than the understanding that, with every candidate, there\u2019s not a full, down-the-ballot agreement on everything that they do.\u201d\nCurry acknowledged that he didn\u2019t agree with every position of the 2020 Democratic party platform, apparently including the belief that every woman should have access to safe and legal abortion and the vow to fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive rights.\nCurry then tried to explain that he considers himself \u201cneither pro-choice nor pro-life,\u201d especially in light of his mother, Sonya Curry, speaking out earlier this year about having an abortion before he was born, Sullivan reported. \n\n\nIn interviews in May to promote her memoir, \u201cFierce Love: A Memoir of Family, Faith, and Purpose,\u201d Sonya Curry said she also considered having another abortion when she was pregnant with Steph. She said she was about to have that second abortion at a Planned Parenthood clinic when the felt \u201cthe Spirit\u201d intercede and she realized she had to \u201ctrust God to move forward with me having this child.\u201d\n\u201cThere could be no Stephen. If I would have gone through that there would have been no Wardell Stephen Curry II, and ya know, God had a plan for that child,\u201d Sonya Curry said. \n\n\nWith Rolling Stone, Curry \u201cdidn\u2019t feel an urge to speak out against the Roe v. Wade reversal,\u201d the writer said. Sullivan said that Curry appeared to have \u201can imaginary older brother in mind.\u201d\nWhen Sullivan asked whether Curry\u2019s membership in \u201ca Pentecostal megachurch\u201d influenced his Christian values related to abortion, the athlete said, \u201cI have certain beliefs that not everybody vibes with.\u201d\nCurry then said, \u201cAs long as there\u2019s equality, in the sense of you having all your protections and your rights as a citizen, that should be the very low bar for everybody to adhere to.\u201d\nOver at the feminist website Jezebel, writer Kylie Cheung raised concerns about \u201cthe famously feminist athlete\u201d expressing \u201csome unsettling, notably un-feminist takes on reproductive rights.\u201d\nCheung suggested that Curry wants to have it both ways by saying he\u2019s supports equality for women while refusing to support women\u2019s access to abortion, at a time when pregnant women, notably women of color, \u201care losing their agency, livelihood, and even their lives to abortion bans.\u201d\n\u201cHow can \u2018equality\u2019 exist in a country where state governments can force about half the population to give birth against their will, uprooting their lives, and \u2014 relevant to Curry\u2019s famed advocacy for gender equality in sports \u2014 possibly ending their athletic careers?\u201d Cheung asked.\nCurry\u2019s reluctance to identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d also runs counter to the liberal, progressive views held by many NBA athletes, Cheung added. Moreover, abortion rights are inseparable from racial justice, a cause that is front and center for Curry and other NBA players, Cheung argued. Black women face the highest rates of pregnancy complications and maternal mortality in the United States \u2014 serious health issues that are exacerbated by abortion bans, she said.\nIf nothing else, Curry\u2019s position is hard to square with his advocacy for gender equality in sports, Cheung said.\n\u201cAs the WNBA, U.S. women\u2019s soccer team, and women athletes around the world have long pointed out, there\u2019s simply no gender equality in sports, or anywhere, without abortion rights,\u201d Cheung said.\nIn the comments section for Cheung\u2019s essay, people debated Curry\u2019s abortion comments. One person said Curry\u2019s comments made them wonder if his advocacy for women in sports is \u201cperformative.\u201d\nSomeone else said it\u2019s not surprising that Curry holds such views, given his background and religious faith. Someone added that it\u2019s \u201cquite plausible\u201d that Curry genuinely cares about equal opportunities for women but \u201chas also been indoctrinated into the religious dogma that personhood begins at conception, which makes him conflicted about abortion.\u201d\nRelated Articles\nGolden State Warriors |  \n\n\t\t\tSteph Curry cleared to return to Warriors\u2019 practices as ankle heals\t\t\n\n\nGolden State Warriors |  \n\n\t\t\tHow did Ayesha and Steph Curry become godparents to Lindsay Lohan\u2019s son?\t\t\n\n\nGolden State Warriors |  \n\n\t\t\tAyesha Curry\u2019s happy news: She\u2019s expecting baby No. 4 with Steph Curry\t\t\n\n\nGolden State Warriors |  \n\n\t\t\tSlumping Steph Curry could use another Madison Square Garden moment\t\t\n\n\nGolden State Warriors |  \n\n\t\t\tPhotos: Steph Curry\u2019s former Oakland penthouse listed for $1.69 million\t\t\n\nSomeone else suggested that the athlete can still call himself \u201cpro-choice\u201d if he \u201cpersonally dislikes abortion but supports full bodily autonomy.\u201d This person said, \u201cI think it\u2019s reductive to argue, \u2018Well, he\u2019s not pro-choice, so all his other advocacy for women must just be lip service for PR.'\u201d\nA couple of others said that Curry can\u2019t truly say he supports women\u2019s rights if he doesn\u2019t think a woman should have a right to control if and when she will have children.\n\u201cIt does mean that his feminism is incomplete at best,\u201d one person said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to call yourself a feminist if you don\u2019t think women should have the fundamental human right to control their own bodies.\u201d\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReport an error\nPolicies and Standards\nContact Us\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularDear Abby: If your house is on fire, you get a pass.
