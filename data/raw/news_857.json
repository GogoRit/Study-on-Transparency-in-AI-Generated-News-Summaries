Happy holidays and happy New Year! \n\nIf you were reading the text of the California Constitution on Wednesday \u2014 as one does \u2014 you would have noticed a new line: \u201cThe state shall not deny or interfere with an individual\u2019s reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.\u201d \nThat addition is the result of voters in November overwhelmingly approving Proposition 1, which Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers placed on the ballot following the leak of a draft U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion that previewed the court\u2019s ultimate decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1978 ruling that established federal abortion protections. \nProp. 1 went into effect Wednesday, five days after Secretary of State Shirley Weber certified the results of the Nov. 8 election. \n\nNewsom said in a video message: \u201cAs other states continue to restrict access to abortion and contraception, California will continue to be a safe haven for reproductive health care.\u201d\nSenate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, a San Diego Democrat, said in a statement: \u201cWhile we made historic progress this year, our work is far from over, and my colleagues in the California Legislative Women\u2019s Caucus and I are committed to continuing to lead the nation in developing policies that will strengthen and expand reproductive rights and access in our state.\u201d  \n\nAlso in effect as of Wednesday: California\u2019s ban on the sale of certain flavored tobacco products \u2014 the result of voters in November upholding a state law that would have been implemented two years ago had the tobacco industry not qualified a referendum to put it on hold until voters had a chance to weigh in. After the election, the tobacco industry sought to block the law from taking effect by petitioning all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Election\nLatest coverage of the 2022 general election in California\n\n\nAs more and more business groups look to referendums to try to overturn \u2014 or at least delay \u2014 laws they dislike coming out of Sacramento, advocacy groups and Californians are pushing back. \n\nLabor unions have filed petitions with the secretary of state alleging illegal tactics from signature gatherers working on behalf of the fast food industry, which is seeking to qualify a 2024 referendum to block a law setting industrywide standards for wages and working conditions. \nEnvironmental justice advocates and other Californians have filed reports with similar allegations about signature gatherers working for the oil industry, which is attempting to qualify a 2024 referendum to overturn a law banning new oil and gas wells within 3,200 feet of such sensitive areas as schools, homes and hospitals. \n\nBut some aren\u2019t waiting to find out whether the referendums qualify for the 2024 ballot. A coalition of environmental groups sent Newsom and other state officials a letter last week urging them to \u201ccease approving oil and gas permits for further extractive activities at wells already located within 3,200 feet of a home, school, or other sensitive receptor.\u201d \nAnd the Los Angeles Times editorial board argued Tuesday that Newsom \u201chas the power to shut down new drilling independent of the new law \u2014 and he should use it.\u201d \nWhether Newsom will attempt to circumvent a possible referendum on a law he signed just two months ago could serve as a litmus test for how far he\u2019s willing to escalate his battle with the oil industry, on which he\u2019s asked state lawmakers to enact a penalty for allegedly price-gouging Californians at the gas pump. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nOther Stories You Should Know\n\n\n1\n2024 election battles take shape\n\nClarissa Cervantes announced her campaign for her sister Sabrina\u2019s state Assembly seat on Dec. 21, 2022. Image via Facebook\nYes, the results of California\u2019s Nov. 8 election were certified just five days ago, and yes, 2024 election battles are already beginning to brew. Combine that with branching family trees and Dem-on-Dem fights, and 2024 is already looking pretty explosive. Here\u2019s the latest:\n\nRiverside City Councilmember Clarissa Cervantes announced Wednesday that she will in 2024 seek the state Assembly seat currently held by her sister, Sabrina, who on Tuesday launched her own 2024 campaign for the state Senate seat that will be vacated by the termed-out incumbent Richard Roth. If both Cervantes win their campaigns, it would mark the latest entry in the California Legislature\u2019s long list of lawmakers bequeathing their seats to family members or staffers. Some recent examples: Akilah Weber replaced her mother, Shirley, in the state Assembly after the latter was appointed secretary of state \u2014 while Mia Bonta replaced her husband, Rob, in the Assembly after he was appointed attorney general. The family connection doesn\u2019t always work, however: Daniel Hertzberg recently lost his bid to replace his termed-out father, Bob, in the state Senate. \nBoth Cervantes are set to face off against fellow Democrats in 2024: Clarissa against fellow Riverside City Councilmember Ronaldo Fierro and Sabrina against Riverside school board member Angelo Farooq. \nAnother possibly fierce Democratic intraparty battle is taking shape in Orange County: Incumbent state Sens. Dave Min and Josh Newman \u2014 who were drawn into the same district following 2021\u2019s post-Census redistricting process \u2014 will both vie for the new seat in 2024. \n\n\n2\nLooking back on 2022 \u2014 and ahead to 2023\n\nAn updated primer from the CalMatters team aims to help Californians understand their state government. Photo collage by Miguel Gutierrez Jr., CalMatters\nIt seems that one aftereffect of the pandemic is that it\u2019s warped our sense of time \u2014 which can make it difficult to remember everything that happened in the world of California politics and policy in 2022, and how those events might inform the challenges and opportunities the state faces in 2023. But never fear, CalMatters\u2019 annual primer is here! In this comprehensive, concise guide, our team of reporters breaks down key 2022 developments in the Newsom administration and state Legislature and delves into such issues as the economy, health, housing and homelessness, K-12 and higher education, justice, the environment, poverty and inequality and the federal government. We also preview key themes to watch in 2023. Give the primer a read here. \n\nCalMatters Editor-in-Chief Dave Lesher: \u201cWe hope it helps you learn a bit more about how California government works, and that it informs or even inspires your participation in our democracy.\u201d \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nCalMatters Commentary\n\nCalMatters columnist Dan Walters: A federal judge has brought an end to Newsom\u2019s political posturing by blocking his foolish gun law. \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nOther things worth your time\n\n\nSome stories may require a subscription to read\n\nLatest on 6.4 magnitude earthquake in Humboldt County: Power still out for thousands, boil advisories in effect. // Mercury News\nCalifornia plans deny mental health claims despite new law. // Bloomberg Law\nCan the California grid handle a gas phaseout? // E&E News\nCalifornia lawmakers want answers on Middle Class Tax Refund debit card issues. // KCRA\nSan Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo: 400 million guns aren\u2019t going to just go away.
