Wade decision.Senate Bill 983 seeks to shift the legal burden to \"elective\" abortions only, proposing language to define the term as any abortion that is not \"medically necessary.\"Sen. Ken Yager, R-Kingston, filed the bill.More:GOP Senator to bring bill adding exceptions to Tennessee's abortion law as new fight brewsSenate Bill 857, sponsored by Sen. Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin, would legalize abortions for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest.The bills are the first Republican-led efforts to walk back portions of Tennessee's ban, one of the few in the nation not to include medical exceptions.Tennessee's medical communities, sexual assault advocates and Democrats have for months called for additional exceptions to the strict ban.More:'Somewhat unusual': UT medical school chancellor supports changes to abortion banWhat would the bills do?Under Tennessee's current law, a doctor could be criminally prosecuted for performing any abortion, even if a pregnant patient's life is at risk.The no-exceptions ban includes something called an \"affirmative defense,\" which would allow a criminally charged physician to mount a legal defense on the medical necessity of an abortion procedure.However, even if the doctor is never charged or prosecuted, they\u2019ve already committed a felony under the law.\u00a0Yager's bill, SB 983, would change the law's language to criminalize \"elective\" abortions or attempted abortions. The bill also further defines what qualifies as a \"medically necessary\" abortion.\"The physician determined, in the physician's good faith medical judgment, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time, that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or toprevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman,\" the bill states in part to define the term.The legislation would not protect abortions performed for any reason relating to a pregnant patient's mental health.The bill also requires the physician to act in \"good faith medical judgment\" to provide the \"best opportunity for the unborn child to survive,\" unless \"termination of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk\" of death or substantial, irreversible injury.The rape and incest exceptions bill, SB 857, provides exceptions for abortions performed in cases of rape and incest from the criminal code. The bill includes several requirements for the pregnant patient to qualify for an abortion, including:Reporting the rape or incest offense to either law enforcement or a rape crisis center that made its own law enforcement reportSubmitting to a forensic medical exam, if \"appropriate and available\"Is no more than 10 weeks pregnant, if the pregnant patient is 12 or youngerIs no more than 8 weeks pregnant, if the patient is 13 or olderHaile's bill also proposes criminal penalties for anyone who makes a \"false report\" to obtain an abortion.Who is sponsoring the bills?Yager, the Senate Republican Caucus chair, said in December he was preparing legislation to add additional legal protections for physicians.\u201cAlthough well intended, the affirmative defense provision is not only overly burdensome for physicians but it can prevent them from performing life-saving abortions for fear of litigation, which puts at risk the lives of pregnant women who require medically necessary abortions,\" Yager said.Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, R-East Ridge, is sponsoring the House version of Yager's bill, HB 778.Haile, the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Senate, filed the rape and incest exceptions bill, SB 857. Rep. Iris Rudder, R-Winchester, is sponsoring the House version, HB 1440.The bills have not yet been assigned to a committee, the first step in the legislative process.How do other lawmakers feel about changes to the abortion law?With the bills coming from senators in Senate and Republican caucus leadership, the legislation could have legs among otherwise anti-abortion conservatives queasy with some implications of the current, no-exceptions ban.House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, said in late December \u201cclarification\u201d on the law is needed, and he would support exceptions for the life of the mother and victims of rape and incest, should such a bill make it to the House floor.Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, and Gov. Bill Lee have said they support the law as it stands.Sen. Richard Briggs, R-Knoxville, publicly raised concerns in late fall about the law. Briggs, a heart surgeon, voted for the law in 2019, when it was immediately blocked in the courts until the Roe v. Wade precedent fell this summer.More:GOP Senator to bring bill adding exceptions to Tennessee's abortion law as new fight brewsBriggs said he didn't fully understand the affirmative defense portion of the law when he voted for it, and the physician warned the current law could put patient lives at risk.An explicit exceptions bill was first filed by Rep. Yusuf Hakeem, D-Chattanooga, who called for increased exceptions for a patient's mental, not just physical health. Democrats on Monday unveiled a wider legislative slate aimed at abortion issues, but the lawmakers are unlikely to gain much traction in the legislature.Anti-abortion lobbyists like Tennessee Right to Life are opposed to new exceptions and publicly went on the offensive against Briggs over his comments late last year. The group's political action committee yanked its endorsement of Briggs, which the senator viewed as a \"shot across the bow\" to other Republicans considering whether to support exception measures.Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
