Trump for his efforts to support pro-life policies and request that he end taxpayer funding for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\u201cThank you for your bold efforts to protect the sanctity of human life\u2026 We write today to urge you to issue an Executive Order to end taxpayer funding of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research and to redirect these scarce federal research dollars toward alternatives that make a real difference for patients,\u201d the legislators wrote.\nSince 2017, the NIH has approved 106 new hESC lines, which brought the total number of approved hESC lines to 484. These lines are derived from live human embryos, which are destroyed when the lines are created. Funding for embryonic research at NIH has averaged between $250 and $300 million dollars over the past three years and yielded no \u201cproof of a single patient\u2019s life being saved through embryonic stem cell treatments.\u201d\nThe expenditures for hESC research are inconsistent with longstanding federal law protecting human embryos. Wicker is co-author of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, first adopted in 1996, that prohibits federal funds from being used to support \u201cresearch in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero.\u201d\n\u201cHuman embryos are young human beings, and human life should never be expended as a mere means of benefiting another. We urge you to bring an end to NIH\u2019s unethical and ineffective hESC research efforts and support research that will respect the sanctity of human life and deliver real benefits for patients,\u201d the legislators concluded.\nJoining Wicker and Harris in signing the letter are U.S. Senators Steve Daines, R-Mont., Mike Enzi, R-Wyo, Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, John Thune, R-S.D., James Lankford, R-Okla., Pat Roberts, R-Kan., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., James Risch, R-Idaho, Jerry Moran, R-Kan., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and John Boozman, R-Ark., and U.S. Representatives Christopher H.
