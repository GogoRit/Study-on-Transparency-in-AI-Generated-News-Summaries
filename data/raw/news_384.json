banOpponents of the ruling argue it puts women\u2019s lives at risk by forcing them to carry unviable pregnancies.Demonstrators, including students and employees of a local university, protest against the ruling by Poland's Constitutional Tribunal that imposes a near-total ban on abortion, in Gdansk, Poland [Bartosz Banka/Agencja Gazeta/Reuters]Published On 28 Oct 202028 Oct 2020Women in Poland walked off the job and hit the streets nationwide on Wednesday, the seventh straight day of mass protests over a court ruling to impose a near-total abortion ban in the country.\nDespite tight coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings, Poland has seen huge rallies against the ruling in both more liberal urban areas and traditionally conservative smaller towns.Keep reading list of 4

Poland, protesters have also demonstrated inside churches and sprayed their exterior walls with graffiti including the popular \u201c#Women\u2019sHell\u201d slogan.\nTens of thousands of mostly young women and men on Wednesday flooded the streets of several cities including Gdansk, Lodz, Warsaw and Wroclaw among others, according to local media reports.\n\u201cGet your hands off my daughter,\u201d read a placard carried by an older male protester in Lodz, while young women with placards reading \u201cNothing can stop an angry woman!\u201d chanted \u201cEnough is enough\u201d.\nElsewhere, demonstrators chanted expletives against the governing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which is backs the court ruling.\nIn parliament on Tuesday, centrist and left-wing mostly female politicians held up pro-choice placards and shouted pro-choice slogans at powerful PiS party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski.\nParliament speaker Ryszard Terlecki \u2013 who is a PiS member \u2013 compared the protest symbol of a red lightning bolt to Nazi imagery.\nKaczynski, who is also a deputy prime minister, accused protesters of attempting to \u201cdestroy\u201d the nation and rallied party members to defend Catholic churches.\nAllied with the church, the PiS government has promised to clamp down on protesters.\nWhen published in the journal of laws, the decision by the constitutional court announced last Thursday will strike down abortions for birth defects.\nTerminations will only be allowed for pregnancies resulting from rape, incest and or when a woman\u2019s life is at risk.\nOpponents of the ruling argue it puts women\u2019s lives at risk by forcing them to carry unviable pregnancies but supporters insist it will prevent the abortion of foetuses diagnosed with Down syndrome.\nSome 66 percent of respondents oppose the verdict while 69 percent want a referendum on whether the changes ought to come into force, according to an opinion poll by the independent IBRiS pollsters published on Wednesday.\nThere are already fewer than 2,000 legal abortions each year in Poland \u2013 which even before the ruling enforced some of the strictest termination restrictions in Europe \u2013 and the vast majority of those are carried out due to damaged foetuses.\nBut women\u2019s groups estimate that up to 200,000 procedures are performed illegally or abroad.\nThe ruling cannot be appealed but only comes into force if it is published in the journal of laws.\nIt is unclear when this will happen and more protests are planned in the coming days.\nExisting abortion legislation was adopted in 1993 as part of a hard-fought church-state compromise aimed at avoiding a backlash just four years after Poland shed communism, when there was unfettered access to abortion.\nSource: AFPaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR
