The states that have come closest to outright bans already had big problems with maternal and infant health, a new report says.\nThe report, by the Gender Equity Policy Institute, said that in 2021 maternal death rates in the 16 states it classified as having post-Dobbs abortion bans were 2.4 times higher than in the 22 states that it classified as being \u201csupportive\u201d of abortion rights.\u00a0\nIt classified Ohio\u2019s law \u2014 which bans the vast majority of abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 as being one of those in 16 states that were \u201crestrictive\u201d of abortion rights. Maternal mortality \u2014 deaths during and shortly after pregnancy \u2014 was 1.7 times more likely in those states than in states with supportive abortion policies.\nAnd for Black and Native American women, the situation is dramatically worse. They had 69 and 117 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, respectively, in 2021. That compares to 33 deaths per 100,000 live births in the nation as a whole.\nOhio\u2019s law is currently on hold by the courts pending litigation, meaning that abortion is currently still legal in Ohio through 21 weeks of gestation.\nThe Gender Equity Policy Institute used data from the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do its analysis. The findings were stark.\n\u201cFor those who live in one of the 22 states which support reproductive freedom, the trends are largely positive,\u201d it said. \u201cThe health and wellbeing of women and babies in these states outpaces that of those living in states which ban or restrict abortion care.

Moreover, these states are less likely to enact policies, like paid parental leave, which have been shown to improve outcomes for new parents and babies.\u201d\nThe analysis found that:\n\n6 in 10 women live in states that ban abortion or sharply limit it.\n7 in 10 Black women live in states that ban or restrict abortion.\n1 in 4 teens live in states that banned abortion after Dobbs.\nBabies born in banned states were 30% more likely to die in their first month of life.\nTwice as many single mothers were uninsured in banned states than in supportive states.\nThe teen birth rate was twice as high in banned states.\nMaternal mortality nearly doubled between 2018 and 2021.\nBlack women were almost three times as likely to die in pregnancy, childbirth, or right after giving birth as white women.\nBlack babies were more than two times as likely to die in their first month of life as white babies.\n\nThe connection between maternal and infant health and states that passed abortion bans or tight restrictions doesn\u2019t seem to be straightforward. But many of those same states appear to be among those that place the least emphasis on women\u2019s and children\u2019s health.\u00a0\nFor example, half of the states classified in the report as having abortion bans refused to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. That leaves millions of low-income women without coverage for birth control or access to care if they become pregnant.\nIn Ohio, strict abortion restrictions took effect almost immediately after the Supreme Court handed down the Dobbs ruling last summer.

Other women\u2019s fetuses had abnormalities so severe that their pregnancies couldn\u2019t be successful. But under the Ohio law, they have to carry them to term anyway \u2014 even though that\u2019s 14 times more likely to kill them than having an abortion.\u00a0\nAs a general matter, the majority in the Dobbs decision and supporters of the Ohio law, have avoided discussing the health implications of severely restricting access to abortions.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWomen in states that banned abortion were already a lot more likely to die, report says\nby Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal January 23, 2023\nWomen in states that banned abortion were already a lot more likely to die, report says\nby Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal January 23, 2023\n When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade last June, it allowed states to ban abortion altogether without regard to the consequences for women\u2019s health in its decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health.
