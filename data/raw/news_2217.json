Because in its effect, a poor argument can have a more detrimental effect than choosing not to respond to a challenge at all. And we must respond.\nA college student named Victor once told me, \u201cWe need abortion. I mean, how are we going to care for these children when the world is so overpopulated?\u201d\nYou\u2019ve probably heard an argument like this before, but you may be surprised by the response I gave: \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re right\u2014the world is overpopulated.\u201d\nNow, pro-life advocates who think the world is not overpopulated may be tempted to argue the point. Don\u2019t. You have enough to argue about without bringing up another topic of disagreement. On the other hand, don\u2019t say you agree with the person on overpopulation or anything if you actually don\u2019t agree with them because then you\u2019re lying to the person.\nInstead, agree for the sake of the argument. You can say something like I did above, or \u201cI don\u2019t think the world is overpopulated, but for the sake of the argument, let\u2019s say it is.\u201d Or, you could agree on some common ground between the two positions like by saying \u201cI agree that some parts of the world are crowded and people there may lack the basic necessities of life.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve found some common ground you can then apply the overpopulation argument to the killing of a born person like a two-year-old or an infant and ask if they should be killed for the same reason. But you can also use other less controversial examples, like the one I offered Victor:\nYou know some people like scientists or political leaders contribute knowledge or ingenuity that could help us solve the overpopulation problem. Since we don\u2019t know which unborn children will grow up to be these people it may not be a good idea to kill them. Why not instead kill people we know aren\u2019t contributing to solving the problem, like the mentally handicapped or people in extreme poverty?\nVictor smiled as he understood where my argument was headed and remarked, \u201cBut you can\u2019t do that, because . . .\u201d As his voice trailed off I replied, \u201cBecause we shouldn\u2019t kill human beings just to ease overpopulation. If a baby in the womb is as human as you or I, doesn\u2019t he deserve the same protection you and I receive?\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that overpopulation doesn\u2019t justify a pro-choice position but a pro-abortion position. What if abortion is kept legal only in order to ease overpopulation, but women as a whole don\u2019t choose to abort? Would the pro-choice advocate argue that women should be forced to have abortions in order to reduce population levels? I doubt most people (at least in America) would argue for that solution. But if it would be wrong to force women to have abortions in order to ease overpopulation, then wouldn\u2019t it be just as wrong to force unborn humans to be aborted for the same reason?\nFinally, while there are concerns about the availability of specific resources like water in certain parts of the world, the world as a whole is not overpopulated, even though people have made this claim for centuries.\nIn 1798 clergyman Thomas Malthus said human populations double every generation but human food production doesn\u2019t increase nearly as quickly, so humanity would eventually run out of food. In 1968 environmentalist Paul Erhlich wrote in The Population Bomb, \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death.\u201d\nOf course, that didn\u2019t happen.\nInstead, humanity learned how to produce more food. We went from producing one ton of wheat per hectare in England in the 18th century to producing nearly eight tons per hectare today. In fact, in many places the problem is not too many children, but too few. In some countries with generous social safety nets, there simply aren\u2019t enough children to support the growing population of aging, retired workers.\nThere are places in the world where people lack access to basic resources, even though there is enough food on earth to feed more than the current population. Killing human beings in the womb won\u2019t help these humans who currently live in poverty. Instead, we need creative approaches to better distribute resources, which is another reason why we shouldn\u2019t kill children in the womb today who may grow up to be the scientists and global leaders who will solve the problems we face in the future.\nThe bottom line of this argument, for apologetics purposes, is this: just as we don\u2019t kill born human beings in order to address social problems, we shouldn\u2019t kill preborn human beings. After all, they are persons just like you and me, made in the image and likeness of God, and they deserve the same respect we deserve.\nDid you like this content?
