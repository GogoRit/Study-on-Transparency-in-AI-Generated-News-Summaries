For Poland, which already had some of Europe\u2019s strictest abortion laws, the decision amounted to a near-total ban on the procedure, sparking mass protests in over 150 Polish cities.\u00a0 \n\n\nnews\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRussian Church Leader Calls to End Abortions to Boost Population\t\t\t\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPrime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and regional heads will be tasked with reassessing Russia\u2019s abortion prevention strategies and developing mechanisms to increase funding for medical organizations that improve their abortion prevention rates, according to Putin\u2019s order published Saturday.\nImproving access to legal, psychological and medical assistance through the maternity insurance program is outlined in Putin's order as a key measure expected to dissuade women from abortion.\u00a0\nRussia, which has one of the world's highest abortion rates, has named abortion reduction as one of its\u00a0key demographic policy priorities. In the past five years, pregnancy terminations have decreased by nearly 30%, Deputy Health Minister Oleg Salagai said Tuesday.\nRussia\u2019s efforts to improve abortion prevention have largely failed to revert its looming demographic crisis, however, with the country\u2019s population predicted to decline by 352,500 in 2020 compared to a decrease of\u00a032,100 in 2019.\nRussia has one of the world\u2019s most liberal abortion laws, with most procedures performed at no cost under the mandatory state health insurance program. Terminating a pregnancy is allowed up until the 12th week, with abortions at later stages only permitted if the pregnancy was a result of rape or for medical reasons.\u00a0\nThe Russian Orthodox Church and conservative lawmakers have pushed for an end to state-funded abortions in recent years.\nWomen\u2019s rights advocates have voiced concern over Russia\u2019s move toward tighter restrictions after the government introduced a mandatory waiting period between the abortion request and the procedure itself in 2011. Some Russian regions also require women to undergo counseling with a priest or a psychologist before the procedure can be performed.\u00a0\nRussian women reported being denied access to free abortions during the coronavirus lockdown this spring when Russian clinics postponed scheduled medical procedures.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more about:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tPutin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,  \n\tWomen\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 we have a small favor to ask.\nAs you may have heard, The Moscow Times, an independent news source for over 30 years, has been unjustly branded as a \"foreign agent\" by the Russian government.
