(CNS photo/Gregory A. Shemitz, Long Island Catholic) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA crowd estimated in the tens of thousands flooded the National Mall for the March for Life on Friday.\nThe annual gathering draws pro-life advocates from all over the U.S. and foreign countries to Washington, D.C., marking the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Jan. 22, 1973 decision that legalized abortion.\nThe march was kicked off by a rally on the National Mall attended by thousands, where President Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to address the March for Life. He did so while Democratic House trial managers were making the case for his impeachment in the U.S. Senate.\n\u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEvery life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting.\u201d\nThe president highlighted recent state-level efforts to expand abortion to include all nine months of pregnancy, singling out legislation passed in New York last year as well as controversial comments by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D).\nTrump was joined on stage by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), March for Life president Jeanne Mancini, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), and others.\nOther speakers at the rally included political figures from both Republican and Democratic parties: the First Lady of Louisiana, Donna Bel Edwards; House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.); Louisiana State Sen. Katrina Jackson (D); U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.); and Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List and co-chair of the Trump 2020 campaign\u2019s pro-life coalition.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as president of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you,\u201d Trump said at the rally, noting that the march was \u201cto defend the right of every child, born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential.\u201d\n\u201cEvery child is a precious and sacred gift from God,\u201d he said.\nFollowing the speeches from the rally\u2019s main stage, the march proper began, progressing up the National Mall towards the Supreme Court.\nCarrying the giant March for Life banner at the front of the crowd is regarded as a privilege, bestowed on a different group each year.\nFor 2020, students at Oakcrest School in McLean, Virginia\u2014a Catholic all-girls middle and high school\u2014led the march. Oakcrest administrators said that the school has a long history of supporting life and participating in the march each year, with classes suspended for the day to allow students and teachers to attend. The banner was carried by members of the school\u2019s student-run Respect Life Club.\nBehind Oakcrest, students at Colorado Christian University carried flags ahead of the main body of the march. The estimated tens of thousands of marchers moved up the National Mall towards the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill, where a few hundred pro-abortion demonstrators had gathered earlier in the day.\nThe theme of the 2020 march,\u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman,\u201d was chosen to mark the centennial anniversary of women\u2019s right to vote in the United States with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920. The march\u2019s theme was chosen to counter the narrative put forward by abortion supporters that the practice \u201cempowers\u201d women.\n\n\n\nJeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, told CNA when the theme was announced that \u201cwe primarily chose it because of the centennial\u201d and to show that real \u201cempowerment\u201d meant valuing the lives of mothers and their unborn children.\nIn an op-ed published Friday morning, Mancini said that \u201cabortion does not improve the lives of women and, unlike many who claim to be part of the women\u2019s movement today, the suffragists wanted no part of it.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion not only destroys women\u2019s offspring, it can also cause lasting physical harm and psychological trauma. It\u2019s a violent step backward that disproportionately affects women,\u201d Mancini said.\n\u201cIt has been 100 years since the suffragists won women the right to vote. They did so over time with single-minded focus and perseverance, and, in the end, gave voice to their voiceless sisters.\u201d\n\u201cWe should not take for granted the progress they made. This November, we should use their victory to give voice to the voiceless unborn. They too deserve equal rights and protection under the law,\u201d said Mancini.\n\n\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

They did so over time with single-minded focus and perseverance, and, in the end, gave voice to their voiceless sisters.\u201d\nWhat use is the right to vote, when the ignorance of the United States\u2019 citizens allows them to mistakenly recognize the unlawful opinion of nine unelected lawyers as somehow \u201cstriking down\u201d state laws passed by duly elected legislators? \nApparently, I am to be the lone voice in the wilderness, but it is impossible from a moral or Constitutional perspective for abortion to be \u201clegalized.\u201d The Supreme Court is not a law-making body-it decides cases-and because abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution (which only applies to the federal government), it is a state issue (by the 10th Amendment), and can\u2019t be reviewed or \u201cstruck down\u201d by the Supreme Court on Constitutional grounds. Furthermore, of course there can be no just \u201claw\u201d passed (by any government) which allows the direct killing of an innocent human life. The right to life is an inalienable natural right. Any \u201claw\u201d which allows the abridgment of this natural right violates the natural law, and therefore is unjust.\nRoe vs. Wade was a piece of legal sophistry, and was an evil, unjust, and false judgment. That it has passed muster as a perfectly valid decision (which somehow has \u201clegalized\u201d abortion by \u201cstriking down\u201d state laws against abortion) in the public square exposes the general ignorance of the population and the tacit complicity of those who should know better and either do not know, are silent when they shouldn\u2019t be (or their voices are being excluded by the mainstream media), or secretly support the wickedness.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFr Peter Morello, PhD\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 26, 2020 at 8:15 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nTruth is not always fair often compelling.  The Woman Rebel newsletter published by Margaret Sanger 1914 vaunts No gods no masters.   The driving principle of today\u2019s feminist movement.  How Ms Sanger got there.  Her mother Ann left potato famine Ireland married Michael Higgins former Civil War Union drummer boy then medical student then stonecutter of religious statues finally atheist fathering 18 children 11 surviving.  Margaret Higgins Irish Catholic born Corning NY spent her youth caring for children her sickly mother who died early could not.  When it touches human life created in God\u2019s image there is no compelling compromise simply hard facts.   Life isn\u2019t always clean cut regards morality the matter settled by the Creator his grace and often heroic virtue.  Otherwise culture collapses into a politics of death.  Death not simply abortion became Sanger\u2019s initial premise for abortion clinics when as social worker NYC she concluded Black are like weeds that must be eliminated.  Clinics opened mainly in poor minority Black areas as today.   The irony is that progressive politicians have convinced Blacks abortion is a procreative right of which conservatives seek to deprive them.  In effect saying Let us help you by killing your babies.  Marjorie Dannenfelser Jeanne Mancini offer women the better option.  The redemptive concept of woman echoing Pres Trump\u2019s quite religious remark Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God.   Woman is the bearer of life like Our Blessed Mother the nurturer of goodness and moral courage.   I would also add Roger Scruton\u2019s  \u201cWithout religion, we risk being lost in the pursuit of pleasure and advantage, tempted away from all durable commitments and without the virtue on which societies ultimately depend, which is the virtue of sacrifice\u201d (Roger Scruton on Sacred Truths in a Profane World in conversation with Hamza Yusuf Editor Renovatio).\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDetlef Kemnitz\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 27, 2020 at 5:34 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nWhy do so many Catholics vote democrat when you know they are in favor of killing babies?\n\nReply \n\n\n \n\n                2 Trackbacks / Pingbacks            \n\n\n\nMore than 225,000 people participated in March for Life | Stand for Christians \n\nThe 47th March for Life | \n \nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.All comments posted at Catholic World Report are moderated.
