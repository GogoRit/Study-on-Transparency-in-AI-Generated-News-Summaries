He performed the abortions from 2000 to 2002, mainly in Indiana \u2013 a state with some of the nation's toughest anti-abortion laws \u2013 at clinics in South Bend, Gary and Fort Wayne.\u00a0He performed tens of thousands of abortions over 40 years, as the only abortion provider in the three cities. Most of the remains were found in the garage of his Illinois home, with others found in one of his vehicles.\u00a0Klopfer's medical license was suspended in 2016 by Indiana regulators who cited shoddy record-keeping and substandard patient monitoring.\u201cThe shocking discovery\u201d of the remains \u201cwas horrifying to anyone with normal sensibilities,\u201d Hill said at the ceremony. \u201cRegrettably, there is no shortage of depravity in our world today, including due regard for the most vulnerable among us.\u201dHill,\u00a0a conservative Republican who opposes abortion rights and is seeking reelection, made opening remarks at the ceremony before taking questions from reporters away from the burial site.He has said his office is investigating the case, but it remains unclear what could be under investigation. A 2016 Indiana law, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in May, requires abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal remains, but it wasn\u2019t in effect from 2000 to 2002.Previously, during Klopfer's career, clinics could turn over fetal remains to processors that dispose of human tissue or other medical material by incineration.Indiana is one of just a few states with a law mandating burial or cremation of fetal remains after abortions. The law did not take immediate effect because of court challenges after then-Gov. Mike Pence signed it into law in 2016. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May upheld the law.Making abortion a felony: Alabama's tough abortion ban blocked by federal judge,\u00a0law would've made most abortions a felonyThe remains found in September were each in small plastic medical bags filled with a chemical preservative called formalin. The bags were stored in cardboard boxes. They were later sent to St. Joseph County to be stored.\u00a0When asked about the gestation age of the remains, Hill said:\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. ... There certainly were some indications that some of the remains would have been outside of the appropriate standard of when it would be appropriate for someone to seek an abortion or qualify for an abortion \u2026 beyond the first trimester.\u201dAt the burial ceremony, people prayed, sang songs and listened to remarks from anti-abortion\u00a0advocates. Serena Dyksen, 44, of Elkhart, said she came because she had an abortion performed by Klopfer as a teenager, after she was raped. She said her parents took her to have the abortion done.\u201cComing here today was just another layer of the healing process,\u201d said Dyksen, who said she has two children, ages 26 and 24. \u201cAs post-abortive men and women, sometimes we think we shouldn\u2019t be able to mourn the loss of our children, but it was a loss of life. It doesn\u2019t matter the situation, the age, I still had a mother\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want to forget what happened,\" she added. \"There are so many hurting women in our community because of this. This is a place for mothers to come to mourn the loss of their children.\u201d\"Regional haven\" for abortion access: Planned Parenthood to open major clinic in IllinoisThe burial plot was donated by the funeral home.\u00a0.U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., did not attend the ceremony but released a statement saying, \"I am praying for these innocent lives cut short and for all victims of abortion \u2013 both unborn babies and their mothers.\"Walorski has sponsored a bill that, similar to Indiana's 2016 law, would require the burial or cremation of aborted fetal remains.Hill, seeking a second term as attorney general, has been under scrutiny in recent months over allegations that he drunkenly groped a female state legislator and three other women at an Indianapolis bar in 2018. He has denied the accusations and put his defense of state laws tightening abortion restrictions at the forefront of his campaign.Two Republicans \u2013 Indiana Department of Revenue Commissioner Adam Krupp, a Plymouth native, and Indianapolis attorney John Westercamp \u2013\u00a0are challenging Hill for the party's attorney general nomination.Contributing: Associated Press\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
