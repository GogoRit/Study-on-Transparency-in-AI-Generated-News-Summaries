Long Garc\u00edaMarch 10, 2020Supporters gather outside before a rally for President Donald Trump at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Friday, Feb, 21, 2020. (Dylan Stewart/Image of Sport via AP)Before starting her own business, Sylvia Menchaca learned the ins and outs of the restaurant industry from her family, who founded La Canasta in Phoenix, Ariz., in 1962. Sylvia\u2019s Off the Grill, also in Phoenix, serves her family\u2019s popular handmade tortillas and authentic Mexican cuisine.Ms. Menchaca is among the 23 percent of U.S. Latino voters who, according to a recent study, strongly support President Trump. Overall, the Pew Research Center found that 30 percent of Latino voters support Mr. Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s what we prayed for. In our family, a lot of people prayed for the United States to be saved,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best president we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dThe minimum wage can have a major impact on small restaurants, Ms. Menchaca said, explaining that when wages go up, it raises the cost of doing business and restaurants raise their prices. In the past, she said, she could pay lower wages to high school and college students who were not providing for children.She hopes Mr. Trump will address the issue if he wins a second term. She would like the federal minimum wage law to distinguish between the first jobs traditionally held by students and the jobs held by those providing for families.\u201cIn our family, a lot of people prayed for the United States to be saved. I think he\u2019s the best president we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dMs. Menchaca said she first wanted Mr. Trump to run for office in 2008 and has supported him since he announced his candidacy in 2015. \u201cWhat this administration has done has helped a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everyone is going to be affected the same way. But we\u2019re employing more people.\u201dIn February, the national unemployment rate dropped to 3.5 percent, with U.S. employers adding 273,000 jobs. The average hourly rate also increased 3 percent, from $27.69 to $28.52.Those kinds of numbers are welcomed by entrepreneurs like Ms. Menchaca, who described herself as a conservative, pro-life Republican and said she likes when Mr. Trump \u201cevokes the name of God.\u201d She relates to Mr. Trump as an entrepreneur and compared being a business owner to being a parent.\u201cHe\u2019s going to make sure we don\u2019t lose money and that we all get treated right,\u201d she said, noting that she supports Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cHe\u2019s going to care about every one of us because we\u2019re like his employees. He\u2019s going to make sure we\u2019re well paid, well fed and safe.\u201dMr. Trump recognized the contributions of Latino business leaders during the Latino Legislative Summit on March 4.\u201cOur Latino communities have always been a vital and indispensable part of the American family,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the beginning of our republic, the exceptional drive, talent, faith, skill, imagination and devotion of Latino Americans has uplifted our entire nation. You\u2019ve deeply enriched American life in history and culture.\u201d\u201cLatinos are not a monolithic voting group. They never have been.\u201dIn another recent study, Pew reported that 83 percent of Latino adults supported a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. The same study found that 76 percent of Latinos supported stronger border security.\u201cLatinos are not a monolithic voting group. They never have been,\u201d said Luis Fraga, the director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame. On average, he said, just under 30 percent of Latinos have supported the Republican candidates for president over the last several decades. \u201cThat\u2019s the norm, no matter who the presidential candidate is,\u201d Mr. Fraga said.The high point was likely President George W. Bush\u2019s 35 to 40 percent support in 2004, though those numbers are debated; the low was Senator Bob Dole\u2019s 21 percent in 1996. Mr. Trump\u2019s current support falls within that range. But one Election Eve poll, Latino Decisions, suggested that only 18 percent of Latinos supported Mr. Trump in 2016.\u201cThe Republican party under George W. Bush was actively pursuing Latino voters and actively praising comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Mr. Fraga said. \u201cThe support is lower now, but it hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d\u201cThe Republican party under George W. Bush was actively pursuing Latino voters and actively praising comprehensive immigration reform.\u201dIn fact, the percent of Latinos who identify as Republican has remained relatively steady for the last 40 years, according to Stephen Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez, chair of Northern Arizona University's department of Politics and International Affairs.President Nixon sought the Latino vote in his re-election campaign, Mr. Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said, and a significant segment of that community has been receptive. Nevertheless, he added, the majority\u201460 to 75 percent\u2014of Latinos are Democrats.Those Latinos who do find a home in the Republican party tend to be from certain groups, Mr. Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said. Those groups include individuals who are involved with business, those who prioritize certain economic concerns and those who see the aesthetic of Republicanism as more patriotic. \u201cSome believe that if you\u2019re an American, this is what you do,\u201d he explained.Others are drawn to the Republican party for religious reasons, especially issues related to abortion and traditional marriage, Mr. Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said. Yet there are significant differences between evangelical Protestants and Catholics, for example. In 2012, one poll found that Latino Catholics strongly supported President Obama\u2019s re-election while Latino evangelicals were more closely divided.\u201cRepublicans are very capable of reaching out to Latinos,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said, noting how the support of many in the Cuban community has benefited the Republican party. \u201cBut more recently, they have seen an electoral benefit of changing that tactic.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s doing more for Latinos without saying he\u2019s doing things benefiting Latinos.\u201dMany of those with Latin American heritage come from countries with histories of deep racial tensions, Mr. Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said. Those who lean Republican \u201ctend to believe that if they have a job and work harder, they will succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deny that racism has the power others say it has.\u201dReymundo Torres of the Arizona Latino Republican Association said that Latinos who support Mr. Trump are not just conservatives, but also those who agree with his \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies.\u201cHe\u2019s doing more for Latinos without saying he\u2019s doing things benefiting Latinos,\u201d Mr. Torres said, noting the low unemployment rate, new jobs and the economy. \u201cThat benefits the entire country. Latinos who support Trump would support anyone with those numbers.\u201dMr. Torres, who described himself as a politically conservative Catholic, takes issue with the church\u2019s positions favoring those who seek refuge in the United States. He has bounced from one parish to the next, finding homilies related to immigration \u201cdisheartening.\u201d His family fled to the United States in 1915, during the Mexican Revolution. \u201cWe came here to save our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t fleeing poverty.\u201d\u201cIn so many homilies, they highlight the holiness of poverty and the evil of success,\u201d Mr. Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. The church has hedged its bets. They\u2019re trying to keep the pews filled.\u201dAt the same time, he said his faith informs his views on abortion and respect for the elderly. Mr. Torres finds his values reflected in the Trump administration. Last year, the Public Religion Research Institute found that most religiously affiliated Latinos were also pro-life, including 58 percent of Hispanic Protestants and 52 percent of Hispanic Catholics.Yet, according to Jeremy Cruz, assistant professor of theology and religious studies at St. John\u2019s University in Queens, the pro-life issue is not a major deciding factor in Latino voting trends. In a recent Latino Decisions poll, only 2 percent of Latino voters cited limiting abortion as an important issue facing the community. The cost of health care (25 percent) and improving incomes (19 percent) were the top issues for the community, according to the poll.\u201cYou can\u2019t let jobs go overseas. I\u2019m glad he pressured companies to keep jobs here.\u201d\u201cMost Latinos are pretty consistently saying the top issues are health care, job creation, wages and income, immigrant rights and condemning racism,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see issues that make for clear Republican talking points.\u201dSome media reports rely too heavily on exit polling data, Mr. Cruz said, noting that the pan-ethnic term \u201cLatino\u201d can be unhelpful when trying to understand trends. For example, studies rarely distinguish between Afro-Latinos and black voters. Also, a sizable portion of Latinos, Mr. Cruz said, come from communities with prejudices against blacks and indigenous peoples.\u201cSome Latinos are receptive to Trump\u2019s messages,\u201d he said. Some in the community do not see those of African or indigenous backgrounds as Latinos at all. Mr. Cruz noted that a number of Latinos work in immigration enforcement. But in general, he said, the media has given a disproportionate amount of coverage to Republican Latinos, whom he considers to be more of a niche group.While he is part of that group, Ed Arroyo is also unhappy with the media. He believes mainstream media outlets have been unfair to Mr. Trump.That said, Mr. Trump was not Mr. Arroyo\u2019s first choice. \u201cProbably third or fourth,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not that happiest person that he tweets so much,\u201d Mr. Arroyo said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s propensity to express his opinions on Twitter.\u201cBut when he did get the nomination, there was no doubt that he was going to get my vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other choice wasn\u2019t an option.\u201dUnder the Obama administration, Mr. Arroyo spent two years unemployed and depleted his savings.RELATED STORIES Why are Hispanic Catholics pro-life?
