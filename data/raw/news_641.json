Planned Parenthood, a Greenville obstetrician and gynecologist, and a Greenville women's health clinic jointly asked for a federal injunction stopping implementation of the law. Friday, they got their answer.U.S. District Court Judge Mary Geiger Lewis handed down her injunction Friday morning, declaring South Carolina's abortion ban \"sideways\" of the U.S. Constitution. Her order came with a scathing legal criticism of the law, the state's elected leaders and attorneys who have pushed it forward.\"It is nothing short of baffling when Defendants here make the fanciful, misbegotten, and misguided argument that the Act is constitutional, although surely, all the while knowing full well that it is not,\" Lewis wrote in her order.She went on to accuse defendants in the case \u2014 Attorney General Alan Wilson, Gov. Henry McMaster and other state leaders \u2014 of playing partisan politics in their passage and defense of the law.First, Lewis acknowledged many opposed to abortion believe the U.S. Supreme Court might soon overturn its landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which affirmed women's right to abortions.Lewis said the idea current SCOTUS justices could or would reverse Roe v. Wade, despite decades of subsequent decisions reaffirming it, is apparently centered on the current makeup of the court, which is theoretically packed with anti-abortion judges.It's true a supposed \"conservative\" majority exists on the High Court after former president Donald Trump successfully had three nominees confirmed and seated as justices during his 4-year term. But Lewis scoffed at the idea current justices will put personal beliefs ahead of the Constitution and nearly 50 years of legal precedent upholding women's right to an abortion. Lewis called the notion \"puzzling, (...) misinformed at best, and highly offensive at worst.\" \"The Court easily rejects such a notion. It has a much higher opinion of the High Court than that,\" Lewis said. \"After all, law libraries are chock-full of judicial opinions affirming a woman\u2019s right to abort a pregnancy before viability, although the authoring judges and justices of those decisions were and are personally fiercely opposed to woman having such a right. Those judges\u2019 and justices\u2019 individual opinions on the matter was and is immaterial to their rulings. And, that is as it should be.\"Lewis added the legal facts and precedent regarding the case meant her decision wasn't even a \"close call,\" and added she \"couldn't fathom how another court could decide this issue differently.\"Roe v. Wade holds women can abort pregnancies without government interference during their first trimester of gestation, which is about 13 weeks from conception. Restrictions can be placed on abortions in the second trimester, and they can be banned altogether in the third trimester except in cases when there's a threat to the mother's life.Friday's ruling means South Carolina's abortion ban is indefinitely blocked. Its future will depend on how Wilson's office proceeds. The state can ask for a hearing in front of Lewis and try to further argue the case there, or appeal to a higher court for a reversal of her decision.Read Judge Lewis' full order in the embedded document viewer below, or CLICK HERE to read it.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\u00a9 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ..."
