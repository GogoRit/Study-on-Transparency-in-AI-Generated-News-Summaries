Why? What does that mean?\u201d Carlson pushed the \u201cGold Digger\u201d rapper, who now legally goes by the first name Ye.\u201cIt just represents life. I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d West explained.\u201cYou wear it on a badge. What kind of response do you get?\u201d Carlson, 53, asked.\u201cI don\u2019t care about people\u2019s responses, but I care about the fact that there are more black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point,\u201d the star shot back.\n\n\n\n3\n\nDuring a political rally in July 2020, the Grammy Award winner went on an emotional anti-abortion rant. AP\n\n\n3\n\nKanye West sits down for an interview with Tucker Carlson on Oct. 6, 2022. Fox News\n\u201cThat 50% of black death in America is abortion. So I really don\u2019t care about people\u2019s response to that. I perform for an audience of one and that is God,\u201d the Grammy winner added.\nNon-Hispanic black women accounted for the highest percentage of abortions performed in the Big Apple in 2019 \u2014 about a third (32 percent) of total abortions, according to the latest city data available. \nBy contrast, non-Hispanic white women accounted for about one-fifth (21 percent) of total abortions in New York City.\n\n\n3\n\nAbortion rights activists protest outside the Supreme Court. Los Angeles Times via Getty Imag\nDuring West\u2019s first political rally in July 2020, the Grammy Award winner went on an emotional anti-abortion rant after telling the crowd in South Carolina that he and his wife, Kim Kardashian, had considered terminating her pregnancy.\n\nHe said at the time that if elected president, he would fight to keep abortion legal but would strongly discourage it by offering people $1 million for every child they have.\n\u201cMy dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy,\u201d West added in the rally.\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\nabortion\n\n\nfox news\n\n\nkanye west\n\n\ntucker carlson\n\n\n10/7/22 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMan shot dead his pal after she beat him at hoops, family ...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tTrending Now\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tin US News\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 58,715 times.\n58,715\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrump sues ABC, George Stephanopoulos for defamation after host accused him of rape in Mace interview\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 38,930 times.\n38,930\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLA socialite accused of conspiring with hubby, daughter to influence witnesses, jury, judge and ex-Yankee pitcher lover\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 36,083 times.\n36,083\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFed-up homeowner arrested after tense standoff with squatters 'stealing' $1M house she inherited from parents\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 28,995 times.\n28,995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat will happen if Trump can\u2019t post $454M bond in his civil fraud case by Monday's deadline?\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow on\n Page Six\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s bios wiped from royal family website\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKate Middleton\u2019s casual farm shop outfit pays tribute to her royal hobbies\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmma Heming celebrates \u2018pure\u2019 husband Bruce Willis\u2019 69th birthday amid dementia battle\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSee All\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tVideo\t\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSenator Ron Johnson grills Secretary Xavier Becerra over COVID-19 documents\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNow on\t\t\t\t Decider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmanda Bynes And Dan Schneider\u2019s Creepy Jacuzzi Sketch Questioned In Explosive \u2018Quiet On The Set\u2019 Documentary: \u201cA Little Odd\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhere To Watch \u2018Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV\u2019 Documentary Online\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeat It!
