More than a public health crisis, the effects of the pandemic have\u00a0exacerbated and brought into focus\u00a0social problems\u00a0that\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0worsening\u00a0for decades\u2014including\u00a0unequal access to health care, poverty,\u00a0and discrimination\u2014that leave communities exceptionally vulnerable to\u00a0emergencies\u00a0like\u00a0COVID-19,\u00a0and\u00a0leaves\u00a0workers with\u00a0few if any\u00a0protections\u00a0in a precarious position.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNow,\u00a0as governments grapple to provide relief, local organizations and activists\u00a0are\u00a0playing a critical role in\u00a0responding to the pandemic.\u00a0But\u00a0they\u00a0continue to face\u00a0increased restrictions, threats, and attacks intended to curtail activism and stifle dissent\u2014and they urgently need\u00a0sufficient resources\u00a0and\u00a0political\u00a0support\u00a0from\u00a0the international philanthropic community to continue their\u00a0efforts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Fund for Global Human Rights initiated a COVID-19 impact survey to assess\u00a0the challenges and opportunities that emerged for civil society over the first three months of the pandemic.\u00a0Drawing on a deep\u00a0global\u00a0network of\u00a0frontline activists\u00a0and organizations\u00a0from more than twenty countries,\u00a0the Fund surveyed\u00a0over 200\u00a0grantee\u00a0human rights\u00a0organizations in late April and early May to better understand how the pandemic has impacted\u00a0their work.\u00a0\n\n\nThe survey offers\u00a0valuable\u00a0insights into\u00a0how the activism\u00a0landscape has changed\u2014and what kind of\u00a0support\u00a0is\u00a0necessary to sustain human rights\u00a0work\u00a0through\u00a0this\u00a0period of global crisis\u00a0and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\nDespite the challenging circumstances, frontline activists are demonstrating\u00a0remarkable\u00a0resilience\u00a0and pivoting to respond\u00a0differently\u00a0to community needs.\u00a0\n\n\nNearly half of the survey\u2019s respondents\u00a0reported that they were still able to engage in their core work areas,\u00a0like advocating for LGBTQ equality or defending\u00a0Indigenous peoples\u2019 land and resource rights. And 40%\u00a0of respondents said that they were able to continue some core\u00a0activities\u00a0while also taking on new areas of work\u00a0such as\u00a0monitoring government actions\u00a0in response to the pandemic,\u00a0documenting the impact\u00a0of COVID-19 on their constituencies, or\u00a0providing community education\u00a0on health and safety. Remarkably, 11%\u00a0of respondents said that they had engaged entirely with\u00a0these\u00a0new areas of work or activities,\u00a0which\u00a0 they\u00a0had not previously carried out,\u00a0in order to address the pandemic.\u00a0A\u00a0minimal number of respondents\u2014only\u00a03%\u2014answered that they were unable to continue working, and none expected\u00a0to shut down entirely.\u00a0\n\n\nDespite this\u00a0largely positive\u00a0outlook,\u00a0the\u00a0picture is likely to change over time\u00a0as groups learn of more lost funding,\u00a0donors shift priorities,\u00a0and\u00a0the public health crisis deepens across new geographies.\u00a0This\u00a0change is already taking place\u00a0as activists working with\u00a0historically\u00a0marginalized groups\u2014including\u00a0Indigenous peoples and religious, ethnic, and racial minorities\u00a0disproportionately impacted by COVID-19\u2014have seen firsthand.\n\nAround the world, botched or wanting pandemic responses have highlighted deep cracks in global and domestic systems\u2014from massive disruptions in the\u00a0transnational\u00a0food supply chain\u00a0to marginalized workers being\u00a0excluded from government assistance programs.\u00a0Human rights activists have demonstrated their capacity to redirect their resources and balance short-term\u2014and often life-or-death\u2014priorities with their longer-term goals. Thanks to this capacity for adaptation and responsiveness, civil society is poised to\u00a0meet\u00a0this moment of reckoning.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, human rights defenders are working under tremendous pressure. The pandemic has generated new priorities and urgencies, even as the immense challenges of frontline activism have multiplied.\u00a0\n\n\nFrom Hungary to\u00a0Brazil, governments have taken advantage of lockdowns and emergency measures to close civic spaces, curb fundamental freedoms, and stifle opposition.\u00a0And in an effort to consolidate power, authoritarian or populist leaders are abusing prudent health and safety restrictions to specifically target human rights defenders.\u00a0Nearly half\u00a0of survey respondents reported that they had\u00a0already\u00a0been targeted by restrictions, curfews, or containment measures.\n\nIn Honduras, several prominent activists\u00a0were\u00a0arrested on trumped-up charges\u00a0related to the pandemic, many of whom were attacked or jailed without access to legal recourse. Over 50%\u00a0of survey respondents reported\u00a0challenges to the normal functioning of protection mechanisms for human rights defenders.\nIn addition to these mounting dangers, survey respondents reported that infrastructure issues\u2014including lost funding\u00a0(37 respondents),\u00a0sick staff (10 respondents),\u00a0and reduced staff due to budget cuts\u00a0(25 respondents)\u2014were impacting their work. A quarter of respondents reported that technical difficulties, such as the lack of reliable internet or access to banks, pose a major challenge. Others mentioned\u00a0dealing\u00a0with\u00a0impacts to their personal\u00a0well-being, looking after\u00a0sick family,\u00a0or\u00a0lacking\u00a0access to critical supplies\u00a0as paramount difficulties\u2014an important reminder that human rights defenders are vulnerable to the same systemic inequalities they fight to overcome.\nThe imperative for human rights groups to demonstrate their relevance by addressing\u00a0their\u00a0community\u2019s\u00a0needs is made crystal clear by the impacts of the pandemic, which cut across areas of economic and social rights, health rights, migrants\u2019 rights, and beyond. As they fill gaps in governments\u2019 pandemic responses and fight for those most vulnerable to receive the resources and attention they need, frontline groups have the opportunity to continue expanding their grassroots constituencies by demonstrating their value to more people.\nIn recent years, the international human rights movement has been in a process of rethinking its role and strategies, and the pandemic is accelerating this reflection.\u00a0This kind of crisis\u2014and the myriad effects reported by survey respondents\u2014begs funders to consider how they balance\u00a0being\u00a0nimble, adaptive, and reactive\u00a0to emergencies such as COVID-19\u00a0with the values and strategy of long-term support and\u00a0movement building.\nThese examples and data demonstrate the importance\u00a0but also\u00a0the effectiveness of partnering\u00a0with frontline groups\u00a0that\u00a0are rooted in\u00a0their\u00a0communities and well-positioned to continue\u00a0their\u00a0critical, long-term\u00a0work\u00a0even as they adapt to shifting priorities. As funders, we must trust our\u00a0frontline partners to assess their communities\u2019 greatest needs and offer the flexibility to pivot amid a crisis.\u00a0This means flexible funding, of course,\u00a0but it also entails\u00a0support for holistic security\u00a0and\u00a0wellness,\u00a0and\u00a0emergency funds and political support for activists that are targeted.\nAs funders, we must trust our\u00a0frontline partners to assess their communities\u2019 greatest needs and offer the flexibility to pivot amid a crisis.\nAs different groups learn to navigate this new operating environment, it\u00a0is critical that funders make space for\u00a0cross-regional and intersectional exchanges, following the lead and priority of frontline activists,\u00a0to compare\u00a0 strategies, share learning, and foster solidarity.\n\nMore than 70%\u00a0of survey respondents said they had explored or considered engaging with other groups working on similar issues\u00a0and were interested in connecting with their peers. But with nearly a quarter indicating they have unreliable\u00a0internet,\u00a0funders must play a greater role in providing tech support and the means to collaborate.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Fund\u2019s COVID-19 impact survey set out to answer\u00a0the same question activists ask every day: what does our community need?\u00a0The answers were a heartening\u00a0reaffirmation\u00a0of the resilience of civil society, as well as a\u00a0pertinent\u00a0reminder that, in times of crisis, our support must meet the demands of the moment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe pandemic is accelerating the need for adaptation and, as funders,\u00a0we\u00a0should\u00a0take our cue from how local rights groups are\u00a0nimbly pivoting to address both immediate and longer-term needs. As grassroots activists and advocates overcome mounting adversities to offer life-changing support in a historic moment of global turmoil, funders must learn, adapt, and evolve alongside them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid B.
