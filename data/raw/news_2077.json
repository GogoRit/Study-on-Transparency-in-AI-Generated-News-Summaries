Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing women\u2019s access to abortion. But it was a dramatic change in this predominantly Catholic nation that could lend momentum to efforts to legalize abortion across the country. Under Mexico \u2018s legal system, the ruling did not invalidate all criminal penalties for abortion, which remained on the books Thursday in 20 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states.But the ruling does mean that government health providers now need not worry about federal penalties for abortion, because the court ruled that they were an unconstitutional violation of women\u2019s human rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico decriminalizes abortion, extending Latin American trend of widening access to procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists\u2019 network in Mexico helps U.S. women get abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike US, Mexico faces a state-by-state divide over abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of Mexican women receive health-care services from the national government, granting the ruling immediate impact. The ruling also gave abortion rights advocates a powerful tool that they can use to continue their state-by-state work of challenging abortion restrictions. However, along with those restrictions still on the books in many states, many millions of Mexican women work outside the formal economy, placing them outside those quickly affected by Wednesday\u2019s ruling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortions are not widely prosecuted as a crime in Mexico, but many doctors refuse to provide them, citing the law.Celebration of the ruling spilled out onto social media.\u201cToday is a day of victory and justice for Mexican women!\u201d Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Women wrote in a message on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. The government organization called the decision a \u201cbig step\u201d toward gender equality.Sen. Olga S\u00e1nchez Cordero, a former Supreme Court justice, said on X that the ruling represented an advance toward \u201ca more just society in which the rights of all are respected.\u201d \n\nBut others in Mexico decried the decision. Irma Barrientos, director of the Civil Association for the Rights of the Conceived, said opponents will continue the fight against expanded abortion access.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d Barrientos said. \u201cLet\u2019s remember what happened in the United States. After 40 years, the Supreme Court reversed its abortion decision, and we\u2019re not going to stop until Mexico guarantees the right to life from the moment of conception.\u201dAcross Latin America, countries have made moves to lift abortion restrictions in recent years, a trend often referred to as a \u201cgreen wave,\u201d in reference to the green bandanas carried by women protesting for abortion rights in the region.Some American women already had been seeking help from Mexican abortion rights activists to obtain pills used to end pregnancies.Mexico City was the first Mexican jurisdiction to decriminalize abortion 16 years ago.Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion could not be treated as a crime in one northern state. That decision set off a slow state-by-state process of decriminalizing it.\n\nLast week, the central state of Aguascalientes became the 12th to drop criminal penalties.What Wednesday\u2019s ruling does now \u2014 in theory \u2014 is obligate federal agencies to provide abortion care to patients, said Fernanda D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n, sub-director and legal expert for women\u2019s rights group IPAS. D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n said removing the federal ban also takes away another excuse for denying abortions in states where the procedure is no longer a crime.But she and officials at other feminist organizations said they worried that women, particularly in more conservative areas, may still be denied.After decades of work by activists across the region, Argentina in 2020 legalized the procedure. In 2022, Colombia, a highly conservative country, did the same.Since last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision, most states led by conservative lawmakers and governors have adopted bans or tighter restrictions. Meanwhile, states with liberal governments have taken steps to try to protect abortion access.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. government is politically divided makes a nationwide ban or legalization unlikely, at least in the short term.In the southern state of Guerrero, Marina Reyna, director of the Guerrero Association Against Violence toward Women, cautioned that challenges would persist. Her state decriminalized abortion last year, but there are 22 open investigations against women accused of ending their pregnancies.\u201cThere is still a lot of resistance,\u201d she said.___Associated Press Writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
