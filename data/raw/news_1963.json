Greg Gianforte on Tuesday announced signing four abortion restrictions into law, including an immediate ban on dilation and evacuation abortions, the most common type of procedure after about 15 weeks of pregnancy. The governor\u2019s office said other bills signed this week included two restrictions on Medicaid coverage for abortion and stricter regulations for clinics.\u00a0\nThe package of legislation, in addition to five other bills the Republican governor approved earlier this month, is expected to kickstart at least one legal challenge from reproductive rights groups seeking to maintain Montana\u2019s status as a state with strong legal protections for abortion access. Gianforte\u2019s sanctioning of the long-standing conservative agenda also came days after the Montana Supreme Court upheld a nearly 25-year-old legal precedent allowing abortion access under the state Constitution\u2019s right to privacy. That case, Weems v. State, found that advanced practice nurse practitioners with proper training can provide abortions in Montana and reaffirmed that women have a fundamental right \u201cto seek abortion care from a qualified health care provider of her choosing, absent a clear demonstration of a medically acknowledged, bona fide health risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nrelated\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWith some Republican abortion restrictions signed into law, critics blast government overreach into personal health care choices In the wake of the 2023 Legislature, the Montana Republican Party on Wednesday celebrated a stack of new laws restricting abortion and reproductive health care, setting up a likely clash with the state\u2019s nearly 25-year-old court ruling that broadly permits abortion as a private medical choice.\n\n\nby Mara Silvers \n05.03.202305.05.2023 \n\n\n\n\nThat ruling did not temper the governor\u2019s enthusiasm for endorsing additional abortion restrictions Tuesday.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to round out our legislative session with another suite of pro-life, pro-family bills that protect the lives of unborn babies in Montana,\u201d Gianforte said in a written statement about the bill signings.\nThe governor did veto one abortion bill on Tuesday, House Bill 968, to revise parental consent laws for minors seeking an abortion when they are under 16 years old. In his veto letter, Gianforte said the Republican-sponsored bill would effectively weaken parental rights and increase consultation from medical professionals. Helena District Court Judge Chris Abbott is still considering an ongoing case about whether a parental notification requirement for a minor\u2019s abortion is legal.\u00a0\nA press secretary for the attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to questions Monday about how Attorney General Austin Knudsen plans to enforce the dilation and evacuation ban, House Bill 721.\u00a0\nAs written, the bill bars \u201cdismemberment abortion,\u201d a nonmedical term that the legislation defines in part as \u201cthe use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or other substance or device\u201d to intentionally terminate pregnancies and the \u201cinsertion of grasping instruments\u201d to remove a fetus. The bill makes exceptions for abortions used to treat an ectopic pregnancy or \u201ca separation procedure performed because of a medical emergency and prior to the ability of the unborn child to survive outside of the womb with or without artificial support.\u201d Medical practitioners found to have violated the law, the bill says, are guilty of a felony and could be subject to a $50,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison.\nRepresentatives of Planned Parenthood of Montana, one of the state\u2019s abortion providers impacted by the new law, framed HB 721 as contradictory to the state Constitution and medical best practices in a Tuesday statement. The group filed a motion for a temporary restraining order shortly after 2:00 p.m., asking Helena District Court Judge Mike Menahan to prevent the state and the attorney general\u2019s office from enforcing the law.\u00a0\n\u201cAbsent emergency injunctive relief, Montanans will be irreparably harmed by denial of their constitutionally protected right to access pre-viability abortion care and will suffer irreversible health consequences,\u201d the filing said.\u00a0\nMontana\u2019s Planned Parenthood affiliate first attempted to block enforcement of HB 721 in April, before the legislation was transmitted to the governor\u2019s desk. Despite the organization\u2019s claim that the bill\u2019s immediate effective date would disrupt services and put providers in legal jeopardy, Helena District Court Judge Kathy Seeley dismissed the motion for being premature.\u00a0\nIn later court filings, attorneys for the state attorney general\u2019s office called the April lawsuit and motions to block HB 721 \u201cfrivolous\u201d because the bill had not yet been signed into law. Attorneys also moved to sanction lawyers for Planned Parenthood of Montana, specifically Raph Graybill of Graybill Law Firm, for allegedly not acting in good faith when they knew the bill was not yet law. Menahan, who took over the case, has not issued an order on that motion.\nFlanked by Republican lawmakers at a bill-signing ceremony in early May, Gianforte pledged his support for HB 721, the restrictions on Medicaid use for abortions and other abortion bills. He proceeded to sign a bill banning abortion after 24 weeks and requiring an ultrasound prior to all procedures; another that interprets the constitutional right to privacy as excluding abortion access; a bill mandating medical care for infants born after an abortion; a \u201cright of conscience\u201d bill for medical providers; and a policy to increase reporting requirements for medication abortions.\n\u201cThank you for protecting life, for protecting our children, for promoting stronger families,\u201d Gianforte said at the time. \u201cThank you for uniting in our shared belief that every human life is precious and must be protected.\u201d\nThe bill to require ultrasounds for all abortions, House Bill 575, was blocked from taking effect by Judge Menahan on May 4.\u00a0\nIn a separate case, Menahan also temporarily blocked a state health department rule requiring pre-authorization for using Medicaid funds to cover abortions and limiting the providers who can receive that reimbursement to physicians and physician assistants.\n\n\n\nThat rule \u2014 similar to House Bill 544, one of the laws Gianforte signed this week \u2014\u00a0may now conflict with the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision Friday in the Weems case allowing advanced registered nurses to provide abortions within their scope of practice.\u00a0\nACLU of Montana attorney Alex Rate, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs suing over the Medicaid rule, said the most recent state Supreme Court ruling emphasized the strength of Montana\u2019s protections for reproductive rights.\n\u201cThe right to abortion is going to persist in Montana,\u201d Rate said. \u201cWhat the courts are very concerned with is the government inserting itself between patients and their private medical decisions.\u201d\nHearings about the challenged abortion restrictions are currently scheduled in Menahan\u2019s court in Helena on May 23.\nThis story was updated May 16, 2023, to include the filing of a legal motion for a temporary restraining order to to prevent the state and the attorney general\u2019s office from enforcing the law.\u00a0\n \n\n\nlatest stories\n\n\n\nMontana Supreme Court allows abortion ballot proposal to proceed After two months of litigation and consideration, the Montana Supreme Court has overruled the state attorney general\u2019s January finding that a constitutional initiative to secure abortion rights is \u201clegally insufficient,\u201d resolving one dispute while setting up additional hurdles before the question can be put to voters on the November ballot.\n\n\nby Mara Silvers \n03.18.202403.18.2024 \n\n\n\n\nPathways to clarity Stakeholders in the corner-crossing debate outline the pros and cons of proposals that could bring clarity to the legality of corner-crossing in Montana.\n\n\nby Amanda Eggert \n03.18.2024 \n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t name your legislative district?
