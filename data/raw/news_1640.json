Wade was overturned, hundreds of frantic phone calls have poured into\u00a0fertility centers across the nation from patients worried not about abortion access\u00a0but about their frozen embryos.Patients are contacting doctors to discuss\u00a0the legal status of fertilized embryos and decide whether to move them to states with looser abortion restrictions, said Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron, vice president and physician at Fertility Centers of Illinois.\u00a0\"There's so much unknown that it creates a great sense of uncertainty,\" she said.The growing concerns\u00a0come\u00a0as some abortion laws and bills moving through legislatures, including in Kansas and Wyoming,\u00a0threaten to jeopardize access to\u00a0in vitro fertilization, a type of assisted reproductive technology.Bills defining life as beginning at fertilization or that give embryos legal rights may limit people's control over how their own embryos are used, said Seema Mohapatra, a health law professor at SMU Dedman School of Law\u00a0in Dallas.This is \"more of a future concern,\" she said, though \"unfortunately, states are moving fast, so there is reason to be worried.\"THREATS TO MEDICATION ABORTION:A Texas judge could soon force a major abortion pill off market nationwideIVF patients raise concerns nationwideAt\u00a0Pacific Northwest Fertility in Seattle,\u00a0reproductive endocrinologist Dr. Lora Shahine said her office also got a wave of phone calls from fertility patients wanting to move embryos there.\u00a0She said there is an increased cost, complexity and risk of damage to embryos\u00a0associated with moving them because of the possible threat\u00a0to IVF access.\"When politicians are making these laws, they don't understand the long-term impact they're having on all reproductive health care, including IVF,\" said Shahine, a founding member of Doctors for Fertility, a national advocacy group supporting IVF and reproductive care access.\u00a0\"It's a much bigger issue than people realize.\"Amid \"growing uncertainty about legal protections\" for IVF, TMRW Life Sciences, a New York-based technology company that stores frozen eggs and embryos, is getting requests\u00a0to move eggs and embryos to New York, said\u00a0Lindsay Beck, the company's chief impact officer.\"It's incredibly demoralizing for physicians and patients,\" Hirshfeld-Cytron said. \"It creates an incredible sense of despair. And for fertility patients, this is already such a stressful, costly process.\"DEMOCRATS WANTING TO LEGALLY PROTECT IVF:Common process by which people get pregnant is in legal jeopardyWhat is IVF and why is it important?IVF is a common process by which people get pregnant and is responsible for about 84,000 babies a year, according to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2020, at least 600,000 frozen embryos were in storage nationwide, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.The process is often used by couples having trouble conceiving, LGBTQ couples and people trying to prevent passing on terminal genetic illness or high risks of cancer to children,\u00a0Hirshfeld-Cytron said.IVF\u00a0can easily cost $20,000 each try.WITHOUT ROE, WHAT HAPPENS TO IVF?:People struggling to conceive worry embryos are at riskAbortion laws may threaten IVF accessA growing number of bills in state legislatures\u00a0define\u00a0life as beginning at fertilization or give embryos legal rights through \"personhood bills,\" Mohapatra said.Most recently, a Kansas bill that criminalizes \"unlawful destruction of a fertilized embryo\" advanced to the state's Senate this month. A Wyoming bill introduced last month and moved to a legislative committee Wednesday would assert that life begins at conception.Many of these\u00a0abortion bans and proposals\u00a0don't include\u00a0exceptions for IVF, raising concerns\u00a0over whether they could limit parts of the IVF process, including potentially removing\u00a0embryos that fail to implant in the uterus or disposing of unused embryos left over after the procedure. This may make IVF less effective, more expensive and less accessible, Mohapatra said.\"The people making these potential laws don't understand the science or the biology, and they don't have the sophistication of scientific knowledge to even really answer our questions,\" Hirshfeld-Cytron said. \"That's a scary place to be, to have politicians with\u00a0a high school level of science describing to us how we should restrict medical care.\"'IT'S TIME FOR US TO BE BOLD':Why six religious leaders are fighting to expand abortion accessWhat IVF patients can doMohapatra said that if she had embryos \"in a state that does not explicitly protect abortion rights,\" she would move them. Doing so does come\u00a0with added cost and\u00a0a small risk that something could happen to the embryos during transit,\u00a0Mohapatra said.\"IVF costs a lot of money,\" she said. \"It's very emotionally and physically taxing. And the fact that someone else could have control over something so personal is really concerning.\"Shahine recommended patients stay in touch with their clinics and doctors. She said patients also can stay up to date through the organizations Doctors for Fertility, Resolve and\u00a0American Society for Reproductive Medicine.Meanwhile, a group of Democratic senators introduced the Right to Build Families Act last year in an attempt to\u00a0legally protect the right to use IVF. In December, the bill was referred to a committee on health, education, labor on pensions.Contributing: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAYContact Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
