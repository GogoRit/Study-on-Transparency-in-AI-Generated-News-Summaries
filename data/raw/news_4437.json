Because around 90 per cent of all legal abortions in the country are performed on this criterion, upon entering into force this ruling will\u00a0in practice\u00a0drastically limit access to safe termination of pregnancy. It stands in opposition to medical science and to the will of the majority of the population, which\u2014according to the polls\u2014supports the existing abortion regime, already one of the strictest in Europe.\u00a0\nThis battle\u00a0started as early as 2016, with \u2018pro-life\u2019 associations\u00a0lobbying\u00a0the parliament\u00a0for an amendment to the law. They failed then but the change has now effectively been introduced by the Constitutional Court. The new\u00a0status quo\u00a0is not only controversial on its merits but also because the court\u2019s\u00a0judicial neutrality,\u00a0vis-\u00e0-visthe governing Law and Justice Party (PiS),\u00a0has long been questioned.\u00a0\nAs a result, massive protests\u00a0broke out, bringing thousands on to the streets, in Poland and among the diaspora around the world. Left and liberal female MPs occupied the podium in parliament. The protesters disrupted services of the Catholic Church, in protest at its political influence. Far-right paramilitary groups trying to set up a \u2018national guard\u2019 to protect churches were outnumbered by protesters and needed police protection themselves.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin 23,000+ informed readers and stay ahead with our insightful content.\u00a0\nIt's free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n  Loading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n  Loading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you!\nPlease check your inbox and click on the link in the confirmation email to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unrest continues, with more rallies planned home and abroad, including strikes, demonstrations and high activity on \u2018social media\u2019. Step by step, the demands are turning from securing access to abortion to the resignation of the government.\nAccumulating anger\nThe public outcry in reaction to the ruling indicates there is more to this story than a fight for reproductive rights. In fact, this huge outbreak of anger has been accumulating for a while.\n\nBecome a Social Europe Member\n\nSupport independent publishing and progressive ideas by becoming a Social Europe member for less than 5 Euro per month.

From the outset, these have been turbulent times, marked by diverse protests\u2014by doctors, teachers, farmers, miners and parents of disabled children. The pandemic has only aggravated the public mood, adding to the frustration of the most affected groups, such as micro- and small entrepreneurs, as well as coronavirus-deniers, a movement also germinating in Poland.\u00a0\nNevertheless, it\u2019s the ideological war which seems to have agitated the society and petrified the political polarisation. The presidential election during the summer was won by Andrzej Duda, candidate of the United Right, by the skin of his teeth. The\u00a0PiS\u00a0retains a majority in the\u00a0Sejm, the lower chamber, thanks only to its two junior coalition partners, while the\u00a0Senat\u00a0was lost to the opposition after the parliamentary elections in October 2019. Local governments and cities remain independent and very often in opposition to the central government.\nDefamation campaign\nThe leader of the\u00a0PiS, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, thus desperately need to cement the populist party\u2019s domination. Meanwhile, one of the junior coalition partners\u2014the leader of which holds the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Public Prosecutor in his hand\u2014has been testing how far it can go in building an electoral base with a radical-right agenda.\u00a0\nIt was in this context that over the summer the LGBT community in Poland became the target of a\u00a0defamation campaign, which sadly mobilised many and mainstreamed homophobic narratives. It seems the\u00a0PiS\u00a0wanted to deliver a pointed response, to prove its ideological \u2018purity\u2019\u2014and completely overdid it, putting its own government at existential risk. In so doing, it again tested the boundaries of what remains a young Polish democracy.\nThe government led by the\u00a0PiS\u00a0had already\u00a0made public media an instrument of political campaigning\u00a0and\u00a0bent the judiciary to its political will, and now it compromises basic civil rights. The abortion ban was only the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u00a0\nThe latest protests have engaged men and women, of all ages, in big cities and smaller towns. They have to be seen in a broader context of defending democratic standards against\u00a0an authoritarian mindset\u00a0that\u00a0wishes to strip individuals of\u00a0their civil liberties,\u00a0one by one,\u00a0in pursue of absolute power.\nDramatic scenes\nNor is Poland the only example of citizen\u00a0resistance. Hungarians and Bulgarians have also taken to the streets,\u00a0in defence\u00a0of academic freedom\u00a0and\u00a0against widespread corruption\u00a0respectively. The most dramatic scenes are of course to be seen in Belarus (outside the European Union), where massive protests\u00a0against the 26-year rule\u00a0of Alexander Lukashenka have persisted since a highly contested presidential election in August.\u00a0\nThere is a lot of upheaval in Europe these days, seeking to save democratic institutions while proving the desire for democracy in citizens\u2019 hearts and minds. Yet, these struggles do not seem to resonate much beyond national bubbles and public opinion in Europe sees them rather as country-specific\u2014hence not as issues which might be tackled within the EU framework.\u00a0\nThe EU\u2019s ineffectual\u00a0clash with Poland and Hungary\u00a0over \u2018article 7\u2019\u2014the treaty clause allowing rights enjoyed by a member state to be suspended, by unanimity, for \u2018serious and persistent breach\u2019 of European values\u2014has proved there are not yet the tools and procedures in place to safeguard democratic standards in Europe. Nevertheless, we have to start looking at local democratic deficits as our common cause, beyond the east-west divide and without distancing the European core from its peripheries.\u00a0\nDemocracy is a process and it comes in different shapes and forms. But without a\u00a0common\u00a0safeguarding mechanism and agreement on its basic values,\u00a0European integration\u00a0not only will not succeed\u2014it will be permanently threatened by local outbursts of illiberal, authoritarian desires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t            Maria Sk\u00f3ra                \n\n\n\n\n\nDr Maria Sk\u00f3ra is a researcher and political analyst in Berlin.

We cast a spotlight on the 2024 European Parliament elections and extend our attention to the broader political landscape. Reform of the EU treaties, enlargement, the twin transition and international developments are some of the topics of this year\u2019s edition.\nThe book also includes an interview with the recipient of the FEPS Progressive Person of the Year award: Teresa Ribera.\n\n\n\r\nDOWNLOAD HERE\nHans B\u00f6ckler Stiftung Advertisement\n \nComparing living and working conditions: Germany out-performs the United States\nThis paper compares living and working conditions in the US and Germany for the year 2022 with a focus on economic, social and environmental standards. Emphasis is also placed on income and wealth inequality.\nTwelve dimensions of comparison are used, split into 15 themes, examined with 80 indicators. Germany comes out ahead on 10 of the themes. When the relative sizes of the gaps are also taken into account, Germany gets an overall score of 23 and the US only 6.\nThis paper is, to the knowledge of the author, the only comprehensive comparison of living conditions in the US and Germany.  The framing of the comparison is the analysis of two different types of capitalism. It underlines the limited role of per capita gross domestic product in the living conditions of the majority of the population while highlighting the impact of institutions and the type of welfare state.\n\n\nDOWNLOAD HERE\nETUI advertisement\n \nHesaMag #28 Workers and the climate challenge\nDiscover the new HesaMag (available in French and English) and subscribe free of charge twice a year through the post. The special report explores in more detail the multi-faceted nature of the problem of the climate crisis for occupational safety and health. For countless workers across Europe, there are two aspects. The first is climate change itself and all the dangers it poses to workers\u2019 physical (eg heat stress) and mental health. The other side of the coin is the transition that our societies and economies must undertake to mitigate climate change\u2014with, for instance, the potential health costs of the EU\u2019s drive towards critical raw-material extraction and the dangerous culture of subcontracting and deregulation in today\u2019s offshore-energy industries.\n\n\n\r\nAVAILABLE HERE\nEurofound advertisement\n \nHow to improve gender equality in the world of work?\nDespite gender equality being a core principle of the European Union, women are less likely to be in employment than men in all EU member states and are paid less than men in almost every member state, with the pay gap larger in higher paying jobs.\nListen to research experts discuss how to tackle the gender employment and pay gaps in Europe in a Eurofound Talks podcast. \n\n\nLISTEN HERE\nFriedrich Ebert Stiftung advertisement\n \nIt\u2018s all about jobs: investing in Europe\u2019s workers and qualifications for a competitive clean economy\nAn ecological miracle on the labour market? Or rather job losses? The impact on employment and job profiles in Europe of ecological modernisation is a question driving politics and society.\nWe have taken a close look at studies and forecasts on the development of the European labour market. One thing is clear: without qualified and motivated workers, the economy will not flourish and the modernisation process will come to a standstill. Europe must deliver on a massive scale in the coming years to remain at the forefront.\nWe spoke to trade unionists and experts: what trends do we need to shape, what risks do we need to avoid, what course do we need to set now?
