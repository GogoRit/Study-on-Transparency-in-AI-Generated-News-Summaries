World Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen worldwide continue to live in societies that provide them unequal opportunities to succeed. In many parts of the world women are less valued than men and at times their rights are violated leaving them with little recourse. \u00a0On the positive\u00a0side, we see progress in many important dimensions, such as increased participation in the economy and leadership globally. \u00a0\nSuch progress gives us hope that societies today are less tolerant of inequality and injustice than past generations. Unfortunately, progress across countries and regions is unequal, and in some parts of the world women are seeing worsening conditions; especially when it comes to violence against them. \u00a0\nIn El Salvador, a Central American country that is well aware of the importance of women in its development plan, it is still a challenge to make meaningful inroads to address societal norms that perpetuate disadvantages, biases and exclusion of women. \u00a0Despite progress in education participation of girls and political representation of women, violence\u2014intrafamilial, social, sexual, institutional\u2014against women in the country is among the highest in the world (and\u00a0 the number of homicides is the highest in the Latin American and Caribbean region).Very few Salvadoran women (among the lowest in the region) participate in the economy or see opportunities for themselves in the country (compelling them to emigrate), and social norms limit how much girls can reach their full potential and how much women can participate in society.\u00a0\nCurrently, El Salvador is one of 14 countries in the world with at least 50% of women ministers. \u00a0\u00a0This is a concerted strategy by the government to level the playing field for women to have a voice in policy and decision-making in the country. \u00a0And even though other parts of government still have minimal representation of women\u201427 out of 262 mayors, for example\u2014there is increased recognition in government and society that having women in leadership roles is good for development. \u00a0Unfortunately, patriarchal societal norms such as prioritizing \u00a0men before women for jobs and leadership \u00a0are likely to limit real progress. \u00a0\nThere have also been meaningful gains in achieving parity in literacy among those below 30 years of age, and in improving school attendance for both genders. \u00a0But taking girls out of school in early years is still common, especially among poorer households, which perpetuates lower school completion and limits access to productive work later in life. \u00a0Another area of improvement observed is in the reduction of pregnancies among teenagers between 15 and 19.\nYears of effective campaigns focused on sexual and reproductive health has helped reduce teen pregnancy in the country and rates are now in par with the regional average. Unfortunately, pregnancy among young girls, 15 or less, remains high; \u00a0and many of these pregnancies are the result of sexual violence. The gender observatory for El Salvador shows that 75% of sexual abuses against women were experienced by girls younger than 17 in 2019. \u00a0This includes 848 cases against very young girls (under 11 years of age). \u00a0Such high incidence of violence against girls can have both short-term and long-term social, psychological and economic consequences that hamper these girls\u2019 personal development.\u00a0\nViolence against girls and women takes many forms and in El Salvador it affects seven out of ten women throughout their life. \u00a0\u00a0Fifty-three percent of those who report are victims of psychological violence while the rest report having suffered physical or sexual violence. \u00a0The country has the second highest women murder rate in the world, and the highest in the Latin American and Caribbean region. \u00a0The vast majority of women\u2019s deaths in the country is a result of acts perpetrated by existing or previous intimate partners or spouses. \u00a0\nPromoting women empowerment\nOne of the main strategies to bring women along in the development path of El Salvador is to promote women\u2019s economic empowerment.\u00a0 \u00a0 To date, only half of all Salvadoran women participate in the labor market, in contrast with 80% of men and 57% of women in the rest of the region. \u00a0\nAnd when women do participate in the job market, they face discrimination in hiring and compensation, and they are often consigned to less productive jobs and sectors in the economy. \u00a0Around one in four women suffered discrimination at work at some point in their lives, and one in ten in the last year. Of those who suffer this, about 45% report receiving less pay compared to male peers doing the same work, and 10% were threatened with dismissal for requesting personal leave to care for children or sick family members. More strikingly, 38% of women who reported some form of harassment or violence against them in the workplace were dismissed. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe absence of women from economic activity is most pronounced among poorer households (8 out of 10 women living in extreme poverty are not economically active) and young women between 18 and 29 years of age (41% are not in employment or training compared to 8% for males). \u00a0 Many women living in poverty are active in unremunerated activities in their home and are unable to access work opportunities \u2014due to low human capital, household duties, geographic location, social norms, among other factors making them more vulnerable to inequality and violence. \u00a0\nWhile the arguments for gender equality are very clear from a moral and ethical standpoint, the economic arguments of inclusion and equality are also unequivocal. Evidence shows that unequal participation of women in society and the economy not only affects them but also their families and society at large. Their exclusion stifles growth and makes it impossible for developing countries to achieve meaningful progress. \u00a0\nWhile some progress has been made, El Salvador still faces numerous and complex challenges to attain gender equality which will require sustained and cross-cutting commitment to women\u2019s human rights and autonomy\u00a0. Development is not possible without gender equality, therefore a country\u2019s development plans should always include tackling gender inequality. \u00a0Doing so can provide an opportunity for real change and a way to strengthen the country\u2019s efforts towards sustained progress. \u00a0March, women\u2019s month, remind us of the importance of celebrating women\u2019s achievements and progress towards gender equality. \u00a0But it is also a period to reflect on how much more needs to be done to help girls and women reach their full potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\nPoverty\n\n\nEl Salvador\n\n\nLatin America & Caribbean\n\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeynabou Sakho\n\n\nDirector of Strategy and Operations\n\n\nMore Blogs By Seynabou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Caruso\n\n\nSenior Economist \n\n\nMore Blogs By Germ\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalena Acu\u00f1a\n\n\nConsultant\n\n\nMore Blogs By Malena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\n\n\n85c5ed7926bbe03d60aa6557ad889468\nhttps://webapi.worldbank.org/comments/api/comment/post\nhttps://webapi.worldbank.org/comments/api/comment\nhttps://webapi.worldbank.org/comments/api/comment/count\n5e099dfc192f44329e4643cfcb86579f\nen\nlatinamerica\nde1c2335a439c257b101e5d826649238\nRead more\nRead less\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\nYour name\n\n\n\nYour name : field is required.\n\n\nYour Email\n\nThe content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly\n\n\nYour Email : field is required.\n\n\nWrite a response\n\n\r\n                    Remaining characters: 1000\n\n\n\nWrite a response : field is required.\n\n\n\nI have read the Privacy Notice  and consent to my personal data being processed, to the extent necessary, to submit my comment for moderation.
