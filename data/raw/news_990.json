On Tuesday she welcomed the announcement saying she was \u201cjoyful and grateful\u201d that the law had been scrapped, adding that it \u201chung like Damocles sword\u201d over doctors who lived in fear of prosecution even by just discussing options with their patients.Buschmann, of the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP), said it made no sense that information about abortion was available freely on the internet, \u201cbut that precisely those people who are qualified in this regard, are not allowed to provide the information\u201d. He sought to appease anti-abortion groups who have argued that the abolition of Paragraph 219a will encourage more terminations. Doctors, he said, would be restricted to giving factual information.\u201cThe situation for the affected woman is difficult enough,\u201d Buschmann said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make it even more difficult.\u201dThe law change was included in the coalition contract between the Social Democrats, Greens and the FDP which states: \u201cthe option to terminate a pregnancy at no cost is part of a reliable health care system\u201d.Abortions are technically illegal in Germany, but they are allowed under certain circumstances and must be carried out within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The woman is also required to receive counselling and the doctor must check that this has been carried out. An abortion is not considered a punishable offence if the pregnant woman\u2019s life is in danger or the pregnancy might lead to severe physical or psychological impairment. Hospitals run or supported by the Catholic church do not offer abortions.Buschmann said that a commission would be set up to consider other aspects of reproductive medicine which could be improved, including better support for couples who were having difficulties getting pregnant.Among the opponents of the law change is the opposition conservative Christian Democratic Union. CDU MP Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker disputed the argument that women faced a barrier when it came to receiving proper information about termination procedures and who provides them. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mother\u2019s right to self-determination, as well as about the life of the unborn child,\u201d she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.Paragraph 219a was enacted in May 1933, at the start of the Nazi dictatorship, when it was introduced in order to \u201cprotect the German nation\u201d. The regime equated abortion with treason. But the campaign to have it repealed did not start properly until after German reunification in 1990.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAbortionEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
