Femininity is beautiful and that\u2019s what a feminist is.\u201dThe theme of this year\u2019s March for Life was, in fact, \u201cPro-Life is Pro-Woman,\u201d in honor of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote. Signs that sought to highlight women\u2019s roles and rights were everywhere, often evoking progressive tenets.One fuchsia, hand-lettered sign read, \u201cWomen deserve better.\u201d Another played off of a famous feminist slogan, asking, \u201cIf the future is female, then why are we killing them?\u201d over the image of a feminine Venus symbol.READ: How women are training to do their own abortions.\u201cI believe that feminism includes women who aren\u2019t born yet,\u201d said college student Amaya Durand, who carried a crimson sign that read, \u201cA true feminist would fight for the rights of unborn women\u201d as she protested in front of the Supreme Court. \u201cI think the word, unfortunately, has been skewed and the color pink has always been associated with supporting Planned Parenthood, but that\u2019s not the case. I think we should take things back. Femininity is beautiful and that\u2019s what a feminist is.\u201dFor conservative millennials and members of Gen Z, raised on social media and steeped in social justice in particular, the terminology deployed by anti-abortion feminists is familiar. It doesn\u2019t even sound all that different from the arguments used by those who support the right to abortion.Advertisement\u201cPro-life feminism is this belief that we should be using our strength and liberation to fight for the marginalized, for the oppressed, for the vulnerable,\u201d explained Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, the purple-haired founder of the group New Wave Feminists. The group has chapters throughout the United States and Latin America. Herndon-De La Rosa doesn\u2019t want women to stay home and raise babies; instead, like generations of career-minded women before her, she wants them to \u201chave it all.\u201dIn her view, men offer women abortion instead of working on real solutions to societal problems.\u201cInstead of getting a piece of the pie, we\u2019re basically settling for crumbs and saying, \u2018OK, abortion\u2019s the solution? Abortion\u2019s how I\u2019m gonna have a successful life and career?\u2019\u201d Herndon-De La Rosa said. \u201cThat just seems like B.S. to me.\u201dYoung women who spoke to VICE News at the March for Life echoed Herndon-De La Rosa.\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna say, \u2018I believe in women\u2019s rights, I believe in all these things,\u2019 do you also believe in their right to have children?\u201d\u201cI believe that women should have absolutely everything men have, and that includes their bodies being supported in a way that supports all of them,\u201d added Evan, a college student from Georgia who called herself a \u201cvery nontraditional feminist.\u201d (She asked that her last name not be used.) At the march, she carried a sign that read, \u201cLife empowers women.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna say, \u2018I believe in women\u2019s rights, I believe in all these things,\u2019 do you also believe in their right to have children?\u201dAdvertisementWhen abortion foes are criticized for being only \u201cpro-birth\u201d and failing to help new moms and babies, anti-abortion feminists frequently point to their work building programs for young people who are pregnant or parenting. Feminists for Life, the grandmother of the movement, runs the \u201cWomen Deserve Better\u201d website, which compiles what it calls \u201cpractical resources and inspirational stories from women and men,\u201d largely on parenting.But while opponents of abortion argue that the procedure undermines women, there\u2019s evidence that denying women abortions can rewrite the course of their lives. Research from a study by the University of California, San Francisco has found that women who are turned away at clinics can see their risk of living in poverty quadruple. They are less likely to have aspirational plans for the next year of their life and more likely to remain with abusive partners.Among women who successfully undergo abortions, however, 95% later report that the procedure was the right decision for them.READ: Pro-life feminists excluded from the Women's March say they're the future.Many young anti-abortion activists are also passionate about the human rights issues that motivate their more liberal peers. But their conservative views on abortion might mean they\u2019re unwelcome among those groups, explained Laury Oaks, a University of California, Santa Barbara professor who\u2019s studied anti-abortion feminists\u2019 work on college campuses.AdvertisementAdopting \u201cpro-life feminism,\u201d or framing their anti-abortions beliefs as pro-woman, can offer young activists a back-door entrance into the social justice causes championed by stars like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, who\u2019ve built brands around feminism.\u201cYou can see that the anti-abortion movement has been really savvy at getting the messages out to youth. Like the anti-violence message now is really strong \u2014 which of course that is about what they are saying is the \u2018violence\u2019 of abortion \u2014 but it fits in with gun violence and anti-gun violence messages,\u201d Oaks said. \u201cThey get to be anchored in different worlds that pro-life feminism allows not to be in contradiction.\u201dIn theory, anyway. \u201cPro-life feminism\u201d has been around for a while: Feminists for Life launched in 1972, during the peak of the U.S. women\u2019s rights movement and the year before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide. But the ideology has rarely made inroads into mainstream feminism, which remains staunchly supportive of abortion rights. In 2017, Women\u2019s March organizers removed the New Wave Feminists from a list of partner organizations and said that accepting them had been a mistake.\u201cWe recognize, as the suffragists did, that a woman\u2019s capacity to have a child is amazing and it\u2019s inherent to who she is as a person.\u201dFeminists for Life President Serrin Foster said she\u2019s tried to work on both sides of the aisle. After she started with the group, more than 25 years ago, she said she\u2019d attend ACLU meetings in the morning and then stop by the ultraconservative Heritage Foundation in the afternoon. Still, Foster said, Feminists for Life was for years seen as \u201ckind of a fringe organization and not part of the mainstream.\u201dAdvertisementThat began to change, she said, once the organization unearthed information that suffragists like Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul opposed abortion. For modern anti-abortion feminists, this proved that their brand of feminism was the rightful heir to the first-wave feminists\u2019 work to secure women the right to vote \u2014 and that argument has at least resonated within the mainstream anti-abortion community, which has started name-dropping famous feminists.The Susan B. Anthony List is now one of the most powerful anti-abortion organizations in the nation; in mid-January, it pledged $52 million to reelecting President Donald Trump and anti-abortion Senate candidates. (That name also hints at the group\u2019s desire to be the women-led, right-wing answer to EMILY\u2019s List, the powerful Democratic group devoted to electing women who back abortion rights.) And on Friday, during her speech to the crowd of screaming protesters, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini spoke reverently of Paul. Highlighting women\u2019s ability to vote, and just how hard women can fight to achieve their political goals, was a potent message to send in an election year \u2014 especially as she spoke before and after Trump, the first sitting president to address the March for Life in person.\u201cWe recognize, as the suffragists did, that a woman\u2019s capacity to have a child is amazing and it\u2019s inherent to who she is as a person,\u201d Mancini told the crowd of thousands. \u201cIt\u2019s not a liability, it\u2019s a gift.\u201dAdvertisementNeither Mancini nor Marjorie Dannenfelser, who leads the Susan B. Anthony List and who also spoke at the March, explicitly identified herself as a feminist. And Oaks pointed out that the \u201cpro-woman\u201d terminology remains vague enough to mean just about anything to anyone.\u201cIf you hear that, and you have a feminist perspective, you might think that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing. But if you don\u2019t, you can think, \u2018Oh, pro-woman is pro-traditional womanhood or motherhood,\u2019\u201d Oaks said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a phrase that can be interpreted to fit in line with your core beliefs, or to shape them, at the same time.\u201dFor Foster, though, the theme was a victory. She compared the rise of anti-abortion feminism to the career of an actor who suddenly has a breakout year. \u201cYou might look at a woman and say she suddenly became famous, not realizing all the steps of work along the way.\u201dCover: Amaya Durand, 20 years old and a self-professed \u201cpro-life feminist,\u201d and her sister protested during the March for Life in front of the Supreme Court.Tagged:abortionabortion accessAbortion Rightssupreme courtfeminismGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
