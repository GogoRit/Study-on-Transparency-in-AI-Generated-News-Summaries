It suggested that emerging efforts within U.S. foreign policy and assistance to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment would benefit from support to women\u2019s health, given the overwhelming evidence of their interdependence. Specifically, the brief found that access to family planning was among the most salient variables for predicting women\u2019s ability to advance economically, given the overlap of reproductive and economically productive years.\nThis brief offers an update to reflect recent literature, as well as to respond to the 2020 political context, where what is now known as the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) initiative is celebrating its first anniversary. The initiative is an interagency effort to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment (WEE) through U.S. foreign policy and assistance, led by the White House and involving 10 agencies. The brief also, where possible, addresses how the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are likely to play out on these two related factors of women\u2019s health and their economic participation.\nIn this context, the updated analysis continues to build the case for strong linkages between women\u2019s health and economic outcomes, calling attention particularly to the connection between reproductive choice and empowerment to women\u2019s ability to choose where and when they work, and under what conditions. It then makes specific recommendations for changes to ongoing efforts within U.S. foreign policy\u2014including its W-GDP initiative and COVID-19 response\u2014that will bring these efforts in line with this evidence and increase overall impact for the women they intend to serve.\n \n \n\nDownload Publication\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\nview all\n\n\n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPost\n11/06/2019\nFGM/C is Child Abuse & a Human Rights Violation\nBy Saira Habib, ICRW Fellow, Professional Fellows for Governance and Society, South and Central Asia \u2013 Fall 2019 Two weeks ago, the US End FGM/C Network was joined by two\u2026 \n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\n12/08/2022\nWeProsper Research Salon Brief: Childcare\nOn October 19, 2022, WeProsper hosted a session focused on childcare, featuring research presentations by the International Center for Research on Women, the Center for Global Development, Abdul Latif Jameel\u2026 \n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPost\n05/07/2020\nCOVID-19: Laying Down the Groundwork for Recovery with Gender at the Fore\nBy Aria Grabowski, Policy and Advocacy Manager, ICRW As originally published in Ms. Magazine on March 31, 2020 As the world shelters in place and takes action to slow down\u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport ICRW is leading the charge in reducing inequality and poverty by generating actionable, evidence-based research.
