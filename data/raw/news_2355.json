So instead, he\u2019s wading into filmmaking by putting the final touches on a feature documentary about abortion.\nWatson, a pro-life Christian, is executive producing and partially financing a movie called Divided Hearts of America that he started filming in May, prior to the NFL season, and continued for two weeks during the bye week for the Patriots. Now, he\u2019s in postproduction on the project.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the movie, Watson interviews about 30 Americans, some pro-life, some pro-choice, about the controversial topic, and the film features several prominent people, such as former presidential candidate Ben Carson and Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNFL Network to Televise Arena Football League, Overtime OT7 Games\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNFL Plans Syndicated Version of 'Good Morning Football,' Moves A.M. Show to Los Angeles\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be involved in a movie, but so many different laws have passed in New York, Alabama, Georgia, it seems this issue \u2014 which has always been a part of our national consciousness \u2014 has ramped up recently,\u201d Watson told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cThings are at a fever pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal is to unveil the truth about abortion, the laws, the history and where our country is headed. I believe in the sanctity of life, be it in the womb or on your deathbed. That\u2019s my conviction. But with the film, I\u2019ll engage those who disagree and hear their reasoning. The No. 1 thing I\u2019m looking for is empathy on both sides.\u201d\nWatson\u2019s view on the subject shouldn\u2019t be a surprise in Hollywood after he engaged in a high-profile war of words with Alyssa Milano in May after the actress said anti-abortion laws would especially hurt \u201cwomen of color.\u201d\nThe married, African American father of seven and author of The New Dad\u2019s Playbook tweeted to Milano that her comment \u201creveals ignorance, racism or some combination of both. Our children and families are capable of greatness and lies like this harm our future. Don\u2019t patronize us.\u201d\nThe two settled their differences when Milano tweeted back: \u201cIf you\u2019d like to discuss further, please DM me. My door & heart are always open.\u201d The dust-up occurred just as Watson began production and he told THR that he informed the actress of his intention to make a movie about abortion.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDissenting views should be respected and in fact encouraged. There are many people in Hollywood who would consider themselves pro-life but they feel as though their viewpoint is unacceptable in the industry,\u201d Watson said. \u201cNo one should feel like their job is in danger because of their convictions on this issue.\u201d\nWatson says that the movie, which is budgeted at less than $1 million, is also financed by some donors and the Christian charity he runs with his wife called the One More Foundation, which focuses on hunger, poverty, prison reform and other social issues.\nWatson said he\u2019s negotiating with distributors and that some groups have already guaranteed they\u2019d be buying out theaters.\n\u201cThis has been a fun learning experience,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know \u2018P&A\u2019 or any of the other terms. This is my first foray into filmmaking, but hopefully not my last.\u201d\nWatson played 15 years in the NFL and has said he\u2019ll retire when his contract expires around Super Bowl Sunday. He began and ended his career with the Patriots.\nAsked for intel on the situation involving his team\u2019s quarterback, Watson said: \u201cThe Patriots will stick with Tom Brady as long as they can. Any team would. Being a friend and a fan, I know he has a lot more football in him. Maybe in New England. Only Tom and God knows for sure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More About:\n\n\n\n\tNFL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTHR Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every
