Despite the pandemic, women and men across the country blocked roads and stormed churches. In response, right-wing groups formed units to protect the churches, at times clashing with the angry crowds.\nThe tribunal\u2019s ruling reminded Anna, whose name has been changed at her request, of her painful ordeal.\nThe now 40-year-old has been pregnant twice, but in both instances did not reach full term. Because of fetal defects, she terminated her first pregnancy in the Netherlands where she used to live. Her second pregnancy could have killed her.\n\u201cIn Poland, I got pregnant again. In the sixth week, I got an ultrasound and it turned out that the heart was not beating as it should. I started to bleed. I was told that I should see a doctor,\u201d Anna told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cI went to the hospital and the doctor was rude. She knew that it\u2019s most likely a miscarriage and she said that she should take care of pregnant women first. She said her equipment is not good enough to prove that the heart had stopped beating and that if it did, the miscarriage would happen naturally.\u201d\nBut it did not. Two weeks later, Anna went to another doctor and he advised her to get an abortion immediately. The fetus had died and if she continued carrying it, sepsis, which is potentially lethal, could have set in.\nThe hospital she had visited previously was a well-known Warsaw anti-abortion rights clinic. They would do anything to save a pregnancy, she said. Even at the cost of the mother\u2019s life.\nShe soon found a doctor who agreed to perform the abortion.\n\u201cI took a pill and after an hour it was over. But a pregnant woman in the nineteenth week from a small town, who was staying in the same room as me, went through hell. Her gynaecologist had not told her that women over 35 can get free prenatal tests,\u201d Anna said.\n\u201cWhen she finally did them, she learned that the fetus was sick. Her doctor refused to terminate her pregnancy or tell her where she can get a legal abortion.\u201d\nThe majority of protesters are girls and women between the ages of 15 and 40, but various other groups have joined in. The demonstrators have created a council which has made a series of demands, including the government\u2019s resignation.\nUntil now, the government has not published the ruling, which contradicts current Polish law. As the rallies grew, President Andrzej Sebastian Duda backed down and proposed a new bill that would make abortion legal in case of some fetal defects, but the protesters continue their battle.\nIf the ruling goes through as it stands, abortion will be almost completely banned.\nClause of conscience\nDoctors who are against it can refuse to terminate pregnancies, citing the clause of conscience. In small conservative towns, women have often felt abandoned, even though in certain circumstances abortion was their right.\nIn many cases, Polish women have travelled to Germany or the Czech Republic to terminate pregnancies.\nThe Women\u2019s Strike, the organisation behind the protests, wants a return to the former \u2013 limited abortion access, but also legalisation, better perinatal care, and much more.\n\u201cThe protesters have several separate postulates. There are anti-government slogans, which attract various groups, far removed from the feminist movement, such as miners or farmers, who are traditionally conservative voters but supported the protests because of their anti-government dimension,\u201d said Kaja Puto, a journalist with Krytyka Polityczna, a left-wing media circle.\n\u201cSecondly, they are anti-church, which shows the frustration with the omnipotence of the Catholic Church in Poland. According to Pew research centre, Poland is the fastest secularising country in the world.\u201d\nDuda\u2019s initiative has met resistance from people within the governing party and anti-abortion rights movements.\n\u201cSome of the women who did not join the protests are pro-life and want to protect those who are defenceless \u2013 unborn children. They ask: If everyone has a voice, why don\u2019t disabled children?\u201d said Marta Piasecka, an anti-abortion rights mother of two.\n\u201cOther women who don\u2019t participate in the Women\u2019s Strike are those who do not agree with this form of protest: Vandalism and aggression that some of the protesters display. It insults women\u2019s dignity. They also disagree with the devastation of churches as well as religious and patriotic monuments.\u201d\nDemonstrators block a street during an anti-government protest [File: Kacper Pempel/Reuters]\nBut despite some resistance, the protests continue.\nNatalia \u017bwirek, an activist from a small town, S\u0142ubice, was surprised when 500 people joined the march she organised.\nAlthough women in her region have easier access to abortion, since it is close to Germany and the borderland has several abortion clinics advertising services in Polish, \u017bwirek remains angry.\n\u201cI cannot stand that they continue to limit our freedoms. They expect us to accept inhumane suffering and they don\u2019t care what we feel. They are treating us as childbearing machines, this is humiliating,\u201d says \u017bwirek.\nAnna goes a step further.\n\u201cAll the suffering that women have to go through could be avoided. But this is how they exercise their power. Everything is political.\u201d\nThe majority of protesters are young females between 15-40 years old, but groups from across the social strata have joined in [File: Wojtek Radwanski/AFP]\naj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
