It is at least the fourth such incident to take place in Poland since a court ruling last year introduced a near-total ban on abortion, sparking a wave of mass protests.\nFirefighters were notified at 3 a.m. this morning that a vehicle was on fire outside Biela\u0144ski Hospital in Warsaw\u2019s north-western Bielany district. The fire was extinguished and no one was harmed. Police are now investigating the incident.\n\n\nPolicja bada spraw\u0119 po\u017caru, w kt\u00f3rym sp\u0142on\u0119\u0142a furgonetka antyaborcyjna zaparkowana przed Szpitalem Biela\u0144skim w Warszawie.https://t.co/Vb8wxaSsjI\n\u2014 PolskieRadio24.pl (@PR24_pl) April 24, 2021\n\nThe rear section of the vehicle features slogans saying \u201cin Biela\u0144ski Hospital abortionists killed 131 children in 2017\u201d alongside images of an aborted foetus. In October last year, a different van bearing the same words was also set alight in exactly the same location. The perpetrators were never identified.\nThe previous incident took place the day after Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal issued its ruling introducing a near-total abortion ban. The van was also graffitied with symbols of the protests against that ruling, including a lightning flash and the words \u201cF**k PiS\u201d \u2013 referring to the ruling party, which is seen as being behind the ban.\nLast weekend in Krak\u00f3w, a van featuring similar anti-abortion slogans as well as images of aborted foetuses was also set on fire in the city\u2019s Nowa Huta district. Police are investigating that incident.\n\n\nSp\u0142on\u0119\u0142a furgonetka z antyaborcyjnymi plakatami. Policja bada spraw\u0119 #wyborcza https://t.co/xUZe6VhKpZ\n\u2014 Gazeta Wyborcza.pl (@gazeta_wyborcza) April 18, 2021\n\nFundacja Pro, the Catholic NGO to which the van in Krak\u00f3w (as well as ten or so others elsewhere in Poland) belongs, said that this was not the first case of apparent arson against their vehicles. In January, one of its vans in the city of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski was set on fire.\nThe same NGO has also faced a series of legal cases over the graphic nature of its anti-abortion billboards, some of which courts have found to violate the law. Krak\u00f3w city council last November passed a resolution banning the public display of images of aborted foetuses.\nCouncillors in Warsaw have drafted a resolution to introduce a similar ban in the capital, reports TVN24. Doctors, patients and visitors to Biela\u0144ski Hospital have repeatedly complained about the anti-abortion vans parked outside, which have in some cases been towed away by police.\nLast year, the hospital won a court case relating to one of the vans, resulting in the head of Fundacja Pro having to pay a 5,000 zloty (\u20ac1,100) fine, reports Gazeta.pl. However, since then different vans have continued to appear at the same location.\n\nKrak\u00f3w council votes to ban images of aborted foetuses in public space\n\nFundacja Pro is also known for driving vehicles featuring anti-LGBT slogans around Polish cities. These have often faced spontaneous protests by members of the public, including drivers and pedestrians who have blocked them from moving.\nIn December, one of the NGO\u2019s drivers was fined for noise violations. However, in a separate ruling, a court in Wroc\u0142aw dismissed a complaint against Fundacja Pro for its slogans and images portraying homosexuals as paedophiles. The judge found its material to be \u201cinformative and educational\u201d.\nIn response to such rulings, which reflect the fact that Poland\u2019s hate crime laws do not cover sexual orientation or gender identity, some LGBT activists have turned to more radical forms of action. This has included vandalising the anti-LGBT vans and, in one case, engaging in a physical confrontation with a driver.\n\n\u201cNo apologies, no shame\u201d: the rise of Poland\u2019s guerrilla LGBT activists \u00a0\n\nLast October\u2019s ruling found abortions in cases where the foetus is diagnosed with a birth defect to be unconstitutional. Such terminations previously made up almost all legal abortions in Poland, but are now banned as a result of the ruling.\nThe ruling sparked the biggest protests in Poland\u2019s post-communist history, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets. Opinion polls have shown that a large majority of the public are opposed to the ruling.\nWhile the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, some early protests saw cases of vandalism against churches as well as clashes with far-right groups that had gathered to protect them.\n\nLeader of Poland\u2019s abortion protests charged with \u201cinsulting police\u201d and \u201ccausing epidemic threat\u201d\n\nMain image credit: Slawomir Kaminski / Agencja Gazeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel TillesDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0Notes from Poland.
