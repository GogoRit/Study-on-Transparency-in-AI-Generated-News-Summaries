Deidre Henderson successfully amended the bill to prohibit the use of transvaginal ultrasounds under the bill, a more invasive procedure than transabdominal ultrasounds. But while the bill went too far before the amendment, she said, the amendment resulted in the bill going \u201ca little less too far.\u201dHenderson and the other female senators, which included one other Republican, spoke in favor of the amendment and then exited the chamber as their names were called for a final vote on the bill, HB364.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned, but a spontaneous decision to put an exclamation mark on our concerns about the invasive nature of that bill,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI am very pro-life, and always vote for pro-life bills. But I\u2019m concerned that we are overstepping with government mandates of medically unnecessary procedures.\u201dSen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, tweeted out, \u201cLove my sisters in the Senate,\u201d alongside an image of the six women hugging.Love my sisters in the Senate \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fA spontaneous decision not planned of sisterhood against the invasive nature of HB 364 #epic #sheroes #utleg pic.twitter.com/FzmSTrzmq7\u2014 Sen. Luz Escamilla (@SenatorLuz) March 11, 2020\n\nThe male members of the Senate voted 16-7 in favor of the bill, with five Republicans joining the male members of the minority party in opposing the legislation.Members of the House voted 47-20 for the bill last week, but an additional vote of that chamber is required to approve Henderson\u2019s amendment and other changes adopted in the Senate.Provo Republican Sen. Curt Bramble, the Senate sponsor of HB364, said the proposal is about informed consent and intended to give parents the most accurate medical information available as they decide whether to have an abortion.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a human being,\u201d Bramble said, \u201cand having the information relative to that child\u2019s physical being is important as that decision to terminate that child\u2019s life is being made.\u201dBut other senators argued that the bill would invite costly litigation against the state, and objected to the state government mandating that patients undergo specific medical procedures.\u201cI\u2019m just not convinced that we need this extra step,\u201d said Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross.On Monday, three medical organizations asked Gov. Gary Herbert to veto the proposed ultrasound mandate, saying it would force them to violate their professional standards.\u201cThere is no other health-related scenario in which the government dictates medical interventions,\u201d wrote representatives of the Utah Academy of Family Physicians, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Utah section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.The joint letter said the mandate would be medically unnecessary and would start the state down a \u201cslippery slope that could lead to government mandating routine medical care.\u201dThe Utah Medical Association adopted a neutral position.Asked Tuesday about the ultrasound bill, Herbert seemed disinclined to exercise his power of veto.\u201cUnder the umbrella of full disclosure, making sure that you\u2019re making the decision based on all the information available \u2026 that\u2019s probably not a bad thing,\u201d the Republican governor said.Before leaving the Senate chamber, Draper Democratic Sen. Kathleen Riebe compared an abortion to a vasectomy, and questioned why women are required to complete information modules and ultrasounds when a man is under no comparable mandate.\"Does he have to watch a movie about babies? Riebe said. \u201cNo, he decided that he didn\u2019t want babies and he got a vasectomy.\u201dAnd Sen. Karen Mayne, D-West Valley City, said it was sad that the female members of the chamber felt the need to speak about their personal medical history in debate with their male counterparts.\u201cIt makes me sad that you don\u2019t believe us that this is invasive to us,\u201d she said.HB364 is one of several abortion-related bills under consideration this year.One bill, requiring that fetal remains be buried or cremated after an abortion or miscarriage, has already passed and is awaiting consideration by Hebert. Another piece of legislation would impose a ban on elective abortions in the state if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its longstanding precedents on abortion.Tribune reporter Bethany Rodgers contributed to this story. bwood@sltrib.comFollow @bjaminwoodDonate to the newsroom now.
