Anthony List on its National Pro-Life Scorecard.\nClick here\u00a0to see how everyone in Congress scored.\nFull Court Press\n\nOn September 13, I appeared on Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren. You can watch\u00a0the entire interview here.\nOn Coronavirus Relief:\nIt's such a shame the Democrats won't look at areas of agreement for coronavirus relief. We agree on more money for unemployed workers, small business, education, vaccines/testing. Why won't they say yes to that?\nOn Election Interference:\nAs seriously as I take Russia, China and Iran trying to destabilize our elections, the way the Democrats and the mainstream media have reacted has done more to interfere and destabilize our politics.\nOn Law Enforcement:\nDemocrats are very weak on law and order and the public is starting to notice.\nJoseph Project in Wausau\n\nOur Joseph Project started in Milwaukee in the fall of 2015. Since that time, we have held 93 classes not only in Milwaukee, but also in Green Bay, Madison and Wausau. Joseph Project Wausau just moved to a new location this month under the volunteer leadership of Pastor Yauo Yang. Congratulations to the graduates this week in Wausau who will now be interviewing for family-supporting jobs.\nTo learn more about the program in Wausau,\u00a0watch this video.\n\nService Academy Nominaton Deadline is September 28\n\nEach September, my office meets with high school students who are interested in learning more about pursuing a nomination to a military service academy.\nBecause of the pandemic, the annual Academy Day (normally held at the EAA Museum in Oshkosh) is virtual this year.\nPlease forward\u00a0this video\u00a0to your local high school so they can help spread the word to students interested in serving their country in this capacity.\nThe nomination\u00a0application deadline\u00a0for my office is Monday, Sept. 28, 2020.\nWatch the Virtual Academy Day\u00a0video presenation\u00a0for more information on each school.\nSocial Media Highlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n About Ron\nToggle Submenu\n \n\n\nBiography\n\nCommittee Assignments\n\nWisconsin\n\n\n\n\n Get Help\nToggle Submenu\n \n\n\nAgency Assistance\n\nStudent Loan Assistance\n\nFlag Requests\n\nVisiting D.C.\n\nInternships\n\nAcademy Nominations\n\nVeteran Services\n\nSpecial Recognitions\n\n\n\n\n News\nToggle Submenu\n \n\n\nPress Releases\n\nOp-Eds and Blogs\n\nNewsletter\n\nSocial Media\n\nVaccines, Mandates & COVID-19\n\n\n\n\n Issues & Results\nToggle Submenu\n \n\n\nBorder Security\n\nCOVID-19\n\nRight to Try\n\nJohnson's HSGAC Results\n\nJoseph Project\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\n Contact\nToggle Submenu\n \n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\nEmail Ron\n\nOffice Locations\n\nScheduling Requests\n\nMobile Office\n\nTelephone Town Hall Signup\n\nWhistleblowers\n\n\n\n\nIsrael at War\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
