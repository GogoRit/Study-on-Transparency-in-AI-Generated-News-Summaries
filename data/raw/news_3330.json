(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction from Nebraska officials has come in swiftly to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Friday overturning Roe v. Wade. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\nU.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.:\u00a0I have always supported pro-life policies that show compassion for women and their unborn children. Both conservative and liberal legal scholars have long questioned the legal reasoning in Roe v. Wade. The justices made the right decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Center by affirming that there is no constitutional right to abortion. Today\u2019s ruling returns policy making decisions on this issue to state and federal lawmakers. It\u2019s going to take good-faith and empathy to address it.\u201d\nU.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb.:\u00a0\u201cAmerica\u2019s work of becoming a more perfect Union is never over, but today \u2014 by righting a constitutional wrong \u2014 the Supreme Court took a historic step forward. Roe\u2019s days are over, but the pro-life movement\u2019s work has just begun. This issue will now be debate in the 50 states, and a 330,000,000-person, continental nation will work through this debate in a way that\u2019s healthier than Roe\u2019s one-size-fits-all, Washington-centrism.\u201d\n\u00a0U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, 2nd Congressional District: \u201cLife is the most precious right and today\u2019s decision in the Dobbs case affirms that. It does not outlaw abortion, but puts it in the hands of the elected representatives of the states and Congress. I now have worked for decades to defend life, and today their prayers were answered. I urge all to respond with mutual respect, civility and grace.\u201d\nState Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks, Democratic candidate for the 1st Congressional District:\u00a0\u201cToday the U.S. Supreme Court made an unconscionable decision to overturn Roe v. Waade, giving the government the seat at our daughters\u2019 exam tables for which many have long coveted. A majority of Americans and Nebraskans do not agree that abortion should be illegal. Tuesday\u2019s special election will be our first opportunity to stand up and fight back at the ballot box against this extreme effort to push us back into the Dark Ages.\u201d\n\n\nState Sen. Mike Flood, Repubican candidate for the 1st Congressional District: \u201cToday, the Supreme Court has returned abortion-related policy decisions back to the states and the people, where they belong. I am proudly pro-life, and am proud to have sponsored and passed the nation\u2019s first Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which banned abortions at 20 weeks, when babies can feel pain. We helped pave the way for this landmark decision. Nebraskans agree: we want to protect innocent life and support women in crisis.\u201d \n\n\nState Sen. Tony Vargas, Democratic candidate for the 2nd Congressional District:\u00a0\u201cPoliticians don\u2019t belong in doctor\u2019s offices making medical decisions. Women should make the decisions that are the best for them with their doctors. Today\u2019s ruling by the Supreme Court is a clear threat to Americans\u2019 health, safety, and rights. Governor Ricketts has promised to call the Legislature back into a special session, and when he does I\u2019m ready to keep fighting for Nebraska women and families, alongside Planned Parenthood Action, to ensure their access to reproductive health care is protected. And in Congress, just as I have in the Nebraska Legislature, I\u2019ll continue fighting to keep the heavy hand of government out of these important and deeply personal decisions.\u201d\nJim Pillen, Republican candidate for governor: \u201cNebraska is a pro-life state because our citizens understand that life is the most precious gift of God\u2019s grace. Today, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed what we have long known to be true: Our Constitution contains no right to murder an unborn child. I will do all I can to ensure that no more unborn babies are killed.\u201d\nState Sen. Carol Blood, Democratic candidate for governor: \u201cReproductive justice is on the minds of many women here in Nebraska today. The trigger bill that will ultimately follow will cause Nebraskans to live in a police state. We will become a police state where doctors will live in fear when they need to provide necessary patient care. It will endanger the jobs of medical specialists who may be trying to protect a woman\u2019s health, disallow women from making decisions on IVF with their doctors never allowing them to experience parenthood, mandate what types of birth control a woman may use instead of allowing the woman and her doctor to make that decision. \u2026 It\u2019s terrifying that we are choosing to not protect the victims of sexual assault, especially our children.\u201d\nSandy Danek, executive director, Nebraska Right to Life:\u00a0\u201cThe Unicameral will now be charged with taking up the issue of abortion to determine what protection they are willing to provide to Nebraska women and their children. We must continue to work vigorously to elect pro-life representatives in the State Legislature to pass laws to protect mothers and their pre-born children.\u00a0Elections matter. Nebraska is a pro-life state and our elected officials should reflect Nebraskans commitment to protecting all innocent life.\u201d\nNate Grasz, policy director, Nebraska Family Alliance:\u00a0\u201cThis is a historic victory for preborn children and their mothers. Overturning Roe finally gets the courts out of the abortion business and allows Americans to decide this issue through our elected representatives. For decades, the pro-life movement has worked not just to overturn Roe but to save lives, empower women, educate, and bring lasting cultural change. The pro-life movement cares not only about the unborn child but also for vulnerable mothers. This is demonstrated by the more than 2,700 pregnancy care centers nationwide that serve millions of people annually. With today\u2019s decision, now our real work begins.\u201d\nJo Giles, executive director, Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha: \u201cEveryone deserves the right to decide if, when and how to start a family \u2014 including all Nebraskans. Each of us should be free to live our lives with dignity and to make the decisions that are best for our lives, families and communities. Collectively, we will continue to reject further medically unnecessary restrictions to abortion that only stand in the way of pregnant people and the care they need.\u201d\nScout Richters, legal and policy counsel, American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0of Nebraska: \u201cMost Nebraskans support keeping abortion legal in our state because they understand no one should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will or face the life-altering consequences of being denied abortion care. This race to take away people\u2019s rights is dangerous and dystopian \u2014 and we will do everything we can to stop it. The impacts of pushing abortion out of reach would fall disproportionately on the same people who have always faced systemic barriers to care: Nebraskans of color, LGBTQ+ Nebraskans, undocumented Nebraskans, young Nebraskans, Nebraskans living in rural communities, Nebraskans with disabilities and Nebraskans with low incomes. All Nebraskans must remain free to make the right decisions for themselves and their families. Now, more than ever, is the time to contact your state senator and demand they respect our reproductive rights.\u201d\nGov. Pete Ricketts: \u201cRoe v. Wade\u00a0took away the states\u2019 right to regulate abortion and cost millions of babies their lives. Today\u2019s Supreme Court decision restores the rights of the people, and as a result our future generations will have a chance at life. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn\u00a0Roe\u00a0is an answer to millions of prayers on behalf of the unborn and a victory for human life.\u00a0 I will be working with our legislative leaders to determine what more we can do to protect our preborn babies.\u201d\nU.S. Rep Adrian Smith, R-Neb: \u201cLife is a miracle that begins at conception. While today\u2019s decision is a win for the pro-life movement, our work does not end here. We must ensure states \u2013 which are now rightfully tasked with authority over abortion \u2014 have the resources needed to restore a culture that respects and values life by supporting at-risk mothers, fathers, and children.\u201d\nNebraska Legislative Speaker Mike Hilgers: \u201cAfter nearly 50 years, the Supreme Court has rightfully overturned\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0and returned the question of abortion to the elected representatives of the states. I anticipate that Nebraskans\u2019 elected representatives in the Legislature will be in special session this summer to pass legislation to protect pre-born babies. I will work with Governor Ricketts on the timing of a special session. And, after reviewing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in detail, I will work closely with the Governor and my legislative colleagues on the scope of such protections.\u201d\nState Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha: \u201cThis is a really dark day for women in this country, and our autonomy. And I\u2019m concerned about what the future holds for us. What other things will be taken away from women?\u201d She said abortion no longer is a \u201chot-button political talking point. \u2026 Now you have to deal with the reality of the health care implications. They never had to address those health care realities before. \u2026 No matter what your religious beliefs are, women\u2019s health care is a real thing.\u201d\nOmaha Mayor Jean Stothert: \u201cThe Supreme Court ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade will not be the end of the decades-long fight that is important to so many people. States, including Nebraska, will now consider state laws to ban, restrict or expand\u00a0access to abortions. I have always believed these decisions should be addressed at the state level with appropriate and clear\u00a0laws that stipulate any restrictions or exceptions. While this is a tremendously\u00a0personal and emotional issue, I believe our Legislature can address it successfully.\u00a0I am proud of my pro-life position and will advocate to further reduce the prevalence of abortion in our state.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story.
