Kaeley McEvoy joined the Westmoreland Congregational United Church of Christ in Bethesda in 2018. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)Listen9 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveWhen the Rev. Kaeley McEvoy began at Westmoreland Congregational in 2018 she faced a question: Should she tell her new congregation she\u2019d recently had an abortion?McEvoy was already a reproductive rights advocate, and to her the experience wasn\u2019t in conflict with her faith. When the pastor and her then-boyfriend learned in 2016 that she was pregnant, the first place they went was to a cathedral, to pray \u2014 and to call doctors\u2019 offices in search of one to do the abortion. Other visitors to the cathedral happened to try to enter the small chapel where McEvoy was on the phone, but her boyfriend turned them away, she remembers, saying \u201csomething holy is happening here.\u201dWpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut in front of her new congregation, she wondered and worried if they would lose respect for her. Westmoreland, like the suburb of Bethesda it sits in, is full of liberal people who politically support abortion access, McEvoy felt, but may not be ready to call it a social and theological good.AdvertisementThen came laws in Texas and Mississippi to severely limit abortion, then the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to review the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade. And on top of that, pandemic isolation and virtual worship that, to McEvoy, made preaching about real, lived physical experiences feel urgent.Now she is part of an increasingly bold and more visible religious movement for reproductive choice, a hard shove back to the decades-old American narrative that a devout person sees abortion only as murder. From prominent clergy to regular people in the pews, far more nuanced and varied perspectives about abortion are being voiced across the religious spectrum, many for the first time.Longtime U.S. House chaplain on Jan. 6, the dangers of \u2018apocalyptic thinking\u2019 and why there\u2019s room to be pro-choice in CatholicismIn November, McEvoy, a  29-year-old with a melodic preaching cadence, took the high, white pulpit at Westmoreland and said she had \u201cnever felt more known and heard and loved by God than when I entered the doors of a Planned Parenthood.\u201d Then last month she addressed a group of Christian abortion access activists meeting in a D.C. church: \u201cSomething holy is happening here, friends.\u201dAdvertisementLast month, the most visible leader of Orthodox Christianity in the country, Archbishop Elpidophoros, said at the antiabortion March for Life that the biblical Mary \u201cfreely chose\u201d to bring Jesus into the world, \u201cand God respected her freedom \u2026 we march not for coercion.\u201d The Rev. Pat Conroy, a Catholic priest and former longtime U.S. House chaplain, told The Washington Post that while he views abortion as a \u201ctragedy,\u201d conditions like poverty and oppression steal women\u2019s options. Ultimately, Conroy said, the choice belongs to the woman; \u201cWe should not make it for her.\u201d Both faiths teach that life begins at conception.At the end of January, 450 clergy and other faith advocates met virtually for a new, two-day event called SACRED that presented reproductive rights as \u201cone of the critical justice movements of our time,\u201d along with those for racial and sexual minorities, immigrants and others. More than 1,500 rabbis have signed on to a program called Repro Shabbat in which congregations study Jewish texts and teachings about reproduction and make public efforts at \u201ccelebrating the critical importance of reproductive health access, reproductive rights, and reproductive justice.\u201d This is the second year of the program.And 54 faith groups signed onto an amicus brief last fall against the new Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks, saying there are diverse religious views about when a life begins and that banning abortion violates American women\u2019s constitutional right to religious freedom.AdvertisementMary Ziegler, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School who focuses on the legal history of reproduction said the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned and new state measures that include criminal penalties for doctors and civil fines for women \u201chas made this more salient.\u201d\u201cEven for ministers who say: \u2018I don\u2019t support abortions, but I can\u2019t condemn people for having them.\u2019 Those people are feeling the need to speak up more because things are coming to a head,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for a lot of people to talk about what you should do when it\u2019s not illegal. Now states can really punish people. I think for people of faith, ethical and religious arguments will be really central to that. Criminal law is intersecting with questions of morality and faith.\u201dChurches are getting designated as \u2018Reproductive Freedom Congregations\u2019Many of the new public perspectives in favor of abortion rights are simply giving new voice to old teachings and beliefs that went underground in recent decades as the religious right won the public narrative war. For many, abortion became a black and white issue and the topic was cloaked in shame.AdvertisementComments like Elpidophoros\u2019 argue for the theological right of women to bodily autonomy and health and say it\u2019s theologically wrong to uniformly choose a fetus over a woman. Like SACRED\u2019s curriculum about the biblical story of creation in Genesis as a process with steps \u2014 not a light switch moment as to when \u201clife\u201d begins. Like those in the upcoming book by Baptist pastor Katey Zeh \u201cA Complicated Choice,\u201d that looks at societal conditions that lead to unintended pregnancies and those that leave many women without parenting support.Share this articleShareIn the years just before and after Roe v. Wade, the tables were somewhat flipped, Ziegler says. The antiabortion side characterized itself as a secular, civil rights cause, allowing it to draw a more diverse support base than only Catholics (who were the founders of that movement). Abortion rights advocates, on the other hand, often made a religious case, and one of the big organizing groups back then was the Clergy Counseling Service. Most mainline Protestant denominations and non-Orthodox Jews as well as the Southern Baptist Convention adopted positions in favor of abortion legalization.Polling has always made clear there are many millions of religious people who favor some type of abortion access, and it was religious activists in the 1960s and 1970s who led the movement.AdvertisementIt\u2019s not American views on abortion access overall that have changed since then, said University of West Georgia historian Daniel Williams, who focuses on abortion, it\u2019s that the issue has become more politicized and polarized. Public opinion polls have consistently shown public support for Roe v. Wade for decades.While the legal landscape is a big reason people are speaking out, there are other factors.One, say people who follow the topic, is a society paying more attention to the full experiences of women. Michal Raucher, a Rutgers University anthropologist who studies Jews and reproductive issues, said the growth of women in positions of leadership in all denominations of Judaism has put more attention and public space for topics like infertility and miscarriages.Another is the stigma, for some, that President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office attached to the antiabortion movement and its goal to make abortion illegal. Trump became a hero of the movement at the same time as he was making authoritarian moves such as his effort to overturn his election loss.An ancient mistranslation is now helping to threaten abortion rightsGeorge Demacopoulous, a Fordham University theology professor and expert on Orthodox Christianity noted that abortion is legal in every major Orthodox country. While the faith views abortion as tragic and wrong, he said, it also respects the autonomy of women. Church and state are generally separate, he said, and abortion is more divorced from politics.Advertisement\u201cIn the United States, the debate is very much positioned as these two goods at war with one another; we\u2019re being asked to pick. And he\u2019s saying that\u2019s theologically wrong,\u201d he said of Elpidophoros. \u201cIt\u2019s a Christian truism that you can hold seemingly contradictory views. Christian moral teaching isn\u2019t black and white.\u201dThe Rev. Angela Williams, a Presbyterian USA pastor and lead organizer of SACRED, said a few years ago she considered herself \u201cpro-choice\u201d but was taken aback by people in her seminary who said they were \u201cpro-abortion.\u201d After a few years of working with women in a wide variety of situations, from homeless women who couldn\u2019t access menstrual products to sexual assault victims, Williams said she came to see unwanted pregnancies as complex situations without necessarily simple answers.\u201cBeing in this work and spending time with people and hearing more of the stories and bringing their experiences out of the shadows helped me to undo the stigma around abortion. [Religious advocates for abortion rights] have given up the public square, letting the dominant narrative be based on some readings of Bible verses. And that doesn\u2019t represent real people, real lives, real faith,\u201d she said.AdvertisementSome advocates are weaving the subject of abortion into their spiritual practices. As part of Repro Shabbat, people baked challah breads in the shape of a uterus. Some made TikToks of Jewish teaching set to music samples. Others are looking to special after-abortion prayers written decades ago by more liberal clergies such as those on the site RitualWell.New Orleans baker Nancy Pesses shows how to braid a challah in the shape of uterus as part of a national campaign called Repro Shabbat. (Video: Nancy Pesses)One night last week a group of about 60 Jewish women listened to a rabbi, who declined to use her name to avoid judgment or shame, for the first time tell the story of two abortions she had about a decade ago.She talked about Judaism, which does not legally see a fetus as a person, but as a potential life. While abortion is never considered murder and is allowed, its use has limits related to the health of the mother. The question is: What kind of limits? Her voice slowed as she talked about how she was told the babies would die soon after birth. As someone with a disability herself, the rabbi said, she was especially conflicted. At the same time, she was told the births could damage her ability to have more children.Talking with a friend, she recalled, eased her mind. She\u2019d decided to speak out now because she feels more strongly about abortion rights and wants to encourage other Jews to go from being politically supportive of choice to being openly stigma-free. \u201cPrivacy\u201d around sexual issues can transform into shame around them, she said.U.S. abortion access, reproductive rightsTracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat. Abortion and the 2024 election: Voters in a dozen states in 2024 could decide the fate of abortion rights with constitutional amendments on the ballot in a pivotal election year.
