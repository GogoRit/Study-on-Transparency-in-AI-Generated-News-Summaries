The measures failed by votes of 56-41 and 53-44, respectively.\u201cToday, the Senate failed to move forward on a bill that would guarantee that babies born alive after an attempted abortion receive appropriate medical care. The Senate also failed to move forward on a bill that would protect life after 20 weeks,\u201d Senator Capito said. \u201cI co-sponsored and voted for both of these bills, and I\u2019m disappointed that neither received the 60 votes necessary to advance towards passage.\u201d\n\u00a0\n# # #\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nSHARE:\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n\n                Previous Article\n              \n\n\n\n             \n                Next Article\n           \n                \n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            About\n          \n\n\n\n            Working For West Virginia\n          \n\n\n\n            News\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Get Updates From Shelley\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Capito Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Capito Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Capito Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal\n\nmodal close button\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                About\n              \n\n\n                        About Shelley\n                      \n\n                        Issues\n                      \n\n                        Committee Assignments\n                      \n\n\n                Working For West Virginia\n              \n\n\n                        Help with a Federal Agency\n                      \n\n                        Flag Requests\n                      \n\n                        Visiting DC\n                      \n\n                        Internships\n                      \n\n                        Academy Nominations\n                      \n\n                        Federal Grants\n                      \n\n                        Congressionally Directed Spending\n                      \n\n                        Passport Assistance\n                      \n\n\n                News\n              \n\n\n                        Press Releases\n                      \n\n                        In The News\n                      \n\n                        Op-Eds\n                      \n\n                        Photos\n                      \n\n                        Videos\n                      \n\n\n                Contact\n              \n\n\n                        Contact my Office\n                      \n\n                        Meeting Requests\n                      \n\n                        Get Help\n                      \n\n                        Hear from Shelley\n                      \n\n                        Office Locations\n                      \n\n                        Share Your Stories\n                      \n\n                        Mobile Office Hours\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal\n\nmodal close button\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
