Not surprisingly, several deal with abortion. When the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer, a near-total abortion ban went into effect in Texas. As it stands now, abortion is only allowed when a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life is threatened. The bills range from repealing the abortion ban completely to making an exception for victims of sexual assault.\u00a0\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nSenate Bill 122\u00a0would not require a pregnant person to file a police report or provide forensic evidence\n\nHouse Bill 61 would make it illegal for a government entity to provide any logistical or financial support to a woman seeking an abortion. Senate Bill 123 would allow abortions if a pregnant patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical or mental health is at risk\n\nSome abortion clinics are seeing their Texas patients in other states\n\nSeveral Republicans have said there might need to be an exception to the abortion law for sexual assault, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that abortion will become legal again next year\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough Senate Bill 122, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, hopes to create an exception for sexual assault.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese exceptions are necessary. Asking a woman to carry a birth to the fullest extent, in a situation of rape and incest, is inhumane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Alvarado said.\nAs written, the bill would not require a pregnant person to file a police report or provide forensic evidence. Alvarado said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because many women don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report abuse in the first place. But since no record would be required to obtain an abortion, anti-abortion advocates see this as a way to create a loophole so any woman could have the procedure.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen could claim rape or assault or incest where, in fact, that has not happened. And it creates a potential loophole in an exception that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support that would allow women to lie to receive abortions. We would hope that no woman would do that, but it does leave that door open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Amy O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell, the director of communications for Texas Alliance for Life.\u00a0\nSeth Chandler, a law professor at the University of Houston, said this is where the legal waters get murky.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout any proof that the sexual assault occurred, in the sense of not having to file a police report or have a criminal prosecution for the assault, again, I suspect that pro-life forces are going to object to that on grounds that basically all that has to happen is for the woman to allege that the sex was nonconsensual and therefore constitutes an assault,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chandler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so I think when people get down to the nuts and bolts of trying to define these exceptions, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be quite a battle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLast year when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked about an exception to the abortion law for rape and incest, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTexas will work tirelessly to make sure we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas, by aggressively going out and arresting them, prosecuting them and getting them off the streets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThat, of course, is impossible to do.\nThere are several other pre-filed bills related to abortion. House Bill 61 would make it illegal for a government entity to provide any logistical or financial support to a woman seeking an abortion. Senate Bill 123 would allow abortions if a pregnant patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical or mental health is at risk. Senate Bill 78 would allow a physician to prescribe a woman an abortion-inducing drug up to 70 days of gestation. And the big one: Senate Bill 227 seeks to repeal the abortion ban all together.\nChandler said that some of the exceptions are quite broad. He pointed to Senate Bill 123 as an example.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere might be many women who are disturbed by continuing a pregnancy. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the exact reason that they want to have an abortion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chandler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so, I suspect there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a battle over the extent to which a mental health exception potentially guts the successes that pro-life forces won in the prior legislative session.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nHe said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be difficult to define exceptions during the next legislative session.\nRep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, has also proposed a bill to let pregnant women drive in the HOV lane.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to wage serious moral battles, and political battles, on the subject of abortion or who gets to drive in the HOV lane is a little bizarre, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a symbolic statement that I guess these fetuses are morally equivalent to having a born passenger next to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chandler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI sort of regard the HOV lane as somewhat of a theatrical part of abortion law, and I certainly hope the debate gets beyond who gets to drive in the HOV lane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhen the abortion clinic Whole Woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health had to close its doors earlier this year, the founder said it was devastating. She thinks Senate Bill 122 could be a step in the right direction if it passes, but she said it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve the problem.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter the reason that somebody ends up with an unplanned pregnancy, they should deserve access to safe and legal abortion. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one kind of reason somebody needs an abortion that should outrank another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder of Whole Woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health.\nNow Whole Woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health is seeing patients from Texas at its clinics in New Mexico, Illinois and Minnesota.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for people to understand that we can all support people to get abortions where they are still legal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hagstrom Miller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to meet the need of all the people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been displaced by these restrictions. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough to just navigate every day knowing that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help as many people as we used to be able to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnti-abortion advocates don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see a sexual assault exemption added to the abortion law.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong to discriminate against anyone based on how they came into being. And even with that beginning story, that child is still deserving of life, and so we will not support that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell said. \u00a0\nEven though most abortions are illegal in Texas, Hagstrom Miller stressed that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a big need for it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because you ban abortion, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the need for abortion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn abortion ban doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent people from still needing abortions in the state of Texas. It just prevents people from getting that care from trained medical professionals. And I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we have to remember as we try to assist people in our communities that really need access to the safe, essential medical care that is abortion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSome Republicans have said there might need to be an exception to the abortion law for sexual assault, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that abortion will become legal again next year.\nFollow Charlotte Scott on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            Contact\n        \n\n\n\n            About\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            Careers\n        \n\n\n\n            Sitemap\n        \n\n\n\n            Newsletter\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
