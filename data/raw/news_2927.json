Jackson\u00a0case. That decision, which overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade,\u00a0sent the issue of abortion back to the states. While we did not see the \u201csummer of rage\u201d that pro-abortion activists promised, there has been a great deal of debate about what our society owes women and children in post-Roe\u00a0America.\u00a0\nThe responses from the political left have been predictable. There have been calls for Congress to codify access to abortion through the\u00a0Women's Health Protection Act and\u00a0Ensuring Access to Abortion Act. These\u00a0bills, passed by House Democrats, would obligate healthcare providers to offer abortion services and prevent states from restricting women who travel across state lines to obtain an abortion.\u00a0\nThe response from the political right has been more varied. Some states moved to immediately impose restrictions on abortion after the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision, leading several abortion providers to close their doors. In Kansas, voters rejected an amendment that would have removed\u00a0the right to an abortion from their state constitution.\nOne interesting development since the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision has been the degree to which conservatives have argued for more support for pregnant mothers and their babies, both from the government and faith-based institutions. One essay in\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0from Patrick Brown, a Fellow at the\u00a0Ethics and Public Policy Center, presented a number of ideas regarding a Republican\u00a0pro-family agenda\u00a0after the fall of\u00a0Roe.\nBrown argued that conservatives should push for the permanent expansion of Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program coverage to mothers for up to one year postpartum. He also supports paid leave, home visiting programs for mothers, and expanding the Child Tax Credit.\u00a0\nThese are all good ideas. But one thing that was not mentioned in Brown\u2019s column was any specific reference to the role men play in supporting the children they create. He is not alone. One of the most consistent themes in abortion-related commentary since the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision is the absence of the words \u201cfather,\u201d \u201cmarriage,\u201d or \u201chusband\u201d in even the\u00a0conservative\u00a0grand vision for family life in America.\u00a0\nEven conservative Christian\u00a0organizations,\u00a0like the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), and pro-life social commentators, like\u00a0David French,\u00a0have fallen into the trap of speaking about\u00a0reproduction\u00a0as if humans are asexual beings.\u00a0Pro-choice activists\u00a0often\u00a0say that a hospital room is\u00a0too small\u00a0for a woman, her doctor, and the federal government. Judging by the words of some self-professed conservatives, there\u2019s not enough room for the\u00a0man\u00a0who helped create the\u00a0baby, either.\nThis is a mistake.\u00a0\nThe most important thing conservatives should be doing to support motherhood is using every ounce of political and cultural capital to reconnect marriage and childrearing. There is no greater example of privilege in America today than a child who grows up with his or her married biological parents in a stable and loving home. Given the relationship between marital status and abortion (i.e., most women seeking abortions are unmarried), now is the time for conservatives to bring a distinctive pro-life message into the public square that is built on the foundation of marriage and responsible fatherhood.\u00a0\n\nAny discussion of family that fails to include marriage and the responsibilities of fathers will yield marginally better results than what we would expect from pro-choice devotees of the Sexual Revolution.\u00a0\n\nPro-life politicians and social commentators need to make it clear that men are responsible for the children they create, not the state. They need to consistently promote the link between marriage and positive social and emotional outcomes for children. They need to reorient our society away from the contemporary model of family formation characterized by casual sex, conscious co-parenting, and commonplace abortion.\u00a0\nWhat conservatives\u00a0should\u00a0create instead is a comprehensive pro-life agenda built on the foundation of marriage that sees children as blessings to be enjoyed and celebrated, not burdens to be managed and overcome.\nIn the wake of the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision, Michelle Obama published a message on social media that expressed her\u00a0heartbreak\u00a0for a \u201cteenage girl, full of zest and promise, who won\u2019t be able to finish school or live the life she wants because her state controls her reproductive decisions.\u201d\u00a0The former First Lady expressed the primary driver of the American abortion regime with crystal clarity. The main issue is not healthcare, day care, or paid leave. It\u2019s not about rape, incest, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancies.\u00a0\nThe biggest contributor to abortion in America since\u00a0Roe\u00a0was decided is a low view of children, especially among women who have been told that their exclusive ability to bear and birth children is an oppressive drag on their career aspirations and life goals. This is why babies are so often referred to in abortion discourse as a \u201cconsequence\u201d of sex instead of the natural result of reproduction.\u00a0\nA man and woman who stand before family and friends to commit to one another for the rest of their lives typically see their children as a gateway to future generations. This is a much different orientation toward children than what one would expect from two people who enjoy being \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d but have no intention of making a lifelong commitment to one another.\u00a0\nPro-choice advocates are very much in favor of government involvement in family life. They want federal funds to pay for abortions, federal property to be used for abortions in states with restrictive abortion laws, and government support for women who choose to keep their babies. What they don\u2019t want is any limitation on the decisions women can make about the babies\u00a0growing inside their bodies.\nConservatives who argue for more support from the state for pregnant women are motivated by compassion and a sense of responsibility to children.\u00a0The problem is that any discussion of family that fails to include marriage and the responsibilities of fathers will yield marginally better results than what we would expect from pro-choice devotees of the Sexual Revolution.\u00a0\nRoe\u00a0is no more, and none of us know exactly what will come next. That is why now is the perfect time for conservatives to extol the benefits of marriage and speak life into an area of our culture that has been marked by death for far too long.\u00a0\nDelano Squires is a contributor to\u00a0Fearless with Jason Whitlock\u00a0on Blaze Media.
