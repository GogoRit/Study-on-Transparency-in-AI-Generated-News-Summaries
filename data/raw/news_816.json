California gun law that was inspired by the novel legal mechanisms pioneered in a Texas 2021 law that allowed private citizens to sue abortion providers.\n    \n\n            The ruling was praised not\u00a0only by the gun rights activists who challenged the law, but by its chief defender, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said the decision vindicated his and others\u2019 arguments that the Texas abortion\u00a0law was constitutionally flawed. \n    \n\n            US District Judge Roger Benitez said in his opinion on Monday\u00a0that the California law went farther than the Texas abortion measure known as SB8. \n    \n\n            But the judge stopped short of saying that those distinctions made the Texas abortion\u00a0law legally sound.\n    \n\n            The California law allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state \u2013 but that aspect of the law was not part of the case before Benitez.\n    \n\n            The provision in question in the California law \u2013 SB 1327 \u2013 was a so-called fee-shifting regime. It said that when a person or entity challenged in a court a state or local gun\u00a0restriction, they would be on the hook for paying the legal fees of the restriction\u2019s defenders if they lost their case, but would not be able to recover their legal fees from their opponents if they won. \n    \n\n            The provision was modeled after fee-shifting language in the Texas abortion law, which included similar language directed at legal challenges to abortion restrictions.\n    \n\n            Benitez said Monday that California\u2019s law fee-shifting regime undermines citizens\u2019 First Amendment right to access courts to protect their rights under the Second Amendment.\n    \n\n            \u201cToday, it applies to Second Amendment rights,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTomorrow, with a slight amendment, it could be any other constitutional right including the right to speak freely, to freedom of the press, to practice one\u2019s religion, to restrict cruel and unusual punishment, and to be free from government takings without compensation.\u201d\n    \n\n            The gun measure also mimics the Texas law by allowing private citizens to bring civil lawsuits to enforce California\u2019s bans on assault weapons and other types of firearms, but that part of the law was not before the judge in Monday\u2019s decision. The Texas law lets private citizens to sue anyone who facilitates an abortion after the detection of fetal cardiac activity \u2013 which is around six weeks into the pregnancy \u2013 with the promise of $10,000 or more in damages if the lawsuit is successful. \n    \n\n            The Texas abortion law was designed to evade judicial review by using private civil litigation to enforce an abortion ban that would otherwise be at odds with the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent, which protected the right to an abortion. The strategy was blessed by a 5-4 ruling by the US Supreme Court that refused to block state court officials from presiding over lawsuits brought under the law.\u00a0\n    \n\n            Benitez quoted Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion dissenting from parts of the Supreme Court majority\u2019s ruling,\u00a0as well as the criticisms\u00a0from Newsom about the abortion law.\n    \n\n            Benitez wrote that, while there were some differences between Texas\u2019 and California\u2019s fee-shifting regimes, it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether those differences protected the Texas law from judicial scrutiny.\n    \n\n            \u201cAnd although it would be tempting to comment on it, the Texas law is not before this Court for determination,\u201d the judge, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote.\n    \n\n            The California measure also ran afoul of a federal statute that allows plaintiffs to recoup legal costs if they bring a successful constitutional challenges to law, Benitez said.\n    \n\n            Bill Sack \u2013 the director of litigation for\u00a0Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the groups that challenged the California measure \u2013 celebrated the ruling in a statement.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe enactment of SB 1327 was intended to do only one thing: chill the rights of the people and dissuade them from pursuing justice from tyranny,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Court made it clear today that cynical political grandstanding will not be tolerated when it infringes on the rights of the people.\u201d\n    \n\n            Several months after the Supreme Court decision in the Texas abortion case, the same set of conservative justices reversed Roe v. Wade, giving states the ability to enforce more conventional abortion bans. But anti-abortion activists remain interested in the novel design of Texas\u2019 SB8.\n    \n\n            Newsom, meanwhile, said in a statement Monday that he wanted to thank Benitez for his ruling, claiming the decision confirmed that the Texas law was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThe provision in California\u2019s law that he struck down is a replica of what Texas did, and his explanation of why this part of SB 1327 unfairly blocks access to the courts applies equally to Texas\u2019\u00a0SB 8.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no longer any doubt that Texas\u2019 cruel anti-abortion law should\u00a0also\u00a0be struck down.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
