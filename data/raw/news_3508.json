Approximately 70% of abortion-related threats of violence in the US since the Dobbs decision have been against pro-life groups, according to the head of the FBI.    FBI Director Christopher Wray gave the statistic while speaking at a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee.MAYORKAS MAINTAINS 'BORDER IS SECURE' DESPITE RECORD CROSSINGS; FBI SEES 'SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL THREATS'  FBI Director Christopher Wray testifies with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas before the House Homeland Security Committee in the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on Nov. 15, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  Sen. Rick Scott of Florida questioned Wray during the hearing about recurring accusations that the FBI is not committing resources to combat an escalation in crimes committed against pregnancy centers, churches and other pro-life institutions.  \"My view \u2014 plainly expressed to all of our people, including in the context of abortion-related violence \u2014 is that I don't care what side of the issue you're on, you don't get to engage in violence, and we are equal-opportunity when it comes to that,\" Wray replied to Scott.

(Photo courtesy of Kathy Potts)The FBI director went on to address the rising rate of violent threats and attacks against pro-life groups \u2014 the most explicit confirmation of the trend from FBI leadership thus far.  \"Now, we have quite a number of investigations \u2014 as we speak \u2014 into attacks or threats against pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations and other pro-life organizations,\" Wray continued. \"And you might be interested to know that since the Dobbs Act decision, probably in the neighborhood of 70% of our abortion-related violence cases or threats cases are cases of violence or threats against [\u2026] pro-life organizations. And we're going after that through our joint terrorism task forces, through our criminal authorities, FACE Act and things like that.\"MORE THAN 100 PRO-LIFE ORGS, CHURCHES ATTACKED SINCE DOBBS LEAK  A pro-life pregnancy center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was vandalized on Tuesday, and the group Jane's Revenge has claimed responsibility for carrying out the act in an online post. (Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life)  \"We have about 20 field offices involved in this. And so we take it very seriously. And again, I don't care you're motivated by pro-life views or pro-choice views. You don't get to use violence to express it,\" he added.    Scott, stating that he supported Wray's strong tone in explaining the situation, expressed confusion as to why the FBI has not been more vocal in its prosecution of those who threaten or attack pro-life organizations.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Sen.
