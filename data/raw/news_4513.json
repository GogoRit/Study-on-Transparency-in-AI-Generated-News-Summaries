The impact of her judgements and dissents on gender equality, reproductive rights and immigration matters will reverberate long after her death, say experts.\nAfter Ginsburg\u2019s death on Friday, Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said: \u201cShe was well aware of her place in history as one of the voices for the excluded, the oppressed and those trying to find real justice.\u201dKeep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Perry guides RCB to first WPL title in low-scoring thrillerlist 2 of 4South Korea to China: Why is East Asia producing so few babies?list 3 of 4\u2018We are tired, angry and mad\u2019: 180,000 women march in Mexico Citylist 4 of 4Varadkar concedes defeat in Ireland\u2019s referendum on family, women\u2019s rolesend of list\nGinsburg has been described as a \u201cfeminist icon\u201d.\u00a0Upon her faculty appointment at Columbia Law School in 1972, Ginsburg said: \u201cSexual discrimination is and will continue to be my principal interest.\u201d\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speaking about her work and gender equality during a panel discussion at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington [File: AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta]\nHiring women\nWhen Ginsburg was hired by Columbia University after a string of rejections because of her gender, she stressed the importance of hiring women for senior legal positions.\nShe said her\u00a0appointment\u00a0as the first female tenured law professor at the school \u201creflects a serious effort on the part of Columbia Law School to hire more women\u201d and added \u201cI know that I am not just a token. I expect that I will be the first of many women the law school will have.\u201d\nKim Thuy Seelinger, professor of law at Washington University and expert on gender-based violence, told Al Jazeera: \u201cThe fact that Ginsburg kept excelling and kept fighting for gender and racial equality despite her personal struggles is tremendously inspiring to me, a female lawyer of colour in the United States. I suspect women of many backgrounds feel the same\u201d.\nGender equality battles\nGinsburg led the legal fight for gender equality in the US from the early 1970s. At the time, hundreds of federal and state laws in the US discriminated against women.\nIn 1971 she wrote her first brief for the Supreme Court in Reed v Reed, a case involving the constitutionality of an Idaho statute that stated \u201cmen must be preferred to females\u201d in executing estates.\n \n\n\n\n \nThe court decided that the statute was unconstitutional. This was the first case in which the Supreme Court struck down a state law on the basis of gender discrimination.\nIn 1972 Ginsburg joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a non-profit organisation that supports civil liberties through litigation and lobbying. She was the founding director of the group\u2019s Women\u2019s Rights Project.\nDuring her time at the ACLU she argued six cases before the Supreme Court and won five. Many of her early cases involved sex discrimination against men, towards which she thought judges at the time might be more sympathetic.\nDuring her first oral argument before the Supreme Court in 1973, in the\u00a0Frontiero v Richardson\u00a0case in which she challenged the assumption that a man is not likely to be a dependent spouse, she quoted Sarah Grimke, a 19th-century abolitionist and suffragette: \u201cI ask no favour for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.\u201d Her argument prevailed in what became known as a landmark case on gender equality.\nIn 1996 Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in the case United States v Virginia, declaring that the Virginia Military Institute, a public military college, could no longer remain an all-male institution. The lawsuit was heralded as the beginning of a new era in gender-based equal protection cases.\n\u201cEverybody working on women\u2019s legal rights in the 1970s knew that Ruth\u2019s litigation was of central significance. It enhanced our ability to attract outstanding legal talent for our work. It also helped build a strong feminist caucus on the board,\u201d said Aryeh Neier, the former executive director of the ACLU who appointed Ginsburg.\nPeople gather at the Supreme Court on the morning after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, Saturday, Sept. 19, 2020 in Washington. [J. Scott Applewhite/AP]\nReproductive rights\nGinsburg was also known for her support of reproductive freedom.\nIn a Supreme Court ruling\u00a0in July, Ginsburg and Justice Sonia Sotomayor were the only judges to disagree with a ruling that would allow any company to get out of government-mandated insurance for contraception if the employer had a moral or religious objection to it.\nIn her lengthy dissent in this case, Ginsburg noted that tens of thousands of women would possibly lose their contraception coverage. She wrote: \u201ca religious adherent may be entitled to religious accommodation with regard to her own conduct\u201d but she is not entitled to force others to conform to her conduct.\nIn the wake of Ginsburg\u2019s death, many are concerned that the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case, which protects a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion in the US, could be overturned by justices appointed by US President Donald Trump.\nThere is widespread concern in liberal circles that if Ginsburg is replaced by a conservative judge on the court, it would leave supporters of abortion rights outnumbered. There was already a five-to-four\u00a0majority\u00a0of anti-abortion judges on the Supreme Court before Ginsburg\u2019s death. If Trump appoints a judge \u2013 presumably one who opposes abortion \u2013 the number of anti-abortion judges would rise to six.\n\u201cThe fate of our rights, our healthcare, our bodies, our lives and our country depend on what happens over the coming months,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, the head of Planned Parenthood, said on Friday.\n \n\n\n\n \n\u201cWhile her record as a lawyer, professor and justice reflects that she was a long-committed advocate on abortion rights because she believed these rights involve critical life decisions that should be made by each woman for herself instead of by the state, Ginsburg\u2019s scholarly writing also reflects her broader institutional concerns about Roe v Wade\u2019s sweep and the need to ensure political support on these important social questions,\u201d Ruti Teitel, professor of law at New York Law School, told Al Jazeera.\n\u2018Great dissenter\u2019\nWell-known for her searing dissents, Bader Ginsburg became known as \u201cthe great dissenter\u201d. A dissent is the opinion of a judge who disagrees with the majority opinion.\nWhen, in 2007, the court ruled against Lilly Ledbetter \u2013 who had been paid less than male colleagues in comparable jobs at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company \u2013 Ginsburg dissented. Her dissent eventually led to the adoption of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act by President Barack Obama in 2009.\nSeelinger says: \u201cGinsburg understood that even if the Supreme Court majority could not or would not offer the protection sought, judges in the minority could still call for Congress to resolve the issue outside the Court. This is what happened in the Ledbetter case.\u201d\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg answering a law student\u2019s question as she participates in a \u201cfireside chat\u201d in the Bruce M. Selya Appellate Courtroom at the Roger William University Law School\u00a0 in Bristol, Rhode Island [File: AP Photo/Stephan Savoia]\nImmigration cases\nWith the new Supreme Court term due to start on October 5, Ginsburg\u2019s absence could change the trajectory of issues she championed such as gender and immigrants\u2019 rights.\nHer absence on the court could affect Trump\u2019s efforts to\u00a0exclude\u00a0undocumented immigrants from the 2020 US Census count of every person in the country, which is politically significant since it will be used to allocate seats in Congress.\nTrump has been accused of \u201cweaponising\u201d and \u201cmanipulating\u201d the census against immigrant communities. It is argued that the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the congressional reapportionment consideration could benefit Republicans electorally.\nIn recent months Ginsburg was still actively protecting the rights of the vulnerable. In July she was one of the justices who\u00a0upheld\u00a0the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme.\nDACA is a US immigration policy that protects eligible immigrant youth who came to the US when they were children from being deported. In 2017 Trump\u00a0attempted\u00a0to end the programme.\nIn the coming months, the Supreme Court will be faced with an immigration case that could affect the fate of\u00a0700,000\u00a0young people who could face deportation should DACA be abolished.\nA \u2018less smart and less decent\u2019 court\nGregory Magarian, professor of constitutional law at Washington University in St Louis, told Al Jazeera: \u201cJustice Ginsburg will leave a great hole on the court. She was the most senior justice on the court\u2019s more liberal wing, and she never hesitated to push back against the court\u2019s conservative majority.\u00a0 The court will be less smart and less decent without her.\u201d\nNeier agrees: \u201cIf Trump gets to pick Ruth\u2019s successor, it will consolidate right-wing control of the court for the foreseeable future. The consequences for civil liberties will be disastrous. I can\u2019t begin to spell them out.\u201d\naj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
