A pioneering lawyer on women\u2019s equality. A civil rights hero. A feminist symbol. A major pop icon. Notorious RBG. A key justice on the nation\u2019s highest court.\nAs the country grieves the loss of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday at 87, thousands gathered near the steps of the Supreme Court building to pay homage to her life and her contributions to American jurisprudence and women\u2019s rights. Ginsburg received an honorary degree from Harvard in 2011 and the Radcliffe Medal in 2015. To understand her legacy better, we asked members of the Harvard community to reflect on what she stood for and how she will be remembered. Here are their thoughts.\n\nTomiko Brown-Nagin \nDean, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study,\nDaniel P.S. Paul Professor of Constitutional Law, Harvard Law School\nProfessor of History, Faculty of Arts and Sciences\nRuth Bader Ginsburg will be remembered as a champion of equality. Well before she ascended to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg had left an indelible mark on law and society. At the ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project, she was the chief architect of a campaign against sex-role stereotyping in the law, arguing and winning five landmark Supreme Court cases during the 1970s. These decisions established the principle of equal treatment in the law for women as well as men and banished numerous laws that treated men and women differently based on archaic gender stereotypes. Her achievements as a litigator made her, as many have said, the Thurgood Marshall of the women\u2019s rights movement.\n\nAs an associate justice on the court, Ginsburg wrote opinions that championed both gender and racial equality. Most notably, in\u00a0United States v. Virginia \u2014 the culmination of her campaign for equal treatment in the law \u2014 her majority opinion held unconstitutional the Virginia Military Institute\u2019s practice of excluding qualified women from admission merely because of sex. Her oral dissent in\u00a0Ledbetter v. Goodyear, which rejected a pay discrimination case on a technicality, pushed Congress to enact and President Barack Obama to sign equal pay legislation in 2009. She defended women\u2019s reproductive freedom in several cases and supported gay marriage. Through her stinging dissent in\u00a0Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, she captured the imagination of a new generation. Her new admirers, praising her fierceness, deemed her the \u201cNotorious RBG.\u201d\u00a0In other cases, Ginsburg defended affirmative action against a legal onslaught, and she poignantly noted in interviews that she and many other women had benefited from the practice.\nHer legacy, however, goes far beyond what she achieved in court. Ginsburg also should be remembered for her resilience. Personal setbacks animated her quest for social justice. She memorably summed up the connection between her personal losses and her public life at a Federal Judicial Center conference that I attended years ago. Profound challenges \u2014 the loss of her mother the day before she graduated from high school, her husband\u2019s struggle with cancer while they were both in law school \u2014 fueled her fierce determination to accomplish her dreams and achieve justice for others. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to just sit in the corner and cry,\u201d I recall Ginsburg defiantly noting during her talk. Those words have stuck with me all these years. Ginsburg\u2019s refusal to crumble into a heap of defeat is a defining and inspiring part of her legacy.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg receiving her honorary degree after Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (right) sang to her at Harvard\u2019s 2011 Commencement.\t\t\tBrooks Canaday/Harvard file photo\nCarol Steiker \nHenry J. Friendly Professor of Law\nSpecial Adviser for Public Service, Harvard Law School\nAlmost a decade ago, Ruth Bader Ginsburg received an honorary degree from Harvard, joining a star-studded list of other luminaries being similarly honored that day. As each honorand was called up to receive a degree from then-President Drew Faust, the crowd responded with warm appreciation. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, the famed opera singer; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia and the first woman to lead an African country; Timothy Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web; Dudley Herschbach, winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry \u2014 each received enthusiastic applause and even pockets of standing cheers. But when Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s name was called, the entire Tercentenary Theatre erupted into a massive, thunderous standing ovation. And when Ginsburg descended from the stage at the end of the ceremonies, people scrambled to the aisle to try to snap photos or to touch the sleeve of her robe as she passed.\nMany famous and accomplished people have been honored at Harvard\u2019s graduations, including a number of Supreme Court justices. But this was different.\u00a0Ginsburg would not be dubbed \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d for another two years, but she was already an icon. Why? Not merely for her important work on the nation\u2019s highest court, but also for her trailblazing work in an era when female attorneys and legal rights for women were both depressingly few and far between. The story of Ginsburg\u2019s tremendous successes as a young civil rights attorney who litigated the key cases establishing women\u2019s constitutional right to equal treatment has been well-told in the documentary \u201cRBG\u201d and the biopic \u201cOn the Basis of Sex.\u201d But our familiarity with that story does not make it any less amazing or improbable. The world will never be the same.\n\nMartha Minow\n300th Anniversary University Professor,\nHarvard University Distinguished Service Professor\nMember of the Faculty of Education\nVery few individuals in history come close to the extraordinary and significant role played by Justice Ginsburg in the pursuit of justice before she joined the bench.\u00a0 She would be a landmark figure just by being the first woman to earn a tenured faculty post at Columbia Law School.\u00a0 And she made history as director of the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued landmark cases on gender equality before the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 brilliantly crafting successful challenges to the system of legally enforced gender roles that limited opportunities for both women and men. With vision and brilliance, she earned a place in the history books and on the honor roll of civil rights heroes.\nThen, as judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, she demonstrated the highest level of legal craft in crucial decisions.\u00a0 And as associate justice of the Supreme Court, she has produced a body of superbly crafted opinions, building on precedent while always demonstrating that law is meant to \u2014 and with conscientious work can \u2014 serve justice for real people.\nWhen she was a student at Harvard Law School, she faced a class of over 500 men and only seven other women. She juggled her roles as a wife and mother with her work as a law student and faced a dean who chided female students for taking the places of qualified males. She excelled. She joined the Harvard Law Review. When her husband, fellow law student Martin Ginsburg, had to deal with cancer, she took notes for him and helped him recover. And when the Harvard dean refused her request to earn her degree while moving to New York with her family and completing her final year of schooling at Columbia Law School, she transferred there and promptly rose to the top of the class.\nShe gently but rightly resisted the requests of later Harvard Law School deans to accept a tardy degree from Harvard Law School. Finally, in 2011, she received a Harvard degree \u00ad\u2014 an honorary doctorate, the University\u2019s highest academic honor.\u00a0 In celebration, an opera singer \u2014 and fellow honoree \u2014 sang for her and the assembled crowd.\nI am one of countless people she directly encouraged and deeply inspired to use reason and argument in service of justice and humanity. Justice Ginsburg also showed that it is possible to build deep and meaningful friendships with people despite severe disagreements.\u00a0At this time of deep social and political divisions, there is much to learn from her life and her commitments.\u00a0Above all, she changed the lives of millions as a lawyer and as a jurist by dismantling barriers to employment, education, and roles in families and society based solely on gender \u2014 and showed how law can, with persistence and vision, be a tool to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.\nIn 2009, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (center) spoke at Harvard Law School with Nancy Gertner (left) and Linda Greenhouse. Kris Snibbe/Harvard file photo\t\t\t\n\nSusan H. Farbstein\nClinical Professor of Law, Harvard Law School\nDirector, International Human Rights Clinic\nFearless. Brilliant. Resilient. As both an advocate and a jurist, Ruth Bader Ginsburg showed us how to use the law, creatively and strategically, to promote justice. Her legacy, of course, is as a champion for the equality of all people and a hero in the struggle for women\u2019s rights.\nHer example has always been an inspiration.\u00a0 As law students, my peers and I wanted to be her, or at least be like her. She was a visionary litigator, a tenacious questioner at oral argument, and a witty storyteller. She personified determination and demonstrated how to fight with grace and an apparently tireless energy. Her intellect, strength, and confidence helped us believe in ourselves, our voices, and our contributions.\nBut more broadly, her legacy implores us to understand that the role of the Supreme Court \u2014 and of the legal system itself \u2014 is not to engage in a series of debates about abstract or purely intellectual legal propositions. The law is about people, their lives, and their aspirations.\u00a0 Attorneys who use the law to promote social justice must, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, be mindful of the fundamentally human aspect of our work.\nJustice Ginsburg always recognized those who had paved the way for her, even as she broke new ground for us. Although her accomplishments are singular, her legacy teaches us that upholding justice requires a collective effort. Her life\u2019s work is a reminder of the law\u2019s capacity to transform systems and cultures, and to shift power. So, as we mourn this crushing loss, we must continue her fight for equal rights and sustain her commitment to the rule of law.\n\nJohn F. Manning\nMorgan and Helen Chu Dean and Professor of Law, Harvard Law School\nJustice Ginsburg personified the best of what it meant to be a judge. She brought a deep intellectual and personal integrity to everything she did. Her powerful and unyielding commitment to the rule of law and to equal justice under law place her among the great Justices in the annals of the court. She was also one of the most impactful lawyers of the 20th century, whose historic work advocating against gender discrimination and for equal rights for all opened doors for countless people and transformed our society. She was an inspiring and courageous human being. We have lost a giant.\n\nVicki C. Jackson \nLaurence H. Tribe Professor of Constitutional Law, Harvard Law School\nJustice Ginsburg\u2019s impact on the law is enormous. The gender equality cases she litigated and won, and the gender equality cases she helped decide in the Supreme Court, including VMI, will continue to shape the law for generations to come. Her commitment to \u201cequal justice under law\u201d was not limited to issues of women\u2019s equality. The opinions she wrote in cases involving efforts to overcome America\u2019s history of racial injustice (for example, in affirmative action in public universities or through the Voting Rights Act), and the opinions she joined in cases extending equality norms to LGBTQ persons, bespoke the breadth and depth of her commitment.\nJustice Ginsburg loved the law; she believed in the importance of legal procedures; she had a prodigious memory and broad knowledge, which she continued to refresh through reading and research; and she carefully scrutinized laws that she thought were based on unsupported suppositions or stereotypes. She applied her extraordinary analytical mind not only to large, general issues, but also to protect individuals from unfair application of procedural rules.\nHer openness about her own life has allowed others to envision paths that combine rewarding work with loving family life and friendships. As she showed, tradition need not determine family roles; tasks can be allocated based on interest or ability (it was Marty Ginsburg who cooked); and even the most demanding workplaces can accommodate parents with young children.\nJustice Ginsburg had a rare combination of brilliance, wisdom, awareness of how law affects actual people, and ability to make lasting human connections \u2014 with her clients, her colleagues, her staff and others. Her connections to the lived lives of people is reflected in her judicial decisions; for example, her dissent in Lily Ledbetter\u2019s case described workplace \u201crealities\u201d in which gendered compensation disparities \u201care often hidden from sight.\u201d\nOur world was greatly enhanced by her life. And our world is greatly diminished by her passing. She will be much missed and long remembered.\n\nDaphna Renan\nProfessor of Law, Harvard Law School\nRBG was tenacious, unflappable, and deeply wise. She was a visionary in the fight for women\u2019s equality, and she was a fighter until the end. She was as careful with her drafting as she was brave in her argument and powerful in her reasoning. She was grace and grit combined, and she never lost sight of the impact law can have on people\u2019s lives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tShare this article\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail article\n\n\n\nPrint/PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore like this\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nGinsburg holds court\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 6, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tCampus & Community\t\t\nHonoring Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n\n\n\nPart of the\nCommencement 2015\n series\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 29, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might like\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nIt may be neither higher nor intelligence\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReligious scholars examine value, limits of AI\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nBolsonaro, Trump election cases share similarities, but not rulings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFormer Brazilian judge, legal scholar says deciding who can be blocked from running is perilous, fraught\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nDark concerns over upcoming vote in world\u2019s largest democracy\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocial scientists discuss controversial Indian prime minister Modi, rise of right-wing populism, erosion of political journalism\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tArts & Culture\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo what exactly makes Taylor Swift so great?\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExperts weigh in on pop superstar's cultural and financial impact as her tours and albums continue to break records.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCampus & Community\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the first day of Christmas \u2026 we partied like it was 1499\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChurch historian traces celebration\u2019s path from wild revelry through Puritan\u2019s progress to Hallmark holiday\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHealth\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 20-minute workout\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPressed for time?
