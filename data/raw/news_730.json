Wade, as the Republican governor quickly signed a near-total ban on the procedure shortly after lawmakers approved it.The ban, which takes effect Sept. 15, includes some exceptions. Abortions would be permitted in cases of rape and incest, before 10-weeks post-fertilization; to protect the life and physical health of the mother; and if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. Victims of rape and incest would not be required to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to an attack, as had once been proposed.Under the bill, abortions can be performed only in hospitals or outpatient centers owned by hospitals, meaning all abortion clinics would lose their licenses. A doctor who performs an illegal abortion or fails to file required reports must also lose their medical license \u2014 wording that tightens current Indiana law that says a doctor \u201cmay\u201d lose their license.\n\n\u201cI am personally most proud of each Hoosier who came forward to courageously share their views in a debate that is unlikely to cease any time soon,\u201d Gov. Eric Holcomb said in the statement announcing that he had signed the measure. \u201cFor my part as your governor, I will continue to keep an open ear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis approval came after the Senate approved the ban 28-19 and the House advanced it 62-38. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana was among the earliest Republican-run state legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws after the Supreme Court ruling in June that removed constitutional protections for the procedure. But it is the first state to pass a ban through both chambers, after West Virginia lawmakers on July 29 passed up the chance to be that state.\u201cHappy to be completed with this, one of the more challenging things that we\u2019ve ever done as a state General Assembly, at least certainly while I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Senate President Pro-Tem Rodric Bray told reporters after the vote. \u201c I think this is a huge opportunity, and we\u2019ll build on that as we go forward from here.\u201d\n\nSen. Sue Glick of LaGrange, who sponsored the bill, said that she does not think \u201call states will come down at the same place\u201d but that most Indiana residents support aspects of the bill.Some senators in both parties lamented the bill\u2019s provisions and the impact it would have on the state, including low-income women and the health care system. Eight Republicans joined all 11 Democrats in voting against the bill, though their reasons to thwart the measure were mixed.\u201cWe are backsliding on democracy,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Jean Breaux of Indianapolis, who wore a green ribbon Friday signifying support for abortion rights, on her lapel. \u201cWhat other freedoms, what other liberties are on the chopping block, waiting to be stripped away?\u201dRepublican Sen. Mike Bohacek of Michiana Shores spoke about his 21-year-old-daughter, who has Down syndrome. Bohacek voted against the bill, saying it does not have adequate protections for women with disabilities who are raped. \n\n\u201cIf she lost her favorite stuffed animal, she\u2019d be inconsolable. Imagine making her carry a child to term,\u201d he said before he started to choke up, then threw his notes on his seat and exited the chamber.Republican Sen. Mike Young of Indianapolis, however, said the bill\u2019s enforcement provisions against doctors are not stringent enough. Such debates demonstrated Indiana residents\u2019 own divisions on the issue, displayed in hours of testimony lawmakers heard over the past two weeks. Residents rarely, if ever, expressed support for the the legislation in their testimony, as abortion-rights supporters said the bill goes too far while anti-abortion activists expressed it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The debates came amid an evolving landscape of abortion politics across the country as Republicans face some party divisions and Democrats see a possible election-year boost.Republican Rep. Wendy McNamara of Evansville, who sponsored the House bill, told reporters after the House vote that the legislation \u201cmakes Indiana one of the most pro-life states in the nation.\u201d\n\nOutside the chambers, abortion-rights activists often chanted over lawmakers\u2019 remarks, carrying signs like \u201cRoe roe roe your vote\u201d and \u201cBuild this wall\u201d between church and state. Some House Democrats wore blazers over pink \u201cBans Off Our Bodies\u201d T-shirts.Indiana\u2019s ban followed the political firestorm over a 10-year-old rape victim who traveled to the state from neighboring Ohio to end her pregnancy. The case gained attention when an Indianapolis doctor said the child came to Indiana because of Ohio\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d ban.Religion was a persistent theme during legislative debates, both in residents\u2019 testimony and lawmakers\u2019 comments.In advocating against the House bill, Rep. Ann Vermilion condemned fellow Republicans who have called women \u201cmurderers\u201d for getting an abortion.\n\n\u201cI think that the Lord\u2019s promise is for grace and kindness,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would not be jumping to condemn these women.\u201d___Arleigh Rodgers is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
