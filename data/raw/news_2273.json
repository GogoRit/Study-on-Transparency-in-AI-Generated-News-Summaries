LeeGuest columnistR.\u00a0Lee is a supporter of women\u2019s rights and has been in health care for approximately 30 years.The elective abortion issue is more complex than simply \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice.\u201d Pregnancy and delivery are not risk free. The risk of death from pregnancy and delivery is far greater than the risk of death from an elective abortion. By removing a woman\u2019s choice, we make her face a greater risk of death or illness from pregnancy and delivery compared to an elective abortion.\u00a0The courts established that the decision to terminate a pregnancy belongs to women. Roe v. Wade did not come about in a vacuum.\u00a0It arose after decades of anti-abortion laws compromised doctors\u2019 abilities to help women, especially when there were medical indications for an abortion. Anti-choice legislation was problematic for health care providers and administrators, some of whom went to jail for helping women with medical reasons\u00a0for an abortion.Prior to Roe v. Wade, at least 5,000 women died annually in the U.S. because of lack of safe, legal abortions. Worldwide, at least 22,800 women die annually from complications of unsafe abortions,\u00a0and millions of women survive unsafe abortions but suffer from acute and chronic complications. In the U.S., problems associated with anti-choice legislation were alleviated or remedied with Roe v. Wade. Importantly, anti-choice legislation has little to no effect on the number of women seeking abortions. Access to safe, legal abortions undeniably benefits women while maintaining their right to self-determination.\u00a0Some claim that life begins at conception.\u00a0Doctors, scientists, philosophers\u00a0and theologians do not agree on when human life/personhood begins. How do we define life?\u00a0Can one legitimately argue a zygote is a human life\u00a0and not simply viable cells with the potential to become an adult human assuming nothing goes wrong with pregnancy and delivery? How about gestational trophoblastic disease? Anencephaly? Sperm/ova are viable, living cells with unique DNA sequences. Are they not also legitimately potential human life?The heartbeat argumentSome try to make a heartbeat\u00a0argument. Anencephalic fetuses have a heartbeat. And the heart is formed and beats before structures/pathways for sentience are formed at around 18-25 weeks. Even then, they are not sufficiently developed for sentience as we know it. The millions of animals slaughtered for consumption have heartbeats and are more sentient than human fetuses. If someone is claiming they care about the sanctity of life,\u00a0it is speciesist and hypocritical if one is not a vegetarian or vegan and not fighting to ban the killing of sentient non-human animals.\u00a0Hear more Tennessee voices:Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought-provoking columns.People also argue that fetuses feel pain, but they often refer to basic reflexes that don\u2019t require higher cortical functions. Fetuses don\u2019t feel pain\u00a0like we do, and they often demonstrate simple reflexive responses.The argument over religionAnother argument is religious. Approximately 1 in 4 known pregnancies end in miscarriage/spontaneous abortion. Considering losses before a positive pregnancy test, approximately 40% of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion. In one study, 53% of pregnancies had chromosomal abnormalities, the most common cause of spontaneous abortion. Worldwide, there are tens of millions of spontaneous abortions annually, including the unfortunate occurrence of umbilical cord strangulation. Nature/ \u201cgod\u201d is not necessarily as \u201cpro-life\u201d as one might think. This does not justify elective abortion, but a dogmatic anti-abortion position must also be condemning of \"god\" if one is using religion as a basis for an anti-choice position.Lastly, there is a strong correlation between strict abortion laws and crime.Legislation regarding elective abortion restrictions in the last trimester might be reasonable, as long as such legislation is crafted in conjunction with medical experts active in the practice of obstetrics and includes exceptions for medical necessity and rape.We should support women and their right to make decisions related to their health care, well-being\u00a0and self-determination. Women should be able to make such decisions in consultation with their doctors, spouses, faith\u00a0and family without interference by politicians, those with a limited understanding of these issues, or those who seek to limit women's options\u00a0based solely on religious ideology.R.\u00a0Lee is a supporter of women\u2019s rights and has been in health care for approximately 30 years.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
