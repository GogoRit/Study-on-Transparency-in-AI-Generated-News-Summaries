In the last few months, the clinic was part of four simultaneous lawsuits at the state and federal level, including June Medical Services v. Russo, a pivotal case being decided by the Supreme Court this week. As COVID-19 spread across the United States, anti-abortion politicians in Louisiana began publicly suggesting that abortion was not an essential health service and threatening to shut down care. As neighboring Texas temporarily shut down access, Hope was inundated with panicked calls from out of state, begging for appointments.\nTo comply with social distancing precautions, the clinic had already limited its daily number of patients and curtailed its normal practices like offering patients tea and cookies and ensuring a patient\u2019s support system was on hand after procedures. At one point, the clinic was forced to schedule patients a month out for first visits\u2014in a state that already mandates a 24-hour waiting period and a ban on abortions after 20 weeks.\nAbortions are already inherently stressful times for patients, but amid the pandemic, they\u2019ve become a nightmare: an elaborate obstacle course as numerous states used the excuse of COVID-19 to close clinics.\n\u201cPeople had an appointment at one clinic and would go for their counseling appointment, then the clinics in the state would get shut down,\u201d said Jennifer Dalven, director of the Reproductive Freedom Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, a Ford grantee. \u201cThey would go to another state, and they\u2019d be past the gestational limit, or, because they had to see the same doctor for their initial counseling appointment, they couldn\u2019t get an appointment.\u201d One woman Dalven spoke to traveled to three different states to find a clinic that could provide her an abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nIn April, when Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry formed a task force to enforce the suspension of \u201celective, non-emergency medical procedures,\u201d Hope Clinic was targeted for warrantless raids by Landry\u2019s staff, who demanded to review their safety protocols, equipment, and medical records of patients who\u2019d received abortions since the pandemic began.\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), a global reproductive rights legal advocacy group funded by Ford, along with Lift Louisiana, a grassroots group also supported by Ford, immediately sued the state to block its attempt to use public health directives to close abortion clinics, reaching an agreement that allowed the clinics to continue operating. In the end, 10 states\u2014including six surrounding Louisiana\u2014made similar attempts to restrict abortion access during the pandemic, prompting CRR, ACLU and their coalition partners to successfully challenge district courts to block bans in eight of the 10 states.\nThe Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge prior to a rally against the state\u2019s stay-at-home order, which led to anti-abortion politicians to suggest that abortion was not an essential health service and threaten to shut down care.Chris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nBy June, as states began reopening, the team at Hope Clinic found themselves playing catch-up with women they couldn\u2019t see earlier because they were flooded with requests from out-of-state patients. The wear on the staff was visible.\n\u201cI can always tell when they\u2019re thinking about what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d said Kathaleen Pittman, the clinic\u2019s longtime administrator. \u201cThey\u2019ll be going about their business and, all of a sudden, I see a very pensive expression cross their faces. And I know exactly what\u2019s on their minds: \u2018Are we going to be able to do this next week?\u2019\u201d\nSome of the issues facing Hope Clinic have been building for years. Others were cast into sharp relief by the pandemic. Taken together, the state\u2019s current situation paints a frightening preview of what a world without meaningful abortion access looks like\u2014and indicates just how high the stakes are for June Medical Services v. Russo.\nGround Zero in America\u2019s fight over abortion\n\u201cLouisiana has been one of the ground-zero areas of reproductive oppression since Roe v. Wade was decided,\u201d said Steffani Bangel, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition for Reproductive Freedom, a Ford grantee. The state has more anti-abortion laws than any other in the country, and anti-abortion groups consistently vote it \u201cthe most pro-life state in America.\u201d\nThat\u2019s made Louisiana an important testing ground for new anti-abortion legislation, such as model laws drafted by \u201cbill mills\u201d like the American Legislative Exchange Council or Americans United for Life. Beyond the state\u2019s 24-hour waiting period\u2014which forces patients to make two separate appointments before their procedures\u2014and 20-week ban, there are also laws mandating parental consent for minors, restricting medication abortions to abortion clinics only, and forbidding any insurance plan offered on the Louisiana health exchange from covering abortion costs.\nAdditionally, in 2015, the state more than tripled its licensing regulations for Louisiana abortion clinics, said Ellie Schilling, the co-founder of Lift Louisiana. The regulations function like classic \u201cTRAP laws\u201d\u2014the \u201ctargeted restrictions on abortion providers\u201d that have proliferated around the country over the last decade and hold providers to standards that aren\u2019t applied to any other medical office\u2014and which have a documented pattern of leading to clinic closures. \u201cIt just increases the administrative burden of operating a clinic, and therefore also the cost in terms of staffing, resources and the strain on what are small medical offices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Statement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Statement\n\n\nAll videos produced by the Ford Foundation since 2020 include captions and downloadable transcripts. For videos where visuals require additional understanding, we offer audio-described versions.\nWe are continuing to make videos produced prior to 2020 accessible.\nVideos from third-party sources (those not produced by the Ford Foundation) may not have captions, accessible transcripts, or audio descriptions.\nTo improve accessibility beyond our site, we\u2019ve created a free video accessibility WordPress plug-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are all these layers upon layers of restrictions, the goal and purpose of which is to make it harder to get a license, harder to provide the services, harder and more humiliating for patients to seek these services,\u201d said Lourdes Rivera, CRR\u2019s Senior Vice President for US Programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been suing the state of Louisiana for more than 20 years because every legislative session they come up with something new to burden abortion access and which falls hardest on people with the fewest resources.\u201d\nThese restrictions have led to some of the highest costs for abortion access in the nation. And, since there is no access in 92 percent of the state\u2019s parishes, Bangel said, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to drive across state borders than to try to access an abortion in Louisiana.\u201d With procedures starting at $400, and many Louisianans forced to drive four to five hours to reach a clinic\u2014which can entail a hotel stay or two trips because of the mandated waiting period, plus time off from work and child care\u2014the costs quickly become prohibitive.\nThat means the burden of abortion restrictions fall disproportionately on poor women and women of color, especially in a poor state with a $7.25 minimum wage and the second-highest maternal mortality rate in the nation. \u201cIf you\u2019re forcing black women to give birth without consent, you\u2019re also asking them to stare down maternal mortality, since we\u2019re three to four times more likely to die in childbirth,\u201d said Lakeesha Harris, Director of Reproductive Health and Justice at the Louisiana nonprofit Women With A Vision (WWAV). \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing is not just whether women will have access to abortion services, but embedding them deeper in poverty, in racism, in being the most marginalized and least-served in our state.\u201d\nDue to the effect of the combined laws and regulations, Louisiana has gone from having 11 abortion clinics to three since 2001: Hope Clinic in Shreveport, and two other facilities in Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Whether those clinics remain open rests with the Supreme Court.\nA Dangerous TRAP\nIn 2014, Louisiana passed Act 620, also known as the \u201cUnsafe Abortion Protection Act,\u201d a classic TRAP law that requires abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital located within 30 miles of their clinic. Anti-abortion advocates claim it is a necessary means of ensuring that providers are properly credentialed so women received sound medical care.\nIn reality, there is no such need. Doctors are already credentialed and regulated in multiple ways\u2014through their medical licenses, malpractice insurance standards, and the myriad institutions that oversee the medical field\u2014and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the US. \u201cThere is no reason to have this extra layer for abortion providers,\u201d said Rivera. \u201cProviders hardly ever admit people to the hospital because of the safety of the procedure.\u201d In 20 years, Hope Clinic has only transferred four patients to the hospital for emergency services.\nIronically, that rarity is one reason that abortion providers find it hard to obtain admitting privileges, since many hospitals require doctors to prove they\u2019ll admit a certain number of patients each year\u2014something most providers will never be able to do. Hospitals may also deny applications because they are religious institutions or teaching facilities that require staff to have academic credentials. In some states, hospitals have refused to even consider admitting privileges applications from abortion providers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that sounds reasonable on its face but, when you look at the facts, there\u2019s no reason for it,\u201d said Rivera. \u201cIt provides no purpose except to weed out abortion providers from being able to provide services in the state.\u201d\nLouisiana\u2019s Act 620 was modeled on\u2014and is nearly identical to\u2014a law passed in Texas in 2013 that also imposed admitting privilege requirements on abortion providers and led to the closure of nearly half the state\u2019s clinics, declining from 41 to 22 over three years. (This March, Vox noted that both Louisiana\u2019s and Texas\u2019s laws closely resemble a model bill drafted by Americans United for Life.) When CRR first challenged Act 620 in 2014, the US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana granted them a preliminary injunction to block the law, but it was appealed by the Fifth Circuit Court, leaving only one clinic open in the state\u2014Hope Clinic\u2014and only one doctor to provide abortions to the 10,000 people in Louisiana who have the procedure each year.\nA patient arrives at Hope Clinic for her appointment. Hope is one of the last operating abortion clinics in the state\u2014and the center of the Supreme Court case.CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court issued a ruling of its own that should have settled the matter. Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, which struck down the Texas law that inspired Act 620, found that admitting privileges requirements offered no medical benefits and imposed undue burdens on patients\u2019 ability to access services, since many Texans were forced to travel hundreds of miles to find an open clinic.\nWhile other states with admitting privileges requirements stood down after the ruling, Louisiana continued to defend its law, rejecting the precedent set by Whole Woman\u2019s Health. When the Fifth Circuit Court again ruled in Louisiana\u2019s favor and upheld Whole Woman\u2019s Health, CRR asked the Supreme Court to take the case, bringing issues of admitting privileges back to the high court. CRR continued to litigate the case, representing Hope Clinic (under its legal name, June Medical Services) and two of its physicians. Julie Rikelman, CRR\u2019s senior director of litigation, presented oral arguments to the Supreme Court in March, and a decision is expected imminently.\nTo reproductive rights advocates, the Circuit Court\u2019s rejection of such precedent on an identical law was troubling on multiple levels. It was seen as both a slap in the face to SCOTUS precedent and raised concerns that the rule of law was shifting over elections and judicial appointments.\n\u201cThis should have been an easy case,\u201d said the ACLU\u2019s Dalven. \u201cThe lower court should have simply said, \u2018The Supreme Court struck down an identical law four years ago, our job here is done. They didn\u2019t do that. What that means is that even when we have a clear precedent, states are willing to fight every step of the way to shut down clinics and push abortion care out of reach.\u201d\n\u201cThe only difference between June Medical and Whole Woman\u2019s Health is the states involved and the makeup of the Supreme Court,\u201d added the coalition\u2019s Bangel, referencing Trump\u2019s appointment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cThe federal Supreme Court and the independent judiciary is supposed to exist to prevent this exact situation. If we get a different decision than Whole Woman\u2019s Health, it would, to my mind, invalidate the entire reason for the Supreme Court.\u201d\nIn fact, the direct attack on precedent represented by June Medical Services is so acute that it moved even the relatively conservative American Bar Association to write an unprecedented amicus brief in support of CRR\u2019s case, its first-ever brief on an abortion-related case.\nThe hidden consequences of Louisiana\u2019s law\nAn additional element of the case also worries advocates. Louisiana has challenged the legal standing of Hope Clinic and its physicians to file a lawsuit on behalf of patients seeking abortion care. In doing so, Louisiana is trying to defy another very important precedent\u2014this one established nearly 50 years ago at the same time as Roe v. Wade\u2014that says that doctors, because of their close relationship with patients who possess the constitutional right to an abortion, have legal standing to bring lawsuits on their behalf.\nIf SCOTUS rules in favor of Louisiana on this point, it will become far more difficult for abortion rights advocates to litigate abortion rights cases in the future, since each case could require individual patients seeking abortions to be plaintiffs. \u201cThese are people who just want access to their health care when they need it,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking to file a lawsuit\u2014especially over something that has been so vilified and politicized and stigmatized. This is just another strategy to push abortion out of reach by closing the courthouse doors.\u201c\nAbortion rights activists protest during a demonstration outside the Supreme Court in Washington as the court hears oral arguments in the June Medical case about access in Louisiana.Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nThe threat to clinics and abortion access\u2014in Louisiana and beyond\u2014is more immediate. If the Supreme Court upholds Act 620 and admitting privileges stay in place, it will have potentially devastating impacts on abortion access in the state. \u201cYou have to understand that those clinics have never given up attempting to get privileges,\u201d said Hope Clinic\u2019s Pittman. \u201cWe\u2019re talking years and years of trying different tactics to obtain these privileges.\u201d\nHope itself has one part-time physician with admitting privileges and thus might be able to hang on for a time, but Pittman said it would be impossible for that doctor alone to address the state\u2019s need for abortion care.\nIn other words, the ruling could ultimately prevent three of the state\u2019s clinics from keeping their doors open. And clinic closures have a tendency to be permanent. Even after the Whole Woman\u2019s Health verdict in 2016, the number of clinics in Texas never rebounded to the levels before the law was first enacted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like flipping a switch\u201d when clinics shut down, said Rivera, whose CRR was also lead counsel in Whole Woman\u2019s Health. \u201cYou have leases you give up, licenses that expire. You have to let people go, sell your equipment. You can\u2019t just turn everything back on.\u201d\nAn even larger threat is the message the SCOTUS ruling will send to other states. The Guttmacher Institute reported that 15 states have admitting privileges laws already on the books or are likely to quickly adopt them, if the Court upholds Louisiana\u2019s law.\n\u201cIf the Court were to let the Louisiana restriction stand or signal any willingness to weaken the standard, it will only increase the speed and ferocity with which state legislatures pass these kinds of restrictions,\u201d said Dalven. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t even need that kind of urging because, last year, many states passed laws completely banning abortion in the hopes that changes on the Supreme Court signaled a willingness to revisit whether there was any right to abortion.\u201d\n\u201cIf we lose here,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe may well see clinics ultimately being forced to close in many, many states.\u201d\nRoe v. Wade is still the law of the land. At least for now.\nThe stakes are so high that some commentators have suggested that June Medical Services v. Russo could effectively end the constitutional right to an abortion, even if it doesn\u2019t touch Roe v. Wade, by enabling states to over-burden abortion providers to the point that no clinic will be able to afford to operate.\nA further wrinkle, as Vox reported in March, is that Justice Kavanaugh may seek\u2014as he has done in the past\u2014to limit any win to be as narrow as possible. For instance, limiting any block of the law such \u201cthat an individual patient challenging an abortion restriction would only be able to secure a court order allowing them and them alone to obtain an abortion.\u201d That possibility, combined with a ruling on Louisiana\u2019s \u201cstanding\u201d challenge\u2014that only people seeking abortions can legally challenge anti-abortion laws\u2014would lead to \u201ca world where the only way to overcome an unconstitutional abortion restriction would be to find a lawyer, file a lawsuit, obtain a court order, receive the abortion, and do all of this before the pregnancy became so advanced that it was no longer legal to terminate it.\u201d Vox continued, \u201cAs a practical matter, this world looks virtually identical to one where Roe was explicitly overruled.\u201d\nUS Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh arrives to testify before his appointment to the Supreme Court in 2019.ERIN SCHAFF/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nEffectively gutting abortion rights through indirect means, rather than by overturning Roe explicitly, might appeal to a conservative Supreme Court seeking to curtain abortion access without sparking public outrage.\n\u201cWe are already seeing states go down to very few clinics and, in June Medical, that case could be lost without the Supreme Court having to say, \u2018We overturn Roe v. Wade,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Dalven. \u201cThere\u2019s a concern that people might not understand it as dire as if you\u2019ve got a headline that says, \u2018Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\u2019 But the effect will be exactly the same for many, many people as if they said there\u2019s no right at all.\u201d\n\u201cWith these TRAP laws chipping away at access, what good is Roe if you can\u2019t get to or into a clinic?\u201d added Pittman. \u201cA woman\u2019s rights shouldn\u2019t be determined by her zip code.\u201d\n\u201cWe will not go silently.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s verdict in June Medical is expected any day now, and advocates are bracing for what might come next. \u201cIf the outcome is not what we expect or hope for, know that we will continue to fight like we always have,\u201d said WWAV\u2019s Harris, who was present in Washington for the oral arguments. \u201cWe will not go silently. It\u2019s a moment in history where people get to look at the promise of America and what injustice looks like, and these things aren\u2019t happening in a vacuum. When we\u2019re talking about Black Lives Matter, that means people get a say over what goes on with their body, wholly.\u201d\nEven if the Court strikes down Act 620 and keeps with their recent precedent, Dalven said, abortion rights advocates shouldn\u2019t rest easy. \u201cEven if we win, we can\u2019t let down our guard, because this will not take the wind out of our opponents\u2019 sails. They will continue to push to make it harder and harder for people to get abortion care. And we should use the experience of what we saw during the COVID crisis. We can expect to see that more and more if we don\u2019t keep up the fight.\u201d\nLourdes Rivera, senior vice president of our grantee Center for Reproductive Rights, speaks during a press conference on the reintroduction of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act in Washington, DC.MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOne of the next battles in Louisiana is already clear: a ballot measure, authored by the same legislator who introduced Act 620, that would restrict courts from ever interpreting the state constitution as protecting abortion rights. And in a clear demonstration of how anti-abortion legislation spreads from state to state, the coalition\u2019s Bangel noted, this measure is identical to one passed in West Virginia two years ago.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re calling for is a shift in the winds here,\u201d Bangel said. \u201cWe need to see a pro-choice access policy platform, and we need to see that everywhere. It\u2019s not enough that Illinois, New York, Massachusetts and California are rolling back restrictive, outdated laws and enshrining access to care, because that\u2019s just four out of 50 states. In a state like Louisiana, look at who we share borders with. If abortion becomes illegal here, people might have to travel 10 hours just to get care.\u201d\nThe experience of the pandemic and the extreme measures that abortion opponents took to support their agenda is just more evidence to abortion rights advocates for the vital need to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a federal bill that would prohibit states from treating abortion providers differently from comparable healthcare services, stopping many TRAP laws in their tracks. The bill\u2014modeled on the Voting Rights Act, said Rivera, in recognition of how states today are similarly refusing to uphold federally recognized constitutional rights\u2014would give litigants a separate statutory basis to defend abortion rights in court besides the constitution or Roe v. Wade.\nAt present, the bill has majority backing in the House, but only 43 co-sponsors in the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build momentum so that, when the stars align, we\u2019re not starting from scratch, and it could be adopted as quickly as possible,\u201d said Rivera. \u201cFrankly, we\u2019re thinking about strategies that start now and that won\u2019t bear fruit until after I retire.\u201d\nThere have been bright spots, like proactive laws in Virginia to remove unnecessary restrictions on abortion providers that CRR had been fighting in court\u2014which would have been unheard of just a few years ago. \u201cIn my 30 or so years,\u201d said Rivera, \u201cI have seen the legal landscape get worse, but the cultural landscape is shifting to our side, and cultural change, I think, precedes legal change.\u201d\nAJ Haynes, a patient advocate at Hope Clinic, now gives patients an information sheet compiled by Lift Louisiana listing the state politicians who have tried to shut the clinic down, and asks the patients to call them as constituents.\n\u201cI understand that it\u2019s difficult to ask the people immediately impacted to advocate for themselves,\u201d said Haynes, \u201cbut who else is going to do it? We need to name who is doing this, and they need to be held accountable by the constituents.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m committed to this work,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m committed to celebrating bodily autonomy. I don\u2019t know what that looks like post this decision, but I don\u2019t think that people are going to give up. You can\u2019t give up when your body is on the line. I\u2019m on the line. I don\u2019t have an option not to fight.\u201d\n\n\n\nStay Connected\n\n\nGet the latest Ford Foundation news, stories and announcements in your inbox\n\n\nEmail Address *\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name *\n\n\n\n\nLast Name *\n\n\n\n\nCountry *\n\nUnited StatesAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua And BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAshmore and CartierAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahrainBaker IslandBangladeshBarbadosBassas da IndiaBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBritish Virgin IslandsBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurmaBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandClipperton IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCoral Sea IslandsCosta RicaCote D\u2019IvoireCroatiaCubaCura\u00e7aoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEast TimorEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatiniEthiopiaEuropa IslandFalkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern and Antarctic LandsFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGaza StripGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGlorioso IslandsGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City)HondurasHong Kong (SAR)Howland IslandHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsraelItalyJamaicaJan MayenJapanJarvis IslandJerseyJohnston AtollJordanJuan de Nova IslandKazakhstanKenyaKingman ReefKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMan, Isle ofMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNetherlands AntillesNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalestinePalestinian Territory, OccupiedPalmyra AtollPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPitcairn IslandsPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint Barth\u00e9lemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSpratly IslandsSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandThe BahamasThe GambiaTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTromelin IslandTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin IslandsWake IslandWallis and FutunaWest BankWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nCareers\nPress Room\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Policy\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\nAll our content may be republished or reused for free, except for most photographs, illustrations, and videos.\u00a92024 Ford Foundation, some rights reserved.\n\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nThreads\nInstagram\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
