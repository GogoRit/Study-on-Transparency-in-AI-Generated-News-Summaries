In this study, we used Turnaway Study data and examined participants\u2019 credit history three years before they became pregnant and five years after to determine the impact of being denied a wanted abortion.\nWe compared the credit histories two groups \u2013 people who were near gestational limit, but received an abortion and people who were past gestational limit and were denied abortion. We included women who were denied abortion regardless of whether they carried the pregnancy to term or got an abortion elsewhere (most carried to term).\nWe found that, in the years before seeking abortion, credit ratings for both groups were similar. However, the group that was denied abortion had a 78% increase in having debt that was 30 days or more past due and their chances of having negative public records, such as bankruptcies and evictions, increased by 81%. They were also less likely to have a credit score in the prime range (680 \u2013 739) and negative financial effects could be seen for up to five years after the birth year.\nThese results, coupled with our previous Turnaway Study findings based on women\u2019s self-reports of the socioeconomic consequences of being denied a wanted abortion, lead us to conclude that abortion restrictions have large and persistent financial and economic consequences for people who were denied abortion. We also conclude that being able to control the timing of when to give birth increases the chances of achieving financial stability.\nFor more on this study, read \u201cThe Economic Consequences of Being Denied an Abortion\u201d from the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Research\nAbortionDenial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\nSee all\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2020\nThe Economic Consequences of Being Denied an Abortion\n\n\n\n\nGet citation\n\n\nMiller S, Wherry LR, Foster DG.
