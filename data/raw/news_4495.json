A nominee for Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court should be evaluated in terms of their likely impact on access to justice for critical human rights guarantees, including the rights to life, due process, free expression, privacy, health, freedom from arbitrary detention, and freedom from discrimination.\nThe following areas of Supreme Court decision-making\u2013voting rights, the right to health, the right to reproductive freedom, and the interaction between religious freedom and other rights\u2013are only some of the domains in which Justice Ginsburg\u2019s replacement could either help to protect or weaken basic rights, with particularly significant impacts on people of color, women and girls, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. The stakes of the decision before US elected officials are tremendous. We urge senators to thoroughly review any nominee\u2019s record on these and other issues and to question a nominee closely about key rights protections that hinge on the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\nVoting Rights\nThe 15th and 19th Amendments to the US Constitution recognize the rights of all citizens to vote without discrimination. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party, provides that \u201cevery citizen shall have the right and opportunity\u201d without discrimination or \u201cunreasonable restrictions\u201d to \u201cvote and be elected at genuine periodic elections \u2026 guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors.\u201d\nOver Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent, the Supreme Court has already eviscerated federal oversight under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, enabling states to impose discriminatory restrictions on the right to vote. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated these problems and the Supreme Court has already ruled to restrict voting rights, including by rejecting attempts by states in several cases to adapt voting procedures to the pandemic. With new legislation to restore federal oversight over voting pending in Congress, a new justice could play a pivotal role in either erecting new barriers or upholding the right to vote without discrimination.\nRight to Health\nThe right to health under international human rights law does not guarantee a right to be healthy, but obligates governments\u00a0to enact policies promoting available and affordable basic health services without discrimination. Governments should take particular care to ensure access to those most likely to face obstacles\u2013people living in poverty, racial and ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, women, and children, among others.\u00a0\nAs the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid, and reproductive health care rights continue to be the subject of litigation in both federal and state courts, the Supreme Court is likely to act as the final arbiter on the constitutionality and permissibility of these programs. These decisions will have profound and far-reaching rights impact, at a time when the number of uninsured is already increasing. They will potentially determine whether millions of people in the United States will have access to health care during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.\nRights to Reproductive Freedom\nEveryone should be able to exercise their reproductive rights and maintain their health, privacy, and dignity. In a series of cases over the last five decades, the Supreme Court has taken important steps to protect women\u2019s health and human rights, including their freedom to access contraceptive care and abortion services. Recently, though, the court has shown it is willing to curtail those rights. Justice Ginsburg\u2019s replacement will be poised to protect or undo jurisprudence ensuring women\u2019s access to abortion.\nA new justice could eliminate constitutional protections for women\u2019s right to access abortion by upholding excessive regulation of abortion providers or by abandoning the Roe v. Wade line of precedent and instead leaving it to individual states to determine access to legal abortion. If that happens, many states might criminalize abortion. At least four states already have \u201ctrigger laws\u201d\u00a0on the books that automatically outlaw abortion if Roe is overturned, and dozens of others have laws that put access to abortion at high risk.\nEven without fully overturning\u00a0Roe, a decision that narrows the court\u2019s understanding of what kinds of restrictions or regulations present an undue burden on a person seeking an abortion, or one that redefines the test for analyzing the constitutionality of abortion regulations, could severely curtail reproductive rights in the United States.\nLGBT Rights\nSexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of our being and should never lead to discrimination or abuse. International human rights law protects the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) to privacy, nondiscrimination, and equal protection of the law. While a recent 6-3 Supreme Court ruling banning employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity should remain settled law, other issues that are likely to come before the court will also be highly consequential for LGBT people. The court is likely to be confronted with efforts to limit the scope of or reverse landmark decisions protecting the rights of LGBT people, such as Obergefell v. Hodges,\u00a0which established that same-sex couples enjoy the same marriage rights as different-sex couples. Even if this decision were not overturned altogether, a new justice may be considering challenges aimed at allowing states to discriminate against same-sex married couples.\nEnsuring Religious Freedom Without Undermining Other Rights\nFreedom of religion is protected under international human rights law as well as the US Constitution. While a government can craft accommodations for religious objectors, they should ensure that these are carefully constructed so that they do not come at the expense of the equality or dignity of others.\nThe next justice will most likely weigh in on whether an employer\u2019s religious liberty permits them to refuse contraceptive coverage to their employees. Under the Affordable Care Act, Congress delegated the authority to define the scope of reproductive health services to Department of Health and Human Services experts. A 2011 recommendation included all Federal Drug Administration-approved contraceptives, sterilization, and education and counselling as part of preventive health services.\nBut in a line of cases, including Hobby Lobby v. Burwell (2014) and Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania (2020), the court has permitted employers to raise conscience-based objections to the contraceptive mandate. In Ginsburg\u2019s dissent to the 2020 Little Sisters ruling, she stated, \u201cToday, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree.\u201d Continued litigation on this issue is expected, as the question whether the expansion of the refusal exemption is reasonable has been returned to lower courts.\nThe new justice will also be central to deciding cases involving efforts to seek religious exemptions from laws that protect the rights of LGBT people and reproductive rights. International human rights law recognizes the importance of the rights to freedom of conscience and religion, but also elaborates their limits, particularly where their exercise threatens to negatively impact the fundamental rights of others.\nIn recent years, litigants have sought to use the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the US Constitution\u2019s free exercise of religion clause to challenge laws requiring government officials to register the marriages of same-sex couples and laws prohibiting discrimination in education, employment, housing, health care, and public accommodations.\u00a0In 2018, the Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling in\u00a0Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, sidestepping the larger questions. The court is set to consider the issue this fall in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, a case involving a religious foster care agency that argues that it has a right to receive state contracts and support even if it will not comply with the city\u2019s nondiscrimination requirements.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States Racial Justice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nCoronavirus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nFree Speech Religious Freedom Health Health Care Access Sexual and Reproductive Health LGBT Rights Women's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 18, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nMourning the Death of Feminist Icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2020\n\n          Blog\n        \n\n\nUS Supreme Court Rules to Uphold Abortion Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nWhat Democracy Looks Like\n\n\nProtecting Voting Rights in the US during the Covid-19 Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cIt Wasn\u2019t Really Safety, It Was Shame\u201d \n\n\nYoung People, Sexual Health Education, and HPV in Alabama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 18, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nMourning the Death of Feminist Icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2020\n\n          Blog\n        \n\n\nUS Supreme Court Rules to Uphold Abortion Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
