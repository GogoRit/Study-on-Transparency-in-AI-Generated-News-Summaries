The procedure is available for free in the first 90 days of pregnancy, with a seven day waiting period (after the first trimester, abortions are only permitted if the mother\u2019s health is at risk or if the fetus has abnormalities).But in reality, accessing abortion is increasingly difficult in a majority Catholic country, with high numbers of medical staff refusing to carry out abortions.According to a 2020 Ministry of Health survey, 64.6% of Italy\u2019s gynaecologists are conscientious objectors to abortion, a figure that soars to over 90% in parts of the south.1 In some regions, such as Molise in southern Italy, this can result in just a handful of doctors who are willing to carry out the procedure.\u201cFinding doctors to perform [abortion] can be a minefield, since there are no official lists disclosing professionals or hospitals which do or do not offer the interruption of pregnancy, while services vary wildly across the country,\u201d says Silvia de Zordo, of the University of Barcelona and principal investigator of the Europe Abortion Access project, which is backed by the European Research Council.Many of Italy\u2019s most prestigious medical schools and hospitals are run by the Catholic Church. Those who perform abortions face stigma, and objection is often connected with a healthcare professional\u2019s career prospects. \u201cQuite often doctors feel professionally isolated \u2026 View Full Text \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Log in    \n\nLog in using your username and password\nBMA Member Log In\n\nIf you have a subscription to The BMJ, log in:\n\n\n\nUsername *\n\n\n\nPassword *\n\n\n\n\nForgot your log in details? \n\n \n \n\n\nNeed to activate \n\n\nLog in via institution\nLog in via OpenAthens\n\n\nLog in through your institution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe from \u00a3173 *\nSubscribe and get access to all BMJ articles, and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe* For online subscription \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess this article for 1 day for:\u00a338 / $45 / \u20ac42 (excludes VAT)\nYou can download a PDF version for your personal record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy this article  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet Widget\nFacebook Like\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Article tools    \n\nPDF0 responses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespond to this article\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint \n\n\n\n\nAlerts & updatesArticle alertsPlease note: your email address is provided to the journal, which may use this information for marketing purposes.\n\n\n\nLog in or register:\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername *\n\n\n\nPassword *\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRegister for alerts\n If you have registered for alerts, you should use your registered email address as your username\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCitation toolsDownload this article to citation manager\n\n\n\n\n\nMarta Paterlini freelance journalist\n\n\nPaterlini M. \n\nThe Italian law enabling, and disabling, abortion access\nBMJ  2022;  379 :o2563 \ndoi:10.1136/bmj.o2563\n\n \n\n\nBibTeX (win & mac)Download\nEndNote (tagged)Download\nEndNote 8 (xml)Download\nRefWorks Tagged (win & mac)Download\nRIS (win only)Download\nMedlarsDownload\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Help    \n\n\n\n\nIf you are unable to import citations, please contact\n  technical support for your product directly (links go to external sites):\n\nEndNote\nProCite\nReference\n    Manager\nRefWorks\nZotero\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRequest permissions \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor citationArticles by Marta Paterlini\nAdd article to BMJ Portfolio\n \n\n\n\nEmail to a friendForward this page\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in spreading the word about The BMJ.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.
