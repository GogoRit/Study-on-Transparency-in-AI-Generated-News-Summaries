[Adek Berry/AFP]Published On 8 Mar 20208 Mar 2020facebooktwitterwhatsappcopylinkInternational Women\u2019s Day\u00a0\u2013 marked annually on March 8 \u2013 is a global event to celebrate and support\u00a0women\u2019s rights,\u00a0while calling for more\u00a0gender equality.\nThe first observance of Women\u2019s Day on a national level took place in New York on February 28, 1909. It was marked on March 8 in several European countries in 1914 in support of women\u2019s right to vote.\nThe first country to make the day an official holiday was the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1965.\nBut it became a truly global event when the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0in 1975 began marking March 8 as International Women\u2019s Day, which is now an official holiday in 27 countries.\nOver the last 100 years, women in many countries secured labour rights and protection from violence, access to sexual and reproductive health, and political rights to reach the highest positions of leadership.\nHowever, the original goal of achieving full global gender equality is still a long way off.\nPakistani activists observe International Women's Day at a rally in Islamabad.
