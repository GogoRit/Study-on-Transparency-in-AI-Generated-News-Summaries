She has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s right to choose and led a successful campaign last year to extend abortion to Northern Ireland.Hacking, 29, from nearby Hackney, said the display of the bloody image was part of a \u201cStopStella\u201d event last October. At a two-day hearing in February, he argued that the community protection notice ban imposed by Waltham Forest borough council was illegal.He urged the court to reconsider the matter on human rights grounds, comparing the emotional impact of the display to that of images of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body was pictured in news stories around the world highlighting the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015.Hacking told the hearing \u201cThe whole business of what we do is exposing the reality of abortion to members of the public who don\u2019t know what abortion looks like. Generally speaking, we know that the public are misinformed by what abortion procedures entail.\u201dHacking, from the campaign group Centre for Bio-ethical Reform UK, said the 10ft x 10ft (3-metre x 3-metre) poster was designed to educate the public about abortion.At Thames magistrates court on Wednesday, the district judge Jonathan Radway dismissed the appeal during a two-minute hearing.In his written decision, he said: \u201cI find a prolonged static display, intended to last a couple of hours in the busy middle of the day, unavoidable to those entering the town square, of a deeply disturbing image which caused harm to some observers, is beyond the margin of what freedom of expression requires, even for political speech.\u201cWas the CPN a proportionate response to the situation? After anxious consideration, I have concluded it was.\u201dRadway said his ruling was \u201cnot about the rights and wrongs of abortion\u201d.Creasy has previously told MPs how she felt \u201charassed\u201d by the campaign and sought police assistance.During the February hearing, one local resident told the court she felt \u201ctruly sick in her stomach\u201d on seeing the image, and had \u201cbeen left feeling anxious and nervous when approaching the location in town\u201d.Neither Hacking nor Creasy was present in court for the hearing on Wednesday.Hacking and his supporters said they would appeal against the judgment.Andrea Williams, the chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting the case, said: \u201cThe ruling hinges on the idea that this image, showing the tragic reality of abortion, causes significant and lasting emotional harm.\u201cBut however uncomfortable the truth, we must be free to make these distressing realities known, or the vastly more horrific truth of abortion becomes immune to criticism.\u201cThere is a high bar to restricting free speech. Freedom of speech must include, and has been ruled in law to include, that which is shocking, provocative and offensive. Political campaigns are often shocking and disturbing.\u201dHacking said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that our appeal to show the reality of abortion to the people of Waltham Forest has not been successful. The real victim of abortion is not MP Stella Creasy, or those negatively impacted by its visualisation, but the unborn child.\u201cHow can we see positive change in the UK if politicians and councils are allowed to dictate how we express peaceable opinions in public? For the sake of the unborn and for freedom of speech, we must take this appeal further and hold those authorities to account.\u201dClare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said: \u201cWe are glad that the court has agreed that our actions to protect residents of Waltham Forest against gratuitously offensive imagery being displayed in Walthamstow town centre were proportionate. We acted after receiving numerous complaints from members of the public about these images.\u201cWe fundamentally believe in free speech and the right to protest. However, we also believe that those who live, work, and study in the borough have the right to use their town centre without being aggressively confronted with deliberately provocative material.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionLondonStella CreasyFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
