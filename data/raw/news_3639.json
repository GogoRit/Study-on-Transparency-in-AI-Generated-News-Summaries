Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a slate of reproductive health care bills on Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2022, running the gamut from increasing access to birth control to ensuring protections for women who seek lawful abortion services in California. (File photo by Shelley Heffler).\n\t\t\n\nBy Tak AllenPUBLISHED: October 31, 2022 at 10:56 a.m. | UPDATED: October 31, 2022 at 10:57 a.m.California\u2019s abortion laws are not in jeopardy and Proposition 1 is not only unnecessary \u2014 it is recklessly ambiguous, extreme and expensive. The debate over Proposition 1 is about whether our tax dollars should be going to pay for an extreme late-term abortion procedure, including for non-residents coming to California. That is why I, as a pro-choice California leader, am voting no on Proposition 1.\nWhen you vote no on Proposition 1, abortion rights and laws in the California will remain the same, despite attempts by the Yes campaign to portray it otherwise. Proposition 1 is a widely unnecessary proposal that would legalize abortion up to a point most Californians \u2014 myself included \u2014\u00a0 do not want.\nCurrent California law restricts abortion up until the 24-week mark, with exceptions. Proponents of Prop. 1 have been dodging the question as to when the new abortion limit would be \u2014 but one of the authors openly admitted it out loud in an interview: they left out viability language on purpose.\nThis means, by design, abortions would be legal even after a child is able to live on his or her own outside the mother\u2019s womb. Unnecessary abortions for women who are seven, eight, even nine months pregnant can be dangerous to their health and compromise their future fertility.\u00a0 While I support abortion rights, Prop 1 goes too far.\nIt is for that very reason that the No on Prop. 1 Coalition has grown to include many diverse organizations on both sides of the abortion issue \u2014 many being pro-life, and many others being pro-choice. It\u2019s a rare time in this modern political environment that pro-lifers and pro-choicers are working together. At our recent news conference on the steps of the state Capitol, leaders who ranged from Catholic to atheist to evangelical to Muslim took to the microphone to share why Proposition 1 is too extreme. I represented the International Faith Based Coalition \u2014 which comprises both pro-lifers and pro-choicers \u2014 and expressed the same concerns I lay out for you today.\nAs a Black woman, and as a Black woman who is currently pregnant, I am seriously troubled about the impact Proposition 1 could have on California\u2019s health systems. The United States holds one of the highest maternal morbidity rates in the world, with rates for Black women at 2.5 times the national average. This is before we overrun state health systems with unlimited passes for neighboring states to join as they see fit to utilize California abortion services and laws. And this is before we further exacerbate our health system and our quickly-depleting healthcare worker pool. \n\n\nRelated Articles\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tTrump\u2019s \u2018bloodbath\u2019 comment wrongly taken out of context\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tGov.

By contributing to a surge of people coming from out-of-state to seek an abortion, Proposition 1 could actually jeopardize women\u2019s reproductive health in California.\nProposition 1 threatens both sides of the abortion aisle with its reckless ambiguity, allowing unprecedented interpretation into the hands of judges, who may or may not support abortions laws in California. This means there is a large possibility, as people come to challenge this language, that abortion laws could be stripped in this state, or dangerously applied beyond what the state has already deemed a sweet spot for abortion rights. \n\n\nBoth pro-lifers and pro-choicers should be concerned and vote no on Proposition 1.\nTak Allen serves as president of the International Faith Based Coalition.
