(photo: Courtesy photo)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nInterviews\nNovember 26, 2020\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A record-breaking number of 17 pro-life women \u2014 nine of whom won against pro-abortion Democrats \u2014 were newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives this election cycle. That brings the total number of pro-life women in the House to 28, another record with the outcome of two races still pending.\u00a0\nThe Register spoke with two of these women, Rep.-Elect Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., who defeated 15-term incumbent Democrat Rep. Collin Peterson in Minnesota\u2019s seventh congressional district, and Rep. -Elect Lisa McClain, R-Mich., who unseated Democrat Kimberly Bizon to fill the seat of Republican Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan\u2019s 10th congressional district.\nFischbach, who spoke on the phone with the Register Monday, is no stranger to breaking records. Prior to serving as the 49th lieutenant governor of Minnesota, she was the first female president of the Minnesota Senate. She is a graduate of Saint Cloud State University in Saint Cloud, Minn., and earned her law degree from the William Mitchell School of Law in St. Paul. She is a wife and mother of two and grandmother of five.\u00a0\nMcClain, who spoke with the Register via email, is also a trailblazer, running for office as an outsider with a background as a successful businesswoman. She is a graduate of Northwood University and worked for American Express for 11 years before working to co-found the financial advising group, Hantz Financial. She is a wife and mother to four children and a philanthropist who has raisedmore than $1 million for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth women are Catholics, and they told the Register about how their faith has informed their pro-life views. McClain commented that she has \u201cprayed about this issue\u201d and said that \u201cthe Lord has gifted an individual with life, and no one else has the right to take that away from someone that hasn't developed a voice themselves.\u201d\u00a0\nFischbach said that, for her, the right to life \u201cis something that runs deep, deep in our family and in our beliefs and it\u2019s one of those core issues that means so much that when first and foremost you respect the right to life, a lot of other things fall in place.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Outlook in the House\u00a0\nThe incoming group of GOP Congresswomen have an uphill battle ahead of them in a Democratic-controlled House where Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has signaled that she will move to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding bipartisan ban on taxpayer funding of abortion. Presumptive President-elect Joe Biden has also come out in opposition to the amendment, changing his stance on the issue in 2019 on the campaign trail, and Senate control hinges on two Georgia special elections in January.\nWhile Democrats still control the House, they hold the thinnest majority in decades, with a lead of less than a dozen seats, and the results in several close races pending. As The New York Times pointed out, \u201cDemocrats are likely to control around 222 seats, effectively allowing no more than a few of their members to defect on any given vote.\u201d Republicans are also looking at a possible House majority in 2022 given that midterm elections historically favor the party that is not in the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nFischbach commented that \u201cone of the things that is going to be very important is protecting the Hyde Amendment so that we\u2019re not using federal tax dollars to pay for abortions. \u2026 That\u2019s going to be something we\u2019re going to be working very hard to protect.\u201d She added that, in general, \u201csome of our fights in the near future are going to be more defense than offense.\u201d\nMcClain said she was looking forward to \u201cworking with my fellow members in Congress supporting any pro-life legislation possible.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe need to defund Planned Parenthood and ensure that no federal dollars are going to any organization or entity conducting abortions,\u201d she added.\n\u00a0\nReaching Hearts and Minds\nWhile the degree of leverage pro-life Republicans will have in the incoming Congress is still being determined, McClain and Fischbach discussed how to change hearts and minds on the abortion issue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMcClain pointed out that \u201cthe pro-abortion crowd has made this an issue about emotion and not facts that life begins at conception,\u201d and said that \u201chearing from individuals directly impacted by abortion is very valuable to changing hearts and minds.\u201d\u00a0\nFischbach saw education as key to \u201cmaking sure that people understand that human life begins at conception,\u201d adding that with \u201cadvancements in science and the ultrasounds, you can see the baby\u2019s face.\u201d She also said that the promotion of crisis pregnancy centers is an important part of the pro-life message as she comes across the accusation that pro-lifers \u201conly care about unborn children.\u201d But in crisis pregnancy centers, she said, \u201cwe are helping the mother, we are helping the child, we are helping on into several years of education and assistance for the mother as she raises the child.\u201d\nIn an election year that some are calling\u201cthe year of the Republican woman,\u201d the two freshman congresswomen discussed the distinct power the diverse group of pro-life women could bring to the pro-life issue.\u00a0\nMcClain called women\u2019s voices \u201ccritical in this realm\u201d because \u201cit contradicts the pro-abortion crowd\u2019s only talking point. They believe women should have the right to \u2018choose\u2019 but when you hear women talking about this not being a choice for themselves, it mutes their argument.\u201d \u00a0She said that \u201cthis is not a women's issue, this is an issue about life, and how the Lord has blessed an individual with life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFischbach met many of her fellow congresswomen-elect last week, and called them \u201ca stellar group of strong pro-life women who really can talk about the issue.\u201d She appreciated that \u201cthere\u2019s a variety of ages too, I have grandchildren and there\u2019s women with children at home but I think the importance of that is that they\u2019re talking from a voice of experience,\u201d as many of them \u201chave the experience of holding that newborn child in their arms and understanding how just overwhelming it is to see that child for the first time and how it didn\u2019t just turn into a baby instantly.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMuch of the time we\u2019re told that it\u2019s old, white men and these are a great, diverse group of pro-life women,\u201d Fischbach added. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be really important as we move this issue forward.\u201d She is also hopeful that they \u201ccan empower a whole lot of other pro-life women to speak out.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nhouse of representatives\npro-life\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS House Passes Resolution Condemning Attacks on Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers and Churches\n\nThe measure passed Jan. 11 by a vote of 222-209, with just three of the 209 House Democrats joining all 219 House Republicans.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Advances Ratification Efforts for the Equal Rights Amendment\n\nThe U.S. bishops\u2019 conference (USCCB) has opposed the measure, arguing it could be interpreted to allow taxpayer-funded of abortion and overturn abortion restrictions.\n\n\nCNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Pain-Capable\u2019 20-Week Abortion Ban Introduced in the House\n\nJoining Rep.
