Can they make it work?By  Janay KingsberryJuly 31, 2022 at 8:00 a.m. EDT(Illustrations by Daryn Ray for The Washington Post)Listen9 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveMiranda Dockett felt certain she was about to lose another friend.After all, she had been watching them fall away over the past few months, as she became more vocal about her views against abortion. Then, in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last month, Dockett, 31, readied herself for a worrisome confrontation with her childhood best friend.The exchange lasted hours, she said, as the pair traded messages and news articles on Facebook days after the ruling. Dockett, a stay-at-home mom in Lansing, Mich., wanted her friend to understand that she believes life begins at conception and should be protected. Meanwhile her friend, who declined to be interviewed for this story, argued that abortion bans infringe on women\u2019s right to health care and bodily autonomy.Advertisement\u201cI suspect this will be the end of our friendship,\u201d Dockett wrote in a Twitter thread recapping the conversation. \u201cHeartbroken BUT it took me forever to find my voice & I will not be silenced even if that means losing every friend I have/had.\u201dThey don\u2019t agree on abortion. Can their relationship survive post-Roe?Dockett\u2019s story echoes a similar cry across social media as the post-Roe era continues to takes shape. With \u201ctrigger bans\u201d now in effect in 13 states and organizers mobilizing on both sides of the abortion debate, friends are inevitably wading into the conversation \u2014 and some are learning that they don\u2019t see eye to eye on the issue.\u201cThe fact that abortion is so much in the news right now kind of forces people to think about it,\u201d said Julie Chor, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Chicago. \u201cSo I do think that more of these discussions are happening in the public setting.\u201dLike Dockett, many people are reporting how those conversations went. For some, it has deepened their bond as they confide in each other about their own experiences. For others, it\u2019s creating new rifts as they contemplate whether their friendship has what it takes to withstand their opposing views.AdvertisementFor instance, one user on Twitter recently considered how to part ways with a friend of more than 20 years. \u201cHe\u2019s pro-life, I\u2019m pro-choice and since the Roe v. Wade decision I\u2019ve been unable to even talk to them,\u201d they wrote. \u201cI just want to vomit.\u201dIt didn\u2019t come to that for Dockett and her friend, she said. A day or two after their exchange, they returned to their usual banter. \u201cShe kind of like moved on, and it was much lighter conversation,\u201d Dockett said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to continue talking about it because we both said what we needed to say.\u201d\u201cI suspect this will be the end of our friendship.\u201d\u2014 Miranda DockettLast year, the Survey Center on American Life, a project of the think tank American Enterprise Institute, found that 45 percent of Americans discuss politics with their friends at least a few times a month. And although political disagreements are common, the study found that 15 percent of people said they ended a friendship over politics.\u201cWhile friendships can buckle under these differences, friendships can also truly spur changes,\u201d said Marisa G. Franco, a psychologist, author and friendship expert. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because we care about people. We see how it\u2019s affecting them. We humanize the issue.\u201dOthers on Twitter shared similar sentiments. \u201cPersonally I\u2019m not a fan of abortion,\u201d one person tweeted, \u201cbut if my best friend needs me to hold her hand when she gets one. I will be there to hold it.\u201dThese famous women were friends? Read 5 stories of sisterhood and support.In states that have enacted abortion bans, the American Psychological Association notes that some people might feel more compelled to disclose an unplanned pregnancy to loved ones to solicit help in securing access to an abortion. But such legislation could also inhibit these discussions.\u201cThe people who are now in this crossroad and don\u2019t know where to turn to in terms of care are feeling a lot of fear around who can they talk to,\u201d said reproductive psychologist Julie Bindeman, citing Texas\u2019s ban, which empowers private citizens to bring suit against providers or anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t create spaces where talking to people about abortion care or health care choices feel safe.\u201dFor a long time, Rachel Stevens had hoped her best friend would reconsider her stance against abortion. Eight years ago, when Stevens sought to terminate a pregnancy, her friend said she would never speak to her again.\u201cHe\u2019s pro-life, I\u2019m pro-choice and since the Roe v. Wade decision I\u2019ve been unable to even talk to them.\u201d\u2014 Twitter userThat threat didn\u2019t hold up, said Stevens, now 35. But something shifted in their friendship for good after the Supreme Court ruling.\u201cWith Roe being overturned, I tried to speak with her about it as she has three young daughters herself, and this will most definitely impact their future,\u201d said Stevens, a server in Nashville. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s something that she should be concerned about and aware of.\u201dBut her attempts to talk about the issue fell on deaf ears, she said: Her friend showed little interest in engaging in the conversation. \u201cIt really sealed the deal in walking away from that friendship once and for all,\u201d Stevens said.When it comes to fraught topics like abortion, it\u2019s not just opposing views that can drive a wedge between friendships.AdvertisementLately, Mela Horr, a Houston-based college student, has been feeling particularly isolated from their friend group. One late night in June, they unpacked those feelings in a short Twitter thread. \u201cIt\u2019s that time of year again where I realize my friends will never actually be able to understand my gender identity,\u201d the tweet began.Share this articleShareAs a nonbinary person, Horr, 23, said it\u2019s been challenging to talk to their friends, a group of mostly cisgender heterosexual men, about abortion and how new restrictions could disproportionately affect the transgender community.\u201cAt the end of the day, because it doesn\u2019t directly affect them, it\u2019s not something that they\u2019re ever going to fully understand the full ramifications of,\u201d they said.Transgender advocates say the end of Roe would have dire consequencesFor Horr, like many others, the coronavirus pandemic uprooted their social life. Classes went online and the communities they had previously found solace in \u2014 a group of local Filipino artists and a queer organization on campus \u2014 fell away.\u201cI felt very strongly rooted in where I was,\u201d Horr said of their life before covid. \u201cAnd I was still trying to discover who I was, but at least I kind of felt like the people I was around kind of reflected parts of me.\u201dRen\u00e9e Mannino, 23, found that support years ago at New York City\u2019s Pride Parade, where she sparked a friendship with Emma Beckerman back when the pair were still in high school. They traveled to the city with a group of mutual friends, Mannino said, \u201cand we clicked so well that that same night we had a sleepover.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that time of year again where I realize my friends will never actually be able to understand my gender identity.\u201d\u2014 Mela HorrYears later, after Mannino had an abortion, Beckerman was one of the first people she told. \u201cIt was so nice because she had, like, no reaction,\u201d said Mannino, who works as a nanny in Flemington, N.J. \u201cShe was just very comforting when I told her \u2026 it was just a regular conversation.\u201dAmong the abortion stories that have flooded social media in recent months, Mannino said she\u2019s noticing a dominant narrative: decisions to terminate a pregnancy due to health risks, traumatic experiences or to escape a toxic or abusive relationship.But Mannino has seen fewer stories that reflect her reason for getting an abortion three years ago: \u201cI do not want to bear kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to carry a child.\u201dThen, after Roe was overturned, Beckerman reached out with the reassurance Mannino needed. Not wanting to be a mom is enough of a reason to get an abortion, Beckerman texted her: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go thru [something] traumatic to deserve the right to choose.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re such a great friend,\u201d Mannino texted back.Beckerman, 22, said she had been thinking about how Mannino might be feeling in the aftermath of Roe.\u201cI bet that I know more women [who have had an abortion], but Ren\u00e9e is the only person who has opened up to me about that experience,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just felt like something that was appropriate to say and that I would want someone to say to me.\u201dAdvertisementFew studies examine the private conversations people have about abortion decisions with their loved ones. But a small study published in 2019 offers some insight.\u201cWhat we found was that most people did talk to a friend or family member or a partner,\u201d said Chor, the University of Chicago professor and one of the authors of the study. \u201cAnd most people described having some positive experiences in those discussions.\u201dExperts echo the importance of such conversations \u2014 and have some tips on how to navigate them.\u201cIt is not a space to insert your own opinion,\u201d Bindeman, the reproductive psychologist, said. \u201cIt is not a space for your values to come out, even if your values are supporting what your friend did.\u201dCenter the conversation on the storyteller \u2014 not the listener, she added.For Dockett, talking through her views with her friend made one thing clear: \u201c[We] both value our friendship and love for one another more than our political or moral values.\u201dThat\u2019s a realization she thinks others can discover through these conversations.\u201cIt is absolutely possible to have differences in various areas of your life and maintain a friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt truly depends on your love for the person, their love for you, and the ability to accept that you don\u2019t have to think alike to genuinely love and care about each other.\u201dShare CommentsSign upSign upwashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
