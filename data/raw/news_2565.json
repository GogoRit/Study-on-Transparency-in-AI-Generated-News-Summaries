The panel has no cutout(s), which makes for a more immersive experience when watching movies or playing games. \n\nThere is no information on the maker of the screen front glass layer, but if you are concerned for scratches or cracks, you have a screen protector waiting for you right inside the retail box.\nThe S5 Pro display has a resolution of 1,080 x 2,340, which makes for a sharp picture at 395ppi and 19.5:9 aspect ratio.\nIn our display testing, the S5 Pro showed an excellent contrast ratio if 1677:1. It demonstrated deep blacks, but the maximum brightness is way below the average for an LCD at 360 nits. What's even worse, is that most of the time, the screen maxes out at 320 nits and it's only on rare occasions that it jumps to 360nits. There is no sunlight boost either, so the whimsical 360 nits is as good as it gets.\nThe minimal brightness we measured was 5.3 nits.\n\n\nDisplay test\n100% brightness\n\n\nBlack,cd/m2\nWhite,cd/m2\nContrast ratio\n\n\nInfinix S5 Pro 0.217 364 1677:1\n\n\nRealme 5 0.345 485 1406:1\n\n\nRealme 5s 0.345 487 1412:1\n\n\nRealme 3 0.263 385 1464:1\n\n\nRealme 3 Pro 0.285 508 1782:1\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy M30 0 437 \u221e\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy M30 (Max Auto) 0 641 \u221e\n\n\nSony Xperia 10 0.362 549 1517:1\n\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 8T 0.331 450 1360:1\n\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 8T (Max Auto) 0.453 600 1325:1\n\n\nNow let's talk color accuracy. As we mentioned earlier, the screen colors are eye-popping - punchy and very saturated. Indeed, our measurements confirm this - the average deltaE we got was 7.4, with a maximum deviation of 12.5. There is a noticeable blue tinge, but the reds and greens are quite off, too. We can only guess if this was intentional, or just a result of the lack of color calibration in the factory.\nNote that the phone only supports the lowest Widevine CDM level - L3 - meaning it won't be able to play high-res content from Netflix, Prime, or other streaming platforms. You can still use these services, but they will serve you 480p content - which, depending on your network connection, might be all you need anyway.\n\nBattery life\nThe Infinix S5 Pro is powered by a 4,000 mAh battery. It supports 10W charging, and the provided 5V/2A adapter refills about 30% of the phone's depleted battery in half an hour.\nThe results from our battery life test are in, and the Infinix S5 Pro scored an excellent mark! The phone lasted north of 14 hours on our web browsing test, more than 13 hours when playing videos, and 30+ hours on 3G talks. Finally, when we added the very good standby performance, we got an overall Endurance Rating of 106 hours.\n\n Our battery tests were automated thanks to SmartViser, using its viSer App. The endurance rating above denotes how long a single battery charge will last you if you use the Infinix S5 Pro\r\nfor an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily. We've established this usage pattern so that our battery results are comparable across devices in the most common day-to-day tasks. The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritty. You can check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.\n\nSpeaker test\nThe Infinix S5 Pro has a single loudspeaker firing down from the bottom and posted an 'Average' result for loudness in our seven-track music test. It's lacking in low-frequency thump but handles vocals nicely and is easily adequate for its price range.\n\n\nUse the Playback controls to listen to the phone sample recordings (best use headphones). We measure the average loudness of the speakers in LUFS. A lower absolute value means a louder sound. A look at the frequency response chart will tell you how far off the ideal \"0db\" flat line is the reproduction of the bass, treble, and mid frequencies. You can add more phones to compare how they differ. The scores and ratings are not comparable with our older loudspeaker test. Learn more about how we test here.\n\n\nNext Page \u00bb\n4.
