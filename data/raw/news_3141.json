The award is in recognition of Ashland\u2019s care for pregnant and parenting students.\nStudents for Life of America, the nation\u2019s largest youth pro-life organization, researched nearly 800 Christian-affiliated colleges and universities and graded each of the them based on their promotion of life-affirming resources while not having any ties with Planned Parenthood or other local abortion resources. Ashland was one of just 48 to receive an A+ rating.\n\u201cWe are honored to be recognized as an institution that celebrates\u00a0life\u00a0and provides resources for\u00a0students\u00a0who are balancing a new baby and the rigors of the collegiate experience,\u201d remarked Carlos Campo, president of Ashland University.\nAshland offers counseling services, health center services and pastoral counseling through Christian ministry for all students. Also, there is a nursing mother\u2019s room in the Hawkins-Conard Student Center, which provides a private space for mothers to nurse or pump.\nA certificate sent to Ashland reads, \u201cBy promoting a relationship with a life-affirming Pregnancy Help Organization instead of a relationship with Planned Parenthood or the abortion industry, you are a model of biblical values for nearly 800 Christian colleges and universities across the country. Pro-life and Christian communities need authentic Christian institutions like Ashland University. Thank you for striving to be a haven for pregnant and parenting students and for encouraging your student body to support pregnant and parenting women in your community.\u201d\nStudents for Life of America, launched in 2006, is the only pro-life organization dedicated to training and equipping college, high school, middle, medical and law school students so that they can defend the preborn and help young mothers on their campuses.\nAshland University is a mid-sized, private university conveniently located a short distance from Akron, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio. Ashland University (www.ashland.edu) values the individual student and offers a unique educational experience that combines the challenge of strong applied academic programs with a faculty and staff who build nurturing relationships with their students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA private university located in the heart of Ohio, Ashland University values and encourages student individuality. We provide a personalized educational experience that is as unique as you are.\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n401 College\n\tAvenue, Ashland,\n\tOH 44805\n419-289-4142\n800-882-1548\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Info\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\nCommencement\n\n\nNews Center\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nWellness\n\n\nConsumer Information\n\n\nStudent Complaints\n\n\nCampus Store\n\n\nPresidential Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAshland University \u00a9 Copyright 2024.
