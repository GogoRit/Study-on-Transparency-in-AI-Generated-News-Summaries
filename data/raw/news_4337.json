The rule, first introduced by president Ronald Reagan in 1984, means that if an organisation receives US government funding it cannot engage in providing abortion services, counselling or even advocacy over abortion law, even if it does so using other, non-US funds.Reinstating the rule was an expected move for a Republican administration, but in the months afterwards, it was expanded to make it unprecedentedly broad. Previously, the rule only applied to reproductive health funding, but it now applies to all public health funds, affecting nearly $9bn (\u00a36.8bn) a year in foreign aid. The new rule means that NGOs cannot receive money for sanitation, access to clean water or HIV/Aids programmes if they also run programmes that offer abortion services or counselling.\u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t underestimate the harm that has been done. This wasn\u2019t the typical Republican administration, where some bad policies came back and now they\u2019re going to be rescinded again,\u201d said Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity in Washington DC.The US vice-president, Mike Pence, who has a long history of ultra-conservative positions on abortion, has driven the agenda. \u201cDenying women access to contraception and abortion is core to who he is and the world he wants to create,\u201d said Sippel.  What is the \u2018global gag rule\u2019, and why does Trump support it? GuardianNumerous reports have found that implementing the global gag rule leads to an increase in the number of unsafe abortions and endangers the health of women. \u201cGirls have been losing lives just because of lack of access to services,\u201d said Melvine Ouyo, a former clinic manager at Family Health Options Kenya, an organisation that had to close five clinics after declining to accept the new US aid conditions. \u201cThe impact of the global gag rule has been really devastating, and has been felt by most of the organisation in Kenya,\u201d she said.Keifer Buckingham, a senior policy adviser at the Open Society Foundations, said the rule left thousands of organisations with a \u201chorrible\u201d decision to make: \u201cDo we reject very lucrative US government money in order to continue providing life-saving care, or do we take the money and compromise on our values and on the provision of reproductive healthcare?\u201dThe organisation Marie Stopes International, which works in 37 countries across the globe, refused to sign up to the global gag rule in 2017, and thus had to decline $30m a year in US funding. The organisation estimates that over Trump\u2019s full term, these funds would have allowed it to serve 8 million women with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths.Dr Carole Sekimpi, who runs the organisation\u2019s Uganda programme, said it had to cut back on five mobile outreach teams in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2017 order, until donors from different countries stepped in to fill the funding gap. But the bigger problem was that other local organisations shied away from joint projects, fearful of losing their own funding.\u201cBecause the regulation is so complicated, and often the interpretation by the US government is pretty blanket, everybody wants to be on the safe side,\u201d she said.Rights advocates hope that a Biden administration would be able to pass a piece of legislation introduced to Congress last year, known as the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (HER) Act, that would repeal the rule permanently.The vice-president elect, Kamala Harris, came out in support of the act last year. \u201cThe United States should never force non-government organisations to choose between receiving American aid and providing comprehensive reproductive healthcare to women across the world,\u201d she said. It is not yet clear, though, whether the next administration will have the numbers to get the act through Congress.As well as the global gag rule, the Trump administration has also sought to lead a global push to promote so-called \u201cfamily values\u201d and curtail access to abortion along with LGBT rights. In some cases, this rhetorical support may have been as damaging to the cause of women\u2019s rights globally as the financial penalties.\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, the United States has defended the dignity of human life everywhere and always,\u201d the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said last month at the signing ceremony of an anti-abortion document known as the Geneva consensus declaration. \u201cHe has done it like no other president in history. We have mounted an unprecedented defence of the unborn abroad.\u201dNearly 30 governments, mainly from authoritarian states, signed up to the document, in which the signatories \u201creaffirm that there is no international right to abortion\u201d. Hungary and Poland were the only two EU members to sign. There have recently been huge protests in Poland over a constitutional ruling that would outlaw almost all abortion in the country.\u201cThere are plenty of governments out there that are emboldened and empowered by the last four years of the Trump administration pushing this rhetoric and will continue to push it globally,\u201d said Buckingham.However, along with acknowledgement of the damage done, there is also impatience for a new era to start, and for a change of tone in the White House.\u201cWe did so much during the Obama administration, and I am expecting that Biden should really do this in his first days so we can get these things back. I am just so expectant and excited that things will change quickly for the better,\u201d said Ouyo.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsAbortionAid'Global gag rule'US foreign policyJoe BidenWomenfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
