Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, said to applause in his Jan. 23 homily at the opening Mass of the National Vigil for Life.\nDuring an \u201cad limina\u201d meeting with bishops from Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska the week before, Archbishop Naumann said Pope Francis had told them, \u201cIf we do not defend life, no other rights matter.\u201d\n[hotblock]\n\u201cThe Holy Father said that abortion is first a human rights issue,\u201d added Archbishop Naumann in his homily, delivered at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.\n\u201cPope Francis was aware of the March for Life in the United States and was delighted to know the anticipated large numbers of pilgrims, especially the participation of so many young people,\u201d said Archbishop Naumann, who is chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\nAlthough the \u201cad limina\u201d meeting was confidential so that the pope and the bishops could speak freely, Pope Francis \u201cencouraged me \u2014 I dare say, ordered me \u2014 \u2018Please tell the pilgrims at the March for Life and the entire pro-life community: The pope is with you! He is praying for you!'\u201d the archbishop said.\nPrelates and clergymen process during the opening Mass of the National Prayer Vigil for Life Jan. 23, 2020, at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. (CNS photo/Bob Roller)\n\u201cGod and 14 other bishops are my witnesses that Pope Francis was passionate in support of the church\u2019s pro-life efforts. The successor of Peter has our backs.\u201d\nArchbishop Naumann dwelt mainly in his homily on what he called a \u201cmoral \u2018Twilight Zone,'\u201d based on an episode of the old television science-fiction series in which surgeons worked time and again to repair a young woman\u2019s disfigured face through plastic surgery. After the final operation, he recalled, the bandages were removed from the woman\u2019s face and she is \u201cstunningly, drop-dead beautiful.\u201d\nSurprisingly, the surgical team apologizes for their failure. \u201cThey remove their own surgical masks revealing their own grotesquely hideous appearance,\u201d Archbishop Naumann said. \u201cYou begin to realize that in this fictional \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 world, beautiful is ugly and the hideous is gorgeous.\u201d\nSuch it is with abortion in American society, he asserted. \u201cThe killing of one\u2019s child is exalted as heroic and brave,\u201d he said. \u201cAbortion was described by early feminists Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul as the ultimate exploitation of women, but in this ethically topsy-turvy twilight zone, it is now hailed as the cornerstone of women\u2019s rights.\u201d\nHe told the worshippers, estimated at 10,000, inside the basilica, \u201cJesus never promised that discipleship would be easy. He told his first disciples that in order to follow him they must be willing to take up their cross.\u201d\n[hotblock2]\nArchbishop Naumann added, \u201cIn this cultural, moral twilight zone to stand for the sanctity of the lives of unborn children, you may face ridicule and social exclusion. You may be penalized in the academy and workplace.\u201d\nBut he cited \u201csigns of hope,\u201d garnering applause when he talked about \u201cour nation\u2019s youth being more pro-life than their parents.\u201d Archbishop Naumann said, \u201cThere is also reason to hope the United States Supreme Court, which imposed by judicial fiat our current liberal abortion policy, may be poised to return to states a greater ability to protect the lives of unborn children\u201d through the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that allowed legal abortion virtually on demand.\nArchbishop Naumann also heralded the 25th anniversary of St. John Paul II\u2019s encyclical \u201cThe Gospel of Life,\u201d St. John Paul \u201cdid not make reference to any \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 episodes,\u201d he noted, but he said in the encyclical, \u201cWhen conscience, this bright lamp of the soul, calls evil good and good evil, it is already on the path to the most alarming corruption and the darkest moral blindness.\u201d\n\u201cFreedom separated from truth,\u201d Archbishop Naumann warned, \u201cin the end creates a tyrant state that allows and even encourages the disposal of life when it is weakest.\u201d\nArchbishop Joseph F.
