A lower court had instructed state lawmakers to enact legislation allowing for abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe state appealed, and the case was sent to the first bench of the Supreme Court.\nIf the Supreme Court had upheld the lower court ruling, it would have opened the door to the legalization of abortion throughout the country. Currently, only Mexico City and Oaxaca state have legalized abortion on demand up to 12 weeks' gestation.\nSupreme Court Justice Juan Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Alc\u00e1ntara Carranc\u00e1, nominated to the bench in 2018 by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, presented arguments backing the lower court's ruling and was the only judge to vote in favor of it.\nVoting against were justices Norma Luc\u00eda Pi\u00f1a Hern\u00e1ndez, Margarita R\u00edos Farjat, Jorge Mario Pardo Rebolledo and Alfredo Guti\u00e9rrez Ortiz Mena.\nAuxiliary bishop Alfonso Miranda of Monterrey, Guardiola, secretary general of the Mexican bishops' conference, posted on Twitter after the ruling, \"Thank you. Blessed be God. #Yes to life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Archdiocese of Mexico City tweeted that \"today life won in Veracruz--and in the country itself--thanks to the Supreme Court's rejection of the effort to decriminalize abortion in the state, recognizing that this procedure is not a right in any law, whether national or international.\"\nIn the run up to the vote, the Mexican bishops' conference and other pro-life organizations had spoken out strongly against the expansion of legal abortion.\nMore than 200 local and federal legislators, joined by more than 200 jurists, had presented an open letter to the Supreme Court on July 28, asking them to overturn the lower court's decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, more than 200,000 people signed a CitizenGO petition asking the Supreme Court to reject the appeal and defend the right to life.\nA version of this story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA's Spanish-language news partner.
