(AP) \u2014 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Friday during her reelection campaign\u2019s lone debate with her Democratic challenger, state lawmaker Jamie Smith, that if reelected she will uphold the state\u2019s abortion ban that provides no exceptions for rape or incest.The Republican governor explained her position simply as \u201cpro-life,\u201d while pledging to push for expanded parental leave in the state and alleviate the toll of inflation on people\u2019s budgets. Smith called Noem\u2019s stance extreme and said it was endangering women\u2019s lives and causing concern among physicians for its lack of clarity on when an abortion is allowed \u2014 only to save the life of a pregnant woman.\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that South Dakotans overwhelmingly support a woman\u2019s right to an abortion,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe talk about freedom all the time, except the freedom to make this choice.\u201d\n\nThe gubernatorial race\u2019s lone head-to-head meeting of the two candidates featured Noem touting her record of a hands-off approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith, who is facing an uphill election in the heavily Republican state, cast himself as a moderate. Here are the key takeaways from the Friday night clash that was hosted by KSFY-TV:POCKETBOOK ISSUES\nNoem claimed the state has the \u201cstrongest economy\u201d in the nation, crediting her decision to forgo government restrictions during the pandemic. But she also turned attention to the squeeze that inflation is putting on household budgets. She said she hears from many people who are \u201cstruggling because they can\u2019t pay their grocery bill. They\u2019re struggling because they can\u2019t pay gas prices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, she promised to push for repeal of the state\u2019s 4.5% tax on food sales.But Smith was quick to point out that was an initiative he has been pushing for years, and when the House passed the proposal in March, support from Noem was lacking. Noem publicly opposed the proposal after the state Senate dismissed it in March, but she said Friday that it was an idea she supported and her office had been working on it.\n\nRecently, South Dakota\u2019s economic growth has lagged behind the rest of the country. Last year, it had the 15th lowest growth in gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output \u2014 among states. However, South Dakota has seen one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of growth in personal income in recent years.ETHICS COMPLAINTS AGAINST NOEMThe Republican governor deflected questions on a pair of ethics investigations against her by blaming the state\u2019s former attorney general, Republican Jason Ravnsborg, for filing the complaints to the state\u2019s Government Accountability Board. She pointed out that she had pressed Ravnsborg to resign after he struck and killed a pedestrian with his car in 2020 and suggested the complaints were just an attempt to get retribution.A state ethics board in August acted on the complaints against Noem. She was accused of misconduct for interfering in a state agency as it was preparing to deny her daughter a real estate appraiser license, as well as misusing the state airplane by traveling to events hosted by political organizations.\n\n\u201cThis matter is closed and it is something that is very clear my daughter never once received special treatment,\u201d Noem said, adding that she had followed the law and precedent in her use of the state plane.However, the Government Accountability Board\u2019s three retired judges voted unanimously last month to find that there was evidence that the governor engaged in a conflict of interest and committed malfeasance in the episode with her daughter\u2019s licensure, but it also kept the board\u2019s action on the complaint a secret. The board also requested that the state\u2019s Division of Criminal Investigation examine her use of the state airplane.Smith took the opportunity to swipe at Noem: \u201cSouth Dakotans, you can tell the difference between right and wrong.\u201dBut it was Noem who mostly prodded Smith. She repeatedly tried to tie him to President Joe Biden and called him \u201cextreme.\u201dEDUCATIONSmith touted his work as a teacher and coach and sought to criticize Noem for leaning on the work of a conservative college in Michigan, Hillsdale College, to remake the state\u2019s social studies standards.\n\nNoem in turn said she was working to elevate parents\u2019 voices in education and accused Smith of being a proponent of so-called critical race theory \u2014 an academic framework that examines American history through the lens of racism. He said that is not a problem in South Dakota\u2019s schools.WHAT\u2019S NEXTNoem had declined an invitation to a debate hosted by South Dakota Public Broadcasting, but Smith challenged her to meet him again.If she doesn\u2019t, the public broadcaster has said it plans to host a debate just with Smith and Libertarian candidate Tracey Quint, who also joined the Friday debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEPHEN GROVES\n\n\n                Groves covers Congress for The Associated Press.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
