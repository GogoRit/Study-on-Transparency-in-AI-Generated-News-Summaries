She was 19, and she wanted an abortion.She visited a nurse inside the facility to ask about her options. \u201cHer exact words were \u2018that wouldn\u2019t be an option\u2019 for me,\u201d Moye said. \u201cI later found out that [saying] that was totally illegal.\u201d By the time she was released, she was in her second trimester, and decided to carry her pregnancy to term. Her son was born prematurely two months later.Tennessee Republicans approve six-week abortion ban in surprise voteRead moreBefore her incarceration, Moye was working full-time at a casino and pursuing an undergraduate degree in business. \u201cMy life was pretty decent,\u201d she said. \u201cI was making decent money for my age, and I just wanted to finish school, figure out my life and my passion and not have to worry about the responsibility of another human being.\u201dBut resuming her life after jail proved difficult. Moye, who went back to work two months after her son was born, said she didn\u2019t qualify for childcare assistance or food stamps. Formula for her son was expensive.\u201cI had my lights cut off. I had my gas cut off. I went to bed hungry plenty of times,\u201d she said. She said paying for things like her son\u2019s food and a car seat caused her to fall behind on bills. Her car was repossessed during that time, and she occasionally relied on help from her parents to stay afloat. She fell into a depression.Moye\u2019s experience reflects a common reality.I had my lights cut off. I had my gas cut off. I went to bed hungry plenty of timesKayla MoyeAccording to a study published earlier this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research, women who are denied abortions are more likely to struggle financially than those who undergo the procedure. Researchers found higher rates of debt, bankruptcy and eviction among those who carried unwanted pregnancies to term.Sarah Miller, an economist at the University of Michigan and the study\u2019s lead author, said new mothers can expect a drop in pay after giving birth, and that\u2019s paired with medical expenses and the costs of caring for a child. But for those who sought and were denied an abortion, their subsequent financial precarity reflects a prescient degree of self-awareness. Miller\u2019s research suggests that individuals who seek out abortions carry an astute sense of their financial situation, the realities of caring for a child, and the compounding hardship of the two.Miller and her team analyzed the credit scores of hundreds of women across the US who had sought abortions; one group obtained abortions and the other were turned away due to advanced gestational age. The researchers found that, on average, the women who were unable to access abortions had roughly $1,700 more in debt; were 81% more likely to have negative public financial records, such as bankruptcies, evictions and tax liens; and were more likely to have poor credit. (In three years prior to the unintended pregnancies, researchers said their credit scores were \u201cnearly indistinguishable\u201d.)Most striking, the financial gaps between the two groups endured throughout the six-year period Miller and her team studied. Miller said she had expected the gap to narrow after the first year or two. \u201cBut it seemed to bring these women\u2019s households into a more persistent kind of financial turmoil,\u201d she said.dividerThese findings come as states across the US roll back access to abortion \u2013 sometimes under the guise of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 and the US. supreme court considers its most high-profile abortion case in decades. Next week, the justices are expected to rule whether the state of Louisiana can impose strict regulations on abortion providers, requiring them to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Abortion rights advocates say a ruling in the state\u2019s favor would signal that states could severely limit individuals\u2019 access to the procedure.Although states\u2019 attempts to classify abortions as non-essential were overturned in the courts, thousands of women were turned away from abortions at the outset of the pandemic, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Miller said if more women are denied abortions, more women are also likely to face economic hardship. \u201cShort-term reductions in access to care could potentially have long-term, persistent financial consequences,\u201d she said.Short-term reductions in access to care could potentially have long-term, persistent financial consequencesSarah MillerMiller\u2019s research built off the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study from the University of San Francisco that looked at how abortion access affects women\u2019s lives. The study, which was recently released as a book, followed 1,000 women across the US between 2008 and 2010 and interviewed them over the course of five years.Researchers found the effects of denying women abortion went beyond financial hardship. Women who carried to term were also more likely than their counterparts to experience complications during pregnancy and stay with abusive partners.Diana Greene Foster, the Turnaway Study\u2019s lead researcher, said two of the study\u2019s participants actually died from childbirth-related complications, a staggering figure, given that most recent statistics put the overall US maternal mortality rate at 17.4 per 100,000 live births.Foster, a demographer, said she was struck by how closely women\u2019s reasons for wanting abortions tracked with the outcomes. Women who said they couldn\u2019t afford a child tended to become poorer; those who worried about raising a child with the man involved tended to see those relationships dissolve; and those who worried about the impact on the children they already had tended to experience worse financial and developmental outcomes for their children.\u201cThe data make it really clear that people are making thoughtful decisions,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThey understand what the impact will be. And they are right.\u201ddividerMoye said she\u2019s gotten to a good place \u2013 emotionally and financially. At 25, she\u2019s engaged to be married, and her son, now five, has a two-year-old sister. She works for a dating service and owns a couple of businesses, including a beauty bar and a stake in a tattoo parlor. She and her fiance are buying a home in a suburb of Cleveland, and she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree.\u201cThe reason that me and my fiance started to explore businesses and kind of go the entrepreneurial route was mainly because we want to be able to pay for the kids\u2019 college,\u201d she said.She hopes they will be able to chart their own paths, without constraints, financial or otherwise.\u201cI think that most of all, everything kind of boils down to freedom,\u201d she said.Explore more on these topicsAbortionFeminist economicsWomenHealthWomen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
