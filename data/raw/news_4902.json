Wade falls, a Hudson lawmaker has introduced a bill in the Ohio Senate that would automatically\u00a0ban all abortions, except to prevent the death or serious injury of pregnant women in limited cases.Sen. Kristina Roegner (R-Hudson) joined Sandra O'Brien\u00a0(R-Ashtabula) this week to introduce Senate Bill 123. Known across the nation as a trigger law, the legislation would automatically make Ohio a \"right to life\" state should the landmark Roe\u00a0case protecting a woman's right to abortion be overturned by the more conservative Supreme Court or the states ratify an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would prohibit abortion.\u201cI believe that when the U.S. Supreme Court considers a challenge to Roe, they will realize that the original decision from 1973 was seriously flawed, and return the authority regarding abortion to the states,\" Roegner said in a press release on her new bill, dubbed the Human Life Protection Act. \"This is why Ohio should be proactive in passing this legislation; declaring that we respect the sanctity of life and will defend the most vulnerable among us \u2014 the unborn.\"Roegner told a Beacon Journal reporter in early March that her faith strongly influences\u00a0her position on matters of ending a life. Last General Assembly, she co-sponsored a bill to end the death penalty. She said she's on-board with that effort again this year.Roegner's bill would ban all abortions, including those performed before a heartbeat is detected. A narrow\u00a0exception would be made \"to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" In order for a physician to cite this exception and\u00a0avoid homicide charges, the doctor must:Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter GuideDeclare in writing, and get a second physician with no professional connection to do the same,\u00a0that the abortion was\u00a0necessary to prevent death or serious harm.Perform the abortion in a way that \"provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive\"\u00a0in a hospital or facility with\u00a0neonatal services for premature infants.And \"take all reasonable steps necessary to preserve the life and health of the unborn child immediately upon the child's complete expulsion or extraction from the pregnant woman.\"Abortion rights groups criticize new billThe anti-abortion trigger law drew swift criticism from defenders of a woman's right to access the medical procedure.\"Ohioans deserve better. Ohioans deserve lawmakers who are focused on making their lives better, not restricting their access to care,\"\u00a0Lauren Blauvelt-Copelin, vice president of Government Affairs and Public Advocacy of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, said in a statement to the press.\"\u2018Trigger\u2019 bans like these are not about protecting people \u2013 they are about taking away access and spreading misinformation,\" said\u00a0Blauvelt-Copelin.\u00a0\"We cannot and will not accept a world where safe, legal reproductive health care depends on where you live.\u201d\u201cThe right to decide whether or when to have a child is a fundamental\u00a0human right,\u201d said NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director Kellie Copeland. \u201cOhioans need and deserve access to safe and affordable abortion care in their local communities.\u00a0They don\u2019t need anti-abortion politicians interfering with their reproductive health care decisions.\u00a0Abortion is safe and legal in Ohio; NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio and our\u00a0partners are working every day to keep it that way.\"Potential cases to overturn Roe v. WadeIn 2019, the Ohio General Assembly passed and Gov. Mike DeWine signed a so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d which bans abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The new law makes an exception in cases when the mother\u2019s life is at risk, but not when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. The law was put on hold while opponents challenge it in court.The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research group, is tracking two cases headed for the United States Supreme Court. As they relate to Roe V. Wade, the cases offer the high court the possibility of:Denying doctors and health clinics the right to challenge abortion regulations on behalf of patients;Overturning Roe v. Wade\u00a0and allows states to ban abortion before viability.Establishing a new legal standard that wouldn\u2019t require state laws restricting abortion to show that the benefits outweigh the burden to the patient.Kaiser Family Foundation reports that 16 states have laws, like Senate Bill 123, that would immediately ban abortions should Roe v. Wade fall or a pro-life amendment is added to the U.S. Constitution. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. have laws that protect abortion.The two cases heading to the Supreme Court are:Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, in which lower courts struck down as unconstitutional a Mississippi state law banning abortions after 15 weeks, except in the case of a medical emergency or fetal abnormality.Food and Drug Administration v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u00a0, in which doctors challenged a new FDA rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that required pregnant women to visit a doctor or clinic to obtain Mifepristone, one of the drugs used in pills that induce abortions.Opponents of abortion have not outnumbered supporters in America in two decades of public opinion tracking by the Pew Research Center, which most recently found that 61% of the public prefers that abortion be legal in \"all or most cases.\"Reach reporter Doug Livingston at dlivingston@thebeaconjournal.com or 330-996-3792.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper NIE ArchivesAkron Classifieds Kent Classifieds Jobs Cars Homes Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.beaconjournal.com.
