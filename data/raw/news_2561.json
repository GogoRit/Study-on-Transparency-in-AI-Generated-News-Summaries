Professor JJ Scarisbrick, one of the charity\u2019s founders in 1970, wrote: \u201cShe was a heroic pro-lifer \u2013 tireless in promoting the pro-life cause at home and abroad.\u201d\nMaire founded Life Doctors and was in the first party to travel to Romania after communism fell to start pro-life work there. The group founded in Transylvania is still going strong.\nIn Ipswich Doc was a founder member in 1977 of the Guild of Our Lady of Ipswich, now Meryemana. Through her initiative the shrine of Our Lady of Grace was re-established in the town and annual pilgrimage walks started. The first shrine, in Lady Lane, was destroyed in 1538 on the orders of King Henry VIII after he broke from the Catholic Church.\nMaire Heley (left) with friend Jean Johnson.\nMaire was instrumental in forging links with Nettuno in Italy which venerates a statue taken there by English sailors after it was rescued from the flames when the English shrine was destroyed. Doc\u2019s work was valued by the Anglican Society of Mary and a Eucharist was celebrated for her soon after she died. Maire had wanted her coffin to stand beside a replica statue in St Mary Elms CofE for a short service before going to St Pancras but sadly the coronavirus outbreak prevented this.\nDoc was proud to be a regular reader at St Pancras and a stalwart member of the Catholic Women\u2019s League. She and Loris Squirrell set up a questionnaire that led to the formation of the Monday Circle Bible study group, which they led for 10 years. As well as deepening participants\u2019 knowledge and love of Scripture this helped foster friendship between St Pancras parishioners and their neighbours in the URC/Baptist congregation at Christ Church.\nMaire supported and was a representative at many ecumenical functions in Ipswich. In her seventies she studied for the Maryvale Diploma in Evangelisation and Ministry and obtained a distinction. Doc also attended the East Anglia diocesan adult learning courses that Bishop Michael Evans began.\nMaire was born in St Albans in 1930 and attended a local convent school and grammar in London before winning a place at the Royal Free Hospital to study medicine. Her father died while she was at medical school and she only finished with the financial help of the Catenians. She won a national prize for surgery but always wanted to be a family doctor and after working at a hospital in Windsor she came to Ipswich as a GP. When I reported her death to the British Medical Association they told me she had been a member for 66 years. For most of that time, Maire was a parishioner at St Pancras, which she loved.\nMany in Ipswich remember her as a wonderful doctor. Some wept when I told them she had passed away. She was an old-fashioned GP who believed in examining patients and discovering the symptoms rather than sending them first for numerous tests. She was usually right! Even in her later years, Maire\u2019s family would phone from afar to see if they needed to see the doctor and when they were unwell, she usually worked out, from the symptoms, what was wrong.\nDoc had an older brother, Fr Tom, and elder sister, Paula, who suffered from poor health. Maire paid for her two nephews to be boarders at St Joseph\u2019s College in Ipswich to ease the burden on her sister. After Paula died her five-year-old daughter went to live with her father in Ireland and Doc looked after the boys, who carried on as day pupils at St Joseph\u2019s, helped by Harriet, a midwife in her practice.\nMaire was a tireless supporter of work I did in East Africa. Until her last hour she had beside her a picture of the only stained glass window in Kabale diocese in southern Uganda. She arranged for the window, depicting the Sacred Heart, to be made and placed in the chapel of Bukinda Seminary in memory of Fr Tom, her brother \u2013 a missionary priest who never got to the missions because of the Second World War and instead taught in a seminary.\nThe picture meant a great deal to her \u2013 particularly when she was deprived in her last years of the daily Mass attendance that had been a huge part of her life \u2013 and she would wake in the night and be comforted by looking at it. Fr Sunday Evarist was rector of the seminary when Maire donated the window and now works in Coventry. It took a lot of argument to convince him that as a hospital chaplain he should not travel to her funeral.\nWhen we planned Maire\u2019s funeral, which she thought would happen in 2017 after she was diagnosed with a terminal illness, Doc insisted that there was to be no eulogy, because \u201cnobody knows, or is capable of finding out, the whole story and it is much better to say nothing than to make up a lot of stuffy nonsense!\u201d So you must forgive me if I have omitted anything.\nShe was a great friend and a woman of real faith. Many, like me, will miss her. There will be a Thanksgiving Mass when normality is resumed. I hope it will be possible to hold it on July 22, which would have been Maire\u2019s 90th birthday.\nDonations in memory of Maire payable to Ipswich Winter Night Shelter or the Apostleship of the Sea may be sent c/of\u00a0 East of England Co-operative Funeral Services at 47 St Helens Street, Ipswich IP4 2JL.\n\u00a0\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated postsMarch 19, 2024Easter people know the power of the resurrectionRead moreMarch 18, 2024Papal Nuncio visits Cambridge for Lunar New Year MassRead moreMarch 15, 2024Reflections on Vatican II \u2013 Constitution on the LiturgyRead more\n\n\n\n\nLatest NewsEaster people know the power of the resurrectionMarch 19, 2024Papal Nuncio visits Cambridge for Lunar New Year MassMarch 18, 2024Reflections on Vatican II \u2013 Constitution on the LiturgyMarch 15, 2024Bishop meets students at St John Fisher High SchoolMarch 13, 2024Bishop Peter leads Lent Station Masses across DioceseMarch 12, 2024\n \n\n\n   Follow us on Facebook\n   Follow us on Twitter\n   Follow us on Flickr\n   Youtube\n   Connec to our RSS Feed\n\nTrending News\n\n Tributes paid to former Abbott with East Anglia links \n New series looks at  religious life in Diocese of East Anglia \n 42 Catholic and Anglican bishops meet in Norwich \n Be the first to read March Catholic East Anglia \n Papal blessing for ministry of East Anglian priest, aged 96 \n\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\nThe Bishop's Secretary: 01508 492202\nThe Bishop's PA: 01508 493956\nDiocesan Offices: 01508 492202\nFinance Offices: 01508 492540\nSafeguarding: 0208 505 4199\nChancellor: 01223 224852\nSchools Commission: 01508 495509\nPress Office: 07712 787762\n\n\nDirectory\nChurches Priests SchoolsConventsPrisons Hospitals & Hospices\nAbout us\nThe Bishop Latest News Facebook X/Twitter Contact Us Reporting AbusePrivacy statement Home\nDepartments\n\nYouth MinistryMusicMarriage & Family LifeSchoolsVocationsSafeguardingCommissionsCaritas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia 2024 | Support \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
