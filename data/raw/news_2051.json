extensively litigated abortion policy, had a briefing Tuesday about new lawsuits against three states with bans: Tennessee, Oklahoma and Idaho.\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee\u2019s abortion ban is facing another legal challenge, and it hinges on the law\u2019s ambiguity around medical exceptions.The Center for Reproductive Rights, local doctors and local patients filed the lawsuit in state court, arguing the ban violates patients\u2019 right to life. They say Tennessee\u2019s medical exceptions are dangerously vague, leaving medical workers weighing the risk of their own imprisonment while deciding whether a patient needs an abortion. The law also lacks exceptions for pregnancies where the fetus has no chance of survival.The Center for Reproductive Rights is a national abortion access group that has extensively litigated abortion policy. On Tuesday, the organization had a briefing about new lawsuits against three states with bans: Tennessee, Oklahoma and Idaho.Two Tennesseans, who are plaintiffs in the state\u2019s case, shared their stories during the media event. Both women underwent pregnancies with fetal anomalies; there was no chance of survival because the fetuses hadn\u2019t developed correctly. The pregnancies caused severe medical complications in both women.\u201cNo one should have to endure the emotional and physical pain and risk to their life that I have suffered in Tennessee,\u201d said Nicole Blackmon, one of the plaintiffs. \u201cThat law forced me to carry a baby for months that was never going to live, and easily could have killed me.\u201dShe found out she was pregnant last summer, just a few months after her 14-year-old son had died. She had hypertension and a few other serious health issues, but she and her partner decided to move forward anyway.\u201cFrom the start, we were excited, but worried at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at 15 weeks, we learned that there was an issue with the baby\u2019s tummy. Then, at 24 weeks, the specialists confirmed that our baby\u2019s organs were not forming as expected or in the right places. Many were outside of our baby\u2019s body. Doctors told us certainly that this pregnancy would result in not a living baby.\u201dShe said that gave her two options: spend thousands of dollars traveling out of state for an abortion, or risk her health carry the pregnancy to term. They couldn\u2019t afford the former, so she persevered through the complications.\u201cEverything hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cMy vision got blurry, and I felt sharp pain when the baby moved. I was told I was at high risk of having a stroke. \u2026 My water broke in my seventh month. And after 32 hours laboring, I delivered our baby stillborn.\u201dAllie Phillips is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. She learned she was pregnant in November. She went for a routine scan at 19 weeks, and her obstetrician told her there were several issues. A specialist later told her that multiple organs had developed incorrectly or not at all, and the fetus had stopped growing.\u201cWe were told that she had no chance at life,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hysterical. All I could do was ask, \u2018What do we do now?\u2019 The doctor said that there were two options: either ending the pregnancy with an abortion or continuing, realizing that (she) wasn\u2019t going to survive.\u201dShe and her husband started a GoFundMe so she could go to New York City for an abortion. Once she got there, she learned the fetus had already died, putting her at risk for blood clots, sepsis and death. That meant she had to undergo a more complicated and urgent procedure.\u201cI went into surgery alone, and I sat in recovery alone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctors were kind and compassionate, but I\u2019d never met them before. I had to grieve the loss of my daughter in a city I\u2019d never been to \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have had to leave my lifelong home for basic health care.\u201dThe lawsuit raises several concerns, but one of the focuses is on the scope of medical exceptions. The language is vague, which they argue is especially troubling when physicians face up to 15 years in prison for performing an abortion that is later deemed medically unnecessary.In addition to ambiguity in its definition of \u201cirreversible impairment\u201d to the pregnant patient, the abortion ban uses the term \u201creasonable\u201d medical judgment, as opposed to \u201cgood-faith medical judgment.\u201d That terminology is stricter and means an expert witness could come to a court hearing and say they disagree with the decision.\u201cMedical emergency determinations, however, are often complex and inherently subject to disagreement,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cTennessee\u2019s abortion ban can and should be read to ensure that doctors have wide discretion to determine the appropriate course of treatment, including abortion care, for their patients who present with emergent medical conditions \u2014 without being second guessed by the Attorney General, the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners, a local prosecutor, or a lay jury.\u201dPlaintiffs are asking the court to clarify several of the ambiguities in Tennessee\u2019s law, particularly in pregnancies with complications.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nHealth\nTennessee abortionabortion ban\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Sweeney\n\n\n                \n                    Catherine Sweeney is WPLN\u2019s health reporter.
