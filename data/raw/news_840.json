Jackson ruling are likely to disproportionately affect the Latina population.\n\n\n\nNearly half of childbearing-age Latinas in the U.S. currently live in states that ban or restrict abortions, UCLA researchers report, and the percentage of Latinas of childbearing age in each of those states is significantly higher than among their white counterparts. \n\nThe findings, from a study released today by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute, highlight the challenging post\u2013Dobbs v. Jackson reality for Latinas, who as a group already face heightened barriers in accessing health care and now face an increased risk of unwanted pregnancies and maternal mortality. \n\n\u201cAbortion bans have an outsized impact on our community, threatening the health and well-being of Latinas,\u201d said Sonja Diaz, founding director of the institute. \u201cOur data makes clear that Latinas must be at the forefront of policy discussions on reproductive justice and health care reform. Our leaders cannot stand idly by and wait for the impacts of Dobbs to ravage America\u2019s youthful and diverse communities of color.\u201d\n\nApproximately 5.1 million Latinas \u2014 46% of the Latina population between the ages of 18 and 44 \u2014 reside in the 29 states that restrict the reproductive rights of women. Their percentage has increased substantially over the past decade as a result of overall Latino population growth and the movement of Latinos into areas of the South and Midwest with historically sparse Latino communities, the researchers said. In North Dakota, for instance, the population of Latinas of childbearing age grew by 136% between 2010 and 2019, while in Texas, long a Latino stronghold, the population of childbearing-age Latinas jumped by 21%. On the whole, states that have seen the highest growth rates of Latinas of childbearing age are also states that have abortion restrictions.\n\nAn outsized impact on Latinas\n\nAlthough roughly 60% of non-Hispanic white women of childbearing age live in abortion-restrictive states, Latinas in each of those states are far more likely to be of childbearing age than white women, the study shows. In the 29 states that ban or restrict abortions, the proportion of Latinas who are of childbearing age ranges from\u00a049% to 77%, compared with 31% to 52% of\u00a0white women. In Alabama, for example, 67% of Latinas are between the ages of 18 and 44, versus 38% of white women. In North Dakota, those figures are 77% and 44%, respectively.\n\nThe study findings demonstrate that the potentially harmful impacts of the Dobbs ruling are likely to disproportionately affect Latinas, who will face challenges finding proper reproductive care and increased financial burdens if travel is required to states with greater access to reproductive health services, the authors said. The current research, they noted, builds on existing work showing that Latinas and other women of color already have higher rates of abortion while also facing barriers in accessing health care. \n\nThe researchers recommend that policymakers take the following actions to help limit the impact of the Dobbs decision on Latinas:\n\nFully adopting Medicaid expansion in their states to ensure access to adequate medical services and maternal and child health care.\nIncreasing funding for community-based clinics and state hospitals, particularly in non-restrictive states, to accommodate women who may travel to access reproductive health services.\nEnacting prohibitions on false and misleading advertising for reproductive health services.\n\n\n\u201cThe Dobbs decision exposed and aggravated existing health and health care disparities faced by Latinx communities,\u201d said Josefina Flores Morales, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cOur findings suggest Latinas will be most impacted by threats to their reproductive rights at a pivotal time in their lives, which can create lasting economic setbacks. To minimize harm, policymakers must take urgent action to implement policy solutions.\u201d\n\nThe study used demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most recent American Community Survey and other sources.\n\n\n        Tags:\n        \n        race and ethnicity | \n        \n        reproductive health | \n        \n        gender | \n        \n        nation | \n        \n        public health | \n        \n        public policy\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact\n\n\n  Kacey Bonner\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  lppipress@luskin.ucla.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Top UCLA News\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Health + Behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  UCLA receives $10 million to launch Howard and Irene Levine Family Center for Movement Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Faculty + Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  UCLA honored as a top producer of Fulbright U.S. Scholars for 2023\u201324 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Science + Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  UCLA\u2019s online engineering master\u2019s program again ranked No. 1 in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Environment + Climate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  UCLA and Equatic to build world\u2019s largest ocean-based plant for carbon removal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Connected\n\n\n\n\nSign up for a daily briefing\nGet top research & news headlines four days a week.\n(Check your inbox or spam filter for confirmation.)\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to a UCLA Newsroom RSS feed and our story headlines will be automatically delivered to your news reader.\nAll RSS Feeds \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n@UCLA on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\nNewsroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n@UCLA on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\nAll content\nArts + culture\nEnvironment + climate\nFaculty + staff\nHealth + behavior\nNation, world + society\nScience + technology\nStudents + campus\nUniversity news\nUCLA in the community\nUCLA Magazine\nCampus statements\nElection 2024\n\n\nFor news media\nMedia contacts at UCLA\nMedia advisories\nNews releases\nImages\nAbout UCLA: Fast facts\nMedia guide to faculty experts\nJournalist guide to UCLA\nUCLA on X\nMedia Relations staff\nUCLA Broadcast Studio\nNewsletter sign-up\n\n\nUCLA Sites\n\nHappenings\nAthletics\nExtension\nHealth\nGiving\nCOVID-19 Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA\n\n\nDirectory\nCalendar\nMaps\nParking\nCareers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Regents of University of California\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nAccessibility\nEmergency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Newsroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCategories\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tAll content\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tArts + culture\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tEnvironment + climate\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tFaculty + staff\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tHealth + behavior\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tNation, world + society\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tScience + technology\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tStudents + campus\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tUniversity news\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tUCLA in the community\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tUCLA Magazine\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tCampus statements\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tElection 2024\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor news media\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tMedia contacts at UCLA\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tMedia advisories\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tNews releases\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tImages\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tAbout UCLA: Fast facts\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tMedia guide to faculty experts\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tJournalist guide to UCLA\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tUCLA on X\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tMedia Relations staff\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tUCLA Broadcast Studio\n\t\t\n\n\n\n    \n\t\t\tNewsletter sign-up\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
