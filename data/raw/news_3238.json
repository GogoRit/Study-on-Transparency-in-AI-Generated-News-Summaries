Wade, a decision that has brought abortion to the forefront of the national conversation.\u00a0While pluralities of both men and women in the aggregate expressed support for abortion, men were almost evenly split down the line. Forty-eight percent of men surveyed said they identify as \"pro-choice,\" while 47% said they identify as \"pro-life.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the past 20 years, men over the age of 50 are the only group with a relatively steady increase in \"pro-life\" identification (up 11 percentage points) and a decline in \"pro-choice\" identification (down 6 percentage points) with numbers declining below 50%.Age is a significant factor: the only age demographic that has a greater percentage of individuals who identified as \"pro-life\" as over \"pro-choice\" were men over 50.When it comes to legal abortion under any circumstance, older men are the least supportive.\n\n\n\n                              Related stories\n                            \n\n\nWhile the percentage of young men, young women, and older women in support of abortion under any circumstance has steadily grown over time, the percentage of men over 50 who support such abortion rights is stagnant \u2014 although the greatest percentage of support of legal abortion under certain situations came from older men.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nSetting aside self-descriptions, overall support for abortion under certain or any conditions is significant and steady. In the three years from 2020 to 2022, on average 79% of men and 82% of women aged 18 to 49 as well as 82% of men and 81% of women 50 and up support abortion in at least some condition.Younger women from the ages of 18 to 49 reported the largest margin of difference (26 percentage points) between being \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\".\u00a0Support for \"pro-choice\" views among younger women in particular are 10 percentage points higher than they were two years ago.\u00a0Women over the age of 50 showed the most stability in their stance on abortion, but over the past three years have been become majority \"pro-choice\".\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the margin of difference between the two camps in this demographic group are not as stark as its younger counterpart, people who self-describe as \"pro-life\" steady declined beginning in 2020, while \"pro-choice\" numbers went up.Younger men, from the ages of 18 to 49, have been generally steady in their abortion-related beliefs, of late.Although a greater share of men (51%) in this demographic said they are \"pro-choice,\" a close 45% reported that they identify as \"pro-life.\" That is the smallest margin between the two identifiers reported by any of the four demographic groups in the survey.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Read next\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: What justices who overturned Roe said about abortion during confirmation hearings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRoe v Wade\nAbortion\nSupreme Court\n\n                      More...\n                    \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nClose icon\nTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.
