reproductive health and rights into Universal Health Coverage \u2013 and why does this mean a healthier world for all?When sexual and reproductive health services are integrated into universal health coverage, all people, everywhere, can get the quality care they need without financial hardship. \u201cEvery individual on the planet has sexual and reproductive health needs, which change throughout their lives,\u201d said Ian Askew, Director of the WHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research, including the UN\nSpecial Programme HRP.\u00a0\u201cFor all people to benefit from universal health coverage, countries are addressing the challenge of integrating services which meet those needs within each country\u2019s specific political, social, cultural, gender, economic and financial circumstances to protect the human right to the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health.\u201dThe WHO Compendium: interventions for UHC, including sexual and reproductive health The United Nations Political Declaration on UHC commits to a healthier world for all by 2030. A powerful new tool to support this work launches on December 14th, following\nUniversal Health Coverage Day: the WHO UHC Compendium of Health Interventions. It can assist countries in decision-making, prioritization and planning processes\naround packages of health services for UHC. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, and the promotion and protection of human rights, dignity, and empowerment of all people, are globally-agreed commitments underlying UHC, and the WHO UHC Compendium includes many interventions\nthat reflect these priorities.Pregnancy and birth, sexual well-being, reproductive choice, reproductive cancers, violence against women, and sexually transmissible infections are key areas for health interventions, recognized in the\u00a0WHO Reproductive Health Strategy\u00a0and\nthe Sexual health and its linkages to reproductive health: an operational approach.To ensure that these priorities are easily identified and addressed in national planning for UHC,Sexual and reproductive health interventions\nin the WHO UHC Compendium is now published alongside the Compendium. The impact of COVID-19 on sexual and reproductive health services COVID-19 has disrupted delivery of essential health services in many countries and stretched resources to the limits.However, it has also show that long-term investment in primary care and public health functions can build a resilient health system; one that continues to provide people with the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial\nhardship.\u201cThailand has been able to maintain service provision during the pandemic as a result of UHC and health systems capacity - and in some instances at slightly higher levels,\u201d said Warisa Panichkriangkrai, International Health\nPolicy Program, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand.\u201cThe National Health Security Office's monitoring system shows that coverage of standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) for persons living with HIV was 85.3% in 2019 and 88.5% in 2020. Average quarterly cervical screening coverage was 38.7% in 2019\nand 39.7% in 2020,\u201d added Viroj Tangcharoensathien, also at the Ministry of Public Health. Country context: expanding UHC through health benefit packagesUniversal Health Coverage: Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Focus, a new supplement published in Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters (SRHM), shows\nthat when it comes to this global commitment, countries are at different stages of progress: towards UHC generally, and comprehensive, rights-based sexual and reproductive health services specifically.Ministries of health are increasingly focusing on sets of services that can be realistically financed and delivered to meet a particular population need. \u201cSince 2016, the government of Burkina Faso has introduced a package of free healthcare for pregnant women and children under 5, which includes screening and treatment for cervical cancer. Family planning has been declared free in all regions of\nthe country since July 2020. The goal is to reduce the burden of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity,\u201d explained Dr Dina Gbenou, Technical Officer, SRHR, WHO Office, Burkina Faso. \u201cWHO, in collaboration with H6 Partners, is supporting the country on expanding the health benefits package and ensuring funding sustainability in the overall context of universal health coverage are as national priorities of the government,\u201d\nshe added.Such packages vary across settings, depending on health systems capacity, resource availability, priorities \u2013 and leadership, which is critical.\n\n\n\nRelated\nWHO & UNFPA are calling for implementation stories for the launch of the joint Learning by Sharing Portal on sexual and reproductive health and universal health coverage\u00a0(Submission\ndeadline: 20 May 2021)\u00a0AbortionCervical cancerContraceptionMaternal healthSexual transmitted infectionsUniversal Health CoverageViolence against womenSexual and reproductive health interventions in the WHO UHC Compendium\nMore\nSexual and Reproductive Health and COVID-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\nEastern Mediterranean\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\nWestern Pacific\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\nCyber security\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nPermissions and licensing\n\n\nPreventing sexual exploitation\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nReport misconduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\nPrivacy policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\u00a9\n\n2024\n\nWHO\n\n                       \n"
