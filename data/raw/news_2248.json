People have hit us with jump ropes and thrown human excrement at us in front of government buildings, college students dress up as vaginas and protest our displays, students approach us on campus and argue the morality of euthanizing children up through toddlerhood\u2026 You name it, we\u2019ve been there.\n\n\u201cQuit talking about abortion while there are hungry/sick/poor/abused people in the world.\u201d\n\u201cBeing pro-abortion is Christian.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d\n\nBut today, we\u2019re going to focus on one you may have heard before. \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to be pro-life unless you adopt.\u201d And this one is interesting, because almost every single pro-lifer will immediately feel defensive on this one. Just remember it\u2019s a bit irrational.\nWhat To Say First\nEveryone who feels called to adopt\u2026 should adopt. The desire to nurture children transcends political party and opinion on abortion; it\u2019s a human quality (for most people, anyway). Adoption is amazing and has allowed countless parents and children a new chance at a loving family. As Mike Pence recently noted, there are about the same number of couples hoping to adopt as there are abortions each year. That seems like an easy math equation.\nThis isn\u2019t to say adoption is always painless. Pro-lifers acknowledge the emotional difficulty that comes with carrying a child and parting ways after birth. But to live the human experience is to encounter pain. It can help us grow and change as people; what is difficult is not always bad.\nMultiple Students for Life team members have personal experience with adoption, and plenty of national activists do as well. Ryan Bomberger is one of them; he was conceived in rape, adopted, and has adopted children of his own. Here, he speaks on his experience at a rally in Alabama:\n\nThe Logic Doesn\u2019t Stand\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be pro-life unless you adopt\u201d is an argument that fails to hold up logically. You do not have to take a specific action in order to have the right to form an opinion on a topic. This idea doesn\u2019t hold up anywhere else. You don\u2019t have to be an African-American to believe that slavery was wrong. You can believe that human trafficking is wrong without donating to Polaris or another anti-trafficking organization. Your beliefs should motivate your actions, but actions are not pre-requisites to belief.\nIt\u2019s a common tactic that only seems to be thrown at pro-life people\u2026 despite not being applicable to any other social justice issue. You don\u2019t see anyone approaching pro-choice people and saying, \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to be pro-choice unless you counsel women with Post-Abortion Syndrome.\u201d It\u2019s a bullying tactic that\u2019s typically only dished with malicious intent.\nFurther, not everyone is able to adopt. Hypothetically, consider a single woman with a small income that only supports herself. She\u2019s not in a position to adopt a child; is she allowed to sidewalk counsel outside Planned Parenthood because she believes abortion is wrong? If an argument only holds up a little\u2026 it doesn\u2019t hold up at all.\nThe Fun Twist\nThe neat part is that pro-lifers\u00a0do\u00a0adopt. Heavily. Pro-life people adopt en masse, despite not\u00a0having to\u00a0in order to \u201cearn\u201d the title of being pro-life. And if we aren\u2019t adopting, we\u2019re participating in some other active, supportive service to benefit women facing unplanned pregnancies.\n\nIt\u2019s us who are running the 17,000+ pregnancy resource centers nationwide that provide free counseling, material resources, parenting classes, and sometimes even medical attention to those in need. And there are many more organizations in addition to literal pregnancy centers (such as maternity homes, charities, church organizations, and more).\nSo, this may be worth noting in a conversation in which someone is suggesting you aren\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d to be pro-life. But the lack of logic in the original accusation stands: You are allowed to believe a bad thing is wrong.
