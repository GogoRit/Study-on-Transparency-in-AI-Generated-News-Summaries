Joni Albrecht\nLB933, introduced by Thurston Sen. Joni Albrecht, would become operative contingent upon one of the three national \u201ctriggering\u201d events: if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, Congress enacts a law giving states complete authority to regulate abortion or the U.S. Constitution is amended to give states that authority.\nThe bill would prohibit both medical and chemical abortions starting at fertilization with no exception for cases of rape or incest. A physician who knowingly violates the bill\u2019s provisions would be subject to a Class IIA felony charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.\nA physician charged under the bill\u2019s provisions could claim a defense that the procedure was necessary to prevent a woman\u2019s death. A woman who attempts or has an abortion would not be liable under the bill. Medical treatment provided by a licensed physician that results in accidental death or injury of an unborn fetus also would not be a violation.\nAlbrecht filed a motion to place the bill on general file, even though the Judiciary Committee has not voted to advance it.\nShe said the state is facing a \u201chistoric moment\u201d that requires action from lawmakers. More than 200,000 abortions \u2014 a number equal to approximately 10 percent of the state\u2019s population \u2014 have occurred in Nebraska since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, she said.\n\u201cPull motions should indeed be rare, but they are allowed under our rules for a purpose,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201c[LB933] addresses a statewide issue with broad public support and the committee has declined to either advance or kill the bill. It has been 43 days since the bill hearing for LB933 in the committee.\u201d\nNorfolk Sen. Michael Flood spoke in support of the motion to pull the bill from committee. Nebraska is a pro-life state, he said, and the Legislature has a significant historical investment in protecting the lives of the unborn.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m not someone who is normally fond of pull motions \u2014 this is an issue that has been tearing at the hearts of Americans since Roe v. Wade was decided,\u201d Flood said. \u201cThis rises to the level of an issue that we must address.\u201d\nSen. Dave Murman of Glenvil also spoke in favor of the motion, saying it is important for bills to be debated by the full Legislature and for Nebraskans to provide input to their senators on how to vote.\n\u201cThe committee process works in most cases. But sometimes, the committees are set up so they don\u2019t reflect very closely at all what the makeup of the Legislature is,\u201d Murman said. \u201cIn that case, I think the pull motion is very valuable because the people of Nebraska need to know where their senators stand on the most important issues.\u201d\nOmaha Sen. Megan Hunt spoke in opposition to the motion. Hunt said the purpose of the committee process is for members to become experts in the subject matter that comes before the committee. Pull motions subvert that process, she said.\n\u201cIn the last four years, we\u2019ve seen this motion used time and time again to subvert the committee process to move radical, anti-women, anti-family [and] anti-choice bills through this Legislature in ways that the majority of Nebraskans just don\u2019t agree with,\u201d Hunt said.\nSen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha also spoke in opposition to the pull motion, saying the procedure should be reserved for addressing urgent matters. LB933 would not meet that standard because it is a \u201ctrigger\u201d bill, he said, and would take effect only if the U.S. Supreme Court gives states sole authority over the procedure.\n\u201cThe argument to pull a bill to the floor, to be debated and to be voted on by this body \u2014 that will actually have no effect unless certain circumstances happens \u2014 does not seem to meet the standard of a pull motion,\u201d Cavanaugh said.\nSenators voted 28-13 to adopt the motion to advance LB933 to general file. A majority vote of the Legislature was required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Social Security income tax phaseout stalls on second round\nProposal to end unfunded mandates advances \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost readDACA provision removed from law enforcement measure, bill advancedBudget advances with minor adjustments, more changes likelyFarmer, restaurateur earns seat at the tableAgriculture proposal amended, advancedDark fiber licensing authorizedResources\n\nLegislative interim hearing schedule\nLive video of Legislature via NPM\nLegislative publications\nCivic education resources\nLegislative calendar\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n October 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n October 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n July 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n October 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n October 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n May 2014 \n April 2014 \n March 2014 \n February 2014 \n January 2014 \n December 2013 \n October 2013 \n July 2013 \n June 2013 \n May 2013 \n April 2013 \n March 2013 \n February 2013 \n January 2013 \n October 2012 \n June 2012 \n May 2012 \n April 2012 \n March 2012 \n February 2012 \n January 2012 \n December 2011 \n November 2011 \n October 2011 \n June 2011 \n May 2011 \n April 2011 \n March 2011 \n February 2011 \n January 2011 \n December 2010 \n November 2010 \n October 2010 \n April 2010 \n November 2009 \n May 2009 \n April 2009 \n March 2009 \n February 2009 \n January 2009 \n January 2008 \n January 2007 \n January 2005 \n January 2003 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Unicameral Update.
