It would increase the votes needed from the current two-thirds majority of the legislature to three-quarters, making future reform of these provisions extremely difficult. The proposed amendment still needs a second vote to be ratified. The next legislative session will begin on January 25.\n\u201cHonduras\u2019 draconian legislation already bans abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, when the person\u2019s life and the health are in danger, and when the fetus will not survive outside the womb,\u201d said Ximena Casas, Americas women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThis decree will make it virtually impossible to carry out the recommendations from\u00a0multiple international human rights bodies\u00a0to\u00a0end this violation of\u00a0reproductive\u00a0rights.\u201d\nAbortion in Honduras is already\u00a0illegal\u00a0in all circumstances.\u00a0The country\u2019s criminal code imposes prison sentences of up to six years on people\u00a0who\u00a0undergo\u00a0abortions and medical professionals who provide them. The government also bans\u00a0emergency contraception, or \u201cthe morning after pill,\u201d which can prevent pregnancy after rape, unprotected sex,\u00a0or contraceptive failure.\nHonduras also bans same-sex marriage. The 2005\u00a0constitutional\u00a0amendment prohibits recognizing marriage between people of the same sex, including same-sex marriages contracted in other countries.\u00a0Honduras also\u00a0bans\u00a0adoption by same-sex couples.\n\u201cBy\u00a0seeking to permanently and comprehensively block any\u00a0possibility of accessing marriage for same-sex couples,\u00a0the Honduran Congress is entrenching state-sponsored homophobia,\u201d said Cristian Gonz\u00e1lez Cabrera, Americas lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cIn a country where LGBT\u00a0people\u00a0already\u00a0experience\u00a0high levels of violence and discrimination, this\u00a0effort to amend the\u00a0constitution\u00a0is sending the message that\u00a0these people\u00a0may\u00a0be further stigmatized.\u201d\nCurrently, all constitutional changes\u00a0need to\u00a0be ratified by a\u00a0two-thirds majority\u00a0in Congress in order to take effect.\u00a0On January 21,\u00a0Congress preliminarily approved the amendment\u00a0after one debate session, even though its rules of procedure require three debates unless there is an \u201curgency\u201d for any\u00a0draft bill.\nThe Special Commission charged with reviewing the proposed constitutional amendment held one consultation with feminist groups on January 19. One activist told Human Rights Watch that they were notified about the consultation less than 24 hours in advance. A group working on the rights of LGBT people told Human Rights Watch that LGBT groups were not consulted.\nThe reform violates\u00a0international human rights law, which establishes\u00a0that denying women and girls access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. The\u00a0bill\u00a0misleadingly\u00a0refers\u00a0to\u00a0Article 4(1) of the American Convention on Human Rights,\u00a0which\u00a0protects the right to life. The Inter-American Court\u00a0of Human Rights has\u00a0made clear that Article 4(1) does not\u00a0recognize an absolute right to life before birth. The court has also found\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0embryo\u00a0cannot be understood to be a human being for the purposes of Article 4(1).Human Rights Watch\u00a0has\u00a0researched and\u00a0seen\u00a0firsthand\u00a0the\u00a0devastating\u00a0consequences of banning abortion in Honduras.\u00a0Among others, Human Rights Watch interviewed\u00a0a woman forced to bear her rapist\u2019s child; a woman facing jail after having a miscarriage; a pro-choice pastor who has faced death threats for her activism;\u00a0and\u00a0a doctor who cannot always act in her patients\u2019 best interests.\n\n\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\nLife or Death Choices for Women Living Under Honduras\u2019 Abortion Ban \n\n\nWomen Tell Their Stories \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriminalizing abortions does not prevent people from ending unwanted pregnancies. It just forces them to put their health and lives at risk to end pregnancies in unsafe settings, desperate, in fear of prosecution, and without access to medical care.\nAccording to the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute,\u00a0in countries where abortion is prohibited or only permitted to save the life of the person who is pregnant, the abortion rate is higher than in those where abortion is allowed.\u00a0The\u00a0Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice\u00a0estimated\u00a0during\u00a0its visit to Honduras in 2018\u00a0that\u00a0between\u00a051,000 and 82,000 unsafe abortions occur each year\u00a0in the country.\nThe Special Commission\u00a0charged with reviewing the\u00a0proposed constitutional amendment\u00a0noted that\u00a0\u201ccreating a constitutional shield that makes it impossible to legalize the practice of abortion\u201d\u00a0is, in part, a response to\u00a0advances in \u201cPuerto Rico, Cuba, Uruguay and lately Argentina.\u201d This,\u00a0in addition to\u00a0organizing by religious groups,\u00a0suggests\u00a0a\u00a0concerted effort\u00a0within Honduras\u00a0to\u00a0make it harder for the country to join\u00a0others\u00a0that are making progress toward compliance with international human rights law on this issue.\nWith respect to same-sex marriage,\u00a0the\u00a0proposed law\u00a0violates\u00a0regional human rights standards that prohibit\u00a0arbitrarily treating same-sex couples differently from different-sex couples, including with respect to\u00a0marital rights. In a landmark\u00a02017 opinion, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stated that all rights applicable to family relationships of heterosexual couples should extend to same-sex couples. This opinion is applicable in\u00a0all\u00a023 states party, including Honduras.\nThe\u00a0legislation\u00a0would\u00a0also put\u00a0Honduras\u00a0out of step\u00a0with its neighboring countries.\u00a0Several of Honduras\u2019 neighbors have heeded the Inter-American\u00a0opinion. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Costa Rican and Ecuadorian constitutional courts ruled in favor of marriage equality, citing the Inter-American opinion. These advances follow a wave of earlier progress in Latin America, with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay recognizing same-sex marriages before the Inter-American opinion. In Mexico, 20 states have marriage equality, while same-sex couples in other states can marry but need authorization from a court.\nHonduras\u2019 own penal code prohibits\u00a0denying access to public services\u00a0on the basis of\u00a0sexual orientation or gender identity.\u00a0It also prohibits inciting\u00a0discrimination.\n\u201cThis proposed constitutional amendment represents an effort to block the long-overdue progress that we\u2019re seeing across much of the Americas region on sexual and reproductive rights and same-sex marriage,\u201d Casas said. \u201cThe Honduran Congress should recognize that access to abortion and same-sex marriage is protected by international human rights law and reject this abusive amendment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Honduras \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nTrans People at Risk in Honduras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 7, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nAnti-LGBT Persecution in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Contribute to Society\u201d\n\n\nThe Need for Legal Gender Recognition in Tabasco, Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWe Must Ask for What Is Already Ours\u201d\n\n\nAfro-descendant Women and Access to Land in Alto Mira y Frontera, Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nTrans People at Risk in Honduras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 7, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nAnti-LGBT Persecution in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
