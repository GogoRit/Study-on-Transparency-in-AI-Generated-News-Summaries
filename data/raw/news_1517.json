But the ACLU of Indiana, on behalf of abortion clinics, tried to get the justices to reconsider. It asked for the ban to be halted while the courts decide how far the serious health exception extends.\n\nREAD MORE: Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban was set to take effect Aug. 1. Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\r\n\tThe Supreme Court declined that request. Chief Justice Loretta Rush did express concern about the abortion ban\u2019s impact, while noting that the ACLU\u2019s legal effort to better define serious health risk must go through the normal judicial process.\n\r\n\tThe ban had been practically in effect since Aug. 1, since abortion clinics had stopped providing abortion care and hospitals were following the ban\u2019s limited exceptions.\n\nBrandon is our Statehouse bureau chief.
