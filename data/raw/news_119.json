Bogota, Colombia, last week in advance of their country's high court ruling on abortion legalization, expected this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nColombia\u2019s highest court is about to issue a ruling that could return the country to a total ban on abortion \u2013 or bring it in line with Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion in the U.S. Either way, because Colombia is one of the region's largest and more culturally influential countries, the decision could have a profound effect on abortion rights in Latin America.The region already has some of the world\u2019s strictest abortion laws \u2013 and now people on both sides of the debate hope a recent\u00a0\u2013 and admittedly unusual\u00a0\u2013 case will affirm their agendas.\u201cIt has opened up the discussion,\u201d says Marta Royo, the executive director of Profamilia, a reproductive health nonprofit in Colombia that supports abortion rights. She\u2019s referring to the national controversy over a young woman in Popay\u00e1n, Colombia, who last September decided she wanted an abortion when she was 12 weeks pregnant.Her unwanted pregnancy had made her so distraught doctors diagnosed her as suicidal. For the past 14 years, Colombia has permitted abortion if a woman\u2019s life is at risk. As a result, she could have the procedure legally.READ MORE: Could El Salvador's Draconian Abortion Ban Become Part of Florida's Debate?But Royo points out that while the unidentified woman had been trying to get an abortion since her first trimester, local clinics and healthcare officials blocked her.\u201cShe was denied access to the service for several weeks,\u201d Royo says. \u201cWhy does she have to go through everything that has happened to her just to have access to her rights?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until her seventh month \u2013 this month \u2013 that a judge intervened and granted an abortion, with Profamilia\u2019s help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Courtesy Profamilia\nMarta Royo speaking on reproductive rights in Bogota, Colombia, in 2018.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe understand how hard it is for the public to face, that a woman had an abortion when she was seven months pregnant,\u201d Royo concedes. \u201cBut we also have to consider the barriers she faced,\u201d obstacles she says countless Colombian women still confront even when their abortion request is legal.On one side, people are pointing to the Popay\u00e1n case as proof that Colombia has become far too lenient on abortion. \u201cThis is not a proper use of the criteria for legal abortion in Colombia,\u201d a Popay\u00e1n government spokesman, Jaime L\u00f3pez, told the Bogot\u00e1 daily El Tiempo.The other side says it only illustrates the need for more legal access to abortion. \u201cThe only way for Colombia to move forward and avoid more situations like this,\u201d Royo insists, \u201cis to advance the legalization ruling.\u201dIn that 2006 ruling, Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court legalized abortion in cases of rape or incest, severe fetus malformation or a threat to the mother\u2019s life.Now, in no small part because of cases like the Popay\u00e1n woman, the court is studying petitions to expand that ruling and legalize any abortion in the first trimester. At the same time, it\u2019s hearing petitions to reverse the 2006 ruling and criminalize all abortions again. A decision could come as early as Wednesday.\u201cIf the court goes back to before 2006, for us it would be a huge victory,\" says Adolfo Casta\u00f1eda, an anti-abortion activist in Miami who directs Hispanic education for Human Life International, a Roman Catholic nonprofit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Courtesy Human Life International\nAdolfo Castaneda addressing an anti abortion forum in Miami Beach last summer.\n\n\n\nHuman Life is based in Virginia, but it\u2019s watching Colombia because it wants Latin America and the Caribbean to retain its strict abortion limits. No region in the world has as many countries \u2013 six \u2013 that ban abortion outright. (Only two small countries and one city \u2013 Cuba, Uruguay and Mexico City \u2013 have legalized all abortions in the first trimester.) The group hopes reaffirming the status quo there will influence Hispanics in the U.S. \u2013 who\u00a0polls show are trending toward abortion rights. (Most younger Hispanics and those born in the U.S. do favor legalized abortion.)\u201cI think [returning to a total abortion ban in Colombia] would have a positive effect on Hispanics here, especially Colombians, realizing that in their own country and Latin America life is still respected from conception to natural death,\u201d says Casta\u00f1eda. \u201cRealizing that abortion does not help the health of women.\u201dDian Alarcon disagrees. She was a teenager in Cali, Colombia, when she says she had to seek a clandestine, back-alley abortion.\n\n\nIt's brutality to have to have an illegal, unsafe abortion \u2013 to feel like a criminal when you're really a victim of the conditions for women in Colombia. \u2013Dian Alarcon\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to knock on an enormous wooden door,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSomeone opened a peephole and I had to give a password. I couldn\u2019t afford local anesthesia, so I fainted during the procedure.\u201dToday, Alarcon is an abortion rights activist in Miami with the nonprofit National Latina Institute. She takes issue with the anti-abortion petitioners who are telling Colombia\u2019s high court right now that even legal abortions cause women the kind of trauma she experienced.Those advocates did not respond to WLRN\u2019s interview request. But their lead attorney, Natalia Bernal Cano, recently told the Colombian daily El Espectador\u00a0that the 2006 ruling is unconstitutional \u2013 not just because she says it denies unborn children their human rights, but because studies show, she insists, that permitting any abortion \u201csubjects a woman to excessively grave mental health risks such as post-traumatic depression.\u201dAbortion rights advocates argue illegal, dangerous abortions like the one Alarcon suffered are far more detrimental to women. They also point out hundreds of thousands of women whose pregnancies don\u2019t meet the 2006 conditions still undergo illicit abortions in Colombia earch year, according to estimates \u2013 a situation likely to worsen if the court returns Colombia to a total abortion ban.\n\n\nBanning all abortions again in Colombia would have a positive effect on Hispanics here \u2013 to realize that in Latin America life is still respected from conception to natural death. \u2013Adolfo Castaneda\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brutality,\u201d says Alarcon, \u201cnot just the unsafe abortion, but the feeling you\u2019re a criminal when in reality you\u2019re a victim of conditions for women in Colombia.\u201dAlarcon echoes a central argument most abortion rights activists make in Colombia, if not the rest of Latin America. Because the country\u2019s gender violence rate is so high \u2013 an estimated third of Colombian women have suffered it, a product of factors such as half a century of civil war that only recently ended \u2013 a larger than usual share of its pregnancies also result from that violence.Even under the 2006 guidelines, \u201cwe know women that have had experiences of sexual violence being afraid of not being believed and as a result having to get [illegal] abortions on their own,\u201d says Laura Mu\u00f1oz a Colombian-American in Miami and founder of the nonprofit Poderosa, or Powerful, which advocates for victims of sexual violence here and in Colombia.Mu\u00f1oz fears outright criminalizing those abortions again will only further silence rape and incest victims: \u201cThis is just one piece of a larger puzzle of systematic violence against women across Latin America.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Courtesy Poderosa\nLaura Munoz speaking in Miami to promote aid to sexual violence victims in South Florida and Colombia.\n\n\n\nBut the anti-abortion forces may have more to worry about this week. Of the Constitutional Court\u2019s nine justices, three of whom are women, four appear in favor of legalizing all abortions in the first trimester; three look opposed, and two are swing votes. Given that math, abortion rights advocates say they can at least count on the court not to reverse its 2006 ruling \u2013 especially since their 2017 poll showed two-thirds of Colombians agree with it.\u201cWe think that will give the legalization sentiment on the court more momentum,\u201d says Dr. Ana Cristina Gonz\u00e1lez, spokeswoman and co-founder of La Mesa, the Colombian reproductive health and abortion rights nonprofit that conducted the 2017 survey.\u201cMost of the justices on the court today seem more committed to women\u2019s rights,\u201d says Gonz\u00e1lez, \u201cand I think they see the 2006 ruling doesn\u2019t go far enough to protect them.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear what share of Colombians support and oppose legalizing all abortions. A Pew Research Center poll six years ago showed three-fourths opposed it, but little if any reliable polling has emerged since then.Still, Colombia may be in a moment similar to the U.S. in 1973. Americans then were conflicted about legalizing abortion, but a majority of the Supreme Court made Roe v. Wade the law of the land. If that majority exists on Colombia's high court, it could dramatically alter expectations about abortion across Latin America.\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nLatin America Report\nAmericasLatin AmericaColombiaabortionMarta RoyoProfamiliaColombian Constitutional CourtPopayanAdolfo CastanedaHuman Life InternationalHispanicsNational Latina InstituteNatalia Bernal CanoLaura MunozPoderosasexual violenceRoe v.
