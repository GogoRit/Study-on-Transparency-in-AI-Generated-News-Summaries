Women Speak Out PAC now has spent at least $190,000 in support of Walker, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission. The super PAC is affiliated with a nonprofit named Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which aims to \u201cend abortion by electing national leaders and advocating for laws that save lives, with a special calling to promote pro-life women leaders.\u201d\n\nWomen Speak Out spent $125,000 on digital ads opposing Walker\u2019s rival, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and $40,000 on canvassing between Oct. 5 and Oct. 7.\n\nSpokespeople for the group and Walker\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to inquiries. Reached last Tuesday, Women Speak Out said it was standing by Walker. \u201cHerschel Walker has denied these allegations in the strongest possible terms, and we stand firmly alongside him,\u201d said Mallory Carroll, a vice president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-life America and spokeswoman for Women Speak Out. \u201cTo date, our Georgia field team has visited more than 310,000 homes across the state in support of pro-life candidates like Herschel and against the extremism of Sen. Warnock and Stacey Abrams, and we will continue through Election Day.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Donald Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again Inc. super PAC reported that it spent $916,000 on ads opposing Warnock.Republican U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker speaks to a standing-room-only crowd of supporters in suburban Atlanta, on Aug. 17, 2022.

Yes, You Read That Right.\u201d\n\n\nMeet The Billionaires Funding The Battle For Control Of The House Of Representatives \n\u201cTwo rival super PACs focused on November\u2019s midterm House elections have raised a total of nearly $100 million from at least 59 of the country\u2019s richest people. But the billionaire donors to the Republican PAC gave nearly four times more than the Democrats,\u201d reports Matt Durot.\n\n At least 59 billionaires reported giving a total of nearly $100 million to a pair of super PACs dueling for control of the U.S. House of Representatives. These party-aligned groups have hoarded much of the cash so far, but if history is any indication, the floodgates are about to open.\n     .Forbes\nContinuing Irresolutions \nUpdates on Checks & Imbalances\u2019 previous reporting\nJohn Ratcliffe, the onetime Texas congressman who Donald Trump appointed to be his director of national intelligence, is terminating his campaign committee, according to a filing submitted to the Federal Election Commission Tuesday.\nOver the past 20 months, Ratcliffe\u2019s campaign paid his wife, Michele, $43,500 to manage its largely dormant books. Payments to Mrs. Ratcliffe, a partner focusing on estate planning and cyber crimes at the Rockwall, Texas law firm of Lamberth Ratcliffe Covington, made up 36% of the campaign\u2019s pending during the 2022 cycle. Ratcliffe\u2019s campaign also shelled out $11,000 for \u201cwebsite design\u201d to the firm that built his personal site for him, a payment that could violate campaign-finance rules.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s filing, Ratcliffe reported repaying himself $225,000 for a loan he made to his campaign. The reimbursement came two months after the Supreme Court ruled in FEC v. Ted Cruz that a limit on how much candidates could repay themselves for loans was unconstitutional.\nIn a separate FEC filing on Tuesday, the campaign advised that its reported cash on hand has been off by $4,600 since 2014.\nNeither Ratcliffe responded to inquiries.\n*****\nSecret Service police still were still on watch outside of former National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s suburban D.C. home as of Monday afternoon. Iran is plotting to assassinate Bolton, reported the Washington Examiner in March. The Secret Service has been protecting Bolton since at least January.\nDeSantis Sued By Florida Watchdog Group\u2014Here\u2019s All The Legal Fallout He Faces For Flying Migrants To Martha\u2019s Vineyard \n\u201cFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and his office were sued by the state\u2019s Center for Government Accountability (FLCGA) on Monday, over allegations it illegally withheld public records related to the state flying approximately 50 Venezuelan migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts\u2014the latest legal exposure DeSantis has faced since he took credit for the migrants\u2019 flights,\u201d reports Alison Durkee.\n\n FLCGA\u2019s lawsuit asks the state court to compel DeSantis\u2019s office to turn over a range of documents related to the Martha\u2019s Vineyard flights\u2014including phone logs and any communications with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), as the migrants\u2019 flights originated in that state\u2014alleging it has not fulfilled the group\u2019s records requests or responded to them in \u201cgood faith,\u201d as state law requires.\n\n\n\n\n\n Florida state Sen. Jason Pizzo (D), acting as a private citizen, sued DeSantis and other state officials in September, taking issue with the state\u2019s program that uses taxpayer money to \u201cfacilitate the transport of unauthorized aliens from this state consistent with federal law\u201d through private companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n That lawsuit argues the state flying migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard violated that measure because they were not in the country unlawfully and their flight originated in Texas and not Florida\u2014meaning they were not \u201cfrom this state\u201d\u2014and asks the court to declare the statute unconstitutional altogether, or at least bar the state from transporting any more migrants who aren\u2019t from Florida.\nFlorida Gov.
