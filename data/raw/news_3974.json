Much of her performing in the past year or so has been directly connected to matters of the womb, as part of her album and accompanying tour show There Will Be No Intermission.\"I've been on a world tour for the past year talking really, really frankly, about these subjects,\" she said. \"I thought it would be great to talk about some of the songs that I mention on stage. Songs that have really inspired me, helped me, taught me.\"There's a long history in music and songwriting addressing reproductive rights.\"Usually, especially when women go through this stuff, it's just the sort of thing that you don't want to address.\"It's really hard to write about a topic like abortion, for the same reason that it's hard to just talk about at a dinner party or a cocktail party. It's awkward. It's intimate, it's personal, and it's highly charged politically.\"I have found it really hard to wrap my head around how you attack a topic like this. There's a lineage of songs about abortion. I think there were certain artists that really broke through this taboo.\"Here are a selection of those songs. You can listen to the full show here.Ani DiFranco \u2013 'Lost Woman Song'LoadingOne of these artists and one of the songs that I'd really like to play for you is one of my songwriting heroes, Ani DiFranco. She hasn't broken out as much in Australia as much as she did in America, especially in the 90s.She was like the feminist, college circuit, unapologetic, super honest, 'Oh my god, did she actually just say that in a song?' songwriters. And in this song, she just confronts it head on.Robyn \u2013 'Giving You Back'LoadingI read this amazing interview that Robyn gave in the New York Times and she was talking about her career and that album [My Truth] which came out in 1999.The original album had a song about abortion on it and her American label made her take it off the record, which is just astounding to me. The lyrics aren't even very direct. Unless of course, you're actually listening to the lyrics.The Dresden Dolls \u2013 'Mandy Goes to Med School'LoadingI had my first abortion when I was 17 years old and I really, really wanted to write about it. But I found it just an impossible songwriting subject to tackle.On The Dresden Dolls' second record [2006's Yes, Virginia...], I gave it a crack. This is sort of a song from a Lost Ark piece of musical theatre. It casts me and my drummer Brian Viglione as zany, back alley abortionists.This is the best I could do in my late 20s, trying to tackle a topic as personal and as strange and as complicated as abortion. But I gave it my best shot.Ben Folds Five \u2013 'Brick'LoadingOne of my songwriting heroes is Ben Folds. This song is so strange, because this was Ben's breakout hit in the mid-90s.The thing that is so astounding to me about this song is that I remember hearing the song back in the 90s and totally not grasping what it was about. It wasn't until I was 15 years down the road and working with Ben Folds that I went back and revisited the song and realised, 'Oh my god, how did I miss that?'This is a song about abortion, written from the perspective of the boyfriend. It says a lot about Ben's songwriting capacities and political bravery that he was willing to put out a song like this. Especially being from the south in America, where abortion is not only close to criminalised but a really taboo subject to make art about.In these lyrics Ben really rides the line. He doesn't make a political statement, he does what a good artist does: he tells an emotional story and he takes you to the moment.Tori Amos \u2013 'Spark'LoadingTori Amos, when she put this album out [1998's From The Choirgirl Hotel], talked really openly in the press about what it feels like to go through miscarriage. In her case, multiple miscarriages.I remember reading the press at the time and being so impressed by her candour, her bravery to talk about such personal things in interviews with magazines. I remember being so inspired by her and how willing she was to just be brutally honest.This is a song from that record really clearly inspired by her miscarriage, and obviously a lot of other things going at the time. In that Tori Amos way, it's like you can't really tell what's about what.If today's Artist in Residence program has brought up feelings for you, you can always talk to someone at Lifeline on 13 11 14Listen to Artist In Residence each Sunday afternoon from 3pm, repeated Wednesday nights from 10pm, and available any time online.
