On Saturday, fewer than 10,000 participants are expected to attend the fourth annual Women\u2019s March in Washington, DC. But to leaders of women\u2019s movements around the country, the decline doesn\u2019t represent a collapse of women\u2019s activism, but rather a channeling of the energy of the 2017 Women\u2019s March into more tangible causes at the state and local level across the country.\u00a0\n\u201cI see the Women\u2019s March from 2017 as a very public statement,\u201d says Hilary Levey Friedman, president of the Rhode Island chapter of the National Organization for Women, who participated in the 2017 Rhode Island Women\u2019s March. She adds, \u201cOf course that same event just isn\u2019t going to get the same continued attention, but that doesn\u2019t mean that that power and interest has dissipated. It just means that people are learning to harness it on specific things.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nRhode Island is at the center of that new effort. State legislatures passed more bills to protect abortion rights in 2019 than in the previous 10 years combined. Rhode Island hadn\u2019t adopted pro-choice legislation in more than 40 years when it passed a bill in June to guarantee the right to an abortion in case\u00a0Roe v. Wade is struck down.\nKelly Nevins became executive director of the Women\u2019s Fund of Rhode Island, a local nonprofit that invests in women and girls, just two weeks before the election of Donald Trump.\u00a0She remembers the rush of activism that followed the 2017 Women\u2019s March. \u201cWe had been fairly quiet for a while,\u201d says Nevins, \u201cbut when all of that happened, there was a surge of people, particularly of women, that felt that women\u2019s rights were being attacked and had a thirst and interest for doing something local.\u201d\u00a0\nNevins\u2019 organization joined with several other groups, including the Womxn Project, the Rhode Island chapter of NOW, and Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, to push the Rhode Island state legislature to pass the abortion rights bill last year. This was a massive feat in the country\u2019s most Catholic state, where several top Democratic lawmakers had been endorsed by Rhode Island Right to Life, an anti-abortion group. Nevins credits the show of force at the Women\u2019s March with empowering women.\nStill, 2019 was hardly a slam dunk for women\u2019s rights. The onslaught of abortion bans, primarily in the South and Midwest, demoralized many women and may have left many feeling that there was nothing to celebrate three years after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0\nThe declining number of marchers may also have to do with the controversy surrounding last year\u2019s march.\u00a0Tamika Mallory, one of the co-presidents of the 2019 march, was criticized for attending an event with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, where he recited anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Sources told Tablet magazine that Mallory had said Jewish people\u00a0were particularly guilty of exploiting black and brown people\u00a0and were leaders of the slave trade. The Women\u2019s March later issued\u00a0a statement disavowing Farrakhan and anti-Semitism. Mallory ultimately stepped down. Amid the controversy, so did two other leaders of the march, Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian-American activist, and Bob Bland, a fashion designer and activist.\nMeanwhile, some activists had begun to question whether the original march represented real activism or just dissatisfaction with Trump\u2019s election.\nIsa Noyola, a trans Latina activist and a new member of the march\u2019s executive board, acknowledges previous critiques of the march and believes that despite the smaller crowds, this year\u2019s march will be a productive and intersectional space. \u201cI was not a part of the first marches, nor did I feel represented,\u201d explains Noyola, adding, \u201cI was very critical in the beginning.\u201d As someone involved in activism for most of her life, she felt that the original march struggled to center marginalized communities that had already been engaged in fights for equality long before the march\u2019s inception. She also thought it had a hard time connecting to grassroots organizers.\u00a0\nOne of the biggest changes this year will be a focus on four core issues\u2014reproductive rights, immigration, gender-based violence, and climate change\u2014marking a departure from the broad scope of the first march. Noyola says this year\u2019s march will highlight global movements for women\u2019s liberation and grassroots activism. There will be no speakers or celebrity guest stars. Instead, the Chilean protest group Lastesis will lead demonstrators on a march to the White House, where they will perform a rendition of \u201cUn violador en tu camino\u201d (\u201cA rapist in your path\u201d), a Chilean anthem that has come to represent global movements against gender-based violence.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d says Noyola. \u201cFor folks not showing up, there\u2019s so many opportunities to show up in your local communities, your local organizing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for news you can trust?\n\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n\nAN IMPORTANT UPDATEWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming up short on donations month after month.
