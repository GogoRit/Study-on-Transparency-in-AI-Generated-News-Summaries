(Lindsey Wasson for The Washington Post)ShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveShe introduced herself to a room full of conservative lawmakers as a bisexual woman, a longtime political progressive and the leader of a radical feminist organization.Listening to Natasha Chart through a Skype call were more than a dozen South Dakota state representatives, most of them Republican, considering a bill to criminalize medical treatments for transgender children.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight\u201cDoctors shouldn\u2019t help kids take out their sadness and anger on the only bodies we can ever have,\u201d she said in her testimony to South Dakota\u2019s House State Affairs Committee on Jan. 22. \u201cPlease vote yes to forbid the sterilization of these young people.\u201dThe Women\u2019s Liberation Front is part of a long-running strain of feminism that rejects the existence of transgender identity. These fringe activists argue that advancements in transgender rights will come at the expense of women\u2019s rights and threaten the safety and sanctity of women-only spaces. They say women are defined not by their gender identity, but by their biology and by having \u201csurvived girlhood.\u201dAdvertisementMainstream progressives have long shunned the organization, calling it a discriminatory, right-wing group disguised as feminist. But the Women\u2019s Liberation Front, also known as WoLF, has found an increasingly influential platform by teaming up with conservatives who disagree with their support of abortion rights and the \u201creproductive sovereignty\u201d of women.WoLF\u2019s leaders have become frequent guests on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and at Heritage Foundation events. The group received a $15,000 grant from the Alliance Defending Freedom to help fund a legal fight against the Obama administration over transgender bathroom policies. It also filed an amicus brief in one of the most consequential Supreme Court cases of the year, arguing that sex-based discrimination protections in the workplace should not apply to transgender people.Now, WoLF is even helping shape legislation in places like South Dakota, which last month became the first state to advance a wave of state bills nationwide banning medical interventions for transgender youth. Kara Dansky, a WoLF board member from the District, plans to travel to South Dakota on Monday to testify in favor of the bill in a Senate committee hearing.AdvertisementEmboldened by the Trump administration and a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Republican politicians across the country have made transgender issues, particularly those affecting transgender children, a key target for 2020. And Chart and other radical feminists are helping to bolster their message, creating the perception of bipartisan support in a polarizing social debate.Republican state lawmakers push bills to restrict medical treatments for transgender youthsRia Tabacco Mar, director of the Women\u2019s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the partnership a \u201cfalse alliance\u201d that seeks to divide the LGBTQ community, as well as progressives.\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s driving their influence \u2014 the false claiming of a feminist mantle and attaching that label to anti-transgender positions,\u201d Tabacco Mar said. \u201cThis is not a principle of crossing party lines. This is a principle of exclusion.\u201dAdvertisementBut the members of WoLF, many of whom are lesbian, claim they are the victims of exclusion and \u201ccancel culture.\u201d They say they\u2019ve been kicked off Twitter, excommunicated from social circles and fired from jobs for expressing their views on gender identity.In December, J.K. Rowling drew widespread outrage for tweeting in support of one such employee, a British researcher who claimed she was fired for her anti-trans social media posts, or as Rowling put it, for \u201cstating that sex is real.\u201d Within hours, one of the trending topics on Twitter was \u201cJK Rowling is a TERF,\u201d a commonly used acronym for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201dDespite the final Harry Potter book publishing in 2007, author J.K. Rowling continues to add to the series\u2019 narrative, resulting in \u201cretroactive continuity.\u201d (Video: Blair Guild/The Washington Post)Last weekend, the tensions between the TERFs and transgender advocates erupted at the Seattle Public Library as hundreds of women converged for a WoLF-organized event, \u201cFighting the New Misogyny: A Feminist Critique of Gender Identity.\u201d More than 2,400 people signed a petition demanding that the library cancel the event, urging it not to use a \u201cpublic venue to spread hate against transgender people.\u201d But the library cited its commitment to intellectual freedom, even when it disagrees with the views of an organization.AdvertisementOn Saturday night, as hundreds of people packed the auditorium, about as many protesters stood outside, waving trans pride flags and shouting \u201cTERFs go home!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t fight for ALL women,\u201d one sign read, \u201cyou fight for no women.\u201dA new platform for a decades-old message The fight between radical feminists and transgender rights advocates began decades ago, amid the second-wave feminism of the 1970s.Mary Daly, a self-described \u201cradical lesbian feminist\u201d who taught at Boston College, argued that transgender women aren\u2019t women, because \u201cno male can assume female chromosomes and life history/experience.\u201d Her student, Janice Raymond, wrote the 1979 book \u201cThe Transsexual Empire,\u201d pushing the belief that transgender women reinforce outdated gender stereotypes and pose a threat to gender equality.AdvertisementWoLF supports abortion rights and combating violence against women. But the group\u2019s recent work has overwhelmingly focused on fighting against the growing transgender rights movement.\u201cGender identity is literally threatening to erase women and girls as a meaningful category \u2026 in language and in law,\u201d said Dansky, one of the group\u2019s most vocal leaders. \u201cWe view that as an emergency.\u201dRejected by mainstream feminists, the group has increasingly found a home with conservative organizations. And what\u2019s unusual is WoLF\u2019s \u201cwillingness not just to sort of flirt with the right, but to full-on coalition,\u201d said Nancy Whittier, a Smith College professor who specializes in gender and social movements.WoLF began aligning itself with conservative groups in 2016, after the Obama administration released its \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter providing guidance for Title IX protections for transgender students in schools. WoLF filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department, and later an amicus brief to the Supreme Court opposing a Virginia student\u2019s right to use bathrooms that matched his gender identity.AdvertisementDansky appeared on Fox News and in a video on the website for the Family Policy Alliance arguing that the transgender bathroom policy would be harmful for girls and women. \u201cHow wrong does something have to be for a Christian pro-family organization and a self-described radical-feminist group to oppose it together at the Supreme Court?\u201d the Family Policy Alliance website stated.Share this articleShareWoLF\u2019s name also appears alongside conservative Christian groups in a \u201cParent Resource Guide\u201d about \u201cResponding to the Transgender Issue,\u201d which has circulated among conservative parent groups across the country, even in increasingly liberal places such as Virginia\u2019s Loudoun County.Angry parents protest LGBTQ books in Virginia classroomsLast year, Dansky joined Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) at a news conference to oppose the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected class to federal civil rights law. In October, WoLF helped organize a rally outside the Supreme Court in opposition to the case of transgender funeral director Aimee Stephens.AdvertisementAnd that same month, Chart spoke at a Heritage Foundation event in Washington, attended by state Rep. Fred Deutsch, the conservative South Dakota legislator who sponsored the bill restricting transgender medical treatments for youth.Deutsch reached out to Chart, WoLF\u2019s board chair, on Twitter, she said. He later asked both Chart and Dansky to testify in support of his bill in a House committee hearing. And when the bill faced a vote on the full House floor a week later, Deutsch invoked Dansky, referring to her as a \u201clifelong Democrat and former ACLU lawyer\u201d who \u201ccame to testify for a Republican.\u201dThe bill passed the House, 46 to 23. A flurry of other state bills focused on trans youth have emerged across the country, and WoLF is already in talks with some of their sponsors.\u2018Cancelled Women\u2019 AdvertisementWoLF claims about 700 members nationwide, a group that Dansky said has grown steadily in recent years. Many of them communicate via a Gab server called \u201cSpinster,\u201d which has become an outlet for anti-trans feminists who have been kicked off other social media platforms or who want to keep their views hidden from their employers.Several women who identified as members of WoLF declined to give their full names to The Post, citing fears of harassment or other repercussions in their social lives or workplaces.Until about a month ago, Dansky worked as a general counsel on the District of Columbia\u2019s Sentencing Commission. While the commission\u2019s director confirmed that she voluntarily resigned, Dansky said she felt the pressure to do so from critics who reached out to her boss to condemn her views on gender identity. Ultimately, Dansky said, the role became \u201cuntenable\u201d given her role with WoLF. Another WoLF member, a 29-year-old who provided only her first name, Karen, works as a software engineer in Seattle and served as the lead organizer of the Seattle library event.She said she started digging into radical feminist writings after she was shut down by a circle of mostly queer friends when she asked them critical questions about gender identity. \u201cBeing told that I was just hateful for even asking these fairly straightforward questions really kind of pushed me to actually question this even further,\u201d she said.The group decries what it sees as the \u201ccancel culture\u201d of the political left. It\u2019s even become part of the group\u2019s brand. A recent event hosted by WoLF in New York was titled \u201cAn Evening With Cancelled Women.\u201d The original location for the gathering, the New York Public Library, ultimately rejected the booking, forcing them to find a different meeting place. \u201cThat\u2019s right. They cancelled us,\u201d Chart wrote in a statement on WoLF\u2019s website.Heron Greenesmith, a senior research analyst with the social justice think tank Political Research Associates, who tracks the group, argues this \u201cpositioning of martyrdom and silencing\u201d is also a strategy to underscore the group\u2019s image as a beleaguered faction of the left, \u201cdespite the fact that they\u2019re being platformed by the largest, most-funded legal organizations in the world.\u201d In reality, LGBTQ advocates say, transgender people \u2014 particularly transgender women of color \u2014 continue to be among the most marginalized communities in America. At least 26 transgender or gender-nonconforming people were killed last year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The American Medical Association has called the pattern of violence an \u201cepidemic.\u201dBut at the Seattle Public Library event last weekend, the leaders of WoLF again portrayed themselves as the targets of attacks from the progressive movement.\u201cWe expected authoritarianism from the right. We weren\u2019t prepared for it from the left,\u201d said Lierre Keith, one of WoLF\u2019s founding members and a speaker on the event\u2019s panel. \u201cThe most basic facts of biology are now considered a hate crime, which means the reality of women\u2019s lives are back to being unspeakable.\u201dAs the program began, a group of 10 ticket holders seated in the back \u2014 some of them transgender women \u2014 chanted \u201ctrans rights are human rights.\u201dWhen library staff asked them to leave, eight of them agreed. But two refused to move. Other women stood to face them, crossing their arms. As the protesters continued to chant, it energized the crowd.\u201cLet women speak!\u201d they shouted. \u201cLet women speak!\u201dOfficers arrested two of the protesters for trespassing, according to Seattle police.\u201cDon\u2019t take him to a woman\u2019s prison,\u201d one woman shouted, assuming the protester was transgender. \u201cHe\u2019s a man.\u201dAs the police officers escorted the protesters out of the building, the crowd burst into cheers, and the event continued.Correction: Because of incorrect information provided by WoLF, an earlier version of this story included an incorrect figure for the group\u2019s membership. It is 700, not 300. The story has been revised.Read more:Transgender sex workers feel under attack.
