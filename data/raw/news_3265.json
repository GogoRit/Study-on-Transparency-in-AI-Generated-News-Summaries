Wade a \u201chistoric victory\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. Nevertheless, he said, it \u201cwon\u2019t distract\u201d voters from more important issues like crime and inflation.\nIn Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson acknowledged in May that things could get a \u201clittle messy\u201d for some people who need abortions. But, he said, they can still drive across state lines to Illinois, so abortion wouldn\u2019t be \u201cthe big political issue everybody thinks it is\u201d come November.\nIn Ohio, J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for an open Senate seat, said the country is entering a \u201cnew phase of the pro-life movement,\u201d quoted from the Christian Bible, and decried the world view that it is \u201cbad for women to become mothers but liberating for them to work 90 hours a week in a cubicle.\u201d He then turned back to rising fuel costs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three are White, Republican men running in competitive U.S. Senate races this year. Their respective states represent the patchwork of new realities facing those trying to access abortion care: Nevada voters approved a referendum in 1990 that protects abortion up to 24 weeks pregnancy, Wisconsin has a ban from the 1800s on the books and its clinics have started referring patients out of state, and Ohio now has a six-week abortion ban in place without exceptions for rape, incest or severe fetal abnormalities.\u00a0\nAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s June 24 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Laxalt, Johnson and Vance all praised the ruling ending nearly 50 years of federal abortion rights. Then, they pivoted back to talking about other issues, like fuel prices or immigration, and did not focus on the role they could play in further restricting abortion rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    How the anti-abortion movement shaped campaign finance law and paved the way for Trump\n                \n\n\n\n                    Democratic leaders in red states are figuring out what they can do to help people seeking abortions\n                \n\n\n\n                    Biden administration officials offer few details on medication abortion protections\n                \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the Dobbs decision, it\u2019s pretty clear the Democrats are the ones who want to be talking about abortion, and the Republicans don\u2019t,\u201d said Kyle Kondik with Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a publication that provides nonpartisan political analysis based at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\nHe said overturning Roe \u201cwas something Republicans have pushed for for a long time, and have pushed for through their judicial appointments, and it finally happened but it was not a decision that was broadly supported by the public.\u201d So, Kondik added, it makes sense that GOP candidates prefer to talk\u00a0 about inflation and the economy and other \u201careas where the president is struggling, frankly.\u201d\nA snap poll done by Marist for NPR and PBS NewsHour the weekend after the court\u2019s Dobbs ruling showed that 56 percent of Americans oppose the decision. Votes were more likely to \u201csupport congressional candidates who pledge to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade,\u201d the poll found \u2014\u00a0men by 12 points and women by 18 points. More than 60 percent of women, including 74 percent of suburban women \u2014 a coveted battleground voting bloc \u2014 are \u201cconcerned that the court\u2019s decision is a harbinger of things to come\u201d when it comes to marriage equality and the use of contraception.\nA separate survey done the week after the Dobbs ruling by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of Americans disagree with the court\u2019s decision, including 43 percent who \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove. Nearly 70 percent of adults under 30 said they disapprove, with 55 percent saying they strongly disapprove. It\u2019s not just Democrats: Among Republicans or those who lean Republican, women and young people \u2014 36 percent and 43 percent, respectively \u2014 were most likely to disapprove of the court\u2019s decision.\nThe campaigns for Laxalt and Johnson did not respond to a request for comment on Dobbs\u2019 potential impact. Vance\u2019s campaign could not be reached. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) likewise did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\nThe Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign arm, however, warned that if Republicans retake control of Congress, they will try to pass a national ban. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told USA TODAY they could \u201ccertainly legislate in that area.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, on the ballot in Florida, has introduced a bill that would prevent businesses from taking tax deductions for reimbursing employees for travel costs to obtain abortions. He has also said the Biden administration should not provide sick leave for federal workers to get abortion care.\u00a0\n\u201cGOP Senate candidates spent months campaigning on overturning Roe v. Wade, they celebrated the Supreme Court decision taking away women\u2019s right to make their own health care decisions \u2014 and voters will hold them accountable for it,\u201d Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) spokesperson Nora Keefe told The 19th.\u00a0\n\u201cThis election will now determine whether Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are able to go even further: making abortion a crime without exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother,\u201d she added.\u00a0\nA president\u2019s party typically struggles in the first midterm elections. In 2010, two years into former President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, Republicans picked up seven Senate seats and 63 seats in the House of Representatives, ending Democratic trifecta control in Washington by taking control of the lower chamber. In 2018, two years into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Democrats picked up 43 House seats to end Republican trifecta control. But Republicans also beat four incumbent Democratic senators that year \u2014 Bill Nelson in Florida, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. Shortly after the election, three of the lawmakers attributed their losses in part to the bruising confirmation fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. All four voted against his confirmation.\u00a0\nPolitical strategists called it the \u201cKavanaugh effect\u201d \u2014 Republican voters were motivated by what they saw as Senate Democrats\u2019 efforts to thwart Trump\u2019s promise to remake the judiciary, and it energized the base in a way that led to Republicans performing better in Senate races than history otherwise would have predicted. Kondik said there could be an analogue \u201cKavanaugh effect\u201d for Democrats this year if voters look past concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy to support candidates based on concerns about reproductive health care access.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

With the 100-seat Senate evenly split, the outcome of these races will determine which party controls the chamber, where a bill to codify abortion rights has failed twice. Biden, facing criticism for his administration\u2019s muted Dobbs response, has said the best way to protect abortion access is to elect more Democrats to Congress so they can pass federal legislation.\u00a0\nLake said that she isn\u2019t surprised the Republican candidates in many of these races are being quiet about the Dobbs ruling and pointed to statements they made after a draft of the decision was leaked in early May. Johnson, for example, said then that he did not think that Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 law criminalizing abortion would go into effect \u2014 and that if it did, it wouldn\u2019t be for very long. In Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican Senate nominee, said on Twitter after the leak that he looked \u201cforward to supporting pro-life legislation that saves innocent lives in the U.S. Senate.\u201d After the actual decision, he wrote that many considered it controversial, and he respects \u201cthose with a different view.\u201d\n\u201cWhile they\u2019re being quiet now, they\u2019re being quiet in part because in the initial days and beforehand, they made a lot of mistakes,\u201d Lake said.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already seen backlash, the fact that they want to be quiet about it tells you how well it could work\u201d against them, she added.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Supreme Court leak immediately reverberated in U.S. Senate races\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats\u2019 abortion bill fails \u2014 again \u2014 and they turn to November elections\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats\u2019 abortion bill fails \u2014 again \u2014 and they turn to November elections\n\n\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Congress codify abortion rights?\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
