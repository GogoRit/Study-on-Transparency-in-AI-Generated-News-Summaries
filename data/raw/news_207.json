When such pills became unavailable due to disruptions in the supply chain or postal services to Malta closing, access to abortions was blocked.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Voice for Choice has become aware of unverified and potentially dangerous online sources offering abortion pills in Malta, all created between March and May. The current crisis is being exploited for financial gain,\u201d she wrote.\nThe harmful consequences of COVID-19 on reproductive health were also evident in personal testimonies from Malta.\n\u201cOne such story is of a woman who experienced extreme anxiety and denial when she found out she was pregnant. While she waited for abortion pills to arrive from abroad she searched for herbal remedies online and had daily suicidal thoughts. Another woman was unable to purchase her usual contraception and was raped by her abusive partner, which resulted in an unwanted pregnancy.\u201d\nShe said that at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the Maltese government ensured an extra stock of medicines to prevent shortages, but oral contraceptive pills were not included because they were not listed as essential. \u201cLiving in a country with substandard SRHR during a pandemic is untenable. It is likely that pregnant people will resort to unsafe methods to end unwanted pregnancies.\u201d\nCaruana-Finkel wrote that Malta\u2019s abortion ban was a structural and symbolic state violence, that caused discrimination and inequality for women.\n\u201cWomen in Malta lack bodily autonomy and are not trusted to make decisions about their own lives. According to international and European human rights law, states have the duty to ensure that SRHR are protected and respected. States\u2019 human rights obligations should not be obliterated in times of crisis.\n\u201cYet Malta\u2019s government has made no attempt to address and reform the country\u2019s draconian abortion laws, or in any way facilitate access to abortion care abroad during this pandemic. Instead, pregnant people are criminalised for accessing care that should be provided locally\u2026\n\u201cWe cannot wait for the pandemic to be over before focusing on SRHR. Abortion is time-sensitive, essential healthcare, and must be prioritised during COVID-19. We should not wait for a tragedy before enacting change.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiza Caruana-Finkel\n\n\n\nMalta remains the only EU and Commonwealth country with a total legal ban on abortion, despite its progressive steps to legislate divorce and introduce emergency contraception and same-sex marriage. Both main political parties have publicly affirmed their opposition to abortion.\nEstimates suggest that over 500 women in Malta access abortions each year, many travelling to countries according to their financial means and mobility. The other safe, though illegal way to access abortion from Malta is through the online purchase of medical abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol, from reputable organisations such as Women Help Women and Women on Web.\nBut the establishment of a pro-choice movement in 2019, together with pro-choice\u00a0 medical professionals, led to an increase in abortion talk in the public sphere.\n\u201cDespite this shift in public discourse, abortion remains highly stigmatised in Malta\u2019s pro-natalist society,\u201d Caruana-Finkel wrote. \u201cMisinformation is spread through various channels: social media, traditional media, school education, and religious institutions. Criminalisation has led to a chilling effect in those seeking abortions and in healthcare professionals.\u201d\nCaruana-Finkel also said that due to the fear of potential legal repercussions, women may delay seeking medical attention in rare events of post-abortion complications, while many healthcare professionals in Malta are reluctant to provide information about abortion, even though it is legal to do so.\n\u201cMost abortion experiences remain shrouded in secrecy and silence,\u201d Caruana-Finkel said, adding that having to travel abroad for healthcare is \u201cinhumane\u201d and discriminates against individuals who are unable to do so.\nAbortion Support Network is now providing financial assistance to Maltese residents, but there are other barriers. \u201cA pregnant teenager, a single mother without access to childcare, a woman living with an abusive partner, an individual with disability, and an asylum seeker lacking travel documentation all face additional obstacles. Unfortunately, there are also anti-abortion organisations targeting women with misinformation and deception to prevent abortion access,\u201d Caruana-Finkel said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Vella, a freelance journalist at MaltaToday, was formerly executive editor at Malt... \n\n More from Matthew Vella\n Matthew on Twitter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise \nContact \nDigital Edition\nSMS Alerts\n\n\nTerms and Conditions \nPrivacy Policy \nCookie Policy \nArchives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaToday is an independent media house based in Malta.
