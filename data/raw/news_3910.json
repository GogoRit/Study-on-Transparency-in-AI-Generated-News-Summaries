For the first time, an international development framework includes not only targets on sexual and reproductive health services but also targets that address the barriers and human rights-based dimensions of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, through SDG target 5.6. The target is measured by two indicators \u2014 Indicators 5.6.1 and 5.6.2.\nSDG Indicators 5.6.1 and 5.6.2., for which UNFPA is custodian, measure\u00a0the legal and regulatory framework for sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, as well as women\u2019s reproductive decision-making.\u00a0Combined, they provide insight into key dimensions of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, with SDG 5.6.2 reflecting the extent to which prevailing laws enable or disable women\u2019s and men\u2019s full and equal access to this health and rights, while SDG 5.6.1 reflects whether women, irrespective of the country\u2019s legal framework, are able to decide on their sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. This allows a complementary examination of whether a country has a positive enabling legal and normative framework, and whether its provisions go the last mile to empower all women and girls.\nThe data and research in these documents\u00a0provide important evidence-based argument to advocate and support rights and choice\u00a0for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nSexual and Reproductive Health and Reproductive Rights Country Profile\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nStaggering numbers of women unable to exercise decision-making over their own\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nTracking women\u2019s decision-making for sexual and reproductive health and\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
