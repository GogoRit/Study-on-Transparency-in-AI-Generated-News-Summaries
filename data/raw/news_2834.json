Wade, the decision affirming a woman\u2019s right to abortion.\nA judicial third rail since the day it was handed down in 1973,\u00a0Ginsburg had been a longtime champion of the ruling, and voted to defend abortion rights time and again during her 27-year tenure on the high court.\nAs late as March 2020, Ginsburg was undiminished as she questioned lawyers arguing on behalf of new abortion hurdles in Louisiana.\n\u201cThroughout her life and work, Justice Ginsburg affirmed and reaffirmed that under the law men and women deserve equal protection and equal freedom to make decisions based on their conscience,\u201d Sara Hutchinson Ratcliffe, acting president of Catholics for Choice, said in a statement.\nHer tireless efforts on the issue did not go unnoticed by Republican critics.\n\n\u201cRIP to the more than 30 million innocent babies that have been murdered during the decades that Ruth Bader Ginsburg defended pro-abortion laws,\u201d\u00a0tweeted Doug Collins, who is running for office in Georgia.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\tGeorgia pol urges Trump to replace RBG with pro-life judge\t\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberals bereft at her death have reason to fear that the landmark law she fiercely protected may now be in jeopardy. During his 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump explicitly promised to appoint judges who wold vote to overturn Roe.\n\u201cI am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges,\u201d Trump said during a debate with Hillary Clinton. \u201cI am putting pro-life justices on the court \u2026 it will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\u201d\nOn Sept. 9, Trump released a list of candidates he would choose from should a new Supreme Court opening emerge. Many of the contenders \u2014 like Sen Ted.
