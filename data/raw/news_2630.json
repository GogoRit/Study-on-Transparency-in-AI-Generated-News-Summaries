One proclaimed \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and the other \u201cDefund the Police.\u201d The first was commissioned by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.\nThis gave a pair of pro-life organizations an idea\u2014an idea that would ultimately lead to the unjust arrest of two students.\nRead more about the details of this case below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent advocates were arrested after they started writing a pro-life message in sidewalk chalk.\n\nWhat are the Frederick Douglass Foundation and Students for Life of America?\nThe Frederick Douglass Foundation is a national education and public-policy organization that advocates free-market and limited-government ideas as solutions to the hardest problems facing our nation.\nStudents for Life of America (SFLA) is the nation\u2019s largest youth pro-life organization. SFLA exists to recruit, train, and mobilize students and young adults to abolish abortion.\nThese two organizations decided to paint a similar mural\u2014in an identical style\u2014outside of a Planned Parenthood facility in D.C. This mural was to read, \u201cBlack Pre-Born Lives Matter,\u201d pointing out the fact that Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry kill thousands of unborn black children every year. And they planned a rally in August to do just that.\nBefore their rally, these two groups received a permit for the assembly as well as verbal confirmation from a police officer that they would be able to paint their message on the street.\nBut when the rally participants arrived, they were greeted by several police cars and a group of law enforcement officers. The officers informed them that if they wrote their message on the street or even on the public sidewalk, they would be arrested.\nWhen two students started to draw this message on the public walkway in washable sidewalk chalk, they were immediately arrested. They weren\u2019t even able to finish writing the intended message.\nThis is unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. The city cannot allow some messages to be permanently painted on their streets and then deny other groups the same right just because it doesn\u2019t like their message.\nThat\u2019s why Alliance Defending Freedom filed a lawsuit against the city on behalf of the Frederick Douglass Foundation and SFLA.\nThe Frederick Douglass Foundation v. District of Columbia \nThe Frederick Douglass Foundation and SFLA wanted to paint their message in exactly the same manner that the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cDefund the Police\u201d messages were painted. Yet they were stopped and told that their actions would be considered the \u201cdefacement of public property.\u201d\nAnd while such laws are well-intentioned\u2014meant to prohibit criminal activity\u2014they cannot be used as a tool to silence disfavored speech. But that is exactly what is happening here.\nWhy is one yellow-painted message considered defacement of public property while two other yellow-painted messages are allowed\u2014and one even encouraged\u2014by the D.C. mayor?\nThe answer is simple: the government favors these two messages over the message \u201cBlack Pre-Born Lives Matter.\u201d\nIn light of this unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, ADF attorneys filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Frederick Douglass Foundation and SFLA in November 2020, but a federal district court dismissed the case.\nADF then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which in August 2023 reversed the lower court\u2019s decision and allowed the lawsuit to proceed.\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\nEvery individual and organization should be able to peacefully express their beliefs, but the District of Columbia is picking winners and silencing those who hold views it doesn\u2019t like. That\u2019s unconstitutional. And that\u2019s why ADF stepped in.\nThe government can\u2019t pick winners and losers when it comes to free speech. It has a duty to uphold that freedom for all its citizens\u2014regardless of whether it agrees with them.\nCase timeline\n\nNovember 2020: ADF attorneys representing the Frederick Douglass Foundation and SFLA filed a lawsuit against the District.\nOctober 2021: ADF attorneys appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit after a lower court dismissed the case.\nAugust 2023: The D.C. Circuit Court reversed the lower court\u2019s decision and ruled that the lawsuit could proceed.\n\nThe bottom line\nThe right to free speech is for everyone\u2014not just those in power. The government can\u2019t silence speakers just because it doesn\u2019t like what they say.\nLearn more:\nADF explains the background of the lawsuit and the core issue at the heart of the case:\n\nRepresentatives from SFLA and the Frederick Douglass Foundation share how they were treated by government officials:\n\n\u00a0\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
