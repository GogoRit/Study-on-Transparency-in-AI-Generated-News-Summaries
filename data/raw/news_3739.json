He said abortion providers could decide whether a procedure could wait.Declare abortion a public health issue during pandemic, WHO urgedRead moreThe US Center for Reproductive Rights filed emergency lawsuits in five states to thwart moves by legislators to ban abortion during the pandemic.In the Alabama court judgement, Thompson said that based on the current record, the defendants\u2019 efforts to combat Covid-19 did not outweigh the lasting harm imposed by the denial of an individual\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy, by an undue burden or increase in risk on patients imposed by a delayed procedure, or by the cloud of unwarranted prosecution against providers. The ruling was a victory for abortion rights advocates who are fighting efforts in Texas, Ohio, Alabama and other states to prohibit abortion services during the Covid-19 pandemic. States have argued they need to conserve medical equipment and potential hospital beds during the outbreak. Abortion clinics in Alabama said they sought the injunction after the state refused to clarify that the clinics could continue to operate.Alabama had ordered a postponement of medical procedures except in cases of a medical emergency or to avoid serious harm from an underlying condition or disease, or necessary as part of a patient\u2019s ongoing and active treatment. A lawyer representing clinics praised the decision. Preventing someone from getting an abortion did not do anything to stop Covid-19, it just took the decision on whether to have a child out of their hands, said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s reproductive freedom project.The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The US ruling came as the World Health Organization was being urged to declare abortion an essential health service during the pandemic. It earlier issued guidance notes advising all governments that women\u2019s right to sexual and reproductive healthcare \u201cshould be respected irrespective of Covid-19 status, including access to contraception and safe abortion\u201d.There have been growing calls for governments to protect abortion services during the crisis. Last week, 100 NGOs issued a joint statement imploring European countries to find new ways to help women access services during lockdown, such as through online consultations and, as introduced in the UK last month, by allowing them to take abortion pills at home.Marie Stopes International has warned that up to 9.5 million women and girls would not access family planning services this year because of the pandemic, which could result in as many as 3m unintended pregnancies and 2.7m unsafe abortions.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsCoronavirusWomen's rights and gender equalityAbortionHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisUkraineFootballNewslettersBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
