For the one-third of Alaska\u2019s women and girls living in the rural reaches of the state, this isn\u2019t a thought experiment \u2013 it\u2019s an everyday reality.\nLast week, things got worse. Under the guise of fighting Covid-19, Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy declared surgical abortions \u201cnon-urgent,\u201d ordering them postponed unless the pregnancy endangered the woman\u2019s \u201clife or physical health.\u201d Dunleavy\u2019s order accidentally acknowledged how urgent abortion is by linking to American College of Surgeons guidance, which says delaying abortion could cause \u201csignificant harm.\u201d\nThe governor said the ban would continue through June 15.\nThe restrictions disproportionately harm Alaskans already facing systemic barriers to health care \u2013 rural, indigenous, young, and poor people. Surgical abortions, which require a single appointment, are performed in Alaska at rates above the US average. The alternative, medical abortions, or taking pills to end a pregnancy, currently require a follow-up appointment up to a week later, a major financial and logistical burden for many Alaskans.\u00a0\nRestrictions on leaving some Alaskan communities during the pandemic compound the barriers.\nToo often people needing abortion care in Alaska are survivors of sexual violence. Rape occurs in the state at 2.5 times \u2013 and child sexual assault at 6 times \u2013 the national average.\nThe crackdown on abortion in Alaska is not new. Anti-choice legislators have restricted abortions to state-approved facilities and prohibited nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives from providing abortions. These restrictions drove nine clinic closures since 1992. In 2019, Dunleavy blocked $334,700 in funds to the judiciary \u2013 the exact amount the state spent funding abortions in 2018 \u2013 in retaliation for a court ruling protecting Medicaid-funded abortions.\nAcross the United States, nine other states are using Covid-19 to further anti-choice agendas, and lawmakers in four others are also considering them.\nAbortions are essential care, and governments can protect abortion care while fighting Covid-19. Telemedicine services and helping patients end pregnancies by self-administering pills at home can make abortion care more accessible, even in remote areas, while protecting health workers from potential exposure to the new coronavirus.\nInstead of using the pandemic as an excuse to roll back rights, policymakers in Alaska and elsewhere should protect everyone\u2019s health now and into the future. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States Economic Justice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nCoronavirus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nHealth Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 24, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nOhio, Texas Use COVID-19 to Stop Abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 8, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nEurope: Abortion Curbs Endanger Women, Girls in Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\n\n\nUnited States\u2019 Poorly Regulated Nonprofit Hospitals Undermine Health Care Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAccess Denied\n\n\nHow Florida Judges Obstruct Young People\u2019s Ability to Obtain Abortion Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 24, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nOhio, Texas Use COVID-19 to Stop Abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 8, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nEurope: Abortion Curbs Endanger Women, Girls in Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
