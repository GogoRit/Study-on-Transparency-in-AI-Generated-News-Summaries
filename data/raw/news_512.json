(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)Social SharingConservative Leader Erin O'Toole says he will vote against a private member's bill introduced by a Conservative MP which would make performing a sex-selective abortion a criminal offence.\"As you know I'm pro-choice, and I will be voting against this private member's bill,\" he told a news conference in Ottawa Monday morning.\u00a0\"I will always as prime minister defend the rights\u00a0\u2014 the human rights\u00a0\u2014 of all Canadians to make this decision for themselves. I've been crystal clear on that and will be as\u00a0prime minister.\"O'Toole\u00a0did not say whether he\u00a0would direct his critics\u00a0to vote against\u00a0Bill C-233, also known as the \"Sex-selective Abortion Act,\"\u00a0which would make it a criminal offence for a medical practitioner to perform an abortion solely on the grounds of the sex of the\u00a0fetus.WATCH |\u00a0O'Toole will vote against Conservative MP's private member's bill on abortionO'Toole will vote against Conservative MP's private member's bill on abortion.3 years agoDuration 1:20Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole held a news conference at the same time that MP Cathy Wagantall was outlining her bill on sex-selective abortions to reporters.Cathay Wagantall, Conservative MP for the\u00a0Yorkton-Melville riding\u00a0in Saskatchewan, introduced the bill. It\u00a0went through first reading in the House of Commons in February\u00a02020 and members are set to debate the bill Wednesday.At a separate news conference this morning, Wagantall\u00a0said she introduced the bill because of a lack of legislation on sex-selective abortion.\"Above all, I'm bringing this bill forward in defence of pre-born Canadian girls and boys who are aborted simply due\u00a0to their sex,\" she said. \"My bill addresses inequality between the sexes at the earliest stages of life.\"WATCH |\u00a0Saskatchewan Conservative MP reacts to O'Toole opposing her push to ban sex-selective abortion\u00a0Saskatchewan Conservative MP reacts to O'Toole opposing her push to ban sex-selective abortion3 years agoDuration 0:52Cathay Wagantall said she respects Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole's decision to vote against her private member's bill on banning sex-selective abortion.Asked about O'Toole's comments, Wagantall\u00a0said she respected his intention to vote against the bill.\u00a0\"I respect my leader's opportunity to make his choice as much as I do mine,\" she said.While Wagantall acknowledged that a majority of Canadians are in favour of maintaining\u00a0access to abortion, she said that consensus\u00a0does not extend to sex-selective abortion.She cited a 2019 Dart\u00a0& Maru/Blue poll, which reported that 84 per cent of Canadians oppose abortions conducted\u00a0on the basis of an\u00a0unborn child's sex.An Angus-Reid poll from 2012 reported that 60 per cent of Canadians would like to see legislation on sex-selective abortion.Melanie Joly, Liberal minister of economic development and official languages, attacked the bill and O'Toole on Twitter Monday morning.\"Women control their own bodies \u2014 full stop,\" the tweet reads.\u00a0\"When O'Toole was trying to get the votes of anti-abortion activists during his leadership run, he promised them he would let his MPs introduce anti-abortion laws, and now this is exactly what has happened.\"Women control their own bodies - full stop.
