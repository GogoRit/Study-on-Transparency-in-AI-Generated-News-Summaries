The government made the announcement today (November 3) after almost two weeks of nationwide protests against the ruling.\n\u201cThere is a discussion going on, and it would be good to take some time for dialogue and for finding a new position in this solution that\u2019s difficult and stirs high emotions,\u201d Micha\u0142 Dworczyk, the head of the prime minister\u2019s office, said in a statement.\nThe ruling was set to be formally published yesterday (November 2) \u2013 unpublished, it has no legal power.\nAccording to The Guardian, Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has appealed for talks with both protesters and opposition lawmakers in an attempt to find a solution. The president, Andrzej Duda \u2013 who\u2019s aligned with the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), and whose recent election campaign was laced with homophobic and anti-abortion rhetoric \u2013 has proposed a new law that would allow the abortion of foetuses with life-threatening defects, but ban them for disorders such as Down\u2019s syndrome. This is still deemed by most as too restrictive.\n\nRead More The Tories are trying to stop young people from voting  Climate Crisis: Why migrant justice is now more important than ever UK university students are calling for tuition fee refunds UK university students now can\u2019t afford to eatIn Poland, millions of women across the country are striking after the government banned abortion. Refusing to go to work, drive, cook at home, or do anything until the ban is dropped. Poland's President today indicated they may have to change or reverse the law. \u270a\ud83c\udffc pic.twitter.com/IrVF5ziFDF\u2014 Liquid Faerie \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udd77\ud83e\udd84\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9 (@LiquidFaerie) November 2, 2020\n On October 22, a high court ruled that aborting foetuses due to defects was unconstitutional, meaning abortions would only be allowed in instances of rape, incest, or if there is a threat to the mother\u2019s life. A near-total ban would force more women to seek procedures illegally or abroad.\nThe ruling triggered mass protests and a women\u2019s strike across Poland, with hundreds of thousands of activists taking to the streets daily since the announcement, blockading streets and disrupting government meetings and church services.\n\u201cI want to live in a country where abortion will not be a political topic,\u201d protester Marta Plewicka told Dazed last week, \u201cit will not be something up for discussion at all, but my private matter. But I\u2019m not moving out. The government can get the fuck out, I\u2019m staying and fighting for my sisters\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nBreaking\u23f0Following mass mobilization by #Poland women's movement, gov't delayed law that would further curb abortion, put women & girls at risk & violate rights.

In parliament following the announcement, centrist and left-wing MPs held up signs that read, \u2018Shame\u2019, and shouted pro-choice slogans at the prime minister.\nThe news that the abortion ban\u2019s publication has been delayed has been welcomed by those on social media. \u201cThis is the power of women,\u201d wrote American actor Aisha Tyler. Publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove said: \u201cPower to women who raise they voice for the rights of others. We must resist where the state fails. Our bodies, our choice.\u201d One Twitter user remarked: \u201cThis is what happens when WE RISE.\u201d\nRead Dazed\u2019s full interview with the protesters fighting back against Poland\u2019s abortion ruling here.\n\nPoliticsNewsPolandabortionprotest\nDownload the app\u00a0\ud83d\udcf1\nBuild your network and meet other creativesBe the first to hear about exclusive Dazed events and offersShare your work with our communityJoin Dazed ClubIcon/Social/TikTok\nContact\n\nAbout\n\nJobs\n\nInternship\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDazed Media\n\nAnother\n\nAnother Man\n\nNowness\n\nDazed Studio\n\n"
