Over 100 people signed up to speak during public hearing on the ordinance, according to City Clerk Marisa Stoller.Council President Heather Graham and councilors Vicente Martinez Ortega, Sarah Martinez and Dennis Flores voted to pull the ordinance from the agenda, while councilors Regina Maestri, Lori Winner and Larry Atencio voted to keep the item on the agenda.Graham, who recently announced a bid for mayor, introduced the motion to table the item. She said regulating an abortion clinic is not within the purview of city council.\"If you want to stop abortion, I suggest you take it up with the state legislature, the state medical board or file a federal injunction. I do not wish to even allow the public testimony on this because we do not govern it,\u201d Graham said.\u201cThis is not how city council typically works or operates, and procedures were not followed. It can only be assumed this ordinance is being used as a political ploy, as it never should have reached this point.\"A councilor could reintroduce the same ordinance or write a new one in the future, said the city's director of public affairs, Haley Sue Robinson.Maestri, who introduced the ordinance, was not available for comment prior to the Chieftain's print deadline.City attorney Dan Kogovsek told city council during a work session Monday that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser could sue the city if council were to pass the ordinance.\"I welcome the Pueblo city council's decision to respect Colorado law and not take action that would interfere with access to legal and safe abortion care,\" Weiser said in a tweeted statement Tuesday. \"As I have stated, I stand ready to challenge any action by local governments that would undermine the Reproductive Health Equity Act and Coloradoans' commitment to protecting access to reproductive health care.\"The ordinance was introduced amid backlash against a planned abortion clinic in Pueblo\u2019s Bessemer neighborhood, from conservative activists and church leaders.A Texas anti-abortion activist, Mark Lee Dickson, helped Maestri draft Pueblo\u2019s proposed ordinance, which attempted to skirt a new Colorado law that prohibits local municipalities from impeding access to reproductive health care.National anti-abortion activist helped craft controversial ordinance in PuebloThe enforcement mechanism for the Pueblo ordinance is similar to the 2021, six-week abortion ban Dickson helped craft in Texas, through which citizens can sue providers for at least $100,000.The planned abortion clinic in Pueblo will be run by Clinics for Abortion and Reproductive Excellence, which also operates clinics in Nebraska and Maryland.Pueblo city council chambers has been packed for the past few meetings with anti-abortion-rights advocates pleading for council to take action to block the clinic.The medical director for CARE purchased the building in September for $365,000, according to the Pueblo County Assessor\u2019s Office.A Planned Parenthood clinic in Pueblo, which did not offer abortion services, closed in 2015. The closest clinic to Pueblo that offers abortion services is the Planned Parenthood location in Colorado Springs.Pueblo is home to an anti-abortion clinic, A Caring Pregnancy Center, that offers some ultrasound and prenatal services.ACPC\u2019s executive director Tamra Axworthy helped bring in attorneys from the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative legal group, to threaten the city with a lawsuit after anti-abortion attorneys were not included on a work session agenda last week.The Colorado law prohibits local governments from interfering with access to reproductive health care, which includes abortion services.Pueblo Rep. Daneya Esgar was a prime sponsor of the bill, which was signed into law this summer. Esgar and state Sen. Nick Hinrichsen sent a letter to city council last week urging them not to pass the \u201ccruel and misguided\u201d ordinance.\u201cYour proposed ordinance is in direct violation of this critical state statute and, if enacted, would create a patchwork of reproductive health care laws around the state while skirting the intent of (the Reproductive Health Equity Act). That is simply unacceptable,\u201d Esgar and Hinrichsen wrote in the letter.Pueblo Mayor Nick Gradisar has said the city does not have any jurisdiction to stop the clinic from opening.The proposed ordinance cites the 1873 Comstock law, a federal rule that prohibits mailing abortion-related materials.Councilors heard from anti-abortion-rights lawyers who helped craft the ordinance, including Jonathan F. Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general who also helped construct the six-week abortion ban in Texas.Mitchell told city council that the Pueblo OB-GYN doctors who were concerned about access to medical equipment were misguided because the federal law cited in the Pueblo ordinance applies only to abortion care.Before council voted to table the ordinance, Maestri said the doctors helped contribute to a \"frenzy.\"\"Counselor Maestri, you created this frenzy,\" Graham said.Mitchell and Colorado attorney Josh Craddock said the Biden administration isn't enforcing 1873 anti-abortion law after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the precedent of Roe vs. Wade this summer, but a future president could because the statute of limitations is within five years.Kogovsek told council that he could only find one example of the 1873 law: It was from 1915, and an appeals court threw out the conviction. He said it was strange how the municipal ordinance was structured to give private citizens a right to sue in order to enforce a federal statute.\"I have never seen that before,\" he said.Editor's note: This story has been updated to include a statement from Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.Anna Lynn Winfrey covers politics for the Pueblo Chieftain.
