The centre was closed at the time.\nIndividual local authorities have powers to use Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) to enforce zones. In October, MPs backed the introduction of similar zones across England and Wales.\n\u2018Interrogated\u2019\nPolice approached Miss Vaughan-Spruce while she was standing near the BPAS Robert Clinic in Kings Norton, after receiving a complaint that she might be praying.\nRecounting what happened, Vaughan-Spruce, a Roman Catholic, said: \u201cI was searched, arrested, interrogated by police and charged simply for praying in the privacy of my own mind.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cNobody should be criminalised for thinking and for praying in a public space in the UK\u201d.\nVaughan-Spruce also admitted to the police that she had stood near the abortion centre on three further occasions where some of the time she \u201cmight\u201d also have been praying.\nBeyond belief\nThe Birmingham censorship zone criminalises individuals perceived to be \u201cengaging in any act of approval or disapproval or attempted act of approval or disapproval\u201d in relation to abortion, including through \u201cverbal or written means, prayer or counselling\u201d.\nSpeaking to The Christian Institute, Miss Vaughan-Spruce confirmed that she was not protesting or expressing disapproval about abortion, but rather praying for friends who had gone through terrible abortion experiences.\nWith the prospect of censorship zones being imposed across the British Isles,\u00a0she put her experience into context, asking: \u201cAre certain thoughts going to be prohibited within those areas. Are we going to have our thoughts censored, what we can and can\u2019t think in those areas?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that police would seriously be trying to clamp down on what people are thinking\u201d. \u201cBut\u201d, she concluded,\u00a0\u201cthis is the reality. This is what\u2019s happening. Thought is becoming a crime\u201d.\n\n\n\nPlease accept preferences cookies \n\t\t  to view this content.\n\n\n\n\u2018Humiliating\u2019\nJeremiah Igunnubole, Legal Counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) \u2013 the organisation supporting Vaughan-Spruce, described the pro-life campaigner\u2019s experience as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cIt is truly astonishing that the law has granted local authorities such wide and unaccountable discretion, that now even thoughts deemed \u2018wrong\u2019 can lead to a humiliating arrest and a criminal charge.\n\u201cA mature democracy should be able to differentiate between criminal conduct and the peaceful exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d\nPolice statement\nIn a statement, West Midlands Police said: \u201cIsabel Vaughan-Spruce was arrested on 6 December and subsequently charged on 15 December with four counts of failing to comply with a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO). She was bailed to appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on 2 February 2023.\u201d\nShe is charged with \u2018protesting\u2019 and \u2018intimidating service users\u2019.\nUnder the conditions of her bail, according to ADF, Vaughan-Spruce has been told that she must not engage in public prayer beyond the PSPO area to prevent further offences.\n\nAlso see:\n\nScot Govt to push nationwide abortion censorship zones \u2018as soon as possible\u2019\nSupreme Court backs NI abortion censorship zones outlawing silent prayer\nMPs back nationwide abortion censorship zones\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this story\n\n\n\nPlease accept preferences cookies to view this content.\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic\n\nCharity volunteer arrested, charged for silent prayer \u201cthoughtcrime\u201d near abortion facility (adf.uk, 20 December 2022)\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Abortionists care more about changing the law than they do about women\u2019s safety\u2019\n26 Jan 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion (Ireland)\n\nAugust 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018One of the most liberal abortion regimes in the world\u2019\n16 Jun 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nManx people warned: \u2018Open the door to assisted suicide and safeguards tumble\u2019\n14 hours ago \n\nCreative Scotland pulls \u00a3110k of public money from pornographic film\n15 hours agoPornographyScotland \n\nTennessee Governor ensures no one is forced to conduct same-sex weddings\n19 hours agoReligious LibertyWorld \n\nCI: \u2018Broad extremism definition poses unnecessary threat to free speech\u2019\n3 days agoExtremismUK \n\nStarmer wants to legalise assisted suicide if he becomes Prime Minister\n3 days agoAssisted SuicideEngland & Wales \n\n\u2018Report hurtful words\u2019 says Scots Govt \u2018hate crime\u2019 campaign\n3 days agoFree SpeechScotland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our free mailing list\nReceive news, prayer and action points, publications and access to exclusive events.\n\n\nSign up now\n\n\n\nChristian influence in a secular world\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nWho we are\nMPs\u2019 votes\nNews Archive\nPress\nSitemap\nSign up\nSupport us\nContact us\nPrivacy and Cookies\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nContact\n\nTel: 0191 281 5664\n\nEmail: info@christian.org.uk\nContact us\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Christian Institute, Wilberforce House4 Park Road, Gosforth Business Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE12 8DG\nThe Christian Institute is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England as a charity.
