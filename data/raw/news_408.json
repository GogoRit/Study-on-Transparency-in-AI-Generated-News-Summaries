(Credit: Anna Lewanska/Agencja Gazeta via Reuters via CNS.)\nListenROME \u2014 As protests against a near-total ban on abortions gripped Poland, Pope Francis urged the people of the country to defend life.\nAddressing Polish pilgrims during his weekly general audience Oct. 28, the pope invoked the memory of St. John Paul II, who \u201calways urged a privileged love for the least and the defenseless and for the protection of every human being, from conception to natural death.\u201d\n\nThe pope prayed, through the intercession of Mary and of St. John Paul, that God would \u201carouse in everyone\u2019s hearts respect for the life of our brothers and sisters, especially of the most fragile and defenseless, and would give strength to those who welcome and take care of them, even when it requires a heroic love.\u201d\nPoland\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled Oct. 22 that a clause in Poland\u2019s 1993 abortion law allowing pregnancy terminations in cases of \u201csevere and irreparable fetal damage\u201d was unconstitutional.\nThe decision provoked outrage from some women\u2019s rights groups in the country against the governing Law and Justice party, as well as against the Catholic Church.\nDemonstrators entered churches during Masses Oct. 25 in Warsaw, Krakow, Poznan and other cities to protest the court\u2019s ruling, drawing criticism from the Polish bishops\u2019 conference.\nAcknowledging that the ruling \u201chas caused unusually emotional reactions,\u201d Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki of Poznan, conference president, said in a statement Oct. 25 that \u201cthe vulgarities, abusive daubings, service disruptions and profanations seen in recent days are not a proper form of action in a democratic state, however much they may help certain people relieve their emotions.\u201d\nWhile appealing for dialogue \u201con how to protect the right to life and women\u2019s rights,\u201d Gadecki said that the church\u2019s stance on abortion is \u201cunchanging and publicly known.\u201d\n\u201cThe church cannot stop defending life or give up proclaiming the need to protect every human being from conception to natural death,\u201d he said. \u201cOn this question, we can accept no compromise.\u201d\nShareLatest StoriesA Wisconsin ruling on Catholic Charities raises the bar for religious tax exemptionsMar 19Todd Richmond,\u00a0Associated PressCatholic nuns support women\u2019s rights in Central African RepublicMar 19Nirmala CarvalhoA priest who refused to stay silent still speaks to the world todayMar 19John L.
