While there are a lot of pro-life people who understand this, there is also a shocking number of people who seem to think that they should stop fighting for someone after they are born.\nRight now, pro-lifers should be supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Black people are being killed, abused and discriminated against. Racism is a blatant attack on life, yet it seems that some of the same people who are saying they are going to advocate for unborn lives have trouble advocating for ones that are already born.\nWhen someone posts on their Instagram story about the March for Life but follows it with a post about how Black Lives Matter is just a political ploy, they are not really concerned with life. They are trying to ensure that the government is not putting them personally in any uncomfortable situations, without taking into consideration how other groups of people are getting hurt. But in order to improve the way of life, people have to embrace and work though the discomfort of making change. It does not come easy, but good things never do.\nAnd if they are coming from a religious standpoint, it should be even more obvious to support the Black Lives Matter movement. The Bible tells stories of Moses freeing the Israelites and Jesus fighting for the forgotten, ill, or abused every step of the way. At no point was he the abuser. The Bible preaches that all living people were made in God\u2019s image\u2014 every single one. \nIn 2016, a lot of people let their vote be decided by whether or not a candidate supported abortion. In this election cycle, a vote should not be left to one wedge issue. Vote for the sanctity of all life, not just the start.\nIn order to be truly pro-life, people should spend as much time protesting in the streets as they do in front of abortion clinics. They should be calling politicians and demanding police reform. They should be signing petitions and donating money. Life does not stop at birth, and neither should the fight for it.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tView Comments (4)\n\n\n\n\nMore to Discover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        More in Op/Ed                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: Mardi Gras is not sustainable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDITORIAL: Students should vote in SGA elections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: Loyola needs more left-handed desks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: Loyola doesn\u2019t uphold Jesuit values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: Houthi opposition to Israeli trade shouldn't be an issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDITORIAL: Students should take advantage of Loyola\u2019s resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        More in Opinions                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: Consent is not just sexy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOLUMN: We need to build a village beyond bricks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: I met the love of my life on Tinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: The OR should have take-out options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: My ins and outs for 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION: Studying abroad enriches your education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Contributor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZia Sampson, Life & Times Editor                \n\n                    Zia Sampson is the Life and Times Editor.

BLM now stands for \u201cbuy large mansion\u201d.  The BLM movement is fully ready to promote abortion at any stage including after birth. At the same time, abortion in New York City remains the top killer of black lives.  If abortion remains unchecked, blacks will become an endangered species in our lifetime.  We must respect life at all stages, before birth, as toddlers, youth, young adults, adults, and the elderly.   And as Matt Walsh asks, what is a woman, I ask what is a black.   We all come in different sizes and shades.  Do we help people based on their pigment level, their ancestry, or more wisely their level of development?  I\u2019d suggest we protect all life at risk.\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n Recommend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://loyolamaroon.com/10029377/oped/pro-life-means-supporting-the-black-lives-matter-movement/#comment-12963\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \n\nLuka\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDec 6, 2020 at 12:37 am \nEnough with the pro-life nonsense.
