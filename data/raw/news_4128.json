Yet, de-democratization is rarely analysed through the lens of gender equality and, so far, efforts to systematically examine the implications for inclusive democracy and the representation of gender interests are fragmented. Backsliding on gender policies and on state commitments to gender equality, and new forms of feminist engagement with hostile governments and audiences, also raise new challenges to the literature on gender and politics.\nIn this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to discuss these two interrelated realms: backsliding on gender equality policies and the emerging political space for feminist responses to this backsliding. We illustrate our framework with empirical observations from three Central and Eastern European countries: Croatia, Hungary, and Poland. We aim to contribute to an understanding of the gendered aspects of de-democratization and the functioning of illiberal democracies.\nThis paper is part of the \u201cUN Women discussion paper series\u201d.\n\nAdditional documents\n\n\nPublication (PDF, 316KB)\nSpanish version\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing entities\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeijing Platform for Action\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCivil society participation\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGender equality and inequality\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHuman rights\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntergovernmental processes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership and political participation\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolitical empowerment\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen\u2019s movements\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen\u2019s rights\n\nRelated publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew feminist activism, waves, and generations\n\n12 May 2021\n\nNew feminist activism, waves, and generations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe digital revolution: Implications for gender equality and women\u2019s rights 25 years after Beijing\n\n7 August 2020\n\nThe digital revolution: Implications for gender equality and women\u2019s rights 25 years after Beijing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 and women&rsquo;s rights organizations: Bridging response gaps and demanding a more just future\n\n22 March 2021\n\nCOVID-19 and women\u2019s rights organizations: Bridging response gaps and demanding a more just future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Menu 1\n\n\nNews and stories\n\n\nResources\n\n\nWhat we do\n\n\nWhere we are\n\n\n\n\nFooter Menu 2\n\n\nPartnerships\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nFooter Menu 3\n\n\nExecutive Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on Flickr\nFollow us on Snapchat\nFollow us on YouTube\nFollow us on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter bottom [Menu]\n\n\nInformation security\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
