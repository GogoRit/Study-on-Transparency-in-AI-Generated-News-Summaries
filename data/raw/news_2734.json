(CNS photo/courtesy Diocese of Charlotte)\nBy Kimberly Bender \u2022 Catholic News Service \u2022 Posted October 29, 2020 CHARLOTTE, N.C. (CNS) \u2014 Police were investigating recent thefts of pro-life signs from four parish churches and two schools in the Diocese of Charlotte.\nSt. Vincent de Paul and St. Ann churches in Charlotte, St. Mark Church in Huntersville and St. Paul the Apostle Church in Greensboro reported that pro-life signs erected for Respect Life Month, observed every October, and the upcoming elections have been stolen or vandalized.\nSimilar signs at Holy Trinity Middle School and Charlotte Catholic High School also were stolen.\nThis type of vandalism has been reported elsewhere in the country.\n[hotblock]\nIn Louisiana, yard signs and larger banners promoting a pro-life measure on the Nov. 3 ballot in that state were stolen in New Orleans and at least four other cities, reported Louisiana Right to Life. The Love Life Amendment, as its called, proposes to amend the state constitution to say there is no right to abortion or taxpayer funding of abortion.\nIn Texas in early October, a pro-life display at the University of North Texas was vandalized, according to Texas Right to Life. Pro-life students at the university had permission to place 1,000 flags on campus as a memorial to represent preborn babies killed by abortion.\nDozens of the flags were ripped out of the ground or stolen and had to be replaced. Each flag represented some of the more than 61 million preborn babies killed since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\nIn Charlotte, large pro-life banners on display in front of St. Vincent de Paul Church were vandalized three times during October. The signs \u2014 urging \u201cPray Every Day to End Abortion\u201d and \u201cAmerica, Defend Life\u201d \u2014 were cut in half. They were later repaired by the church.\nOne banner with a pro-life message was stolen from outside St. Vincent de Paul Church between Oct. 9 and 10, according to a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police report.\nThe remaining banner in front of the Charlotte church has been repaired, after being slashed in half three times, said the parish\u2019s Respect Life coordinators Steve and Gail Barringer.\n[hotblock2]\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this stop us,\u201d Steve Barringer told the Catholic\u00a0News\u00a0Herald, newspaper of the Charlotte Diocese. The pair said they continue to pray for those who have committed these acts and will continue to bear witness for the rights of the unborn.\nThis is not the first time St. Vincent de Paul Church has been targeted: Other pro-life displays have been damaged or stolen several times over the past few years. Last year, small crosses on display in front of the church were stolen.\nAt St. Ann Church, similar signs were stolen sometime overnight Oct. 20-21. The parish said it plans to replace the banners.\nPro-life banners at Holy Trinity Middle School were vandalized and then subsequently stolen in separate incidents. The school also plans to replace its banners.\nA pro-life sign was stolen from in front of Charlotte Catholic High School sometime between Oct. 16 and 17.\nIn Greensboro, a pro-life banner in front of St. Paul the Apostle Church was cut apart, Father Joseph Mack, the pastor, reported on the parish\u2019s Facebook page. The parish has repaired the banner and it is back on display. Father Mack commented about the importance of the pro-life message on social media.\nIn Huntersville, a Respect Life banner stating, \u201cVoting saves lives. Vote pro-life,\u201d was stolen from outside St. Mark Church a few days after it was installed. The theft occurred sometime Oct. 20-21, the parish reported. The banner has since been replaced.\n\u201cWe were created (this banner) specifically for a time and place such as this one with the current events going on in the world,\u201d said Father Alfonso G\u00e1mez, St. Mark\u2019s parochial vicar. \u201cThe Lord has specifically given us the grace of faith, to be able to not only be witnesses and spectators of such sacrileges and difficulties that going on in the world, but that we are called to be, in a certain sense, co-redeemers of this world.\u201d\nFather G\u00e1mez asked people to pray for the country \u201cwith the turmoil that we face and that for individuals who act out \u2014 out of an absence of knowledge and love of God \u2014 that they may come to be filled with his grace, and live in that love that the Lord wants for them.\u201d\nJessica Grabowski, the Charlotte Diocese\u2019s Respect Life program director, noted: \u201cWe must remember that the fight for life is most importantly a spiritual fight. Although it is unfortunate and inconvenient when things like this happen, it illustrates hope that the Catholic community is making great strides in our steadfast efforts to promote the protection of all human life, from conception to natural death.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cWe must continue to surround all our efforts for life in prayer and through acts of reparation.\u201d\n***\nBender is an online reporter for the Catholic\u00a0News\u00a0Herald, newspaper of the Diocese of Charlotte.\n\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
