Photo by Eston Parker III  Annalise Wellman and Darlene AntoineFebruary 14, 2020Last year, an anti-abortion group brought a JumboTron to campus to play hours of abortion footage. Yesterday, something similar happened.\u00a0\nThe Canadian Center for Bio-Ethical Reform displayed massive posters of disembodied fetuses across the Free Speech Lawn near the Social Science Building on the Boca campus.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe are an educational pro-life group where we try to have conversations to people about the issue of abortion by showing the evidence of what abortion does to an innocent human being,\u201d said Cameron C\u00f4t\u00e9, founder of the center. \u201cOur goal is to motivate and demonstrate the idea that abortion directly and intentionally kills human beings.\u201d\nMembers of the pro-life organization passed out pamphlets with images of aborted fetuses that said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t All Humans Beings Have Human Rights?\u201d and engaged in conversations with passing students about their organizations stance on abortion.\nTheir choice to use graphic images to convey their ideologies sparked mixed reviews from FAU\u2019s student body.\u00a0\nStudent-run organizations like Generation Action, Planned Parenthood\u2019s FAU chapter, and FAU\u2019s Revolutionary Communist Youth displayed their pro-choice views across from the demonstrators while passing out pro-choice flyers.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to be here because both sides should have representation,\u201d said Ally Walchak, president of Generation Action. \u201cThey are very strong in their opinions to push those onto students. My group, and myself are here to be a little safe haven, a small space, to offer support and refuge for those who feel attacked by their techniques.\u201d\u00a0\nMembers of the pro-life organization passed out pamphlets with images of bloody aborted fetuses titled, \u201cShouldn\u2019t All Humans Beings Have Human Rights?\u201d and engaged in conversations with passing students about their organizations stance on abortion.\u00a0\nWith knowledge of the anti-abortion demonstration taking place, student-run organizations, such as Generation Action displayed their pro-choice views across from where the anti-abortion organization was set up and Revolutionary Communist Youth passed out pro-choice flyers in an effort to counter the claims being made by the opposing organization.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to be here because both sides should have representation,\u201d said Ally Walchak, president of Generation Action. \u201cThey are very strong in their opinions to push those onto students. My group and myself are here to be a little safe haven, a small space, to offer support and refuge for those who feel attacked by their techniques.\u201d\u00a0\nA member of the pro-life organization Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform stands by the Free Speech Board. Photo by Eston Parker III\nOther members of Generation Action were protesting along with Walchak.\u00a0\n\u201cEvery year we fight against these anti-abortion groups to stand up for our fundamental rights to protect our own bodies and make our own decisions,\u201d said Nia Abbate, vice president of Generation Action. \u201cRight now, we are supporting a bill in Student Government to force FAU to notify all of the students when this group comes to campus. This imagery is really disturbing, false, and graphic, and it could be really triggering or upsetting to students. We deserve the right to know when they will be on campus and when we can fight back against them.\u201d\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 said he was intentional with the use of his graphic images.\u00a0\n\u201cThroughout history, most reform movements have needed to show the victims of the injustice to demonstrate the accuracy of their cause and the importance of their cause,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThe reform C\u00f4t\u00e9 said he wants is to make abortion \u201cunthinkable.\u201d The organzition does not span into political or religious interpretations of abortion, but only focuses on the concept of abortion as a violation of human rights.\u00a0\nMany bystanders had diverging opinions in regard to the explicit photos, and the cause of the organization.\u00a0\n\u201cI think that this is good, honestly there should be more of it on campus because it spreads awareness about the topic,\u201d said international business major Rachel Dejean.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s really disturbing:\u2019 Should FAU students be notified in advance?\nSome students felt that there should be a formal announcement when these groups come to campus.\n\u201cThis protest is disgusting, they really shouldn\u2019t do this. We are trying to go to class, all these posters are up, and it\u2019s not something I am trying to see when I am trying to think about my test,\u201d said biology major Dakayla Saunders. \u201cThey should notify us, it\u2019s not fair to us, if anything students could have taken another route instead of seeing that. It\u2019s disturbing, it\u2019s really disturbing.\u201d\u00a0\nMarcela Callejas, an executive member of FAU\u2019s National Organization for Women (NOW) chapter, was also upset that students weren\u2019t notified.\u00a0\n\u201cSome people have PTSD about having to go through an abortion or even having a miscarriage. I think it is really insensitive of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been going on for years and years. There are highschoolers on the campus, these are children. I don\u2019t think this is ethical \u2014 it seems like they are just trying to push an agenda without having all the information. All these images are fake and have been debunked.\u201d\u00a0\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 said he is unsure if they will return to FAU next Spring for another demonstration.\nAnnalise Wellman is a contributing writer for the University Press.
