Incomplete abortions and miscarriages are estimated to result in 8% of the country\u2019s maternal deaths every year.Argentina legalizing abortion will spur reform in Latin America, minister saysRead more\u201cThe decision to legalize abortion in Argentina is a triumph for all women,\u201d said Ysabel Paulino, a Dominican feminist and educator at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. \u201cIt is a fight we in the Dominican Republic have been waging \u2013 to defend the destiny of our bodies, what we do with our bodies and our right to life.\u201dDespite the current ban, Dominican women go to extreme lengths to self-induce, often in secrecy and without clear medical guidance. These women risk up to two years in jail, while medical professionals face up to 20 years in prison and the loss of their license for aiding in a termination.In August, the president of the chamber of deputies, Alfredo Pacheco, created national uproar when he submitted a revised version of the country\u2019s penal code which retained the abortion ban.Amid broad criticism, Pacheco soon after announced a new law permitting abortion in three cases: when a person\u2019s life is in danger, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when the fetus is incompatible with life.Feminist organizations condemned the ruling as insufficient, claiming the law would prove worthless against a penal code criminalizing abortion. It remains unclear when the new law will take effect.Meanwhile, the chamber of deputies is expected to pass the penal code sometime this year. It will then needs to be approved by the senate before President Luis Abinader will ultimately decide if it becomes law.Despite the ban, the Dominican health ministry already allows some exceptions under their supervision, according to Dr Jos\u00e9 De Lancer Despradel, the former general director of maternal, child and adolescent health.In 2012, he authorized the health ministry to make an exception in the high-profile case of Rosaura Almonte Hern\u00e1ndez, or \u201cEsperancita\u201d, a 16-year-old leukemia patient, who doctors refused to treat with chemotherapy because she was nine weeks pregnant.De Lancer offered to move Rosaura from a private hospital to a public one to terminate her pregnancy, but the girl\u2019s mother, Rosa Hern\u00e1ndez, declined the offer, he said, because she didn\u2019t want to transport her daughter.Rosaura later died after a miscarriage that sent her into cardiac arrest.Selene Soto, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyer, said Hern\u00e1ndez was not properly made aware of the options she had at the time. Furthermore, moving Rosaura would have been too costly for Hern\u00e1ndez, she said, who was solely paying her daughter\u2019s medical expenses.The story illustrates the many obstacles women face in a country where even the discussion of abortion is considered taboo and reproductive care is severely limited.When asked if the ministry continues to make exceptions, De Lancer said, \u201cAll of us who are doctors, gynecologists, and who work in the environment, we know that these things are done constantly. But they are handled with discretion,\u201d he said.\u201cThey do not come to light because it is prohibited,\u201d he said of the back channel procedures. \u201cIt is illegal.\u201dMeanwhile, the death toll climbs.Damaris Mej\u00eda, a 31-year-old Dominican-Haitian woman, was 16 weeks pregnant when she started experiencing severe uterine pain in 2012.Doctors at a local hospital told her she had suffered a miscarriage and would need a curettage \u2013 a forbidden procedure that would clear her uterine lining of the fetus, but cautioned that they would be unlikely to find a doctor willing to terminate her pregnancy because of the ban. Doctors around the world perform curettages to treat uterine conditions, including abnormal bleeding and use them to detect cancer.The family drove from clinic to clinic, hospital to hospital, with no luck.Clandestine clinics exist throughout the country, but charge up to $500 \u2013 way beyond the reach of poor rural women in a country with a minimum wage of $250 a month. Researchers consider Dominican women of Haitian descent to be a group most vulnerable to the prohibition.Within days, Damaris\u2019s pain was excruciating. At the final hospital the family visited, a doctor told her she should go home and rest.She died the following afternoon. An autopsy showed that her death had been caused by an infection from the dead foetus.Eight years later, the anguish of her death has not diminished for Damaris\u2019s family, said her sister Juliana.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see any family live what we are living, what we have lived, what we have suffered,\u201d she said.Explore more on these topicsWomen's rights and gender equalityDominican RepublicAbortionAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
