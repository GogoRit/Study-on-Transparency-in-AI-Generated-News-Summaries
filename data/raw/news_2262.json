(Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)    Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow says that he would rather be known for saving babies from abortion than for his achievements on the field. Tebow, a Christian athlete who is currently a professional baseball player, spoke to an audience of about 1,200 pro-lifers at a football-themed banquet for Kansans for Life earlier this month, according to National Right to Life News.   \"It really does mean a lot more than winning the Super Bowl,\" Tebow, who won the Heisman Trophy and led his team to two college football national championships, told the crowd. \"One day, when you look back and people are talking about you and they say, 'Oh my gosh what are you going to be known for? Are you going to say Super Bowl, or we saved a lot of babies?'\"   The issue of abortion is a personal part of Tebow's own story, as his mom shared in a 2010 Super Bowl commercial for Focus on the Family, calling him her \"miracle baby.\" He recounted that story at the pro-life banquet. \"You see, my mom 32 years ago had doctors tell her she needed to abort me because if she didn't, it was going to cost her life. And they didn't even believe that I was a baby,\" he said. \"They thought I was a tumor.\" But he added, \"When I was born, they found out the placenta wasn\u2019t actually attached. So, the doctor looked at my mom after 37 years of being a doctor and said, \u2018This is the biggest miracle I\u2019ve ever seen because I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s alive.\u2019 \u2026I\u2019m so grateful that my mom trusted God with my life and her life.\u201d Tebow, 32, whose name means \"to honor God,\" shared how his parents prayed that he would be a preacher but instead got a quarterback. But the man who was mocked for Tebowing and wearing \"John 3:16\" on his eye black has been a preacher in his own right. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here matters,\" he concluded. \"You\u2019re fighting for life. You\u2019re fighting for people that can\u2019t fight for themselves. And my question to you is: Are you willing to stand up in the face of persecution, in the face of adversity, in the face of criticism, when other people are going to say it\u2019s not worth it, when other people won\u2019t stand beside you?\" GET UPDATES ON THIS STORY FROM FOX NEWS.     \n      Latest News\n            Gwinnett PD need help to solve murder of young mother at house party in December 2023         Man shot while asking for money at Chamblee gas station dies, suspect identified         Ex-Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill released from federal prison early         Atlanta Girls' School announces closure at end of academic year         Georgia couple accused of child neglect after being found 'heavily intoxicated,' asleep on Daytona Beach    BREAKING NEWS Breaking news delivered fast        By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
