Wade have not adequately considered the complexity and nuance required of pregnancy care, the physicians said, adding they expect maternal morbidity rates to increase.\nThese health experts spoke to journalists Tuesday in a virtual media briefing. (Replay the briefing on YouTube.)\nHere are excerpts:\nON PARTICULARLY STRICT ABORTION BANS IN SOME STATES\nDr. Beverly Gray, obstetrician and gynecologist\n\u201cWe know the patients in these situations are in grave danger. With the passing of the laws in Texas, it\u2019s a very strict ban with a very narrow exception for saving the life of the patient.\n\u201cEssentially they were having to watch those patients until they were on the brink of a catastrophic outcome, and then they could take care of them.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes it complicated for physicians who are just trying to do the right thing. They\u2019re trying to give their patients the best advice, the best evidence-based care. And that\u2019s being limited.\u201d\n\u201cMany of these bans across the country, we see they seek to prosecute physicians. They seek to scare physicians so that they\u2019re not taking care of patients in an evidence-based way. That\u2019s just corroding the trust patients have with their physicians.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really disheartening is just how quickly these laws are changing, how fast it\u2019s moving, how quickly patients are being affected all over the country.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we tell if someone\u2019s sick enough? It\u2019s really hard to say in each individual situation what constitutes enough illness. Do you need one organ failing? Do you need two organs failing? Do you need to be to the point where you\u2019re bleeding, where you need a blood transfusion?\u201d\n\u201cPatients are confused. Physicians are confused. Ethicists, lawyers are getting involved in care. That\u2019s just clouding the issue and creating a situation where we\u2019re offering worse care for patients.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON PATIENT CONCERNS\nDr. Megan Clowse, rheumatologist\n\u201cI have certainly heard more interest from women lately about having tubal ligations rather than relying on things like IUD or implant, things we consider long-term, reversible contraception so a woman can change her mind in a few years and decide to get pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cI am hearing women who are afraid of having something bad happen to them during a pregnancy to the point where they\u2019re willing to sacrifice their desire for future children even though they\u2019re not entirely sure they don\u2019t want children.\u201d\n\u201cWe are beginning to have conversations with our patients who are on medications with a risk for long-term birth defects.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDr. Maria Small, maternal and fetal medicine specialist\n\u201cMany of my patients are asking, \u2018If something is seen, how soon do I have to make a decision if there\u2019s something major wrong with my baby and I may not want my baby to live with a major birth defect and a severely compromised quality of life?\u2019 These are decisions that individuals make on a regular basis. When they have a change in guidelines where those decisions need to be made earlier, it becomes more challenging and it becomes more painful. No one can say for sure what they would do in the circumstance many are put in.\u201d\n\u201cHaving those options \u2013 the option of ending a pregnancy -- needs to be available to individuals who need it.\u201d\n\u201cWe are in a maternal health crisis in the United States. We already are dealing with trying to help providers and patients know the warning signs for pregnancy-related conditions that need to be acted upon.\u201d\n\u201cYou have conditions where legislators are determining when you can and can\u2019t act on condition in pregnancy. This is not their role. And many of them have shown us over and over again by their statements have no clue about pregnancy and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\u201cIt really is sad and disturbing that we are fighting so hard to decrease maternal mortality rates and yet we have conditions where people are wondering, \u2018Can I intervene in this condition that usually is associated with maternal death, like an ectopic pregnancy?\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\nON AN EVENTUAL RISE IN BIRTH RATE\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared for nationally is an increased in birth rate. We\u2019re already seeing rural hospitals closing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s another thing that, as medical providers across the country, we need to start thinking about how to prepare for more pregnancies.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing predictions that maternal mortality will increase in states where it\u2019s already high. Many of those states that have high maternal mortality rates also have very strict abortion bans.\u201d\n\u201cI think we need to be prepared for the future of obstetrics in our country.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON CONSEQUENCES OF ABORTION BAN ON RHEUMATOLOGY CARE\nDr. Megan Clowse\n\u201cWomen with rheumatic disease, which is a large collection of autoimmune diseases in which the immune system is attacking a woman\u2019s own body, can have a lot of complications during pregnancy.\u201d\n\u201cWe see high rates of pregnancies lost, preterm birth, stillbirth, preeclampsia and severe health consequences both short term and long term for both the mother and the baby.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion bans really change the landscape of rheumatic care for women of reproductive age. Not just the women who are pregnant or want to be pregnant, but all women of reproductive age because so many of our medications either can, we know, impact pregnancy with complications, or might.\u201d\n\u201cSome of our most commonly used medications, bedrock rheumatology medications \u2026 are known to increase birth defects when there\u2019s first trimester exposure. I\u2019m particularly concerned the use of these medications is going to decrease in women of reproductive age who are not trying to get pregnant, leading to increased medical complications and disability, organ failure and in some situations, premature death.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON ABORTION BAN EFFECTS ON PREGNANT WOMEN WITH CARDIAC DISEASE \nDr. Maria Small\n\u201cSo many cardiac diseases can result in a much higher risk of death in pregnancy. So sometimes individuals who are pregnant, with a cardiac condition, need to have the option to terminate a pregnancy, to end a pregnancy, as a life-saving action for themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIn general, we know the safety of abortion relative to carrying a pregnancy to term is something that\u2019s very important. People don\u2019t necessarily realize there\u2019s a 14-times higher risk of carrying a pregnancy to term in general compared to a termination of pregnancy, an abortion.\u201d\n\u201cThis is just part of women\u2019s health care, care for pregnant individuals and postpartum individuals, that people don\u2019t seem to be taking into account in this banning of this very important part of reproductive care.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON CARE COMPLICATIONS FROM AN ABORTION BAN\nBeverly Gray\n\u201cThere are a whole host of medical conditions that impact people of reproductive age. Until people have an understanding of what individuals are facing, it\u2019s really hard to comprehend.\u201d\n\u201cWe all know or care for someone or love someone who\u2019s had an abortion. I think when we\u2019re allowed that window into people\u2019s lives and understanding what they\u2019re facing, we\u2019re able to understand how decisions are made, how folks are approaching their lives and their futures.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON DETERMINING WHEN A PREGNANT WOMAN\u2019S LIFE IS IN DANGER\nDr. Megan Clowse\n\u201cPregnancies that threaten the life of a woman with rheumatic disease are surprisingly common. I probably see one or two women a year who conceive when their rheumatic disease is active to an extent that could lead to kidney damage or damage to another organ or can drive up her blood pressure dangerously high and put her at risk for stroke or a heart attack.\u201d\n\u201cOften at the same time that the woman\u2019s health is in danger, the pregnancy itself, the developing fetus, is also at very high risk for a very early delivery. Sometimes before it is viable and can survive outside the womb and sometimes in the first weeks of viability when it will require months in the intensive care nursery and likely, if they make it out alive, have long-term permanent consequences.\u201d\n\u201cThese conversations with patients are really challenging. It\u2019s not like a woman can walk in really early in pregnancy and I can say, \u2018You for sure are going to have a catastrophic outcome.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhere do you personally draw the line? Of your safety? Your ability to mother your existing children? Your ability to survive this pregnancy versus your desire to continue this specific pregnancy? How they weigh this specific pregnancy that will likely end in catastrophe versus a potential future pregnancy that could be very well planned and lead to a very successful delivery.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nuance that physicians and patients really take very seriously. These are long conversations. These are hard conversations. These are conversations in which women involve their spouse. Involve their families. Involve their priests and pastors and other people who can really help guide them through these life-changing decisions. Different women pick different things.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON WHETHER \u2018LATE-TERM\u2019 ABORTION IS A REAL THING \nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cA \u2018late-term abortion\u2019 is not a medical term. It\u2019s not a term that we physicians use. It\u2019s a term that\u2019s very politicized, that politicians use to make it appear that the vast majority of abortions are happening in the late second, third trimester. Which is absolutely not the case. We know the vast majority of abortion care that occurs in our country happens in the first eight weeks of pregnancy. Only 1.2 percent of care happens after 20 weeks, and that\u2019s typically before viability. It\u2019s right around the 20th week. In North Carolina that rate is even lower.\u201d\n\u201cThose are the cases politicians want to talk about, that there\u2019s this care happening right at term pregnancy. That\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\u201cWe take care of very sick, medically complicated patients all the time here in our institution. Many of those patients, they want to continue their pregnancies. They want to have hope for those pregnancies. We give them that hope.\u201d\n\u201cThrowing around that term is kind of dangerous. I think politicians are trying to be doctors and using non-medical language to make it seem like something nefarious is happening. Which is not the case.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE POTENTIAL INCREASE OF ABORTION PILLS \u2013 AND ASSOCIATED RISKS\nDr. Megan Clowse\n\u201cWomen who terminate, who do medical terminations at home and don\u2019t let their doctor know \u2013 particularly in states where this might be illegal, I think that women are not going to be forthcoming with their providers, we will not really understand their risk landscape when they\u2019re calling.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to know how to help them have a successful pregnancy in the future. So I do think that\u2019s risky and problematic.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON PHYSICIANS AFRAID OF PROVIDING TOO LITTLE CARE\nDr. Megan Clowse\n\u201cI think physicians are concerned about that. We go into becoming doctors in order to help our patients live the best lives that they can. Sometimes that means talking about abortion and helping patients access abortion. I think doctors are concerned that they\u2019re not going to have the ability to do that for their patients, and that could lead to legal consequences for them. There\u2019s a lot of talk in the other direction, but I think it\u2019s important that we remember that when we provide substandard care to our patients, we do them a disservice and that puts all of us at some risk.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON INEQUITIES IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nDr. Maria Small\n\u201cThe whole idea that people being afraid they may be criminalized if they\u2019re seeking out abortion care, even if they\u2019re seeking out support related to how to self-manage termination. You have a scenario where people who may, because of previous injustices in the healthcare system, or previous mistrust of the healthcare system, are contributing to some of the maternal mortality in the United States. And you have a scenario where you\u2019ve placed individuals in an adversarial position that may even involve law enforcement. That\u2019s a very dangerous situation for communities of color.\u201d\n\u201cThis environment of placing pregnant and potentially pregnant individuals in this kind of toxic relationship with healthcare providers is one that is only going to worsen maternal mortality \u2026 for Black women in America.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON COMPLICATING MISCARRIAGE CARE\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cThe medications that we use for miscarriage management are absolutely the same as the ones we used for medication abortion care.\u201d\n\u201cThe process of someone\u2019s body having a miscarriage versus going through the normal process of medication abortion, there\u2019s no litmus test that you can say, \u2018Oh, this patient had a miscarriage, or not.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat worries patients. They wonder, will doctors know what\u2019s going on with my body? Will they test me for these medications? It doesn\u2019t even matter because those are the same medications we use for miscarriage.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE BIGGEST CONCERN NOW\nDr. Maria Small\n\u201cMental health. This is an area that is garnering, appropriately, additional attention in our country.\u201d\n\u201cSevere maternal morbidity is associated with a higher risk for maternal conditions like depression and even Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. These are things that are life-threatening, that don\u2019t cause death, but they would cause death if they weren\u2019t treated.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking individuals to be pushed to the brink of death \u2026. because a legislator has deemed that be the case. That is something that really concerns me, it troubles me.\u201d\n\u201cI think we just have no sense of just how bad this is going to impact individuals in our country.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE FUTURE OF OB-GYN CARE\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cIn states like Texas and others that already had a strict ban in place, they\u2019re seeing how those changes are happening right before their eyes. They\u2019re seeing patients\u2019 lives being put at risk on a daily basis. They\u2019re having to give patients non evidence-based advice and recommendations because their state legislators are saying that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a patient is experiencing or going through. You can\u2019t imagine it until you\u2019re facing it yourself. That trust between a patient and their physician or their healthcare provider needs to be reinstated. There\u2019s this idea that a ban will make care safer for the patient \u2013 that\u2019s absolutely not true at all. In fact it makes care less safe. It will likely increase maternal mortality in this country.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a simple question of right or wrong. This is a complicated issue and people feel differently about it, but we have to let patients have autonomy over their lives.\u201d\nFaculty Participants\nMegan Clowse, M.D.\nDr. Megan Clowse is a rheumatologist with Duke Health and an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the Duke School of Medicine.
