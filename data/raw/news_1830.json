Government authorities have stressed this week that the law was, therefore, not the cause of the woman\u2019s death. They stressed that women have a right to a legal abortion in such cases and that the hospital violated her right to a legal abortion.\nSeveral women have now died after the constitutional court ruled in 2020 that women could no longer terminate pregnancies in cases of severe fetal deformities.\nWomen\u2019s rights advocates have argued that the current law and the overall conservative climate have had a chilling effect. They have said another problem has been doctors refusing to perform abortions on grounds of their moral conscience.\nProsecutors have opened an investigation into Lalik\u2019s death. They are already looking at two similar cases of pregnant women who died in hospital after the death of the fetus they were carrying.\nIn 2021, after a pregnant 30-year-old mother from Pszczyna died, her family blamed doctors\u2019 \u201cwait-and-see attitude\u201d.\nA year later, a 37-year-old woman died in Czestochowa, a few weeks after she lost 12-week-old twin fetuses.\n\nSource: News Agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
