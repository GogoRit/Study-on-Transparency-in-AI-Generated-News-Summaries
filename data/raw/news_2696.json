Being anti-abortion also appears at odds with Ivanka Trump\u2019s own efforts to empower women around the world, most notably her Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, with experts agreeing that one of the most important factors in allowing women to thrive is the ability to control how many children they have and when.\u00a0\n\n\nFurther Reading\nThe Pragmatism and New Populism of Ivanka Trump (RealClearPolitics)\nIvanka Trump says she respects \u201call sides\u201d of the debate over abortion, which she is \u201cunapologetically\u201d opposed to.
