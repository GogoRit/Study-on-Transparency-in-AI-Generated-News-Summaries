All day long, triumphant messages flitted across my screen\u2014from the ACLU, the Center for Reproductive Rights, Vote ProChoice, Vote Mama, and many more. \u201cWe Are Shook,\u201d was the headline from Rewire, the online reproductive justice news service. \u201cSCOTUS just protected abortion access.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nWhew. June Medical Services v. Russo was the case that pro-choicers feared would devastate abortion rights in Louisiana and give the signal for open season on abortion around the nation. A win for the state would have meant upholding a law requiring abortion clinic doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, something all but impossible to obtain; all but one of Louisiana\u2019s three clinics would have been shuttered. The strange part is, in 2016, the court decided an identical case from Texas, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. That year, the court ruled 5 to 4 that the law served no health purpose but only made abortion harder to get. That the court would revisit the issue now that hard-line conservative Bret Kavanaugh has replaced moderate Anthony Kennedy seemed like a bad omen.\nBut surprise. John Roberts, who had voted to uphold the restriction in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, voted against it this time\u2014not because he has changed his mind about abortion restrictions (he has been opposed to abortion for his entire public career, and in his separate opinion wrote that Whole Woman\u2019s Health was \u201cwrongly decided\u201d) but on the narrow ground of respecting precedent. Should a different restriction make its way to the court, one that hasn\u2019t already been struck down, there\u2019s nothing in Roberts\u2019s opinion today that would require him to reject it. \u201cRoberts\u2019s opinion is less an endorsement of the right than it is a warning that litigants should not overreach,\u201d writes Ian Millhiser in Vox.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take our small victories where we\u2019ve got them, even if they might be repealed tomorrow,\u201d reproductive justice theorist and activist Loretta Ross told me when I reached her by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s always a Sword of Damocles hanging over our head.\u201d Too right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m breaking out the champagne, but only allowing myself one glass. The next case to come before the court\u2014and there are several in the pipeline\u2014might strike Roberts differently. He is the swing vote now. \ncourtroom drama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Roberts Is Not Your Friend\nElie Mystal\n\n\nNaturally, everyone is trying to get inside Roberts\u2019s head. Is he trying to shore up the Supreme Court\u2019s nonpartisan reputation, battered by nakedly pro-Republican decisions like Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and Shelby County v. Holder (which gutted the Voting Rights Act and for which he wrote the majority decision)? Does he want to help Trump get reelected? Is he laying the groundwork for anti-abortion decisions down the road? Does he not want to go down in history as the man who overturned Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed Roe and barred restrictions that placed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s ability to get an abortion? Maybe a bit of all four.\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\n\n\nDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wild History of \u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Voting\n\nThe Wild History of \u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Voting\n\n\n\nGinny Hogan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Can\u2019t the Political Press Just Say the Truth About Trump?

That 70 percent of Americans support Roe, that one in four women will have had an abortion by menopause, that countless women still living had illegal abortions before Roe, that legal abortion underwrites every aspect of modern women\u2019s lives, and men\u2019s lives too\u2014none of that has the traction in our politics or our legal system that you would expect. Donald Trump was pro-choice before he ran for president, a fact that reassured a lot of naive people during the campaign, but he has done more to restrict access to birth control and abortion than any president in modern American history. In his three years and change, he has nominated Kavanaugh and Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, placed on the federal bench 200 judges, the most recent of whom, Cory Wilson, has called for a \u201ccomplete and immediate reversal\u201d of Roe, and seeded departments and agencies like Health and Human Services with anti-choice fanatics.\nLittle by little, like that proverbial frog relaxing in slowly heating water, we\u2019ve gotten used to abortion being hard to find and hard to pay for. \u201cLouisiana has three clinics that serve a million women of reproductive age,\u201d the abortion sociologist Carole Joffe told me. In 1992 there were 17; in 2014 there were five. \nCurrent Issue\n\n\n\n \nView our current issue\n\n\n\n\n\nJoffe\u2019s eye-opening new book, Obstacle Course: The Everyday Struggle to Get an Abortion in America, co-authored with David Cohen, describes in minute detail the effect on real people of the more than 1,000 abortion restrictions passed since Roe was decided. Especially for poor and low-income women, who make up the majority of abortion patients, restrictions that might not seem so onerous to a better-off woman within reach of a clinic\u2014a 36-hour waiting period, for example\u2014can make for serious problems. Class and geographical disparities in abortion access are part of the reason anything short of a direct threat to Roe has often failed to excite a critical mass of pro-choice voters. \u201cI worry that people who don\u2019t obsess about abortion 24/7 will think, well okay, it\u2019s safe,\u201d Joffe told me. \u201cI worry that the pro-choice movement will overstate the victory, and part of the electorate that would have been particularly motivated to vote won\u2019t be so now.\u201d\nI worry about that too. So let me be clear: What we got on Monday was less a victory than a temporary reprieve. If Trump ekes out a win in November, Roberts may not be the swing vote for long. Trump will almost certainly get the chance to replace at least one and possibly more of the liberals of the Supreme Court with hard-liners like his previous nominees Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, and nominate enough federal judges to turn the appeals courts hard-right and anti-abortion for a generation or even longer. Perhaps Roe will be overturned outright; perhaps it will be allowed to remain the law of the land, while the court simply upholds every restriction that comes before it.\nPro-choicers have one chance to stop this. Let\u2019s not waste it.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
