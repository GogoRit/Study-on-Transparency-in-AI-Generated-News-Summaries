Previously back burnered by both former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump\u2019s campaigns, Ginsburg\u2019s death left a hole in the Supreme Court, allowing Trump, who has been called America\u2019s most pro-life president, to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the bench. Unlike the pro-choice Ginsburg, Barrett has spoken out loudly against abortion, and it\u2019s possible that Roe v. Wade, the landmark court case that legalized abortion, could be overturned if she is confirmed.Meanwhile, Biden, a Catholic, has pledged to make Roe v. Wade \u201cthe law of the land.\u201dAs Catholic voters head to the polls on Election Day (or mail in their ballots early), they must make a decision between two candidates: Biden, himself a Catholic, who is pro-choice, but has promised human rights and social service policies in line with Christian teachings, and Trump, whose pro-life stance is strong, but other policies limit access to health care for many people.We turned to Catholics with opposing views to debate: Can pro-life Catholics vote for Joe Biden?AdvertisementYes: If every life is sacred, vote for the candidate who will save the most lives.By Thomas Groome and Richard GaillardetzMay pro-life Catholics vote for former Vice President Joe Biden? Our consciences lead us to say an unqualified \u201cyes,\u201d and then some. First, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, echoing the teaching of Popes Francis and Benedict, makes clear that Catholics should not be single-issue voters. While we may not vote for candidates because they support abortion, we can do so for the totality of their views. This reflects Pope Francis\u2019 statement that \u201cequally sacred\u201d are the lives of those already born.Further, and recognizing that other Catholics may reach a different prudential judgment, out of the depths of our Catholic faith, we are convinced that not only may we vote for Biden, but even must do so, and for grave moral reasons.As faithful Catholic Christians, we accept the teaching of our church that \u201cevery human life, from the moment of conception until death, is sacred.\u201d This being said, we recognize that more than 80% of Americans favor allowing abortion, at least in certain circumstances.The greatest Catholic theologian, Thomas Aquinas, taught that laws must reflect \u201cthe consensus of the governed\u201d if they are to be effective. So, until the great majority of Americans oppose abortion, Catholics cannot impose our moral norms on the rest of society.\u201cA President Biden will make it more possible for people to avoid unintended pregnancies.\u201dThomas Groome and Richard GaillardetzSo what are Catholics like us to do with our ethical convictions that cannot \u2014 at least at this time \u2014 become the law of the land? Again, Aquinas advises that when applying general moral principles, one must take account of the social context and discern how best to apply them. In such circumstances, Aquinas advised that we are to choose the greater good and the lesser evil. The greater good that is achievable now is to significantly reduce the number of abortions with effective social services. Fully confident in the deep commitments of Biden to his Catholic faith, and especially to its social teachings, he \u2014 not Donald Trump \u2014 is the one who will implement this accommodation.Our best warrant is the record of the Obama-Biden administrations. Over their eight years, and by improved health care and social services, they reduced the U.S. abortion rate by 27%.A President Biden will make it more possible for people to avoid unintended pregnancies, and that all who desire to bring a pregnancy to term will have the necessary health care and then the resources needed to care for their child after birth.We\u2019re also confident that a Biden-Harris administration will champion an aggressive program to promote adoptions by strengthening the Adoption Assistance Act and streamlining adoption procedures. Further, providing health care that makes available improved means of birth control can greatly reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. Even for Catholics who accept church teaching forbidding artificial means of birth control, such social services can be seen as choosing the lesser evil \u2014 to abortion.Now contrast a Biden-Harris administration to four more years of a Trump-Pence one. Trump has done many things that can be deemed evil. This includes his refusal to address the 400-year pandemic of racism, his approving of Nazi-like groups and their hate-filled rhetoric, his contributing to environmental destruction, his disrespect for immigrants, his dumbfounding denial of the scientific evidence regarding COVID-19, his incessant lying, and the list goes on.It is not for us to dictate the conscience-based decisions of other Catholics. But speaking from the depths of our own souls, not only may we vote for Biden-Harris, but believe we must do so. To do otherwise would be contrary to our consciences \u2014 our sin.Thomas Groome is a senior professor of theology and religious education at Boston College. Richard Gaillardetz is the Joseph chair in Catholic systematic theology at Boston College.No: A Biden presidency would jeopardize our faith and our country.By Bernadette RepiskyThere was once a time when a politician looking to be the Democratic contender for president of the United States declared abortions should be \u201clegal, safe, and rare.\u201d That was Hillary Clinton during her first failed presidential bid in 2008. Today, the Democratic Party led by Joe Biden would reject her and those words. The former senator from Delaware used to consistently vote to at least limit abortion and the federal funding of it. No more.Biden has devolved on the issue of life. For every positive move Donald Trump has made to defend life, Biden has promised to reverse, repeal, and rescind it. He has declared he will make Roe v. Wade \u201cthe law of the land.\u201d And he said he will end the Mexico City policy that bans federal dollars going to programs overseas that provide abortion. In an affront to religious liberty, Biden also supports policies that would force organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor to cover contraception and abortion-causing drugs in their health plans.Biden\u2019s silence as high-ranking members of his party call for looser and looser restrictions on abortion, including allowing abortion through the ninth month of pregnancy, speaks volumes.\u201cFor every positive move Trump has made to defend life, Biden has promised to reverse, repeal, and rescind it.\u201dBernadette RepiskyWith that in mind, Catholic voters must examine the positions of Republican President Trump and Democratic candidate Biden on this issue.\u201cThe threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority because it directly attacks life itself, because it takes place within the sanctuary of the family, and because of the number of lives destroyed,\u201d stated Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kan., United States Catholic Conference of Bishops\u2019 chairman, on pro-life activities. \u201cAbortion is an intrinsic evil, meaning that it is never permitted or morally justified, regardless of individual circumstances or intentions.\u201dThe Biden-Harris ticket has accepted an endorsement and money from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\u201cLife is the preeminent issue,\u201d Archbishop Nelson P\u00e9rez of Philadelphia said this summer. He also commented on the youth who attend the annual pro-life rally in Washington, D.C., attended for the first time by a sitting president in January. \u201cAt least 70% are young adults. They clap, they sing, they hold their banners. They\u2019re just on fire.\u201d I can personally attest to this.These young people embrace science and truth. With its own DNA separate from the mother, created male or female, life begins at conception. The 3D ultrasound image is a baby, a human being, not a \u201cchoice.\u201d These youth are the future. A Biden presidency, however, would jeopardize our faith and our country. Not only is Biden \u201cunabashedly pro-abortion,\u201d the Democrats are pushing America toward socialism, a \u201csoul-robbing ideology that always and inevitably leads to totalitarianism, where the government presumes to put itself in the place of God, in the lives of its subservient citizens,\u201d said Father Edward Meeks of Maryland. Socialists view our church as \u201can enemy to be destroyed, or, at the very least, to be silenced and marginalized.\u201dThe Gospel tells us the unborn John the Baptist leaped in the womb at the mere presence of Jesus in Mary\u2019s womb. Is there any doubt that we\u2019re to honor and respect these yet-to-be-born lives?Bernadette Repisky is a college-educated \u201csuburban housewife\u201d enthusiastically supporting President Donald Trump again. A practicing Catholic, she\u2019s happily married and the mother of four adult children.Read more Inquirer Pro/ConsDo we still need presidential debates?Should Supreme Court justices have term limits?Should the U.S. privatize the Postal Service?AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAbout UsAbout The InquirerDiversity & InclusionAdvertiseContact UsLicensing & PermissionsPhoto ReprintsNewspapers in EducationJobs & InternshipsInquirer EventsAcel Moore WorkshopsNewsroom StaffHelp and FeedbackNews & InfoNewsSportsSports BettingEntertainmentBusinessHealthFoodLifeOpinionArchivesSpecial ReportsSite MapMarketplaceSubscribeInquirer StoreJob ListingsAll ClassifiedsDeath NoticesLegal NoticesGift Subscriptionse-EditionsThe InquirerThe Daily NewsSubscriber ServicesMobile AppsApple iOSGoogle AndroidTwitterFacebookInstagram\u00a9 2024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLCTerms of Use/Privacy Policy/Cancellation Policy/California Notice/California residents do not sell my data request"
