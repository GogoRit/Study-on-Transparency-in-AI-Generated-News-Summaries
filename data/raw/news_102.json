Here\u2019s where they stand, and what\u2019s coming next:6-week abortion ban/Heartbeat Bill \n \n\nThe latest:\u00a0 A federal appeals court\u2019s three-judge panel blocked the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban, upholding a lower court\u2019s ruling from May 2019. The law was \u201cdoomed,\u201d according to the ruling, because the panel was bound by a recent decision finding a 15-week abortion ban unconstitutional.\u201cIf a ban on abortion after 15 weeks is unconstitutional, then it follows that a ban on abortion at an earlier stage of pregnancy is also unconstitutional,\u201d reads Thursday\u2019s order blocking the six-week ban.Former Gov. Phil Bryant signed the six-week ban, dubbed a heartbeat bill, into law March 2019, making it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected.Hillary Schneller with the Center for Reproductive Rights\u201cThis is now the second time in two months the Fifth Circuit has told Mississippi that it cannot ban abortion,\u201d Hillary Schneller, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights who leads this and other lawsuits challenging anti-abortion laws in the state, said in a statement. \u201cDespite the relentless attempts of Mississippi and other states, the right to legal abortion remains the law of the land \u2026 This court decided not two months ago that Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban was unconstitutional. Even the state agrees that, under that decision, the 6-week ban cannot stand.\u201d\n\n\n \n \n\n\nMS Letter to Fifth Circuit Re 6-week Ban, from CCR (PDF)MS Letter to Fifth Circuit Re 6-week Ban, from CCR (Text)\n\nBackground:\u00a0 After Bryant signed the law, the New York City-based Center for Reproductive Rights quickly sued the state on behalf of the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the only abortion clinic in the state. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves subsequently blocked the law from taking effect. However, the state appealed that decision while another measure banning abortions at 15 weeks was also under appeal.When the six-week abortion ban bill was signed into law last year it was the most restrictive in the country, drawing national attention for attempting to ban abortions before many women know they are pregnant. Mississippi was one of nine states that passed abortion bans in 2019, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah. Mississippi\u2019s was the first to reach the appeals stage and is the farthest along in the court system.Opponents of the six-week ban decried it as a brazen attempt to erode reproductive rights when the previous year\u2019s ban was still winding its way through courts. Advocates, as well as Judge Reeves who first blocked the ban, pointed to the state\u2019s poor maternal and infant health outcomes as hypocrisy in face of abortion restrictions that claim to advance the safety of women and fetuses. Scientists quickly rebuked the heartbeat metric as unsupported by medical science, calling it an \u201cintentional obfuscation\u201d unrelated to actual gestation development.What\u2019s next: The state has not yet announced whether it would appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201cI am disappointed in the 5th Circuit decision yesterday on Mississippi\u2019s heartbeat bill and am consulting with pro-life experts right now to determine the best strategy to advance the cause of life,\u201d Newly elected Attorney General Lynn Fitch, whose office represents the state, told Mississippi Today in an email Friday.15-week abortion banThe latest: After a federal appeals court struck down the 15-week ban in December 2019, then-Attorney General Jim Hood asked the court to reconsider, which would have put the case in front of the entire 17-judge court.The court declined last month to re-hear the case, reiterating that states can restrict but not outright ban abortion. Less than two months after courts affirmed the block of the 15-week ban, the subsequently passed, stricter six-week ban was brought before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel earlier this month.Background: At the time the strictest abortion law in the country, the state\u2019s 15-week ban was signed into law March 2018. In November of that year, Judge Reeves blocked it. The state appealed, mounting the first federal appeals case of recent bans. Last October, the state and Center for Reproductive Rights argued the case before the three-judge panel, which ultimately ruled it unconstitutional in December 2019.Attorney General Lynn Fitch said she was disappointed in the appeals court ruling against the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban.After the October arguments, in which Texas state attorneys lead the charge over similar abortion restrictions in Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana, opposing attorney Schneller addressed the irony and question of the pending six-week ban: \u201cThe cases are raising the same exact issue \u2013 whether you can ban abortion before viability and the Supreme Court has already decided and said no, states cannot do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the fact that Mississippi has passed a 15-week ban and the six-week ban shows that they are trying to subject women\u2019s fundamental right to perpetual relitigation even though the court has been clear that these bans will not stand up in court.\u201dWhat\u2019s next: Attorney General Fitch told Mississippi Today in an email that she is focused on advancing the 15-week ban amidst being \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the six-week ruling. \u201cIn the meantime, my office will continue to zealously appeal our 15-week regulation to the U.S. Supreme Court and strongly defend our pro-life laws under attack at the trial court level,\u201d she said.City of Jackson \u201cbuffer zone\u201d ruleThe latest: Earlier this month, federal Judge Daniel Jordan agreed with anti-abortion plaintiffs that the city of Jackson\u2019s buffer zone \u2013 meant to keep protesters at the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization away from patients \u2013 was a state issue, not a federal one and kicked the case back to state court. Currently in effect, the ordinance requires protesters to stay 8 feet away from patients, and bans people from congregating or demonstrating within 15 feet of the abortion facility.Background: Last year Jackson passed an ordinance that created a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around the state\u2019s only abortion clinic, preventing face-to-face contact with patients and protesters. An anti-abortion group called \u201cSidewalk Advocates for Life,\u201d affiliated with local crisis pregnancy centers, sued the city saying the ordinance violates their free speech under Mississippi law. Lawyers for Jackson last year filed to move the case into federal courts citing the case\u2019s First Amendment questions. The plaintiffs disagreed, arguing their challenges to the city relied on state rather than federal constitutional protections.The Mississippi Justice Institute, which is challenging the ordinance on behalf of plaintiffs, applauded the decision. \u201cJackson\u2019s argument completely disregarded the principles of federalism upon which our country was founded, denigrated the competence of state courts to hear state law claims, and was dismissive of the authority of state courts to interpret their own state\u2019s Constitution,\u201d said Aaron Rice, director of the institute, in a statement. \u201cFortunately, the federal court understood that, and ensured that state courts will have this important opportunity to interpret the Mississippi Constitution\u2019s free speech protections.\u201d A spokeswoman for Jackson declined to comment.What\u2019s next: The case will stay in federal court until Judge Jordan determines attorney fees the city of Jackson owes to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys at the Mississippi Justice Institute, the legal arm of the conservative think tank Mississippi Center for Public Policy. Afterward, the case will move back to local state court. Currently, the buffer zone is still active. \n\nYou deserve answers.
