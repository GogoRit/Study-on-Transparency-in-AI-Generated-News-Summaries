The Trump administration reinstated the restriction in 2017 by presidential memorandum and then extended it to cover all applicable US global health funding. That made some $9.5 billion in aid for everything from HIV treatment to clean water projects and child immunizations contingent on groups agreeing not to discuss or perform abortions.\n    \n\n            The memorandum also directs the Health and Human Services Department to immediately move to consider rescinding the Trump administration rule blocking health care providers in the federally funded Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions, according to the Biden administration.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden speaks about climate change issues in the State Dining Room of the White House on January 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. \n\nPool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nBiden will sign executive order to reopen Affordable Care Act enrollment\n\n\n\n\n            Taken together, the actions show an administration receptive to at least the initial requests of advocates eager to codify a new era of abortion protections after the prior administration took restrictions on the procedure to unprecedented levels.\n    \n\n            Advocates for abortion restrictions slammed Biden over the announcement, which coincides with the eve of anti-abortion activists holding the annual March for Life event on Friday \u2013 though this year it will be virtual. Former President Donald Trump made history in 2020 by being the first sitting President to participate in the event, which for decades has drawn large crowds of supporters each year to the National Mall.\n    \n\n            The moves come as health care providers, reproductive rights groups and progressive lawmakers seek a more permanent end to longstanding barriers to the procedure.\n    \n\n    Abortion access abroad\n\n\n            Beyond US borders, the impact of Trump\u2019s expanded Mexico City Policy, formally called \u201cProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\u201d has \u201creally been devastating,\u201d said Melvine Ouyo, a Nairobi-based reproductive health nurse and former clinic director at Family Health Options Kenya. \u201cSo many lives were lost.\u201d\n    \n\n            The policy, also known as the \u201cglobal gag rule,\u201d has been instituted by Republican administrations since President Ronald Reagan and repealed by Democratic ones. A State Department review published last year of the Trump administration\u2019s policy to bar funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions found it has also affected efforts to treat tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS as well as to deliver nutritional assistance, among other programs, and has had significant impact in sub-Saharan Africa.\n    \n\n            Advocates and practitioners like Ouyo say the deaths result from the cuts to health care of all kinds for women, including access to contraception, which sends them in search of illegal, often unsafe and deadly abortions.\n    \n\n            \u201cThis global gag rule has been one of the most detrimental policies to women\u2019s lives, especially women coming from marginalized communities,\u201d Ouyu told CNN. \u201cBiden really has a lot to do.\u201d\n    \n\n\n    Biden's First 100 Days\n  \n\nBiden aims for comprehensive climate approach as he halts new oil and gas leases on federal landBiden administration takes cautious approach as it touts using Defense Production ActFirst lady Jill Biden expected to take active role in immigrant family reunification\n\n\n\n\n\n            Seema Jalan, executive director of the Universal Access Project and Policy at the United Nations Foundation, said advocates see an opportunity for the Biden administration to work with Congress to make broad changes. She cited the Helms Amendment \u2014 which bars US foreign aid for performing or promoting abortion, not just to foreign non-profits, but to governments, multilateral organizations and US non-profits \u2014 and the Hyde amendment, which imposes similar restrictions on groups within the US. The policies currently allow for abortions in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the pregnant person\u2019s life.\n    \n\n            \u201cThere\u2019s the hard work of the administration working with Congress putting in place permanent solutions to harmful policy: addressing global gag, Helms, Hyde, and other technical fixes that are highly consequential,\u201d Jalan said.\n    \n\n            Anti-abortion advocates, however, criticized the rollback, arguing it runs counter to Biden\u2019s professed efforts to bring the country together. \n    \n\n            \u201cFunneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the \u2018unity\u2019 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire,\u201d said SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.\n    \n\n            \u201cRescinding the Mexico City Policy on the eve of the March for Life is a deeply disturbing move, especially when the President says he wants national unity,\u201d March for Life president Jeanne Mancini said Thursday, adding that the government \u201cshould work to protect the inherent dignity of all persons, born and unborn.\u201d\n    \n\n    Abortion access domestically\n\n\n            Biden\u2019s memorandum also deals with Title X, a federally-funded program that served about 4 million people a year prior to the abortion referral rule\u2019s implementation, according to HHS. The program provides resources including contraception, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and preventive education and testing for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV \u2013 but not abortions.\n    \n\n            In 2019, Trump\u2019s HHS issued a rule to bar health care providers participating in the program from offering abortion referrals, a policy that opponents argued would hit low-income people, rural residents, communities of color and the uninsured hardest. The rule prompted multiple federal court challenges and was ultimately blocked in federal court. But in July of that year, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the rule to go into effect despite the ongoing challenge against it. \n    \n\n            The effects of the rule have been stark. Planned Parenthood \u2014 which previously covered 40% of Title X\u2019s patients and had been involved with the program since it began, according to the organization \u2014 withdrew from the program soon after the 9th Circuit decision. Additional clinics have dropped out of the program since the rule took effect, leaving six states without Title X providers, according to data from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 1,000 Title X sub-recipients and sites \u2014 approximately 25% of the 4,000 clinics in the program prior to the rule \u2014 have withdrawn from the program, per Kaiser.\n    \n\n            National Right to Life President Carol Tobias lamented Biden\u2019s memorandum on Thursday.\n    \n\n            \u201cDuring the presidential campaign, Joe Biden made it clear that promoting abortion would be a priority in his administration and it would be done at the expense of taxpayers,\u201d Tobias, accusing him of dismantling \u201cdomestic protections that have saved countless lives \u2013 and put taxpayer money in the pockets of abortionists.\u201d\n    \n\n            Biden\u2019s memorandum, while a significant change of direction, represents just the beginning of advocates\u2019 goals of restoring the program.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe expect some commitment toward repairing the program, rescinding the rule and getting longstanding providers back into the network so that services can be restored in parts of the country that have gone without Title X funding for so long,\u201d said Audrey Sandusky, communications director for the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA). \n    \n\n            Around 1.5 million people lost access to Title X coverage after the rule was implemented, according to Sandusky. The group counts nearly three-quarters of Title X grantees among its membership of providers and administrators and worked with the Biden transition team and HHS staff on Title X\u2019s future, she said. \n    \n\n            In light of how some \u201cpatients have been in the dark\u201d after they were no longer able to get free or low cost health care from their usual providers, \u201cI would say it would take a long time for providers to regain the trust and confidence that patients have had in them,\u201d Sandusky said, as well as \u201cto regain trust in the federal government and to assure providers that they have support that they need from this administration and from Congress.\u201d\n    \n\n            In a call with reporters on Wednesday, Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson called rolling back the Mexico City Policy and the Title X abortion referral restriction \u201ca great start, one that will increase access and meaningfully impact people\u2019s lives, but I\u2019ll emphasize again, this is a start.\u201d\n    \n\n            When asked about conversations between Planned Parenthood and the Biden administration on Title X, McGill Johnson described \u201cvery robust, and I would say, exciting conversations not just about the domestic gag rule but also thinking about how more investments can go into access to family planning and contraception, how to be more inclusive, how we can use policy to also engage men, to engage other populations.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWe need to improve and modernize Title X,\u201d McGill Johnson said, later adding, \u201cmaking sure that it meaningfully reflects the sexual and reproductive health care needs of all patients.\u201d\n    \n\n    Beyond Biden\u2019s actions\n\n\n            Lawmakers, pointing to data that show the policies result in more unsafe abortions, more unwanted pregnancies, more maternal deaths and have a disproportionate impact on Black and brown women, say they are seizing the moment as well.\n    \n\n            Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, chair of the House Appropriations Committee that oversees Title X funding, told CNN in an interview Wednesday that while she had not been in contact with the Biden administration on Title X, she\u2019s focused on returning the program to its prior form.\n    \n\n            \u201cWhat I\u2019m committed to in Appropriations, because we have jurisdiction over Title X funding, is to work with the administration and the providers, those who were forced out of the program, to make sure that the funding is there for them to get back in,\u201d she said. \u201cOr work in that legislative direction, and to ensure there are safeguards to make sure that we can\u2019t have what the Trump administration tried to do here.\u201d\n    \n\n            When asked if she would seek to increase funding in this legislative session, DeLauro replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a look at what we have by way of an allocation and so forth and, if I can, I will work to increase the funding.\u201d \n    \n\n            Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire is set to re-introduce on Thursday the Global HER Act, which would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy. She said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that the Trump administration not only implemented it, but expanded it.\n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m so relieved that President Biden has made rescinding this policy an early priority,\u201d Shaheen told CNN. \u201cThe data doesn\u2019t lie. We know how detrimental this policy has been \u2013 how it likely contributed to increased maternal deaths, unsafe abortions and compromised access to critical care. Rescinding this rule is the start but it is not enough \u2013 there needs to be a permanent fix.\u201d\n    \n\n            And in the House, Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and others will reintroduce a bill to repeal the Helms Amendment. Also in their sights: the Hyde Amendment.\n    \n\n            Access to reproductive health care and abortion, if needed, \u201cis central to women\u2019s independence, success and bodily autonomy,\u201d Schakowsky told CNN. \u201cIf you cannot control reproduction for yourself, then you can never really plan your life.\u201d\n    \n\n            And some lawmakers, along with reproductive rights groups, are pushing Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to go further. The Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus is asking Biden to take immediate action on multiple fronts beyond repealing the Mexico City policy and reconsidering the Title X rule, including expanding US foreign assistance support for abortion care, rescinding an executive order that restricts abortion access under the Affordable Care Act, and directing the Health and Human Services Secretary to lift the Food and Drug Administration decision that an over-the-counter medication to safely end early pregnancy cannot be mailed during the pandemic.\n    \n\n            Over 90 advocacy groups, including NFPRHA and Planned Parenthood, have presented the Biden administration with a \u201cBlueprint for Sexual and Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice\u201d calling for such actions and others, such as rescinding the Hyde Amendment.\n    \n\n            Marcela Howell, president of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda, which is one of the groups, told reporters Wednesday that lawmakers freely discussing abortion access contributed to their goals.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe reality is that all of us have been fighting stigma around abortion, and if we cannot get the administration and members of Congress to actually use the word abortion care, then that furthers the stigma,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we believe that it is a safe
