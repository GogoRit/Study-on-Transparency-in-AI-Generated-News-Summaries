Others say her story doesn\u2019t add up.Tracy ConnorUpdated\u00a0Aug. 26, 2020\u00a03:49AM EDT\u00a0/\u00a0Published\u00a0Aug. 25, 2020\u00a09:30PM EDT\u00a0Republican National Committee via GettyAnti-abortion activist Abby Johnson told the Republican National Convention an exceedingly graphic story of helping to terminate a pregnancy as a Planned Parenthood employee\u2014an account that has been challenged numerous times.The speech contained the kind of shock imagery embraced by some in the anti-abortion movement, with details that painted her former co-workers as heartless money-grubbers.She made reference to a \u201cpieces of children\u201d room and asked, \u201cDid you know abortion even had a smell?\u201dBut serious questions about Johnson\u2019s narrative\u2014which became the basis for the movie Unplanned\u2014have long been raised by records and a former friend.  As she told it Tuesday night, Johnson decided to quit Planned Parenthood and go \u201cpro-life\u201d a decade ago after she was asked to assist with an ultrasound-guided abortion and saw \u201can unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never forget what the doctor said next\u2014\u2018Beam me up, Scotty.\u2019\u201d  But Texas Monthly reported in 2009\u2014as Johnson became something of a celebrity\u2014that records provided by Planned Parenthood did not support her story.She claimed the fetus was 13 weeks, but there were no patients more than 10 weeks pregnant on the date in question, it reported. She said the patient was Black, and the only woman matching that description was six weeks pregnant and would not have undergone an ultrasound. Johnson claimed years later that the records must have been falsified.According to a 2009 report in Salon, Johnson might have had other reasons to quit her job: Planned Parenthood said in a court filing that she had been put on a \"performance improvement plan\u201d at work.Not long after, the Texas Observer reported that Johnson\u2019s friend Laura Kaminczak, who worked for another Planned Parenthood clinic, told them that she was fired, and Johnson was disciplined, for trash-talking colleagues in an email.\u201cShe was so pissed. She felt like she\u2019d given them everything, and this was just a slap in the face,\u201d Kaminczak told the\u00a0Observer. \u201cThis whole thing is really just about a disgruntled employee.\u201dKaminczak said that Johnson had talked about seeing an ultrasound-guided abortion but not in the way that she described it at the RNC on Tuesday night.\u201cShe was super-excited about it\u2014she said it seemed a lot more humane then the normal procedure, like the patient was in a lot less pain,\u201d she said.Johnson denied then that she quit because she was punished and also denied Kaminczak\u2019s allegation that she was broke and was enticed by the offer of $3,000 speaking gigs for the Coalition for Life.But Texas Monthly noted that when she posted on Facebook the night she quit, she did not mention any of the reasons she gave at the RNC.\u201cAlright. Here\u2019s the deal. I have been doing the work of two full time people for two years. Then, after I have been working my whole big butt off for them and prioritizing that company over my family, my friends and pretty much everything else in my life, they have the nerve to tell me that my job performance is \u2019slipping,\u2019\u2019 she posted.\u201cWHAT???!!! That is crazy. Anyone that knows me knows how committed I was to that job. They obviously do not value me at all. So, I\u2019m out and I feel really great about it!\u201dAhead of her moment in the biggest spotlight, Johnson came under scrutiny for comments that had nothing to do with abortion. Vice uncovered video of her discussing racial profiling in the context of her \u201cbrown son,\u201d Jude.\u201cRight now, Jude is an adorable, perpetually tan-looking little brown boy,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cBut one day, he\u2019s going to grow up and he\u2019s going to be a tall, probably sort of large, intimidating-looking-maybe brown man. And my other boys are probably gonna look like nerdy white guys.\u201dShe continued, \u201cStatistically, I look at our prison population and I see that there is a disproportionately high number of African-American males in our prison population for crimes, particularly for violent crimes. So statistically, when a police officer sees a brown man like my Jude walking down the road\u2014\u00a0as opposed to my white nerdy kids, my white nerdy men \u00a0walking down the road\u2014because of the statistics that he knows in his head, that these police officers know in their head, they\u2019re going to know that statistically my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.\u201d\u201cSo the fact that in his head, he would be more careful around my brown son than my white son, that doesn\u2019t actually make me angry. That makes that police officer smart, because of statistics.\u201d  Tracy ConnorTracy.Connor@thedailybeast.comGot a tip?
