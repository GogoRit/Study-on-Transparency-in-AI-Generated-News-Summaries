Lockdowns imposed to curb the coronavirus's\u00a0spread have put millions of women in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere out of reach of birth control and other sexual and reproductive health needs. Confined to their homes with husbands and others, they face unwanted pregnancies and little idea of when they can reach the outside world again.\n\n\u00a9 2020 AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was 13\u2026 I got pregnant from my older brother\u2026 He raped me starting when I was 11,\u201d a girl from Guatemala told one of us in 2015. She was one of the\u00a02 million\u00a0girls under 15 worldwide who give birth each year, often due to sexual violence.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is putting girls like her at even greater risk. While lockdowns reduce the spread of Covid-19, they also drive a global spike in reported\u00a0violence\u00a0in the home, and leaving some women and\u00a0girls isolated\u00a0with abusers, leading to increased unwanted pregnancies.\nThe pandemic is putting enormous pressure on health systems around the world as governments work to contain the virus and treat sick people. But governments also need to sustain other essential services, which according to the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0include sexual and reproductive health services.\nOverloaded hospitals, travel bans, lockdowns and border closures are making access to those services increasingly difficult. Poor and marginalized\u00a0women and girls, including those with\u00a0disabilities, especially risk losing access to needed services. And some governments\u2019 responses are making matters worse by discriminating against women and girls who need them.\nThe pandemic is exposing and exacerbating existing\u00a0inequalities. More than\u00a05 million\u00a0families in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean already spent more than 40 percent of their annual non-food household expenditures on maternal health services before the pandemic. With poor families hardest hit by the pandemic\u2019s\u00a0economic\u00a0consequences, they are likely to find it even harder to get quality maternal health care.\nGovernments need to make sure that people can get these services, regardless of ability to pay, and that pregnant women not only get pre-natal and birth care and have the\u00a0right\u00a0to make decisions about their\u00a0labor and delivery plan.\nBut they also need to protect everyone\u2019s choice about whether to become pregnant or continue a pregnancy. The International Planned Parenthood Federation reports that the pandemic has forced them to close\u00a0thousands\u00a0of family planning facilities\u2014either due to government orders or social distancing needs\u2014 Colombia, El Salvador, Pakistan, Germany, Ghana, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have each had to close at least 100 such facilities.\nDirectors for Marie Stopes, an organization that provides contraception and safe abortion services in many countries, in\u00a0Uganda\u00a0and Zimbabwe said they have waited in vain for supplies to arrive. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a huge shortage of contraceptives in African countries,\u201d one said. In\u00a0Venezuela, thousands of women who previously travelled to neighboring Colombia to obtain contraceptive supplies are now blocked by border closings. Manufacturers\u00a0warn\u00a0of a global condom shortage because manufacturers are locked down to halt the spread of the virus. The shortages of contraceptive supplies increase the risk of unplanned pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and the need for abortion.\nAnti-choice\u00a0politicians and organizations are\u00a0capitalizing\u00a0on the pandemic by urging governments to prohibit abortion care during the crisis. In the United States,\u00a011 states\u00a0have tried to\u00a0limit access to abortion.\u00a0Poland\u2019s Parliament is considering regressive legislation to eliminate legal access to abortion in some cases and to criminalize sexuality education.\nAbortion cannot be delayed, and denying access violates human rights.[[nid:339665 field_ne_alignment_limited=right]]\nThe right to non-discriminatory access to women\u2019s health services is part of the right to health under international law and domestic law in most countries. Governments need to find ways to protect this right, even in the pandemic.\nDenying these services will undermine women\u2019s ability to recover from the pandemic. And increased pregnancies or unsafe abortions could increase pressure on already overburdened health systems.\nThe pandemic is reshaping our world, but it is also an\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to reshape reproductive health services. This might include expanded use of\u00a0telemedicine, and making information available online. Expanding access to medical abortion at home, as\u00a0England, Scotland and Wales\u00a0have done, can help. In communities with limited access to technology, governments should ensure that health providers have the equipment and resources they need to safely reach patients.\nGovernments should monitor supply chains closely and seek solutions if contraceptive shortages arise, including redistributing available supplies across localities and even countries. They should ensure access to contraceptive information and services, including emergency contraception and abortion care.\nGovernments should put protecting sexual and reproductive rights up front in their response to Covid-19. These services are essential to women and girls\u2014and their families\u2013 surviving and remaining healthy and are needed more than ever during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n--\nAnand Grover\u00a0is the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and\u00a0Ximena Casas\u00a0is a women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nGlobal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nCoronavirus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nHealth Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion Sexual Violence and Rape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nGovernments Call for Protection of Sexual and Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nFor Maternal Health and Covid-19, a Racial Divide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Felt Like the World Was Falling Down on Me\u201d \n\n\nAdolescent Girls\u2019 Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in the Dominican Republic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThe Breath of the Government on My Back\u201d\n\n\nAttacks on Women\u2019s Rights in Poland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nGovernments Call for Protection of Sexual and Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nFor Maternal Health and Covid-19, a Racial Divide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
