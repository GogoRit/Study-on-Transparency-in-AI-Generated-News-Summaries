Chuck Grassley\r\n(R-Iowa) was recognized for his consistent support for family values throughout\r\nthe first session of the 117th Congress. Grassley received a perfect 100 percent score from Family Research Council\u2019s legislative arm, FRC Action.\u201cThroughout my time representing Iowans,\r\nI\u2019ve prioritized supporting strong families, defending religious freedom and\r\nkeeping our government from separating families from their faith. It\u2019s an honor\r\nto receive this award, and I\u2019ll continue working to help ensure our policies in\r\nWashington promote and empower American families and defend the values we hold\r\ndear,\u201d Grassley said.Grassley\r\nis recognized during Family Research Council\u2019s Blue Award Reception Tuesday\r\nmorningSpecifically, FRC reviewed Grassley\u2019s\r\nstrong record of \u201cprotecting born-alive abortion survivors, unborn children\r\ndiagnosed with Down syndrome, unborn children capable of feeling pain,\r\nreligious freedom\u201d as well as his work to prevent tax dollars from being spent\r\non abortion services. Last year, Grassley joined his pro-life colleagues in committing to block any bill that undermines Hyde Amendment protections, which\r\nensure taxpayer dollars are not allowed to be spent on abortions.View the scorecard by clicking HERE.\n-30-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nLike\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Previous Article\n            \n\n\n\n              Next Article\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            About\n          \n\n\n\n            News\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Services\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Medium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal\n\nnav-mobile-modal close button\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              About\n            \n\n\n                      Service\n                    \n\n                      Biography\n                    \n\n                      Results\n                    \n\n                      Voting Record\n                    \n\n                      Legislation\n                    \n\n\n              News\n            \n\n\n                      News Releases\n                    \n\n                      Remarks\n                    \n\n                      Commentary\n                    \n\n                      Official Correspondence\n                    \n\n                      History Series\n                    \n\n                      Press Kit\n                    \n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n                      Questions & Comments\n                    \n\n                      Help with Federal Agencies\n                    \n\n                      Request a Meeting\n                    \n\n                      Get the Scoop\n                    \n\n                      Whistleblowers\n                    \n\n\n              Services\n            \n\n\n                      Help with Federal Agencies\n                    \n\n                      Questions & Comments\n                    \n\n                      Request a Meeting\n                    \n\n                      Visiting Washington, D.C.\n                    \n\n                      Flag Requests\n                    \n\n                      Grants\n                    \n\n                      Academy Nominations\n                    \n\n                      Internships\n                    \n\n                      Teachers & Students\n                    \n\n                      Women's Advisory Council\n                    \n\n                      Veterans Fellowship Program\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal\n\nsearch-mobile-modal close button\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
