Ron DeSantisThe governor is expected to sign the measureJames CallCapital Bureau | USA TODAY NETWORK \u2013 FLORIDAFlorida lawmakers on Thursday voted to approve a 15-week abortion ban that shortens by more than two months the current window available to legally terminate a pregnancy.The 24-15 party-line vote in the Senate came after more than six hours of discussion and debate over two days.\u00a0The measure cleared the Florida House last month on a 78-39 vote and now goes to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to sign it.\"I think it's a great day,\" Senate President Wilton Simpson said about lawmakers approving Florida's most restrictive abortion regulations (HB 5) since the U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision established abortion as a constitutional right in 1973.More coverage from the USA TODAY Network-Florida:Florida House passes ban on abortions after 15 weeksReproductive rights activists, groups vow to take fight over recently filed abortion bill to streets, electionsFlorida abortions: What you need to know about bill making its way through LegislaturePrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\"For the first time in many years, you\u2019re going to have a bill that I believe will be tolerated (by) the U.S. Supreme Court,\" Simpson told reporters.Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, and Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, sponsored the measure and said it mirrors\u00a0a Mississippi law that is now before the nation's high court.\"I never dreamed I'd be here today ...\u00a0actually being able to save the lives\u00a0of babies that are past 15 weeks of gestation,\" Stargel told her fellow lawmakers. \"God is so good.\"How did lawmakers vote?\u00a0See who voted for and against abortion billDoctor who violates Florida's abortion ban faces 5 years in prisonIf a physician violates\u00a0the ban, they would be\u00a0guilty of a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\u00a0The bill makes exceptions only in cases where the mother is at risk of death or \"irreversible physical impairment,\" or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate defeated amendments that would have made\u00a0exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and mental health.\u00a0\"After 15 weeks, that is a child. And so the argument is, should you kill a baby after 15 weeks because it was (conceived) under certain circumstances?\" Simpson said.Democrats pushed back at Republicans' assertions that a fetus has achieved personhood and that abortion is equivalent to the taking of human life.\u00a0\"As much as a fetus may look like a baby in a sonogram, it is not a life until it is able to survive on its own and that is established under the law,\" said Sen. Gary Farmer, D-Plantation, a lawyer.Farmer, a father of two daughters, said it was simply wrong for a male-dominated legislative body to make a \"decree\" about a woman's body.\u00a0\"We will never know what it feels like,\" he said.And Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book of Miami\u00a0called abortion restrictions a \"control mechanism and an affront to every woman's individual freedom and independence.\"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis expected to sign abortion billWhen it was introduced in January, DeSantis said a ban on abortion after 15 weeks\u00a0is \u201ca good idea.\u201d\u00a0If the bill becomes law, it's widely\u00a0expected to be challenged in court.Until now,\u00a0a privacy provision in the Florida Constitution that\u00a0guarantees\u00a0a right to be let alone by the government\u00a0has blocked abortion restrictions.\u00a0But that provision is grounded in the legal finding of a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before the fetus achieves viability,\u00a0the ability to survive outside the womb, which the court set at 24 weeks.\u00a0Advocates for a woman's right to an abortion fear the U.S. Supreme Court signaled it was willing to alter the legal landscape for abortion when it agreed to hear the so-called\u00a0Dobbs case\u00a0about the Mississippi law.Abortion law scholar Mary Ziegler has told the USA TODAY Network-Florida Capital Bureau that the justices went looking for an opportunity to reopen Roe. There is no split in lower court decisions or conflict in state statutes\u00a0for the justices to resolve in Dobbs, said Ziegler, a\u00a0Florida State University law professor.Three of them were picked by former President Donald Trump, she noted, who \"promised to pick, in his words, \u2018pro-life justices,' \" she added.The Florida law, which would go into effect July 1, would significantly reduce access to late-term abortions.\u00a0Currently, North Carolina is the only other southern state to permit an abortion after 15 weeks.\u00a0The bill galvanized opponents into a coalition that staged numerous rallies in Tallahassee and marched on the state Capitol three times in the past nine weeks.Planned Parenthood of Florida, the ACLU of Florida, Florida Rising, the Florida Access Network\u00a0and student groups from Florida State and Florida A&M universities vowed to make abortion access an issue in the 2022 mid-term election and target lawmakers who supported the bill.\u00a0But Simpson, also a candidate in November for state Agriculture Commissioner, dismissed any concerns about voters\u00a0reacting\u00a0at the ballot box:\u00a0\"When you do the right thing, the blowback is the blowback.\"View in new tabJames Call is a member of the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida Capital Bureau.
