Her dissertation work explores issues of white supremacy and mass incarceration at the intersections of race, gender, and reproductive justice.\n\u201cCrystal Hayes impressively takes the lead on a groundbreaking paper that is part of a unique supplement in the American Journal of Public Health (APHA) that spotlights mass incarceration,\u201d says Michael Fendrich, associate dean for research. \u201cAPHA is a highly impactful journal and is the leading journal in the field of public health.\u00a0 Hayes\u2019 paper focuses on the notion of reproductive justice, a concept that integrates reproductive rights, human rights, and social justice.\u00a0 These are values that are central to our field of social work.\u00a0 I was struck by how Hayes, and her co-authors, linked\u00a0 mass incarceration to\u00a0 reproductive justice \u2013 and showed that these issues have ramifications for incarcerated and non-incarcerated women.\u201d\nThe article explores contemporary systems of control and violence over women\u2019s bodies by focusing on incarcerated pregnant Women of Color (WOC) using reproductive justice, and other theoretical frameworks, like Black Feminist Thought that take into account their positions from multiple marginalized identities and their history with reproductive injustice and racial oppression. In this she draws on her dissertation research about issues of reproductive oppression faced by incarcerated pregnant WOC.\n\u201cThere is a paucity of literature and conversations in social work that uses reproductive justice in social work practice,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cThis is particularly true for social work research focused on interventions with prisoners or prison research, and there is even less work out there in social work that does so by centering the experiences and stories of Black women and other Women of Color\u201d.\nThese issues are critically important for social work to address in the classroom, practice, and research particularly, given that clinical social workers provide the majority of mental health care in our prisons, jails, and detention centers. Also, as a values-based profession, reproductive justice is also at the heart of social work\u2019s commitments to social justice and human rights. By adopting a reproductive justice lens, social workers can be better trained to inform institutions about policies and practices that violate reproductive justice and people\u2019s human rights, especially within the carceral state where people are the most at risk for reproductive justice violations.\n\u201cAs a reproductive justice scholar, my work in this field of scholarship and dissertation joins the growing call among advocates, scholars, and social workers interested in radically rooting issues of the carceral state within a critique of white supremacy, reproductive oppression, and patriarchy\u2013all important issues facing social work practice today,\u201d Hayes says.\nIn the journal article, Hayes and her co-authors write, \u201cCentral to reproductive justice is the ability to make decisions about your own fertility without fear, coercion, or violence. It is a human right that includes the ability to choose if, when, and how to have children and under what circumstances you will be a parent. In this sense, reproductive justice exposes the ways that mass incarceration is tied to the systemic violations of human rights. These violations have contributed to the acceptance and normalization of removing children from incarcerated parents and the denial of reproductive rights and health and, thus, has made it impossible for all incarcerated people and communities of color to enjoy what it means to be fully human.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Articles\n\n\n\n \n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\nSearching for Data in DNA with CRISPR\nRead the article\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\nUConn Law Graduate Taps His Retirement Fund to Boost Scholarship\nRead the article\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\nUConn Senior Offers Recipes for Success\nRead the article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUConn \nToday\n\n \r\n\tUniversity Communications\nuniversitycommunications.uconn.edu\nContact Us | (860) 486-3530\r\n\nSubscribe \n\n\u00a9 2023 University of Connecticut\nDisclaimers, Privacy & Copyright\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
