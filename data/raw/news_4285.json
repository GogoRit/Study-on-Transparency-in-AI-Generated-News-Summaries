Kay Ivey\u2019s signing the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, a bill banning almost all abortions in the state that sailed through both chambers of the Alabama Legislature with overwhelming majorities.Legal challenges, however, have kept the bill\u2019s abortion restrictions from every being enforced.And now, Reyes said the services offered at the Jack Warner Parkway facility would continue under the guidance of the Yellowhammer Fund, which Reyes helped co-found in 2016 in response to a growing surge of anti-abortion rhetoric nationwide.\u201cOne of the things that I said rally early on was that they unintentionally were probably going to improve abortion access in Alabama by passing the ban,\u201d said Reyes, a Texas native who has earned two degrees from the University of Alabama. \u201cBut I could never imagine one of the things that came from that was that we were able to purchase a clinic.\u201dThe state\u2019s near-total ban on abortion makes it a felony, punishable by up to 99 years or life in prison, for anyone who performs an abortion.While the act adds no punishment for the woman receiving the abortion, the Yellowhammer Fund, which provides funding to help low-income women obtain abortions, received millions of dollars in donations from across the nation, Reyes said.So, when Gray approached the organization about purchasing the clinic she launched in 1993, Reyes said the Yellowhammer Fund was financially able to say yes.\u201cIt was the right place and the right time to take advantage of that,\u201d Reyes said, \u201cso we did it and we\u2019re super excited about it.\u201dWhile Gray has stepped down and into retirement, the clinic \u2013 one of three in Alabama \u2013 is currently searching for a new doctor to provide abortion services as the current physician also is seeking to retire.The clinic is still operating as normal, but once a new provider is secured, Reyes said the clinic will look to expand to offer additional services, including those for trans residents and others.\u201cWe are looking forward to expanding services there and helping Alabamians access a full range of reproductive healthcare services \u2013 including trans healthcare \u2013 within the next year,\u201d the Yellowhammer Fund said in a press release announcing the purchase. \u201cOne year ago, abortion was made illegal in the state. Today, abortion is still completely available in clinics without fear of prosecution.\u201cAnd hopefully, one year from now, West Alabama Women\u2019s Center will be the full services reproductive health site we have always dreamed existed in the state.\u201dReach Jason Morton at jason.morton@tuscaloosanews.com.Careers Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices Staff DirectoryContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaperJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.tuscaloosanews.com.
