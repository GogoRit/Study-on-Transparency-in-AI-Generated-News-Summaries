The decision of the Constitutional Court will have an impact on the Polish community for decades.          Polish model Anja Rubik, 37, has voiced support for pro-choice campaigners following a ban on abortions in Poland. Pictured: Anja on cover of Vogue Poland\u00a0Expanding on her point, Anja wrote: 'Picture making is my language, the way I express my protest, my rebellion, our strength, pain, anger and hope. I believe that photography has enormous power, it can attract attention, arouse emotions, start conversations, mobilize us to action and change.\u00a0'Power enslaves women with prohibitions of abortion and restrictions on reproductive rights.\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Savvy DIY fan gives her VERY tired kitchen a stylish modern...

I am naked in the photo. In patriarchal systems a woman's body is sexualized, it\u2019s shamed and it\u2019s shown as something wrong and indecent.'Hence, nudity has become a symbol of the female revolution. Currently in Poland, there are ongoing government plans to deprive women of their reproductive rights and the right to decide about their own lives and bodies.'A third cover shows a head shot of Anja wearing minimal make-up, as red smoke swirls around her head.'I am a patriot. With age, I feel more and more connected to Poland. And when the rights of women, the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, personal freedom, teachers and students are attacked in my country, and when the state announces a new enemy in our community almost every single day, I cannot keep silent.\u00a0'We are told that we should feel shame for who we are, who we love, and what we believe in.\u00a0'This divides the country and makes us feel unsteady and insecure and it\u2019s easier to manipulate a torn society. Let us not be intimidated. The law should not interfere in our personal decisions,' she penned.\u00a0The covers were re-posted along with their captions on Vogue Poland's Instagram racking up over 50,000 likes.\u00a0         Anja (pictured) argued the nation shouldn't be intimidated and the law shouldn't interfere with women's personal decisions\u00a0One person wrote: 'Thank you for your courage! I am with you with all my heart!'\u00a0\u00a0'Your support is invaluable and needed all the time! May more women have the courage to speak up in such a specific way! It's good that you are,' another said.A third added: 'Wow this is so powerful and so eloquent and great, I'm speechless. Bravo Anja'                                                                        A stream of responses praised Anja for speaking out and gushed that the covers are 'simple and strong'Poland\n\n\nRead more:\n\nAnja Rubik on Instagram: \u201c1/3 @vogue.polska .
