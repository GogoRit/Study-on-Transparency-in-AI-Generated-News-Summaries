Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court Friday, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost confirmed that he filed a motion to dissolve the injunction on Ohio\u2019s six-week abortion ban, which was granted. Abortion is now illegal in Ohio after six weeks of pregnancy, before many are aware yet they are pregnant.\n\u201cThis decision returns abortion policy to the place it has always belonged: to the elected policies branches of the governments,\u201d Yost said in a statement released on YouTube early Friday.\n\nIn his tweet announcing the motion, Yost said that the injunction was based on precedents set by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a landmark 1992 case that upheld the right to an abortion established by Roe.\n\u201cRoe was poorly reasoned, a doctrine of shifting sands that invited non-stop litigation, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve had for 50 years,\u201d Yost said.\nThe six-week bill,\u00a0sponsored by state Sen. Kristina Roegner (R-Hudson), does not have an exception for rape or incest. It also only applies only to intrauterine pregnancies. It only has two exceptions.\nThe ban allows for physicians to perform an abortion if the procedure is to prevent a someone\u2019s death or bodily impairment, which is defined as any \u201cmedically diagnosed condition that so complicates the pregnancy of the woman as to directly or indirectly cause the substantial and reversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d This includes pre-eclampsia, \u201cinevitable\u201d abortion and premature rupture of the membranes. It could also be diabetes or multiple sclerosis but it can\u2019t be anything related to mental health.\nTo be able to perform the life-saving measure, a physician has to write that the procedure is necessary for the above reasons and must include the medical condition and the medical rationale for it. Also, the written documentation must be included in the pregnant person\u2019s medical records and the doctor must have a copy of it for at least seven years.\nThe other exception is if there is no heartbeat.\nThe bill also requires a pregnant person to sign a form acknowledging that there is a heartbeat detected.\nAccording to experts, the term \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is misleading and medically inaccurate.\n\u201cAt six weeks of gestation, those valves don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN who specializes in abortion care and works at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \u201cThe flickering that we\u2019re seeing on the ultrasound that early in the development of the pregnancy is actually electrical activity, and the sound that you \u2018hear\u2019 is actually manufactured by the ultrasound machine.\u201d\nNevertheless, the form would include statements that say \u201cthe unborn human individual has a fetal heartbeat,\u201d and would include the statistical probability of bringing that \u201cindividual\u201d to term.\n\u201cWe knew this was coming, but it\u2019s still devastating,\u201d said Sri Thakkilapati, the interim director of the Preterm Clinic in Cleveland, the abortion provider named in Yost\u2019s filing. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where somebody\u2019s abortion could be legal today and illegal tomorrow.\u201d\nThakkilapati says she is fully staffed, getting patients in the door as quickly as they can, and ready to refer patients to clinics in other states where they can obtain abortions.\nThakkilapati also says she will also continue to fight today\u2019s supreme court decision, which she described as a brutal defeat.\nIf someone violates the abortion ban, they are guilty of a felony of the fifth degree.\nA former pregnant person could file civil action for a wrongful death suit of their unborn child, and they could be awarded court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees if they win.\nThe legislation also creates the Joint Legislative Committee on Adoption Promotion and Support, which would be made up of three House members and three Senate members.\nIn addition, it allows the State Medical Board to take disciplinary action for failure to comply with the act\u2019s requirements. It allows the board to assess penalties of up to $20,000 for each abortion ban violation.\nThe person who received the abortion would get criminal immunity and immunity from civil liability.\nThe bill doesn\u2019t prohibit contraception or birth control.\nOn Friday night, Gov. Mike DeWine signed executive order 2022-11D which permits the Ohio Department of Health to immediately adopt the Heartbeat Bill, which DeWine signed in 2019.\nFollow\u00a0WEWS\u00a0statehouse reporter Morgan Trau on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXOhio Attorney General Dave Yost has six-week abortion ban put into effect\nby Morgan Trau, Ohio Capital Journal June 27, 2022\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost has six-week abortion ban put into effect\nby Morgan Trau, Ohio Capital Journal June 27, 2022\n The following article was originally published on News5Cleveland.com and is published in the Ohio Capital Journal under a content-sharing agreement.
