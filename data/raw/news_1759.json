Wade ruling Sunday, Jan. 22, 2023, in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA judge refused Friday to toss out a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin\u2019s 174-year-old abortion ban, keeping the case inching toward the state Supreme Court in a state where debate over abortion rights has taken center stage.\nWisconsin lawmakers enacted statutes outlawing abortion in all cases except to save the mother\u2019s life in 1849, a year after Wisconsin became a state. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion had nullified the ban, but legislators never repealed it. Then, the high court\u2019s decision last June to overturn Roe v. Wade reactivated the statutes.\nThe state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, has vowed to restore abortion access. He filed a lawsuit in Dane County days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, seeking to repeal the ban. Kaul argues the ban is too old to enforce and that a 1985 law that permits abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Three doctors later joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, saying they fear being prosecuted for performing abortions.\n\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaul has named district attorneys in the three counties where abortion clinics operated until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade as defendants. One of them, Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Joel Urmanski, filed a motion seeking to dismiss the case in December.\nUrmanski maintains that it\u2019s a stretch to argue the ban is so old it can no longer be enforced and that the 1985 law and the ban complement each other. Since the newer law outlaws abortions post-viability, it simply gives prosecutors another charging option, he contends.\nKaul\u2019s attorneys have countered that the two laws are in conflict and doctors need to know where they stand.\nDane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper explained in a written ruling denying Urmanski\u2019s dismissal motion that the 1849 ban makes killing fetuses by assaulting or battering the mother illegal and doesn\u2019t apply to consensual abortion. That means the doctor plaintiffs could ultimately win a declaration that they can\u2019t be prosecuted for performing abortions and hence the case should continue, Schlipper wrote.\nThe ruling means the lawsuit will continue in Schlipper\u2019s courtroom.\nShortly after the ruling, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers took to Twitter, calling the decision a win.\n\u201cThis is good news and a critical step in our fight to end our state\u2019s criminal abortion ban and restore the reproductive freedom women had in Wisconsin until #SCOTUS overturned #Roe last June. We must restore access to safe, legal abortion in Wisconsin,\u201d he wrote.\nRegardless of how the judge ultimately rules, the case is likely to rise to the state Supreme Court where liberal justices will have a 4-3 majority after progressive Janet Protasiewicz is sworn in on Aug. 1. She stopped short on the campaign trail of saying how she would rule on a challenge to the 1849 ban but said repeatedly she supports abortion rights.\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nRepublican DA asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide abortion lawsuit without lower court ruling \n\n \n\n\n\nSheboygan County DA to appeal ruling that abortions are legal to Wisconsin Supreme Court \n\n \n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood to resume abortion services in Sheboygan \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA vows to appeal Dane County ruling on Wisconsin abortion law \n\n \n\n\n\nIn victory for abortion rights, Dane County judge rules 19th century law does not ban abortions in Wisconsin \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
