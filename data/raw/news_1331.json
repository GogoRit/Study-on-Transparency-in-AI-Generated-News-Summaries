Will it push voters to the polls?Most Iowans, 61%, say abortion should be legal in most or all casesKatie Akin Michaela RammDes Moines Register\u00a9 Copyright 2022, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.An overwhelming majority of Iowans want abortion to be legal in the case of rape or incest or to save the pregnant person\u2019s life, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found.\u00a0Eighty-five percent of Iowans believe abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest. Even more, 89%, support legal abortion if the pregnant person\u2019s life is in danger.\u00a0Even among those who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, 66% support exceptions for rape or incest and 75% support an exception if the pregnant person\u2019s life is at risk.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t have children dying because someone made them pregnant when they\u2019re not old enough to have a baby, or a mother dying and leaving children at home,\u201d said Carolyn Breen, 72-year-old Republican and poll respondent. \u201cWith things like that, there\u2019s got to be a happy medium somewhere.\u201d\u00a0Breen, who lives in Wall Lake, is a staunch opponent of abortion and plans to vote for Republican candidates in November. But she believes some flexibility is needed in proposed policies, and she said she\u2019s concerned about desperate individuals seeking abortions through unsafe means. \u00a0The new poll of 804 adult Iowans, conducted Oct. 9-12 by Selzer & Co., has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\u00a0Iowa Poll:Iowa Poll: Chuck Grassley narrowly leads Mike Franken in US Senate raceIt comes just weeks ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm election. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, Republican-led states have passed a flurry of restrictive new laws, and Democrats have framed the election as a referendum on abortion rights.\u00a0Most Iowans, 61%, say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 33% say all or most cases should be illegal. Six percent are unsure.\u00a0Although abortion is often seen as a partisan issue among elected officials, the Iowa Poll reveals that about a third of Republicans, 34%, support legal abortion in most or all cases. Sixty percent say it should be illegal in most or all cases.\u00a0Among poll respondents who plan to vote for Gov. Kim Reynolds, an outspoken opponent of abortion, 33% believe it should be legal in all or most cases.\u00a0The vast majority of Democrats, 91%, and most independents, 66%, favor legal abortion. \u00a0At least half of every demographic group supports it as well, with the exception of evangelicals (33% in favor), the poll shows. A huge majority of women favor legal abortion (72%), as do people under age 35 (69%). \u00a0\u00a0\u2018Fetal heartbeat\u2019 abortion law an emotional sticky point for Iowans, interviews show\u00a0\u00a0While large shares of Iowans say they support exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape or incest or when the pregnant person\u2019s life is in danger, they are more divided on how the government should restrict abortion in other circumstances.\u00a0The split highlights the complex and often conflicting views Iowans hold on abortion.\u00a0The debate in Iowa centers on the so-called fetal heartbeat abortion ban, a proposal that Reynolds signed into law in 2018 before the courts blocked it.\u00a0Under that law, abortion would be prohibited when cardiac impulses are detected in an embryo, generally after about six weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0Following the court\u2019s reversal on Roe v. Wade, Reynolds asked an Iowa district court judge to lift the injunction on the ban, allowing the law to take effect.\u00a0The Iowa Poll asked Iowans whether they agree or disagree with the statement: \u201cAbortion should be illegal once a so-called fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks after conception.\u201d\u00a0Nearly half of Iowans, 49%, disagree with that idea. Forty-five percent agree with it, and 7% are not sure.\u00a0That divide appears to have narrowed since the law was first proposed. In September 2018, shortly after the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bill passed the state Legislature, 52% of Iowans said the proposal went too far, while 39% said the law was appropriate for Iowa.\u00a0In the most recent poll, the majority of Democrats (76%) and independents (52%) say they disagree with the concept of the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law. \u00a0Nearly one in four Republicans, 24%, also say they disagree, while 70% agree. \u00a0Poll respondent Victor Logan, a Republican, said he agrees with a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d ban in principle. However, the 60-year-old insurance broker in Council Bluffs said he does not support implementing the law because he doesn\u2019t believe personal opinions \u2014 neither his nor policymakers\u2019 \u2014 should play a role in this issue.\u00a0Instead, Logan, a former social worker, said he believes others \u201cshouldn\u2019t be telling women what to do with their bodies.\u201d \u00a0\"These situations can be really, really bad, and we can\u2019t make blanket statements,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how I may feel, the reality is that things are vastly different for the majority of the population. Why should we legislate that?\u201d\u00a0Medical professionals have said \u201cheartbeat\u201d is a misleading term to describe the stage of development at about six weeks, a time when the embryo's developing heart begins to emit rhythmic electrical impulses.\u00a0It isn\u2019t until later in the pregnancy \u2014 from 17 to 20 weeks \u2014 that a fetus develops an actual heartbeat, they say.\u00a0Medical professionals also have said many women don\u2019t know they are pregnant at six weeks, which could be as little as two weeks after their missed period. Opponents of the ban have criticized the law for this reason, stating it essentially would act as a total ban on abortion.\u00a0Iowa Poll:Gov. Kim Reynolds earns 52% support, leads Deidre DeJear by 17 points among likely votersStill, many Iowans have been swayed by the idea of a \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0The Iowa Poll found that 25% of Iowans who say all or most abortions should be legal also agree that the procedure should be illegal once the so-called fetal heartbeat is detected. \u00a0Poll respondent Jeff Laughlin, an independent in Davenport, believes abortion should be legal in most cases, particularly if it involves cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the pregnant person.\u00a0However, the 66-year-old cab driver also supports an abortion restriction once the so-called fetal heartbeat is detected, because \u201conce the heart kicks in, that\u2019s a living person.\"\u00a0More:See where Iowa candidates stand on key issues in the 2022 midterm elections\u201cYou have to have a reason to have abortion, and not because you don\u2019t want a baby,\u201d Laughlin said. \u201cIf you have six kids and don\u2019t want the seventh, that\u2019s not OK.\u201d\u00a0Rebecca Mothershead, a Democrat and a retired 67-year-old in Sioux City, said she doesn\u2019t support abortion except in cases of rape, incest or if the woman\u2019s life is in danger. \u00a0Once an embryo\u2019s cardiac activity can be heard, she said, she thinks the woman is too far along for an abortion \u2014 though she added that she sees a ban at 8 weeks of pregnancy as more common sense than a 6-week ban. \u00a0\u201cIf they didn\u2019t really want to have a baby, they should put it up for adoption,\u201d Mothershead said. \u00a0Will abortion rights sway Iowans in the 2022 midterms?\u00a0Poll respondent Cassandra Walters, a 26-year-old independent, said she leaned toward Republicans in previous elections. But following the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the surge in restrictive abortion laws across the country, she plans to vote for Democrats in November.\u00a0\u201cNow that the abortion bans are being pushed by these big Republican leaders, and they\u2019re voicing their opinions on the matter \u2014 a matter that shouldn\u2019t have been brought back up \u2014 weighed me more to look into what Democrats I want to be voting for because my autonomy is at stake,\u201d she said.\u00a0Walters, a West Des Moines personal trainer, said she voted for Reynolds, but the six-week abortion ban made her lose respect for the governor \u201cas a woman and \u2026 as a policymaker.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI feel like she is unable to see any side of a story that is not her own,\u201d Walters said.\u00a0More:What to know about Iowa's judicial retention elections in NovemberDemocrats are banking on voters like Walters \u2014 people who support abortion rights and reject Republican candidates who would restrict the procedure. Democratic ads and campaign speeches have centered on the issue, framing Republican opponents who oppose exceptions as extreme. Republicans have been on the defense, walking back past statements and accusing Democrats of supporting abortions up until birth.\u00a0Despite the political fervor over abortion, several Iowa Poll respondents said in interviews that they\u2019re more worried about day-to-day issues, like rising prices, than abortion rights.\u00a0More:Nearly 90 Iowa candidates told us where they stand on abortion. Here's what we learned:Republican Darlene Edwards, a 79-year-old living in Farragut, thinks abortions should be illegal in almost all cases in Iowa. She supports exceptions to protect the life of the pregnant person, and in some cases of rape or incest. She celebrated when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe in abortion,\u201d the poll respondent said. \u201cIt\u2019s against God.\u201d\u00a0But Edwards said abortion won\u2019t be top of mind when she heads to the polls this November. Instead, she\u2019s worried about the economy and whether schools are teaching about gender identity or \u201ccommunist, socialist junk.\u201d\u00a0Poll respondent Trisha Nelsen, a 46-year-old Johnston resident, personally disagrees with abortion \u2014 but she wants it to be legal so individuals can make that decision for themselves.\u00a0More:How to vote in Iowa's 2022 elections for governor, US Senate, state Legislature\u201cMy religious belief is that it\u2019s not right,\u201d said Nelsen, a Democrat. \u201cBut that\u2019s my religious belief, and I don\u2019t put my religious beliefs on others.\u201d\u00a0Nelsen, who has disabilities and is seeking work, said her top issues this election are resources for people with disabilities and the economy. She plans to vote for Democrats.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re paying a lot more for groceries, we\u2019re paying a lot more for gas,\u201d Nelsen said. \u201cHow am I supposed to pay rent, renters\u2019 insurance, all my bills, have a car, fill it up and get to my doctor\u2019s appointments?\u201d\u00a0A significant proportion of Iowans who say abortion should be legal in most or all cases are planning to vote for Republican candidates \u2014 even those leading the effort to make most abortions illegal, according to the poll. Among Iowans who plan to vote for Reynolds, 33% say most or all abortions should be legal.\u00a0Republican Kyla Menke, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother, says all abortions should be legal, and she called the six-week law \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like somebody should be telling somebody else what to do with their body,\u201d she said.\u00a0Menke, an Eagle Grove resident, still plans to support Republicans in the midterms, including Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley.\u00a0\u201cI think with every candidate, there's going to\u00a0be pros and there's going to be cons to them being in office,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that both of them so far have been on top of most of the issues.\u201d\u00a0Michaela Ramm covers health care for the Des Moines Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\u00a0Questions based on the sample of 804 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Questions based on the subsample of 620 likely voters in the 2022 general election have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points or 3.9 percentage points, respectively. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.\u00a0\u00a0Republishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to the Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.\u00a0Iowa Poll methodologyView in new tabStaff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote Your Event Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Licensing & Reprints Promote your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper Archives MilestonesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.desmoinesregister.com.
