The bill threatens the rights, health, and dignity of Floridians, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis should veto it.\nIn recent weeks, as the bill advanced through several legislative committees, young people from across the state traveled to the capital to urge legislators not to diminish their bodily autonomy. Abortion providers told legislators that this bill will prevent them from providing the best standard of care to patients experiencing miscarriages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats repeatedly fought for amendments to the bill to at least allow survivors of rape, incest, or human trafficking to seek abortion care after 15 weeks\u2019 gestation. Republican legislators rejected all of them, voting against any exceptions for survivors of violence.\nThe 15-week ban could have particularly harmful impacts on adolescents and young people who already face barriers and delays accessing abortion care because of Florida\u2019s forced parental consent law. That law requires anyone under 18 to get consent from a parent or legal guardian before having an abortion or endure a potentially traumatizing court process.\nFlorida\u2019s judicial bypass process came under national scrutiny in recent weeks when an appeals court decision revealed that a circuit court judge had denied a young person\u2019s petition for a judicial waiver to obtain an abortion without involving a parent, in part because he thought her high school grade point average was too low.\nBeing denied access to an abortion can have serious and lasting consequences for a pregnant person\u2019s health and well-being. For survivors of violence, denial of abortion care may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment under international human rights law.\nThe Florida bill is part of a broader attack on reproductive rights in state legislatures across the US. According to the Guttmacher Institute, state legislatures enacted 106 abortion restrictions last year, the highest number since the US Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion access, which the court may soon overturn. \u00a0\nFlorida\u2019s governor should defend rights and veto the harmful 15-week ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nChildren's Rights Health Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nFlorida Advances 'Don\u2019t Say Gay' Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 13, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Slow Progress on Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\n          Feature\n        \n\n\nHow Do US States Measure Up on Child Rights?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 28, 2023\n\n          Feature\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Give Back\u201d: The Reintegration of People Sentenced to Life Without Parole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nFlorida Advances 'Don\u2019t Say Gay' Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 13, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Slow Progress on Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
