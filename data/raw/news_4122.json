Two days later, President Jair Bolsonaro distorted the note\u2019s content in a tweet, saying that the ministry was trying to identify its authors and did not support \u201cany proposal to legalize abortion.\u201d The ministry then removed two of the three public servants who signed the note from leadership positions.\n\u201cThe Brazilian health system is under strain because of Covid-19, but women and girls who need abortions can\u2019t wait until the end of the pandemic,\u201d said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, Americas acting deputy director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cInstead of ensuring that women and girls have access to essential health care and support during this crisis, President Bolsonaro ignored expert guidelines, lied about a Health Ministry document that recommended improving services, and punished the officials who signed it.\u201d\nAs of June 11, Brazil had 800,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and about 41,000 deaths.Several news reports in Brazil have suggested that some local authorities have suspended sexual and reproductive services considered \u201cnot urgent,\u201d including providing contraception, during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, only 42 hospitals, in a country of about 210 million people, are currently performing legal abortions, according to a study conducted by the nonprofit Article 19 and news sites AzMina and G\u00e9nero e N\u00famero. In 2019, it was 76 hospitals.\nOn June 1, three offices within the Health Ministry, including the Office of Coordination of Women\u2019s Health, jointly published Technical Note 16/2020, with support from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which serves as Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization (WHO). The note was posted on a Health Ministry website.\nThe five-page note underscored the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on access to health services for vulnerable populations, particularly poor women and girls. It warned that women and girls may not have access to contraceptives and also may suffer increased gender-based violence during the pandemic, leading to unwanted pregnancies.\nIt said that the authorities should make \u201call possible efforts\u201d to maintain sexual and reproductive health services to prevent causing \u201cimportant and irreparable harm to women\u2019s comprehensive health.\u201d Among those \u201cessential\u201d services it listed services for victims of sexual violence; access to contraception, particularly emergency contraception; prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases; and access to \u201csafe abortion in the cases contemplated by Brazilian law.\u201d\nAbortion is legal in Brazil in cases of rape, when necessary to save a woman\u2019s life, or when the fetus has anencephaly, a fatal congenital brain disorder. Human Rights Watch has urged Brazilian authorities to decriminalize abortion and ensure access to safe abortion and post-abortion care, in line with its obligations under international human rights law.\nOn June 4, the Health Ministry acknowledged in a statement that its Office of Coordination of Women\u2019s Health had written the note. But it claimed that \u201cthe note was not discussed within the Ministry of Health\u201d and said that the ministry had initiated disciplinary proceedings to identify those responsible for writing and publishing it.\nThe next day, the acting health minister removed two of the people who signed the note from their positions as coordinators for women\u2019s health and for life cycles, respectively. Both are public servants, who can only be fired if they commit a crime or a serious infraction. They continue to work for the ministry in lower-level positions.In a joint letter released on June 6, 98 civil society organizations, including Human Rights Watch, rejected the government\u2019s distortion of the note\u2019s content and expressed their solidarity with the two public servants who suffered reprisals and all other employees of the Health Ministry who are trying to ensure high quality public health.The WHO has warned that reductions in the availability of essential sexual and reproductive health care, including maternal and newborn health services, around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic will result in many thousands of maternal and newborn deaths due to millions of additional unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and complicated deliveries without access to essential and emergency care. The WHO has recommended that governments prioritize ensuring access to contraception, abortion to the full extent allowed by law, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections.\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, many pregnant women and girls in Brazil had to choose between continuing dangerous or unwanted pregnancies or seeking unsafe methods to end them.\nA case challenging the criminalization of abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is pending before the Supreme Court. In a different case, in April, the court rejected on a technicality a petition to allow pregnant women infected with the Zika virus, which can cause microcephaly and other harm when a fetus is exposed in utero, to choose whether to continue their pregnancy.\nIn both cases, Human Rights Watch submitted amicus briefs arguing that Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are incompatible with its human rights obligations under international law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 3, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nBrazil Suffers its Own Scourge of Police Brutality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nPeople in Institutions in Brazil at Risk from Covid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n          Feature\n        \n\n\n\u201cA Sense of Terror Stronger than a Bullet\u201d\n\n\nThe Closing of North Korea 2018\u20132023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Contribute to Society\u201d\n\n\nThe Need for Legal Gender Recognition in Tabasco, Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 3, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nBrazil Suffers its Own Scourge of Police Brutality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nPeople in Institutions in Brazil at Risk from Covid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
