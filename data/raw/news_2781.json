Photos by Claire Runkel and Julian Cirnigliaro.\nSOPHIE CIOKAJLO | STAFF REPORTER | sciokajl@butler.edu\nOn Wednesday Sept. 23 anti-abortion demonstrators from the organization Created Equal, based in Columbus, OH visited Butler\u2019s campus. Representatives from the organization stood on the sidewalk of Hampton Drive between Atherton Union and ResCo, displaying images and speaking to students passing by. Several Butler students participated in a counter-protest, some were there with organized groups while others happened to be there.\u00a0\nCreated Equal has visited Butler\u2019s campus several times before, but this was the first time in recent years that there was a counter-protest. Created Equal is allowed to protest on this spot on campus as it is public property, while the rest of campus is private property.\u00a0\nButler warned students about the protests with an email on Monday Sept. 21, explaining that the demonstrations are allowed on campus due to the Constitutional right to freedom of speech. The dean of students office set up signs on either side of the demonstrators telling students to either have a civil discussion or avoid the demonstrations altogether.\nThe Collegian interviewed individuals from both demonstrations, asking each individual the questions below:\u00a0\nWhy are you here today?\n\u201cI\u2019m here today because I do think everyone has the right to free speech, but I do find it a little insensitive that they are displaying graphic images that might have a really negative effect on our students\u2019 mental health,\u201d sophomore psychology major Angie Zara said. \u201cThey don\u2019t go here. This is our campus; our home. I also fundamentally disagree with them, but I know that\u2019s their right.\u201d\n\u201cWe are here today to expose the reality of abortion,\u201d Lexi Hall, a 19-year old Created Equal employee, said. \u201cMost people believe that abortion just gets rid of a clump of cells or a blob of tissue, but by showing the truth of abortion, you can clearly see these are not just a clump of cells, this is not just a blob of tissue, it\u2019s a human being that is being brutally murdered through abortion. We\u2019re also here to talk to people and have educated conversations; civil conversations, in hopes to change their minds on abortion and really start the conversation on this college campus and all around the nation.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat is your personal stance on abortion?\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-choice as in everyone\u2019s right to choose, not pro-abortion,\u201d Zara said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing, but people have their own reasons and I don\u2019t think anyone should be told what to do with their body. I also believe in separation of church and state, and I think a lot of [pro-life] reasons are based in religious beliefs and I don\u2019t think that should be inflicted on anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human being and therefore abortion is always wrong,\u201d Hall said. \u201cRight from fertilization, that\u2019s when human life begins: a single-cell zygote. It meets the standard of life so we are opposed to any killing of that human being from then on.\u201d\nWhy is it important to discuss this issue specifically on Butler\u2019s campus?\n\u201cSince we\u2019re all coming in from\u2026 different places, different backgrounds, I believe it\u2019s important to have this conversation,\u201d sophomore psychology major Quinn Davis said. \u201cPersonally, I went to a Catholic high school and they forced their pro-life opinions on me and other students, so I think it\u2019s important to have this conversation on Butler\u2019s campus so that everyone can form their own opinions for themselves and understand each side of the movement.\u201d\n\u201cWe actually travel all across the country with our organization,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually target certain universities, it\u2019s basically just because this is in Indiana, and we\u2019re going to other ones as well. We have gone to two other [universities] this week. We also go to other events; like if there\u2019s a rally or something like that we\u2019ll go there. We also go to high schools as well and stand outside the high schools and talk to the high school students.\u201d\nAside from being here today, what are you doing to support your stance on abortion?\n\u201cJust having a lot of those hard conversations with people, including what we\u2019ve been doing here today, and having conversations with people who disagree and being able to share your opinions,\u201d Zoe Strepek, a sophomore psychology and criminology major said. \u201cI feel like I do a lot of that in my life, so that\u2019s probably the biggest thing.\u201d\n\u201cWe also go out to the abortion facilities and talk to women as they go inside, kindly introduce ourselves to them and offer them help from the crisis pregnancy centers that are usually right next door or down the street from the abortion facilities,\u201d Hall said. \u201cTell them that we\u2019ll be there for them, help them physically, financially, whatever it may be, help them through adoption if they so choose. So we do that as well, and we non-stop talk about abortion in other places and just support women who are in need.\u201d\nWhy is abortion an important issue in this upcoming election?\n\u201cTrump supports anti-abortion, and we have to settle for Joe 2020 because he will advocate for more rights for women as well as minorities,\u201d Isabel Austin, a first-year computer science major said. \u201cThis is important because if we outlaw abortion, it\u2019s only going to outlaw safe abortions.\n\u201cThis election is super important because we have two candidates: Joe Biden and Donald Trump,\u201d Hall said. \u201cJoe Biden is in support of abortion up until birth and even after birth, so that is a very radical view. [EDITOR\u2019s NOTE: Joe Biden has not expressed support for late-term abortions or infanticide.] Even most people that I\u2019ve talked to today on your campus aren\u2019t in support of that\u2026 Where we have, on the other hand, Donald Trump who is in support of life and trying to protect the pre-born and protect all human rights. We don\u2019t advocate for one candidate over the other, but we do encourage people to vote anti-abortion, vote for people who will seek to end abortion, seek to protect all human life.\u201d\nIf you were triggered by any of the images displayed on campus during the demonstration or by content in this article see the resources below.\u00a0\nAppointment with Butler counseling services\nClarity Cares \u2013 after abortion counseling\nAllentown Women\u2019s Center Pregnancy Options Counseling\n\u00a0\n  \n\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\n\nSharing\n\nTwitter0\nFacebook0\nGoogle +0\nLinkedinactive){li-icon[type=linkedin-bug][color=inverse] .background{fill\nEmail this article\nPrint this article\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\n Contributor\n\n\n\nTags\n\nAbortion, butler student activism, butler university, claire runkel, Julian Cirnigliaro, News, Sophie Ciokajlo, student protests \n\n\n\n\nRelated posts\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nButler Brew to be replaced by student-run cafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBehind barn doors: Factory farming\u2019s lethal secrets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVisualizing a vibrant future for Irwin Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\nFollow us on TwitterMy TweetsThe Butler Collegian E-Newsletter We get it\u2014you're busy.
