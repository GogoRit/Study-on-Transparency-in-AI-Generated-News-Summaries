Over the course of the evening, volunteers took calls from more than 20 panicked women who suddenly found their next-day appointments for abortions cancelled.One of the calls was from hospital staff at a loss over what to do about a woman who broke down after being told that her termination would not go ahead. \u201cShe went into a frenzy, got into the hospital lift and was going up and down, up and down, without stopping for an hour,\u201d says Krystyna Kacpura, director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning (Federa).Staff at Federa were used to helping women navigate a hostile healthcare system in which legal terminations were already virtually impossible. But the new legislation put in place an almost total abortion ban in everything but name, allowing women to terminate only if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest, or if it represented a threat to life or health. At the time the legislation was brought in, about 1,000 legal abortions were carried out in Poland every year, 98% because of foetal abnormalities. This option was now closed to women. It was, says Kamila Ferenc, a lawyer for Federa, a devastating blow.Since its announcement, at least 34,000 women in Poland have managed to get abortions despite the ban, and hundreds travelled abroad for later abortions, facilitated by groups such as Abortion Support Network and Women on Web.View image in fullscreenA sticker on a roadside post in central Warsaw gives the number of Abortion Without Borders, January 2022. Photograph: Anna Liminowicz/The GuardianBut now the women calling Federa for help are often in serious distress, many further into their pregnancy because they have discovered a problem at a second-trimester scan. Pregnancies are more likely to have been planned. \u201cIn the past, it was rare for us to receive calls from individuals in this state. This last year, it has been 80% of our work,\u201d says Ferenc in Federa\u2019s Warsaw office. \u201cEvery call is very emotional.\u201dIn the past year staff and volunteers at Federa, like many other women working as advisers, lawyers and activists in the pro-choice movement, have faced death threats, intimidation and legal challenges. Many have said they are exhausted by their increasing workload as they struggle to help women trying to access safe abortions. Ferenc says she is not afraid of the people who send bomb threats to her office or superimpose bullet holes on pictures of her face. \u201cI\u2019m more scared that one day prosecutors will launch an investigation against us,\u201d she says. In the past, few Poles faced trial on abortion-related charges. The state largely turned a blind eye to illegal abortion services, with pages towards the back of newspapers filled with euphemistic adverts for private clinics offering \u201crestoration of the menstrual cycle\u201d. That changed when the new law came in.View image in fullscreen\u2018Every call is very emotional\u2019: Kamila Ferenc, a lawyer at Federa in Warsaw, helps women unable to get abortions. Photograph: Anna Liminowicz/The GuardianA member of pro-choice group Abortion Dream Team became the first Polish abortion activist to face the prospect of trial in September, after a man notified the police that his wife ordered abortion pills online. The case is ongoing.Ferenc believes the latest changes did not fully appease the ruling Law and Justice party\u2019s (PiS) religious base. \u201cBefore, abortion was not a topic, no one wanted to talk about it. Now the anti-abortion groups on whose support PiS is relying are demanding blood.\u201dMarta Lempart \u2013 who is fighting 86 court cases under various charges \u2013 heads the pro-choice Polish Women\u2019s Strike movement and says the new laws have targeted the women most at need of healthcare and support.View image in fullscreenMarta Lempart, co-founder of the Polish Women\u2019s Strike movement. Photograph: Anna Liminowicz/The Guardian\u201cPolish women with unwanted pregnancies are now in a better situation than those with wanted pregnancies but who are facing complications, because there is a working system completely outside of public healthcare for the former. But the healthcare system does not provide a service to the latter at all.\u201dA further attempt to ban abortion completely and jail women who had terminations for life was rejected by the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament, but the government has since announced it would begin compiling a database of all pregnancies across the country, a move defended as a digitisation of existing documentation but which women\u2019s rights groups believe is another natalist policy designed to control women\u2019s lives and a sign that worse is to come.I called one woman straight after she left the hospital. She was in an awful state, it\u2019s hard to say what she would have done if we hadn\u2019t reached herKrystyna KacpuraMeanwhile, an underfunded and overstretched Polish healthcare system, accused of failing to provide women with reproductive care, is emboldened by the new laws. \u201cWomen are falsely told by doctors that contraceptive pills give them cancer, or that an IUD is dangerous for those who haven\u2019t had children yet,\u201d says Ferenc. She has begun advising women to record their conversations with doctors. One woman said that doctors treating her breast cancer repeatedly told her the illness was caused by an abortion she had months earlier.But Kacpura and others believe the legislation may also have had a chilling effect on doctors who are terrified of navigating the new law. She says, before the 2021 ruling, doctors would rarely contact her, but in the past year she has been answering their calls day and night. \u201cNo one [in authority] explained to the doctors what they should do,\u201d she says. Sometimes, doctors call to pass on the numbers of patients they were not able to legally help. \u201cI called one woman straight after she left the hospital. She was in an awful state, it\u2019s hard to say what she would have done if we hadn\u2019t reached her.\u201dAgata Bzdy\u0144, a lawyer who represents a number of women who have taken their abortion refusals to the European court of human rights, points to reports that Biela\u0144ski hospital in Warsaw, which she says \u201chas a reputation for still providing abortions\u201d, has been under pressure from the government to hand over documents on the number of terminations approved. Biela\u0144ski did not respond to a request for comment.Beyond the government, Roman Catholic lay groups continue to exert pressure for an outright abortion ban. The group Ordo Iuris (Order of Law) was one of the mobilising forces behind a citizen\u2019s bill in favour of a total abortion ban, a move that was rejected by parliament but precipitated the ruling. Since 2016, the organisation has acted as official adviser to the PiS government in areas of reproductive rights and education. The organisation recently announced that it will provide legal representation to a man who is suing his wife for having an abortion, which Ordo Iuris argues violated the man\u2019s right to family life.View image in fullscreenAn anti-LGBTQ gathering of members of ultra-conservative religious group Tradition, Family & Property in front of Warsaw\u2019s church of Holy Cross, May 2021. Photograph: Piotr \u0141apin\u0301ski/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe most shocking case of the past 12 months is that of a woman called Izabela, who died in November of septic shock while in her 22nd week of pregnancy. Doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, in south-west Poland, did not perform an abortion, even though her foetus would not survive, according to a lawyer for the family. \u201cFor now, because of the abortion law, they can\u2019t do anything,\u201d Izabela texted to her mother shortly before she died. An investigation found \u201cmedical malpractice\u201d led to Izabela\u2019s death and the hospital was fined . She is survived by a husband and daughter.Kacpura said she knows of several cases in the past year where the woman\u2019s waters broke prematurely, as Izabela\u2019s did, but doctors refused to perform a caesarean or induce birth. \u201cA nightmare, because the foetus cannot survive but the heartbeat can continue for days, sometimes weeks, and the woman has to wonder whether she has already become a coffin.\u201dBart\u0142omiej Wr\u00f3blewski, a leading PiS parliamentary force behind the change in the law, said: \u201cIt is not true that this law puts women\u2019s lives in danger, because nobody challenged existing provision of Polish law to rescue endangered life and health of the mother, even when it leads to the death of their unborn child.\u201d Echoing other governmental and anti-abortion voices, he stressed that in his eyes there was no connection between Izabela\u2019s death and the new abortion restrictions, instead putting the blame on doctors.View image in fullscreenPeople protest in Warsaw after the death of Izabela, a woman who died in the 22nd week of pregnancy after doctors refused to perform an abortion, 6 November 2021. Photograph: Dawid \u017buchowicz/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/ReutersBut Izabela\u2019s death horrified the country and sparked fresh protests. It may have proved a turning point. Several polls have found the majority of people in the country oppose the 21 January ruling.Even those who are not pro-choice resent what they see as the Roman Catholic church overstepping the mark by creating political pressure for a ban, says Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at Sussex University. \u201cAbout 40% of people in Poland still attend weekly mass, but that is not to suggest they are happy for the church to have more control of their lives,\u201d says Szczerbiak. He believes the change in law may have shifted perceptions of the issue in Polish politics.\u2018I used to judge people\u2019: the Polish woman who became her city\u2019s lone voice for abortion rightsRead moreFerenc echoes this. \u201cWe thought there was no political chance to change [the law around abortion]. The paradox is that it has changed for the worse, but that means we have a chance to liberalise the law too,\u201d she says.A pro-choice citizen\u2019s bill calling for abortion to be made fully available is gaining momentum. \u201cWe had an older gentleman come in whose wife told him to print the form from the internet and he got his friends to sign it, and then he came to deliver his 10 signatures,\u201d says Lempart from her office on Wiejska Street, a few doors down from the Polish parliament. \u201cBefore, initiatives to collect signatures were mostly organised by groups and political parties. Now, I\u2019d say 60% is just individuals collecting signatures.\u201dOrganisers say the citizen\u2019s bill has reached the 100,000 signatures needed for official recognition and more signatures are coming in every day.Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:Sign up for Her Stage \u2013 please check your spam folder for the confirmation emailExplore more on these topicsPolandRights and freedomAbortionWomen's rights and gender equalityHealthEuropeWomenfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
