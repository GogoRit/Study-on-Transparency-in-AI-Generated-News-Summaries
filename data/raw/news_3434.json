Murphy also called out\r\nRepublicans\u2019 hypocrisy and their efforts to distort the debate on abortion with\r\nfalsehoods.Murphy highlighted Republican\r\nhypocrisy: \u201cFrankly, it's always been really hard for me to square how\r\nRepublicans who so readily evangelize about small government, about the\r\nimportance of putting families and their decision making processes first, about\r\nthe evil of public sector overreach, are so enthusiastic about the government\r\nmicromanaging personal decisions about pregnancy or marriage or adoption. Small\r\ngovernment is great, I guess for corporations, but it's not so great when it\r\ncomes to the most intimate decisions the families make.\u201d\u201cAnd as I've said on this\r\nfloor before, it's also hard to take seriously, Republicans\u2019 passionate pleas\r\nfor this body to defend the existence of an unborn fetus when they seem to care\r\nso little about many of the existential threats that are posed to every\r\nAmerican after they are born. Today, this day, over 100 Americans are going to\r\ndie from gunshot wounds, from murders and suicides\u2026 It seems that after birth,\r\nlife matters a little bit less to some people in this body,\u201d Murphy added.Murphy also called out\r\nRepublican lies about the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act: \u201cToday,\r\nI heard Republican senators making a whole bunch of claims that are just so\r\nungrounded in truth as to diminish the quality of what should be a very\r\nimportant debate on a very weighty subject\u2026I heard one senator say that the\r\nWomen's Health Protection Act, for which I will proudly vote tomorrow, allows\r\nfor garage abortions. That's not true. That's just plainly not true. Every\r\nstate requires that abortions be performed in licensed health care facilities\r\nand nothing in the bill changes it. Don't say that just because it makes a\r\nbetter story.\u201dA full transcript of his\r\nremarks can be found below:\u201cMadam president, I will probably\r\nget in trouble with somebody for saying this, but\u00a0the question of when\r\nlife\u00a0begins, the deeper question of\u00a0what defines life,\r\nwhich\u00a0biological entities are alive or\u00a0possess independent\r\nexistence\u00a0versus which biological entities\u00a0are simply part of\r\nsomething\u00a0else that is alive. Man, those\u00a0are really hard questions.\u201cI\u00a0heard my colleague\r\nSenator Daines on the floor earlier tonight, talking passionately about his\r\nbelief that life begins at conception. And that humans have an obligation to\r\ndefend a day old fetus equally to our obligation to defend the life of someone\r\nwho has been born.\u201cNow, I disagree. I believe\r\nthat life begins at birth. I believe that our legal obligation towards a born\r\nhuman is different than our legal obligation toward an unborn fetus.\u201cBut on that narrow question\r\nof when life begins, I don't cast any particular judgment on Senator Daines for\r\nbelieving what he believes. His belief system is shared by millions of\r\nAmericans, not the majority of Americans, but a significant share.\u201cThis disagreement that he\r\nand I have over when legally protected life begins though is as significant and\r\nas important a disagreement as exists, right? Because it's about the most\r\nfoundational questions in human existence.\u201cWhat is life? Who decides\r\nwhether a woman bears a child? Who has control over that woman's body? Who has\r\ncontrol over the most sacred and critical function of a human being, the act of\r\ngiving birth? It just doesn't get any more important than that set of questions.\u201cAnd given this fundamental\r\ndisagreement, given the weightiness of these questions, given the large number\r\nof Americans who sit on either side of these questions, I come to one simple\r\nconclusion: no government, no group of politicians should make this decision\r\nfor anyone else.\u201cThis decision about whether\r\nto abort a pregnancy, so morally complicated, so socially divisive, should and\r\nmust be left to individuals. In this case, to women to decide.\u201cOver the course of history,\r\nmillions have died in fights over another weighty, moral issue: the question of\r\nwhether God exists and if a god exists, exactly what form that being takes and\r\nwhat it requires of humans.\u201cDisputes over religion has\r\neradicated entire civilizations. What does this have to do with Roe vs. Wade?\r\nWell, our founding fathers decided that there were some topics that were so\r\npersonal, so subject to disagreement and controversy that government should\r\njust be barred from registering judgment.\u201cThat's part of the reason\r\nwhy our civilization has not been plagued by wars between religious groups, a\r\nreality that continues to paralyze societies to this day in other parts of the\r\nworld because we keep government out of the question of which god is the right\r\ngod. That's up to every American to decide for themselves, even though many\r\nAmericans believe that the consequence of observing or following the wrong god\r\nis serious, eternal damnation for some. \u00a0The stakes are huge when it comes\r\nto religion, but government sits on the sidelines.\u201cTo me, that's an imperfect\r\nbut instructive corollary to the debate over choice and abortion. The decision\r\nabout whether to have an abortion is so personal. And the lack of consensus in\r\nthe country on the question is so unavoidable as to make government intervention\r\njust as illegitimate as it would be if government tried to dictate to someone\r\nwhich religion they should follow.\u201cNow, that's not the exact\r\nroute that the Supreme Court traveled to get to the Roe decision. But it helps\r\nme understand why from 1973 until today, the decision about whether or not to\r\nhave an abortion has been a constitutional right of the individual, not the\r\nconstitutional right of the government to decide.\u201cFrankly, it's always been\r\nreally hard for me to square how Republicans who so readily evangelize about\r\nsmall government, about the importance of putting families and their decision\r\nmaking processes first, about the evil of public sector overreach, are so\r\nenthusiastic about the government micromanaging personal decisions about\r\npregnancy or marriage or adoption. Small government is great, I guess for\r\ncorporations, but it's not so great when it comes to the most intimate\r\ndecisions the families make.\u201cAnd as I've said on this\r\nfloor before, it's also hard to take seriously, Republicans\u2019 passionate pleas\r\nfor this body to defend the existence of an unborn fetus when they seem to care\r\nso little about many of the existential threats that are posed to every\r\nAmerican after they are born.\u201cToday, this day, over 100\r\nAmericans are going to die from gunshot wounds, from murders and suicides. And\r\nwhether my Republican colleagues agree with me or not that stricter gun laws is\r\npart of the solution to this uniquely American epidemic that plagues those that\r\nare born, I don't know that I've ever heard a Republican speech dedicated to\r\nthis crisis on the floor of the Senate. I\u2019ve heard dozens \u00a0dedicated to\r\nthe cause of those before. It seems that after birth, life matters a little bit\r\nless to some people in this body.\u201cSo that's what I think, and\r\nas I said, I'll probably get into some hot water for admitting that I\r\nunderstand the arguments that people like Senator Daines make. I don't agree\r\nwith his views, but I understand them. And my hope is, is that as we begin this\r\ndebate over the future of reproductive choice and health in this country, as\r\nthis debate heats up, because it's not going away, we're taking the vote\r\ntomorrow. But this is a debate that is going to consume this nation. If the\r\nAlito opinion becomes law, which I believe it will.\u201cMy hope is that we're honest\r\nabout the complexity of this debate. But the Republicans are equally honest in\r\nthe claims that they make. And let me just briefly tell you what I mean.\u201cToday, I heard Republican\r\nsenators making a whole bunch of claims that are just so ungrounded in truth as\r\nto diminish the quality of what should be a very important debate on a very\r\nweighty subject. For instance, I heard senators make the claim that the\r\nprotesters who were protesting outside or near Supreme Court justices homes\r\nthreatened violence against those justices. That was an explicit claim made by\r\npeople who came down to this floor who might have heard it on some unreputable\r\nwebsite, but it's not true.\u201cYou can object to\r\nprotesters, being outside of public officials\u2019 homes - it's happened to all of\r\nus, by the way - but don't make up threats of violence just because it makes\r\nfor a better story.\u201cI heard one senator say that\r\nthe Women's Health Protection Act, for which I will proudly vote tomorrow,\r\nallows for garage abortions. That's not true. That's just plainly not true.\r\nEvery state requires that abortions be performed in licensed health care facilities\r\nand nothing in the bill changes it. Don't say that just because it makes a\r\nbetter story.\u201cMany Republicans claim that\r\nthe bill we're taking up tomorrow allow abortions up to the date of birth.\r\nThat's not true either. The Women's Health Protection Act, it does codify Roe\r\nversus Wade, but Roe only protects a woman's right to have an abortion without\r\nrestriction until viability and then afterward protects for the woman's health\r\nfor risk of death. The bill simply does not expand the circumstances under\r\nwhich an abortion can be performed beyond what currently exists in case law.\u201cSo I'm going to be honest\r\nwith my colleagues about the admitted complexities, the political, moral\r\ncomplexities of this debate. But I expect opponents of the bill that we're\r\ndebating tomorrow to be equally honest in the arguments they make as well.\u201cSo I\u2019ll have a lot more to\r\nsay about this topic as we begin what I think is a debate that will consume\r\nthis nation, rightfully, over the course of the coming weeks and months, but\r\ntoday, I will leave it there.\u201d\n###\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Previous Article\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n                  Next Article\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Stay Connected\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Murphy Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Murphy Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Murphy Flickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Murphy Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            About\n          \n\n\n\n            Newsroom\n          \n\n\n\n                      Press Releases\n                    \n\n\n\n                      In the News\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n            Key Issues\n          \n\n\n\n                      Sponsored Legislation\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n            Services\n          \n\n\n\n                      Academy Nominations\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Addiction Resources\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Appropriations Requests\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Crumbling Foundations\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Flag Requests\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Grants\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Help with a Federal Agency\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Internships\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Scheduling Requests\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Special Recognitions\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Visiting DC\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n            Map\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal modal close button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n\n              About\n            \n\n\n\n              Newsroom\n            \n\n\n                      Press Releases\n                    \n\n                      In the News\n                    \n\n\n              Key Issues\n            \n\n\n                      Key Issues\n                    \n\n                      Sponsored Legislation\n                    \n\n\n              Services\n            \n\n\n                      Appropriations\n                    \n\n                      For Connecticut Residents\n                    \n\n                      For Students\n                    \n\n                      Help with a Federal Agency\n                    \n\n                      Scheduling Requests\n                    \n\n\n              Map\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal modal close button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
