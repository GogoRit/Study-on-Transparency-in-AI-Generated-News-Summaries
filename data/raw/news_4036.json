In-vitro fertilization is also banned. Credit: Coburn Dukehart / Wisconsin Watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinnPost\u2019s Daily Newsletter\nThe latest on the politics and policy shaping Minnesota.\nDelivered straight to your inbox.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was a collaboration between Wisconsin Watch, the Cap Times and Fuller Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news outlet that focuses on women\u2019s issues.When Ascension\u2019s St. Joseph Hospital in Milwaukee announced it would cut back services in 2018, residents of the surrounding Sherman Park area protested.The predominantly black, low-income neighborhood already faced its share of challenges. Nearly a third of residents in the ZIP code live in poverty, and black infants born there are more than twice as likely to die as white infants. \n \n\nResidents feared that reducing services would exacerbate these disparities, and even pave the way for the hospital to close. St. Joseph\u2019s parent company, Ascension Wisconsin, eventually put the cuts on hold.\u201cIt\u2019s an anchor institution there,\u201d says Reggie Newson, chief advocacy officer at Ascension Wisconsin.But St. Joseph remains the target of a different kind of protest. The hospital is Catholic, which means it follows Ethical and Religious Directives, a set of rules written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The rules prohibit Catholic hospitals, except in extreme situations, from providing procedures the church deems immoral \u2014 including abortions, contraception and sterilization. In-vitro fertilization is banned.Asma Kadri Keeler, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, recently met with members of the St. Joe\u2019s Accountability Coalition, a community group formed after Ascension announced cutbacks. Although most people surveyed by the community group had positive views of St. Joseph, some residents told Keeler they were hesitant to send their pregnant loved ones there. \n \n\nKeeler says the ACLU works to safeguard religious liberty, but it also has sued when patients were denied care based on religious restrictions.\u201cWe take the position that it (religious liberty) can\u2019t be used to harm other people,\u201d she says.Reproductive rights advocates say the restrictions impose religious doctrine on patients and violate medical standards of care in ways that disproportionately affect communities like Sherman Park.Catholic health systems argue that they serve as safety nets in impoverished communities and provide the same quality of care as secular hospitals. According to the Catholic Health Association (CHA), which represents more than 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States, patients who received care at Catholic hospitals are more likely to recommend those hospitals than patients who receive care elsewhere. \n \n\nThat St. Joseph is both desperately needed and criticized reflects an increasingly common tension facing Wisconsin communities. An analysis by the Cap Times and the Fuller Project, a nonprofit news organization focusing on women\u2019s issues, shows that the number of Catholic hospitals grew by 13 percent in the state, while the number of non-Catholic hospitals fell by the same percentage, between 2001 and 2018.In most ways, these Catholic hospitals, which treat one in every seven patients in the United States, differ from secular ones in name only. Yet, critics say, in reproductive care, Catholic ethics can trump medical best practice, bishops can wield more influence than physicians, and patients can be denied care they desire or need.Catholic hospitals commonIn Wisconsin, where Catholic Germans and Irish dominated immigration in the mid- to late- 1800s, one-third of hospitals are governed by Catholic religious principles \u2014\u00a0more than twice the national average.It is the only state where black women are more likely to deliver their babies in a Catholic institution than a non-Catholic one, Columbia Law School researchers found. And in 12 of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties, the only hospitals within the borders are Catholic. \n \n\nHospitals are not always transparent about the services they will not provide, and patients often lack a choice of where they seek care, the Cap Times and the Fuller Project found.Catholic hospitals are governed by 77 directives, which fuse theology with medicine and technology. Several directives cover reproductive care. For example, Catholic-affiliated hospitals will not provide sterilization if the sole purpose is to prevent a woman from becoming pregnant.And abortion is not permitted, unless it is an \u201cunavoidable\u201d consequence of an action taken to save the mother\u2019s life, according to Brian Reardon, vice president of communications for CHA.Some physicians provide referrals for abortions and other restricted services or prescribe contraception for menstrual pain rather than birth control. Others adhere strictly to the directives. \n \n\nSSM Health St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Madison refers patients seeking a common form of sterilization to undergo the procedure at a nearby eye clinic that does surgeries, according to one doctor and a nurse familiar with the arrangement.Out of dozens of former and current medical residents, physicians, nurses and midwives in Wisconsin contacted by the Cap Times and the Fuller Project, only one currently practicing physician agreed to speak on the record for this story. Other currently practicing providers agreed to speak only anonymously because of concerns about negatively affecting their careers or because they had been instructed not to by their employer.To clarify how Wisconsin\u2019s Catholic hospitals use the directives, the Cap Times and the Fuller Project sent a series of questions to six such hospital systems: Ascension, SSM Health, Hospital Sisters Health System, Divine Savior Healthcare, Essentia Health and Holy Family Memorial. Questions were also sent to Aspirus and Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare, two non-Catholic health systems that own hospitals that adhere to the ERDs.None responded individually. However, Nathaniel Blanton Hibner, CHA\u2019s director of ethics, sent a statement on behalf of the organization and Ascension, SSM and Hospital Sisters Health System, clarifying that physicians will prescribe contraceptives for \u201ca variety of underlying medical conditions\u201d and will offer emergency contraception to rape victims.The full statement can be read here.Doctor recalls potential \u2018time bomb\u2019Dr. Kathy Hartke worked in Catholic hospitals for 27 years. She recalls a young woman pregnant with twins who arrived at the Catholic hospital in Brookfield, now known as Ascension SE Wisconsin Hospital-Elmbrook Campus. At about 21 weeks, the fetuses had virtually zero chance of survival.The longer they waited to terminate the pregnancy, the greater the risk the woman\u2019s uterus would become infected, Hartke said. But at Elmbrook, medical personnel were told they had to wait until the fetuses had no heartbeats.Hartke recommended the patient be transferred to the secular Waukesha Memorial Hospital, where they could induce labor. But nurses gave the patient the opposite advice.\u201cMeanwhile, we\u2019re sitting on a possible time bomb of somebody who is going to get very, very sick \u2026 and potentially die,\u201d says Hartke, who has retired from practice.The patient remained in Hartke\u2019s care, growing sicker in the ensuing days. She developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Hartke says the patient went into spontaneous labor and was provided antibiotics, which prevented her from growing sicker. The fetuses did not survive.Hibner says if a mother is suffering from a life-threatening condition, Catholic hospitals will provide all medically indicated care \u2014 even if it results in the death of the child.The Rev. Charles Bouchard, senior director of theology at CHA, says he urges doctors to be \u201cproactive\u201d and not \u201cwait until this infection starts.\u201dBut in her experience, Hartke says, \u201cThey push it to the last possible second.\u201d\u201cHow is any physician supposed to be able to predict when it\u2019s too late and a woman is going to die?\u201d she says.As a medical resident, Dr. Jessika Ralph tried to facilitate an abortion for a patient who became ill after going into premature labor with twins at St. Joseph in 2017. Ralph, who now works at University of Minnesota Health, says she was forced to wait until the woman hemorrhaged or showed signs of infection to help end the doomed pregnancy. Ralph eventually induced labor using medication, but was unable to use a particular recommended abortion drug. The ordeal lasted 24 hours, she says, and neither fetus survived.\u201cWhile overall I believe these hospitals do provide good obstetric and gynecologic care for women, this unfortunately is a really big gap, and it\u2019s a gap that patients don\u2019t know about,\u201d says Ralph, who also told her story to Rewire.News.Tubal ligations raise thorny issuesWomen delivering by C-section at a secular hospital can ask physicians to tie their fallopian tubes, cut them and cauterize the ends while the abdomen is still open \u2014 a procedure that might last just a few minutes.But at a Catholic hospital, the same woman often must schedule a second surgery at a different hospital to get a tubal ligation. Researchers have found that nearly half of women who requested to be sterilized but were denied became pregnant within a year. Hospitals also charge nearly three times more for postpartum tubal ligations than they do for the same procedure done during a C-section, according to a list of procedure costs from Aurora hospitals in Wisconsin. The median charge for a C-section tubal is $515; a postpartum tubal is $1,390.Doctors at Catholic hospitals face a dilemma: Risk violating hospital rules, or make the patient go through two surgeries.Says Hartke: \u201cWhen you have a moral conflict like that, it eats away at you.\u201dContraception policies vary widelySecular hospitals commonly implant long-acting reversible forms of contraception such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) after a woman gives birth. Physicians from Catholic hospitals told the Cap Times and the Fuller Project they were not allowed to implant IUDs, which provide contraception that can last for years.Data from the Wisconsin Hospital Association suggest this is largely true. Ascension\u2019s St. Joseph Hospital, for example, billed for an IUD just nine times for the fiscal year ending June 2019, whereas the non-Catholic Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, less than 5 miles away, did the same more than 1,500 times.Cami Thomas is a leader of Maroon Calabash, which describes itself as a black radical reproductive justice organization. She says reproductive health care should be about \u201cdignity and consent.\u201dThomas recounts going to a Catholic hospital about a decade ago when she was on the brink of death, having lost two-thirds of her blood after her menstrual cycle went on for six months. Her doctor recommended Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, but the hospital\u2019s rules on contraception prohibited it. Furious, he found a loophole.\u201cNot all doctors are like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThank goodness I had that doctor.\u201dThe nonprofit Wisconsin Watch collaborates with Wisconsin Public Radio, Wisconsin Public Television, other news media and the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

I\u2019m not sure the moderators are paid (I seem to recall seeing somewhere that they volunteer to do this, but I could be wrong).  But the fact that there are more than one of them (and perhaps MANY more than one) could certainly lead to inconsistencies based on individual differences in judgement as to what is appropriate.\nAdditionally, I suspect they have a LOT of comments to wade through, and it would not surprise me in the least to find that some of them simply get lost.  Especially if moderators are unpaid or low paid.\nI don\u2019t like the inconsistency, but over time, I\u2019ve pretty much resigned myself to it given the setup here.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Nilsson says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t01/11/2020 at 07:53 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAccording to the latest numbers from the Guttmacher Institute, 24 percent of women who procure abortions identify as Catholic, almost the same as 22 percent of all U.S. women who called themselves Catholic in a 2014 survey by Pew Research Center.  \u201c\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nKris Yesame says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t01/13/2020 at 04:51 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSad to say but the Church should get back to its mission and take care of the poor, needy, and faithful.

I know personally that there were several \u201c missed abortions\u201d that resulted in D&C\u2019s which is the procedure technically used for elective AB\u2019s.  In other words, they got an abortion electively.\nSometimes There is something going on behind the scenes that is not apparent to a non-medical personnel.  If there is a conflict between the OB doc and nurses, they can make life difficult in the specific conflicted interactions.\nIn other words, the patient suffers because someone\u2019s upset who is not pregnant. It\u2019s a sad fact of life. Elmbrook is in Waukesha, which is an extremely conservative suburban, whereScott walker came from. \nIt\u2019s funny how people like to claim that such actions are pro-life and that the hospitals should be commended. In the same hospitals, I would get calls asking for me to standby while the respiratory therapist \u201cpracticed\u201d an intubation on an already ventilated and intubated patient.  Because they needed the practice.  I would refuse and then catch hell from hospital because I did not believe non consented procedures that were unnecessary should be performed on sick patients for non medical reasons.  Doesn\u2019t sound very prolife to me.  Or ethical.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nTom Anderson says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t01/15/2020 at 10:15 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCatholics run one-third of Wisconsin hospitals\u201d\nInsert any other group you wish for Catholics.

Nearly a third of residents in the ZIP code live in poverty, and black infants born there are more than twice as likely to die as white infants.</p>\n<p>Residents feared that reducing services would exacerbate these disparities, and even pave the way for the hospital to close. St. Joseph\u2019s parent company, Ascension Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/ascension-wisconsin-statement-re-next-steps-at-ascension-st-joseph-hospital/\">eventually put the cuts on hold</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's an anchor institution there,\u201d says Reggie Newson, chief advocacy officer at Ascension Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>But St. Joseph remains the target of a different kind of protest. The hospital is Catholic, which means it follows <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/about/doctrine/ethical-and-religious-directives/upload/ethical-religious-directives-catholic-health-service-sixth-edition-2016-06.pdf\">Ethical and Religious Directives</a>, a set of rules written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The rules prohibit Catholic hospitals, except in extreme situations, from providing procedures the church deems immoral \u2014 including abortions, contraception and sterilization. In-vitro fertilization is banned.</p>\n<p>Asma Kadri Keeler, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, recently met with members of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SJACMKE/\">St. Joe\u2019s Accountability Coalition</a>, a community group formed after Ascension announced cutbacks. Although most people surveyed by the community group had positive views of St. Joseph, some residents told Keeler they were hesitant to send their pregnant loved ones there.</p>\n<p>Keeler says the ACLU works to safeguard religious liberty, but it also <a href=\"https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/aclu-announces-lawsuit-against-catholic-hospital-system-failing-provide-emergency\">has sued</a> when patients were <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/reproductive-freedom/religion-and-reproductive-rights/health-care-denied\">denied care based on religious restrictions</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe take the position that it (religious liberty) can't be used to harm other people,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Reproductive rights advocates say the restrictions impose religious doctrine on patients and violate medical standards of care in ways that disproportionately affect communities like Sherman Park.</p>\n<p>Catholic health systems argue that they serve as safety nets in impoverished communities and provide the same quality of care as secular hospitals. According to the Catholic Health Association (CHA), which represents more than 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States, patients who received care at Catholic hospitals <a href=\"https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/cha_2019_miniprofile.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">are more likely to recommend </a>those hospitals than patients who receive care elsewhere.</p>\n<p>That St. Joseph is both desperately needed and criticized reflects an increasingly common tension facing Wisconsin communities. An analysis by the Cap Times and the Fuller Project, a nonprofit news organization focusing on women\u2019s issues, shows that the number of Catholic hospitals grew by 13 percent in the state, while the number of non-Catholic hospitals fell by the same percentage, between 2001 and 2018.</p>\n<p>In most ways, these Catholic hospitals, which treat <a href=\"https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/cha_2019_miniprofile.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">one in every </a><a href=\"https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/cha_2019_miniprofile.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">seven</a> patients in the United States, differ from secular ones in name only. Yet, critics say, in reproductive care, Catholic ethics can trump medical best practice, bishops can wield more influence than physicians, and patients can be denied care they desire or need.</p>\n<h4><strong>Catholic hospitals common</strong></h4>\n<p>In Wisconsin, where Catholic Germans and Irish dominated immigration in the mid- to late- 1800s, <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6576267/Catholic-Affiliated-Hospitals-in-Wisconsin.pdf\">one-third</a><a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6576267/Catholic-Affiliated-Hospitals-in-Wisconsin.pdf\"> of hospitals</a> are governed by Catholic religious principles \u2014\u00a0more than <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/report-health-care-denied?redirect=report/health-care-denied\">twice the national average</a>.</p>\n<p>It is the only state where black women <a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/gender-sexuality/PRPCP/bearingfaith.pdf\">are more likely to deliver their babies in a Catholic institution</a> than a non-Catholic one, Columbia Law School researchers found. And in 12 of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties, the only hospitals within the borders are Catholic.</p>\n<p>Hospitals are not always transparent about the services they will not provide, and patients often lack a choice of where they seek care, the Cap Times and the Fuller Project found.</p>\n<p>Catholic hospitals are governed by 77 directives, which fuse theology with medicine and technology. Several directives cover reproductive care. For example, Catholic-affiliated hospitals will not provide sterilization if the sole purpose is to prevent a woman from becoming pregnant.</p>\n<p>And abortion is not permitted, unless it is an \u201cunavoidable\u201d consequence of an action taken to save the mother\u2019s life, according to Brian Reardon, vice president of communications for CHA.</p>\n<p>Some physicians provide referrals for abortions and other restricted services or prescribe contraception for menstrual pain rather than birth control. Others adhere strictly to the directives.</p>\n<p>SSM Health St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Madison refers patients seeking a common form of sterilization to undergo the procedure at a nearby eye clinic that does surgeries, according to one doctor and a nurse familiar with the arrangement.</p>\n<p>Out of dozens of former and current medical residents, physicians, nurses and midwives in Wisconsin contacted by the Cap Times and the Fuller Project, only one currently practicing physician agreed to speak on the record for this story. Other currently practicing providers agreed to speak only anonymously because of concerns about negatively affecting their careers or because they had been instructed not to by their employer.</p>\n<p>To clarify how Wisconsin\u2019s Catholic hospitals use the directives, the Cap Times and the Fuller Project sent a series of questions to six such hospital systems: Ascension, SSM Health, Hospital Sisters Health System, Divine Savior Healthcare, Essentia Health and Holy Family Memorial. Questions were also sent to Aspirus and Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare, two non-Catholic health systems that own hospitals that adhere to the ERDs.</p>\n<p>None responded individually. However, Nathaniel Blanton Hibner, CHA\u2019s director of ethics, sent a statement on behalf of the organization and Ascension, SSM and Hospital Sisters Health System, clarifying that physicians will prescribe contraceptives for \u201ca variety of underlying medical conditions\u201d and will offer emergency contraception to rape victims.</p>\n<p>The full statement <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6572788/CHA-Statement-to-WisconsinWatch-11-26-2019.pdf\">can be read here</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Doctor recalls potential \u2018time bomb\u2019</strong></h4>\n<p>Dr. Kathy Hartke worked in Catholic hospitals for 27 years. She recalls a young woman pregnant with twins who arrived at the Catholic hospital in Brookfield, now known as Ascension SE Wisconsin Hospital-Elmbrook Campus. At about 21 weeks, the fetuses had virtually zero chance of survival.</p>\n<p>The longer they waited to terminate the pregnancy, the greater the risk the woman\u2019s uterus would become infected, Hartke said. But at Elmbrook, medical personnel were told they had to wait until the fetuses had no heartbeats.</p>\n<p>Hartke recommended the patient be transferred to the secular Waukesha Memorial Hospital, where they could induce labor. But nurses gave the patient the opposite advice.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, we\u2019re sitting on a possible time bomb of somebody who is going to get very, very sick ... and potentially die,\u201d says Hartke, who has retired from practice.</p>\n<p>The patient remained in Hartke\u2019s care, growing sicker in the ensuing days. She developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Hartke says the patient went into spontaneous labor and was provided antibiotics, which prevented her from growing sicker. The fetuses did not survive.</p>\n<p>Hibner says if a mother is suffering from a life-threatening condition, Catholic hospitals will provide all medically indicated care \u2014 even if it results in the death of the child.</p>\n<p>The Rev. Charles Bouchard, senior director of theology at CHA, says he urges doctors to be \u201cproactive\u201d and not \u201cwait until this infection starts.\u201d</p>\n<p>But in her experience, Hartke says, \u201cThey push it to the last possible second.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is any physician supposed to be able to predict when it\u2019s too late and a woman is going to die?\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>As a medical resident, Dr. Jessika Ralph tried to facilitate an abortion for a patient who became ill after going into premature labor with twins at St. Joseph in 2017. Ralph, who now works at University of Minnesota Health, says she was forced to wait until the woman hemorrhaged or showed signs of infection to help end the doomed pregnancy. Ralph eventually induced labor using medication, but was unable to use a particular recommended abortion drug. The ordeal lasted 24 hours, she says, and neither fetus survived.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile overall I believe these hospitals do provide good obstetric and gynecologic care for women, this unfortunately is a really big gap, and it\u2019s a gap that patients don't know about,\u201d says Ralph, who also told her story to <a href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2017/09/07/catholic-rules-forced-doctor-watch-patient-sicken-now-shes-speaking/\">Rewire.News</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Tubal ligations raise thorny issues</strong></h4>\n<p>Women delivering by C-section at a secular hospital can ask physicians to tie their fallopian tubes, cut them and cauterize the ends while the abdomen is still open \u2014 a procedure that might last just a few minutes.</p>\n<p>But at a Catholic hospital, the same woman often must schedule a second surgery at a different hospital to get a tubal ligation. Researchers have found that nearly half of women who requested to be sterilized but were denied became pregnant <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966691\">within </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966691\">a year. </a></p>\n<p>Hospitals also charge nearly three times more for postpartum tubal ligations than they do for the same procedure done during a C-section, according to a list of procedure costs from Aurora hospitals in Wisconsin. The median charge for a C-section tubal is $515; a postpartum tubal is $1,390.</p>\n<p>Doctors at Catholic hospitals face a dilemma: Risk violating hospital rules, or make the patient go through two surgeries.</p>\n<p>Says Hartke: \u201cWhen you have a moral conflict like that, it eats away at you.\u201d</p>\n<h4><strong>Contraception policies vary widely</strong></h4>\n<p>Secular hospitals commonly implant long-acting reversible forms of contraception such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) after a woman gives birth. Physicians from Catholic hospitals told the Cap Times and the Fuller Project they were not allowed to implant IUDs, which provide contraception that can last for years.</p>\n<p>Data from the Wisconsin Hospital Association suggest this is largely true. Ascension\u2019s St. Joseph Hospital, for example, billed for an IUD just nine times for the fiscal year ending June 2019, whereas the non-Catholic Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, less than 5 miles away, did the same more than 1,500 times.</p>\n<p>Cami Thomas is a leader of <a href=\"https://www.marooncalabash.com/\">Maroon Calabash</a>, which describes itself as a black radical reproductive justice organization. She says reproductive health care should be about \u201cdignity and consent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thomas recounts going to a Catholic hospital about a decade ago when she was on the brink of death, having lost two-thirds of her blood after her menstrual cycle went on for six months. Her doctor recommended Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, but the hospital\u2019s rules on contraception prohibited it. Furious, he found a loophole.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all doctors are like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThank goodness I had that doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>The nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.WisconsinWatch.org\">Wisconsin Watch </a></em><em>collaborates with Wisconsin Public Radio, Wisconsin Public Television, other news media and the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication.
