Although just a small minority of Swiss openly reject abortion rights, groups that are opposed to voluntary terminations of pregnancy (VTP) have diversified their strategies to promote their ideals.\u00a0\n\n    More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        More    \n\n        How abortion rights in Switzerland compare internationally    \n\n\n\n\n                        This content was published on                    \n\n                        Jul 7, 2022                    \n\n\n                The recent decision by the United States Supreme Court to overturn the right to abortion has given the world pause.            \n\n\n\n\n            Read more: How abortion rights in Switzerland compare internationally        \n\n\nThe lobby in parliament\u00a0\nOn the political side it is the conservative right Swiss People\u2019s Party that flies the anti-abortion flag. Parliamentarians from the country\u2019s largest party regularly make interventions in the chambers or launch popular initiatives aimed at restricting abortion rights.\u00a0\nUntil now, such proposals have been consistently rejected. But in December 2021 two women parliamentarians from the People\u2019s Party launched a new pair of popular initiatives. They have until June 2023 to collect the 100\u2019000 signatures needed to force a nationwide vote on the texts.\u00a0\nThe first initiative, dubbed \u201cSleep on it\u201d, was launched by Bernese representative Andrea Geissb\u00fchler. The proposal is to introduce a day of reflection before a scheduled abortion in order to \u201cprotect women from abortions decided in a hurry\u201d. The second proposal, put forward by a parliamentarian from Lucerne, Yvette Estermann, wants to tackle \u201clate abortions\u201d. If accepted, this text would make any voluntary termination of pregnancy illegal as soon as \u201cthe fetus can breathe outside of the uterus, if necessary through intensive care\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                People\u2019s Party politician Andrea Geissb\u00fchler in 2011 expressing support for a popular initiative to abolish the reimbursement of abortion costs by health insurance companies that was rejected by almost 70%.            \n\n            Keystone / Samuel Truempy        \n\n\nAlthough they insist their initiatives are not aimed at making abortion illegal, the two women are closely linked to pro-life organisations in Switzerland and go so far as to employ the same arguments. Geissb\u00fchler is on the board of the Swiss association Pro Life, which is openly anti-abortion. The parliamentarian believes a voluntary termination of pregnancy amounts to murder. \u00a0\n\u201cIf some lives can be saved through these initiatives, then they are worthwhile,\u201d Geissb\u00fchler tells SWI swissinfo.ch.\u00a0\nThe two conservative politicians may be acting as spokespersons for these initiatives, but they are not the authors of the texts. Behind the women are radical anti-abortion groups.\u00a0\n\u201cThese initiatives were written by different organisations, which then asked us to lead the initiative committees,\u201d says Geissb\u00fchler.\u00a0\nPro-life activists at home and abroad\u00a0\nNeither Estermann nor Geissb\u00fchler wants to reveal the names of these organisations. Nevertheless, the signatures collected in favour of the initiatives need to be sent directly to one of these groups, the association Mamma. Its president, Dominik M\u00fcggler, is fervently anti-abortion. A Basel resident who is on both initiative committees, M\u00fcggler opposed the decriminalisation of abortion in Switzerland back in 2002.\nM\u00fcggler has set his goals far beyond these two initiatives. \u00a0\n\u201cSooner or later abortion will disappear,\u201d he writes in a reply to SWI swissinfo.ch, \u201cnot because it will have been made illegal, but because humankind will have realised that such a practice is fundamentally opposed to human dignity.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cAbortion is not a termination of pregnancy but the killing of one\u2019s own child,\u201d it says on the Mamma website.External link\u00a0\nAs an activist M\u00fcggler takes part in anti-abortion conventions and demonstrations abroad, events from which he draws inspiration. He is pictured, for example, at a \u201cmarch for life\u201d \u2013 an anti-abortion protest that exists in several countries \u2013 in Washington, DC in 2019. He was also behind the creation of the association hope21, modelled on an American group opposed to abortion of foetuses with Down\u2019s syndrome.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                In 2021, the \u201cMarch for Life\u201d had its eleventh edition in Oerlikon (Zurich).            \n\n            Keystone / Ennio Leanza        \n\n\nControversial baby hatches\u00a0\nM\u00fcggler\u2019s work against abortion goes further: he is responsible for setting up the very first baby hatch \u2013 where mothers in distress can discreetly and anonymously leave a newborn they are unable to care for \u2013 at a hospital in Einsiedeln in canton Schwyz back in 2001. His foundation Swiss Aid for Mother and Child (SAMC) now manages seven so-called \u201cbaby boxes\u201d out of eight available nationwide, and covers the costs associated both with setting them up and with the babies\u2019 needs.\u00a0\nIf the \u201cbaby boxes\u201d appear to be a good idea at first glance, they have come in for fierce criticism. In 2015 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended Switzerland declare them illegal because such a practice violates the right of the child to know their origins.\u00a0\n\n    More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        More    \n\n        How do \u2018baby boxes\u2019 work in Switzerland?    \n\n\n\n\n                        This content was published on                    \n\n                        Jan 27, 2020                    \n\n\n                Switzerland does offer an emergency solution for desperate mothers that want to give away their infant anonymously.            \n\n\n\n\n            Read more: How do \u2018baby boxes\u2019 work in Switzerland?        \n\n\nThe hatches have also been criticised by the umbrella organisation for sexual health centres, Sant\u00e9 sexuelle SuisseExternal link, which objects to the boxes being managed by anti-abortion groups and argues they put the health of both mother and child at risk. \u00a0\n\u201cThe approach is purely pro-life \u2013 what matters is that babies are born,\u201d says director Barbara Berger. \u201cThe women simply don\u2019t count.\u201d \u00a0\nSant\u00e9 sexuelle Suisse suggests confidential births as an alternative, an option that is currently available in 18 cantons. The mother can choose not to reveal her identity when she gives birth in a hospital, saving her from having to deliver alone or in secret. The woman is thus able to maintain her privacy while still being entitled to adequate medical care for her and her baby.\u00a0\nSwiss Aid for Mother and Child presents itself as \u201ca support and counselling centre for women facing difficulties due to pregnancy or the birth of a child\u201d. But on its website, the foundation also presents arguments against abortion as well as information on the supposed physical and psychological risks associated with voluntary termination.\u00a0\nIn reality abortion is a common surgical procedure. In countries where the practice is legal, terminating a pregnancy is generally considered low-risk and complications are rare, according to medical researchersExternal link. Numerous scientific studies also show that a voluntary termination does not cause psychological trauma. Instead, says Sant\u00e9 sexuelle Suisse, stigmatisation and taboos surrounding abortion can cause greater harm that the practice itself.\u00a0\n\u201cThese groups are spreading false information to discourage women from having an abortion,\u201d says Berger. \u201cThey use people\u2019s distress as a leverage. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n        External Content    \n\n \n\nHealth insurance rebates\u00a0\nSwiss Aid for Mother and Child is hardly alone in adopting controversial approaches to fight abortion in Switzerland. Some organisations, such as Pro Life, go as far as offering financial support to women who decide to call off an abortion.\u00a0\nPro Life, which was established in 1989 and has some 70,000 members nationwide, negotiates contracts with the private health insurance firm Helsana. It\u2019s able to give rebates on insurance premiums to members who sign a declaration renouncing abortion. But this document has no legal value, as any voluntary termination is paid for by compulsory basic health insurance. For its part, Helsana told the newspaper ArcInfo it has \u201cno specific ties\u201d to Pro Life and has simply signed a \u201ccollective contract in conformity with industry practices\u201d.\u00a0\nCritics like senator Lisa Mazzone of the Green Party have repeatedly called out these types of contracts. After Mazzone raised the issue again in parliament recently, the federal government acknowledged these could be seen as problematic. However, it also considered that \u201cthe right of insured persons to receive the benefits provided for by the law on health insurance is not restricted\u201d.\u00a0\nAn international network\u00a0\nSwiss anti-abortion activists do not operate alone. \u00a0\n\u201cThey belong to a highly efficient international network that\u2019s pro-life, against sexual education and anti-LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans] rights,\u201d says Berger of Sant\u00e9 sexuelle Suisse. Berger has noticed that some parliamentary motions on the subject contain lines lifted directly from position papers published by pro-life groups abroad.\u00a0\nNeil Datta of the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development has made a similar observation. Movements in Europe that share an ultra-conservative view of society have organised and gained ground since 2013, when both France and the United Kingdom introduced marriage equality. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThey began meeting each other and exchanging ideas, especially through a network called Agenda Europe or at the World Congress of Families,\u201d says Datta.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Some anti-abortion proponents also oppose LGBT rights, like this woman carrying a sign against gay marriage at the \u201cMarch for Life\u201d.            \n\n            Keystone / Ennio Leanza        \n\n\nThe fact that they have modernised may be the secret to their success, as this has allowed them to find new sponsors, a study by the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights shows. \u201cThe amount of money being invested in these movements quadrupled between 2009 and 2018, to reach $700 million [CHF686 million],\u201d says Datta, who wrote the report. These funds came from 54 different sources (NGOs, foundations, religious organisations and political parties) based primarily in three regions: the US, Russia and above all, Europe.\u00a0\nIn Switzerland, like elsewhere in Europe, pro-life movements remain on the fringe despite their activism. However, as Datta warns, \u201cthey are out there waiting for the right moment and a favourable political landscape to push their ideas forward.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also noticed that many countries are not doing a good job on the legal front to protect the right to abortion,\u201d he adds. The Polish government, for example, was able to pass a near-blanket ban on abortion in 2021, allowing the practice only in cases of rape or where the woman\u2019s life is in danger. \u00a0\n\u201cPro-life movements in Europe are fifteen years behind their counterparts in the US,\u201d says Datta, \u201cbut the wheels have already been set in motion.\u201d\u00a0\nEdited by Samuel Jaberg and Virginie Mangin.
