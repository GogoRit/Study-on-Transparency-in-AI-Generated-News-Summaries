Wade. Learn more about how the ACLU continues to fight for abortion access and what steps you can take here.\nDespite being a year into a global pandemic that has caused a staggering half a million deaths in the U.S, many state legislatures still have their sights trained on a favorite target: decimating access to abortion care.\nIn 2020, most states \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 shifted their attention to addressing the pressing needs created by COVID-19. But now, anti-abortion politicians are returning to their prior obsession: interfering with people\u2019s personal medical decisions. By the end of February, states had already introduced 384 anti-abortion measures and enacted eight abortion laws.\nIn many ways, this year will feel like a re-play of 2019, when 8 states passed bans on abortion from the earliest days of pregnancy. Thus far, South Carolina has passed a 6-week ban (already blocked in court) and Arkansas\u2019s governor just signed a total ban. Other states could soon follow suit.\nBeyond the bans, however, are more subtle and nefarious restrictions on the horizon \u2014 bills that will push abortion out of reach without explicitly banning it.\nThis has long been the strategy of anti-abortion extremists: chip away at abortion access while leaving the legal right in place, even if in name only. That strategy shifted, however, in 2019 when abortion opponents began to hope the Supreme Court would use a near-total ban to overturn Roe v. Wade. Now, they are pursuing both strategies simultaneously.\nWhile we\u2019ve seen many of these restrictions before, this year has brought new variations. Already, several trends are emerging.\nThe first is related to medication abortion. Anti-abortion politicians already promote the dangerous myth of \u201cabortion reversal,\u201d forcing providers to tell patients they can stop a medication abortion mid-course and continue their pregnancy. But now, in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Montana, and Oklahoma, they are considering bills that could prevent people from getting medication abortion at all.\nMifepristone, medication used for early abortion and miscarriage care, is safe and effective, demonstrating a stellar safety record in the 20-plus years since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But it is still subject to medically unnecessary federal regulations \u2014 regulations that we are trying to get lifted \u2014 that make it far harder to access than it should be. State restrictions compound these barriers and abortion opponents are now seeking to make them even worse.\nThe second trend involves bans on abortion if even part of a patient\u2019s reason might be based on the sex or race of the fetus or a fetal diagnosis. Previously, some states had singled out Down syndrome, making it illegal for doctors to perform an abortion if they have reason to know that diagnosis was a factor the patient\u2019s decision \u2014 and we\u2019ve challenged such laws in Tennessee and Ohio. But this year, states are increasingly looking to ban abortion whenever any kind of fetal diagnosis may be involved, as Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming may do.\nThese measures cynically attempt to exploit the fight for disability and other civil rights, pitting them against the fight for reproductive freedom. Let\u2019s be clear: these laws do nothing to address the ableism people with disabilities face \u2014 or the discrimination against any marginalized group \u2014 in education, housing, and health care. They are simply a ploy to block access to abortion care.\nLastly, Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee currently have bills that would require fetal tissue from an abortion to be buried or cremated, and in some cases receive a death certificate. We just filed suit against a law like this in Ohio. Such laws are cruel and entirely unnecessary, searching for a solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. They do nothing to respect or support a patient\u2019s decision; instead, they impose intrusive mandates on abortion patients, regardless of their own wishes.\nBecause of racism and structural inequality, these types of restrictions \u2014 along with the hundreds of other medically-unnecessary restrictions that have been introduced \u2014 will fall hardest on people of color, low-income people, youth, immigrants, LGBTQ people, people in rural areas, and other marginalized communities.\nAnd yet, some states are fighting back, acting to ensure the right to abortion remains protected within their borders, no matter what happens to Roe. Just last month, New Mexico passed legislation to repeal a 1969 abortion ban, removing the threat that it could go back into effect \u2014 an essential safeguard for a state that already provides a haven to those who cannot access care in their home state. It\u2019s the second state, after Massachusetts, to move to protect reproductive freedom since Justice Ginsburg passed away last year.\nHoping to build on this momentum, in New Jersey, activists are pushing forward a comprehensive Reproductive Freedom Act to protect and expand access to a wide range of reproductive health care. And Delaware just introduced a bill to decriminalize abortion and ensure that no one can be prosecuted for ending a pregnancy.\nIn these uncertain times, one thing is certain: states will continue to be at the center of the fight over abortion. But the right to abortion \u2014 just like any other right \u2014 shouldn\u2019t depend on where you live. This pandemic has both laid bare and exacerbated the health and economic disparities that are rampant in this county. Together, we will keep working to ensure everyone can access the health care they need, build the families they want, and make their own decisions about their lives \u2014 without stigma, shame or political interference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About the Issues on This Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Abortion                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Reproductive Freedom                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            State Abortion Legislation                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nIn Alabama, Embryos Are People and It Won't Stop There\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nACLU Calls Out Junk Science at the Heart of the Supreme Court Medication Abortion Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nBusy Philipps Is Fed up With Abortion Bans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nBusy Philipps Named as ACLU Artist Ambassador for Reproductive Freedom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
