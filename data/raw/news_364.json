A Louisiana law, known as\u00a0Act 620,\u00a0unnecessarily requires abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges. If upheld, that law will create a two-tiered system in the state where wealthier, disproportionately white women will have greater access to abortion care than Black women.\nThe stakes could not be higher as this law now goes before the Supreme Court for review. To aid the Court\u2019s consideration of the glaring disparities that result from Act 620, we led a coalition of nearly a dozen civil rights groups in submitting a\u00a0friend-of-the-court brief\u00a0in\u00a0June Medical LLC, et al.\u00a0 v. Stephen Russo. In that case, scheduled for argument in March, the Court will decide if Act 620 is unconstitutional.\u00a0Politicians supporting Act 620 claim that these hurdles are necessary to protect women\u2019s health by ensuring physicians can admit abortion patients to nearby hospitals. These arguments fall short, since abortion is safer than\u00a0wisdom tooth extraction, almost never resulting in complications that would require a trip to the E.R., and certainly not hospitalization.\u00a0 Moreover, the Supreme Court has\u00a0already determined\u00a0that there is\u00a0no medical benefit\u00a0to admitting privileges laws.\nAct 620\u2019s stated \u201chealth\u201d justification\u2014that abortion patients may require hospitalization nearest abortion clinics\u2014is highly specious for other reasons, as well. First, the bill\u2019s author has absurdly suggested that the law is motivated, at least partly, by the stigmatizing belief that Black women who have abortions\u00a0commit genocide.\u00a0\u00a0Casting an even darker shadow upon the state\u2019s purported \u201chealth interest\u201d is Louisiana\u2019s abysmal record of failing to protect health and life at nearly every opportunity to do so.\u00a0 More Louisiana children\u00a0live in poverty\u00a0than in any other state,\u00a0ensuring that children there are subjected to a variety of stresses, anxieties, and environmental ills associated with poverty.\u00a0 Also,\u00a0Louisiana has been among states with the\u00a0highest rates\u00a0of infant deaths in the nation for several years. East Baton Rouge Parish\u2014a predominantly Black neighborhood\u2014currently has a\u00a0higher infant mortality rate than the entire country. Louisiana also has the highest maternal mortality rate in the country, and Black women there are four times more likely to die during childbirth than white women. Instead of focusing on these bona fide crises, Louisiana\u2019s legislature has poured its energy into enacting a slate of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, including Act 620.\nThe true purpose of the law is plain: Act 620 will make it nearly\u00a0impossible\u00a0for physicians who provide abortions in Louisiana to do their jobs and for women to access abortion.\u00a0If Act 620 is upheld,\u00a0just one abortion clinic will likely remain open in Louisiana and Black women will bear the brunt of the clinic closures.\u00a0Studies show that Black women are\u00a0half\u00a0as likely to be able to travel between just 25 and 50 miles for abortion care compared to white women.\u00a0\u00a0With a single clinic in the state, 90% of women will live more than 50 miles away from the remaining clinic, and 53% will live more than 150 miles away.\u00a0And,\u00a0because Louisiana law already requires that women seeking abortion have two appointments 24-hours apart, many will have to obtain costly lodging.\nHistorically, reproductive restrictions have fallen more harshly on Black women and Act 620 would be no different. For Black women, who are disproportionately low-income, abortion care will be out of reach if Act 620 is upheld.\u00a0Louisiana\u2019s legacy of slavery,\u00a0mass incarceration, and\u00a0segregation\u00a0has led to concentrated and intergenerational poverty within the Black community there.\u00a0The state\u2019s failure to address racial and gender economic inequality has resulted in persistent financial anguish. This is especially true for Black women who lack access to\u00a0affordable child care,\u00a0and are more likely to work in low-paying service jobs. And, among women, Black women have the\u00a0highest\u00a0labor force participation rate in Louisiana, yet face the\u00a0highest gender pay gap\u00a0in the country.\u00a0 An overwhelming 33% of Black women in Louisiana live below the poverty line. \u00a0\u00a0\nOf course, equal access to abortion care is vital to the ability of all women to exercise reproductive autonomy. However, Louisiana\u2019s attempt to obliterate abortion access has serious civil rights implications for Black women, in particular. Without access to abortion care, Black women may find themselves unable to attain the basic tenants of civil rights, such as adequate healthcare, housing, education, and employment.\u00a0 Indeed, studies show that Black women experience large educational and employment gains as a result of access to reproductive health services, including abortion care. Such care is especially essential for young people to determine their futures: Of the Black women in Louisiana who sought abortion care in 2018, 78% were under the age of 30.\nThe question before the Supreme Court this March clearly has far-reaching implications for thousands of Black women who are already vulnerable to the pains of generational poverty. Critical civil rights are hopelessly entangled with the constitutional question of abortion rights.  Black women deserve to live their lives on their own terms, pursue educational and economic opportunities, and seek personal stability free from regressive state interventions like Louisiana\u2019s Act 620. We can only hope the Justices will agree.\nKristen Clarke is President and Executive Director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Pilar Whitaker is Counsel for the Economic Justice Project at Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\n\nTOPICS:\u00a0  abortion act 620 Louisiana abortion ban\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
