(02-14-2022) \u2013\u00a0At a co-sponsored event at the Heritage Foundation, Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins along with leaders and experts from Heritage Action, Concerned Women for America, Live Action, Heartbeat, Alliance Defending Freedom, and well-known speakers joined in a Valentine\u2019s Day event to counter the false narrative that in a Post-RoeAmerica, pregnant and parenting women would be on their own.\u00a0\nSenators Steve Daines, Marsha Blackburn, Deb Fischer, and Cindy Hyde-Smith joined the event through a video,\u00a0seen here, adding their voices to the message that no woman needs to stand alone. Also highlighted\u00a0was a letter\u00a0from almost 40 leading pro-life/pro-family advocates, all engaged in the daily of supporting mothers and their children \u2013born and preborn.\u00a0\n\nMEDIA NOTE: For a complete list of speakers,\u00a0click here. The 11 a.m. event at the Heritage Foundation can also be watched at\u00a0Students for Life of America\u2019s Facebook here.\nOpening the event, Hawkins notes: \u201cOn this Valentine\u2019s Day 2022, we gather to say that pro-life is pro-love, and love looks like caring for women and children in need.\u00a0 The shared goals of those of us here, every signee on our open letter to women, and the prolife movement as a whole is to ensure that no woman in an unexpected pregnancy stands alone, and every woman in crisis is connected to the life-giving, non-violent alternatives to abortion available in her area.\u201d\nDuring the event, Hawkins also highlighted new features of Students for Life\u2019s 10-year program,\u00a0Standing With You, which helps women finds resources near them, from federal and state programs, to local, community and non-profit help. New services and functionality have been built in to help women across the country and connect them with groups near them, including many featured in the letter.\nRuth\u00a0Asmarzadeh,\u00a0a Standing With You alumni and mother, studying for a psychology degree\u00a0joined Hawkins at the event to share her story.\u00a0Click\u00a0here to read Ruth\u2019s story at Fox\u00a0or\u00a0watch a video\u00a0of how she was helped by SFLA\u2019s\u00a0Standing With You\u00a0initiative.\u00a0\n\nThe letter to women across America\u00a0begins: \u201cYou are strong. Powerful. Capable. You may not have heard that from the abortion industry, but you will hear it from us, believers in a woman\u2019s ability to choose life and to pursue all of the dreams in her heart. We live in a country with\u00a0about 3,000\u00a0pregnancy resource centers and\u00a0approximately 400\u00a0maternity homes,\u00a0offering free services and tangible support to women and their families during pregnancy and motherhood. But the sad reality is that we know through Students for Life\u2019s\u00a0Campaign for Abortion Free Cities\u00a0nationwide door-knocking efforts nearly 72% of Americans cannot name their local pregnancy resource center. In a Post-Roe\u00a0America, that must change \u2026 We are Standing with You so you will never need to stand alone. No matter what happens to\u00a0Roe\u00a0and the harmful institution of abortion it established, you have a friend in us.
