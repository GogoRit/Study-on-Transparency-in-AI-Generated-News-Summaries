Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, speaks during a news conference on Monday, Jan, 23, 2023 at the Wisconsin Capitol. Subeck is among the sponsors of a joint resolution seeking to ask voters in April 2024 whether they support repealing an 1849 state law that bans non-life-saving abortions. Sarah Lehr/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\nAs the nation marks half a century since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision, Wisconsin Democrats are once again attempting to ask voters to weigh in on abortion. A joint resolution introduced Monday would ask Wisconsin voters in April 2024 whether they support repealing a 19th-century state law that bans non-life-saving abortions while \u201crestoring the constitutional rights guaranteed under Roe v. Wade.\u201d The measure would be non-binding, but it nonetheless faces an uphill battle to get to the ballot in Wisconsin, where Republican lawmakers don\u2019t support the full repeal of Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Melissa Agard, D-Madison, a sponsor of the joint resolution, argued at a state Capitol press conference that Republicans also don\u2019t want to risk shining a spotlight on widespread support for abortion rights in Wisconsin.\u201cI think we all know that legislative Republicans are scared to be putting this on the ballot because of their antiquated views,\u201d Agard said. \u201cBecause they know that they are out of line and out of touch with the people of the state of Wisconsin.\u201dSpokespersons for Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. \nMembers of the Forward Marching Band perform at a march on the 50th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade on Sunday, Jan. 22, 2023, in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nWisconsin Republicans blocked previous attempts to bring abortion to ballotLast week, Wisconsin Republicans rejected an attempt by Democrats to bring a similar non-binding referendum on abortion to the ballot this spring. The timing of that proposal could have driven up Democratic turnout during the crucial April 4 election that has the potential to shift the ideological balance of Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court. Instead, GOP lawmakers approved two other measures for this April\u2019s ballot. One will ask voters to change the state\u2019s Constitution by adding criteria for judges who impose cash bail. The other referendum, which is strictly advisory, will ask voters whether they think \u201cchildless, able-bodied adults\u201d should be required to search for work in order to receive public benefits. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has also pushed \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to try and let voters repeal Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban by giving them the power to amend the state\u2019s Constitution. Evers\u2019 plan, if it had been approved, would have eventually given voters the power to bypass the Legislature altogether if they gathered enough signatures to bring issues directly to the ballot. In Michigan, that process, called a citizen-initiated referendum, is already allowed. Voters there used it this fall to add the right to abortion to Michigan\u2019s Constitution. In Wisconsin, GOP lawmakers rejected Evers\u2019 plan.The timing of Democrats\u2019 latest attempt has added resonance, said state Rep. Lisa Subeck. The Madison Democrat introduced the joint resolution calling for an advisory referendum on Monday, a day after more than a thousand people marched in Madison to call for abortion access on the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.\u201cWe have worked for years to try to overturn this ban, yet our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,\u201d Subeck said. \u201cPeople across the state have called out and said they want the freedom to be able to make their own health care decisions and their own family planning decisions, in consultation with their physicians, with their families and their faith and without interference from politicians. The last person who I want to see in my physician\u2019s office is a Supreme Court justice, the president of the United States or Robin Vos, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dDays after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued to block enforcement of the 1849 state law that makes providing an abortion a felony unless it\u2019s done to save a pregnant person\u2019s life. That lawsuit is ongoing in Dane County Circuit Court.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nAlluding to Trump, Biden calls out Republicans \u2018bragging\u2019 about abortion bans \n\n \n\n\n\nAs 2024 campaign winds up, Democrats knock Senate candidate Eric Hovde on abortion record \n\n \n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris voices support for abortion access at Wisconsin visit \n\n \n\n\n\nGOP bill would restrict abortions after 14 weeks \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
