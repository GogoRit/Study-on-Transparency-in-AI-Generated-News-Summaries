A local news anchor on WUSA-TV  called the story \u201cbizarre and chilling,\u201d while Handy\u2019s neighbors told NBC News that it was \u201creally messed up\u201d and \u201chorrifying\u201d that there were \u201cfetuses in someone\u2019s house.\u201d\nHandy is the director of activism at Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising (PAAU), a group founded in October 2021 by Terrisa Bukovinac, a self-described liberal atheist pro-lifer. After news broke of the police recovering the remains of the aborted babies, PAAU around midnight on Friday morning posted a statement about the incident on Twitter, connecting the arrests of the nine pro-life activists to the five unborn babies.\nAccording to the statement, one of the nine defendants in the case \u201cprivately arranged for the Washington, D.C., police homicide unit to pick up\u201d the remains. PAAU describes the babies as \u201crecently discovered\u201d and said they were at late gestational ages and appeared to have \u201csustained injuries.\u201d The defendant turned them in due to suspicions that forensic examinations could show they were aborted in violation of federal law. The Partial-Birth Abortion Act prohibits a specific technique of late term abortion that involves partially delivering the baby, and the Born Alive Infants Protection Act gives legal protection to infants born alive during abortions. \nHandy and other activists accessed labs and freezers March 9\u00a0at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she said they saw bags \u201cfilled with aborted baby body parts.\u201d The PAAU shows a picture of paper bags lining shelves in the freezer. It is unclear if the March 9 visit is related to the aborted baby remains obtained by police this week.\nPAAU said \u201ca funeral Mass and \u2018naming ceremony\u2019 was offered for the deceased babies with their bodies present.\u201d Another pro-life leader, Monica Migliorino Miller, has said that, in the past, she stored boxes of aborted babies\u2019 bodies in her apartment to arrange burials for them.\nWashington police said at a news conference Thursday that whoever aborted the babies apparently did so in compliance with local law, adding, \u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be anything criminal about that \u2014 except for how they got into that house.\u201d But Bukovinac in a statement said \u201cthe laws in question are federal laws enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d \nPAAU brings together pro-life activists who also oppose capitalism. The group\u2019s website describes abortion as a tool used by capitalists to \u201cbenefit their own bottom line.\u201d Bukovinac and other PAAU activists frequently use the term the \u201cabortion-industrial complex\u201d to describe the government and industry interests that sustain abortion practices.\nIn a February interview, Bukovinac told WORLD that PAAU focuses on activism that makes headlines. \u201cI just don\u2019t see another way of really weakening the abortion-industrial complex,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the language of the left: the activism, uprisings for social justice. It means something to leftists, and when they don\u2019t see any of that happening \u2026 they just don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d\nIn an interview in November, Handy, the woman who had the babies\u2019 remains in her home, told WORLD she was working to bring back the \u201csocial justice movement aspect of the pro-life movement.\u201d Handy said she started sidewalk counseling outside of abortion facilities as a college student but dropped out of college to do it full time. She described her participation in \u201cRed Rose Rescues,\u201d demonstrations in which pro-life activists enter abortion facilities to pass out roses to women who have come for appointments and talk to them until police arrive. \u201cI will sacrifice my freedom to have the chance to save another life,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Savas\nLeah is the life beat reporter for WORLD News Group.
