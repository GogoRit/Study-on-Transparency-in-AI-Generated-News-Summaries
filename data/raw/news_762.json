Wade and eliminate women\u2019s constitutionally protected right to abortion,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Saturday. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Indiana lawmakers 1st to approve abortion ban after Roe reversal\nThe ban, which takes effect Sept. 15,\u00a0includes some exceptions. Abortions will be permitted in cases of rape and incest, before 10-weeks post-fertilization; to protect the life and physical health of the mother; and if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. Victims of rape and incest won\u2019t be required to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to an attack,\u00a0as had once been proposed.\nUnder the bill, abortions can only be performed in hospitals or outpatient centers owned by hospitals, meaning all abortion clinics will lose their licenses. A doctor who performs an illegal abortion or fails to file required reports will lose their medical license.\nIndiana Senator Susan Glick, author of Senate Bill 1, debates Senator Greg Taylor shortly before the vote to accept Senate Bill 1, which was passed by the House earlier in the day, making the Indiana legislature the first in the nation to restrict abortions, in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 5, 2022. Photo by Cheney Orr/Reuters\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., which employs 10,400 people at its headquarters in Indianapolis, warned that the ban could lead it to reassess its presence in Indiana.\n\u201cWe are concerned that this law will hinder Lilly\u2019s \u2014 and Indiana\u2019s \u2014 ability to attract diverse scientific, engineering and business talent from around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement Saturday. \u201cWhile we have expanded our employee health plan coverage to include travel for reproductive services unavailable locally, that may not be enough for some current and potential employees.\u201d\n\u201cGiven this new law, we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state,\u201d it said.\nLilly has research and development hubs in New York City and the California cities of San Diego and San Francisco, and this year announced it would build a $700 million genetic medicine hub in Boston.\nLilly was not among the more than 250 businesses that opposed abortion restrictions in a letter released July 21 by the American Civil Liberties Union,\u00a0The Indianapolis Star\u00a0reported.\nIU Health, Indiana\u2019s largest health care system, said it was studying the new law.\n\u201cIU Health\u2019s priority remains ensuring our physicians and patients have clarity when making decisions about pregnancy within the limits of the law. We will take the next few weeks to fully understand the terms of the new law and how to incorporate the changes into our medical practice to protect our providers and care for the people seeking reproductive healthcare,\u201d it said in a statement.\nThe Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce urged the General Assembly to proceed with caution.\n\u201cOver the last two weeks, the Indiana General Assembly has debated a substantial policy change on the issue of abortion in a compressed timeframe,\u201d the chamber said in a statement Thursday. \u201cSuch an expedited legislative process \u2014 rushing to advance state policy on broad, complex issues \u2014 is, at best, detrimental to Hoosiers, and at worst, reckless.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights demonstrators protest outside the state Senate chambers shortly before the vote to accept Senate Bill 1 which was passed by the House earlier in the day, making the Indiana legislature the first in the nation to restrict abortions, on August 5, 2022.
