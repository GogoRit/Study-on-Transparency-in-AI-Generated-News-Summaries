During the segment, Goldberg made arguments suggesting that God is fine with abortion.    Goldberg, who insisted that every co-host of the ABC daytime talk show was \"pro-life\" \u2014 despite them all railing against the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the past \u2014 argued against Hasselbeck\u2019s claim that abortion was the wrong option for pregnant women.The host and famous actress seemed to invoke God to justify women choosing abortion, countering Hasselbeck\u2019s pro-life points by saying that God gave women \"freedom of choice.\"\u00a0  Goldberg also argued that Jesus Christ's teaching of, \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\" obliged her to not speak out against abortion lest she risk judging others.  Whoopi Goldberg debates Elisabeth Hasselbeck on abortion during Wednesday's episode of 'The View.' (Screenshot/ABC/TheView)  \u2018THE VIEW\u2019 MOCKED OVER REPORT SHOW IS STRUGGLING TO FIND NEW REPUBLICAN HOST: \u2018ANTI-CONSERVATIVE LUNATICS\u2019  The clash began after the conservative guest promoted adoption centers and pro-life \"agencies\" as great options for women who find it impossible to raise a baby. She urged women in these tough situations to \"look for the nonprofits, look for the agencies that help you create a birth plan and match you with an adoptive family who may have suffered miscarriage after miscarriage who want to care for the baby.\"Hasselbeck added, \"I don\u2019t believe in giving women half the information out there.\"  That\u2019s where Goldberg first countered, insisting that women, including those that abort, are merely exercising their God-given \"freedom of choice,\" even in committing abortion.\"As you know, God doesn\u2019t make mistakes,\" Goldberg insisted. \"God made us smart enough to know when it wasn\u2019t going to work for us. That\u2019s the beauty of giving us freedom of choice,\" she added, apparently implying that abortion, like adoption, is a choice that God allows women to discern for themselves.\u00a0  Hasselbeck protested, saying, \"No,\" though Goldberg continued, mentioning that her \"relationship\" with God is \"always choppy,\" seemingly explaining why she supports things many Christians do not.    Trying to be conciliatory in her approach, Hasselbeck told Goldberg, \"He [God] loves you.\" Goldberg acknowledged the sentiment, though she continued arguing her biblical justification for supporting a woman\u2019s right to choose.\"Listen. I have no doubt, but I also know that God made me smart enough to know that if there are alternatives out there that can work for me, I will investigate them, but I also know God said, \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u2019 I will not make that decision for anybody,\" she declared.  Former \u2018View\u2019 co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck discusses abortion with the ladies of the ABC talk show. ELISABETH HASSELBECK RESPONDS TO VIRAL RECORDING OF HER TRYING TO QUIT \u2018THE VIEW\u2019    Hasselbeck responded, asking, \"What about the life in the womb?\" She added, \"I will say this, that life has a plan and a purpose designed by God. I don\u2019t believe there is any circumstance\u2014\"Dismissing her argument, Goldberg responded, \"I love that you feel that way,\" clearly indicating she didn\u2019t agree that the life in the womb must be protected from abortion.\u00a0Most Christian churches\u2019 teaching on abortion is clear, that it is morally wrong. The Roman Catholic Church, one of the oldest Christian traditions, contends that abortion at any point after conception is a grave evil.  Pope Francis recently rebuked President Biden, claiming that his moral orientation as a Catholic who promotes abortion demonstrates \"incoherence.\"  Abortion rights activists march to the White House to denounce the U.S. Supreme Court decision to end federal abortion rights protections on July 9, 2022.

She stated, \"There are 117,000 children waiting to be adopted right now, so it\u2019s not such a snap thing, \u2018I\u2019ll have the baby and it will be put up for adoption.\u2019\"  Co-host Sara Haines added onto Behar\u2019s point, stating that adopted babies \"get turned into a social system that fails them.\"\u00a0  Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.\u00a0                  \n\n\n\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox\nArrives Weekdays\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n     \n          U.S.\n         \n            Crime\n          \n            Military\n          \n            Education\n          \n            Terror\n          \n            Immigration\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Personal Freedoms\n          \n            Fox News Investigates\n          \n            Digital Originals\n          \n          Politics\n         \n            Executive\n          \n            Senate\n          \n            House\n          \n            Judiciary\n          \n            Foreign Policy\n          \n            Polls\n          \n            Elections\n          \n          World\n         \n            U.N.\n          \n            Conflicts\n          \n            Terrorism\n          \n            Disasters\n          \n            Global Economy\n          \n            Environment\n          \n            Religion\n          \n            Scandals\n          \n          Opinion\n         \n          Media\n         \n            FOX Nation Coverage\n          \n          Entertainment\n         \n            Celebrity News\n          \n            Movies\n          \n            TV News\n          \n            Music News\n          \n            Style News\n          \n            Entertainment Video\n          \n          Sports\n         \n            NFL\n          \n            College Football\n          \n            MLB\n          \n            NBA\n          \n            NHL\n          \n            Golf\n          \n            Tennis\n          \n            Soccer\n          \n            UFC\n          \n            WWE\n          \n          Lifestyle\n         \n            Health\n          \n            Food & Drink\n          \n            Auto\n          \n            Travel & Outdoors\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            House & Home\n          \n            Fitness + Well-being\n          \n            Style & Beauty\n          \n            Family\n          \n            Faith\n          \n          FOX Business\n         \n            Personal Finance\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Markets\n          \n            Watchlist\n          \n            Lifestyle\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            Tech\n          \n          Science & Tech\n         \n            Air & Space\n          \n            Security\n          \n            Innovation\n          \n            Video Games\n          \n            Military Tech\n          \n            Planet Earth\n          \n            Wild Nature\n          \n          Watch Live\n         \n            FOX News Shows\n          \n            Programming Schedule\n          \n            On Air Personalities\n          \n            Full Episodes\n          \n            Show Clips\n          \n            News Clips\n          \n          About\n         \n            Contact Us\n          \n            Careers\n          \n            Fox Around the World\n          \n            Advertise With Us\n          \n            Media Relations\n          \n            Corporate Information\n          \n            Compliance\n          \n          Apps & Products\n         \n            FOX News Go\n          \n            FOX Weather\n          \n            FOX Nation\n          \n            FOX News Shop\n          \n            FOX News Radio\n          \n            Outkick\n          \n            Newsletters\n          \n            Podcasts\n           Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Flipboard LinkedIn Slack RSS Newsletters Spotify iHeartRadio Fox News New Terms of UseNew Privacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesClosed Caption PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility Statement \n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.
