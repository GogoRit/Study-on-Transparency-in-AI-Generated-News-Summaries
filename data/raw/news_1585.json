(AP) \u2014 Abortion access in Kentucky remained virtually shut off Thursday after the state\u2019s highest court refused to halt a near-total ban that has largely been in place since Roe v. Wade was overturned.Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court, which was weighing challenges to the state\u2019s near-total ban and a separate one that outlaws abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, sent the case back to a lower court for further consideration of constitutional issues related to the more restrictive ban.The court weighed in on the issue after Kentucky voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion. The justices heard arguments in the case a week after the November midterm elections, and activists on both sides had anxiously awaited the ruling. The state\u2019s Republican-led Legislature passed both of those laws.\n\nThe justices ruled on narrow legal issues Thursday. They left unanswered the larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the Bluegrass State.\u201cTo be clear, this opinion does not in any way determine whether the Kentucky Constitution protects or does not protect the right to receive an abortion, as no appropriate party to raise that issue is before us,\u201d Deputy Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert wrote. \u201cNothing in this opinion shall be construed to prevent an appropriate party from filing suit at a later date.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky House backs giving lawmakers authority over statues in Capitol Rotunda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA booming bourbon industry has Kentucky leaders toasting record growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky juvenile facilities have issues with force, staffing, report says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights groups responded that the fight is far from over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven after Kentuckians overwhelmingly voted against an anti-abortion ballot measure, abortion remains banned in the state,\u201d Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in today\u2019s decision, but we will never give up the fight to restore bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nKentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, called the ruling a \u201csignificant victory,\u201d and said his office will continue to defend laws that \u201cstand up for the unborn.\u201d \u201cWe are very pleased that Kentucky\u2019s high court has allowed these laws to remain in effect while the case proceeds in circuit court,\u201d Cameron said in a statement.The legal challenge brought by two Louisville abortion providers revolves around the state\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and six-week ban. The trigger law was passed in 2019 and took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It bans abortions except when they\u2019re carried out to save the life of the mother or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.In July, a Louisville judge, Mitch Perry, halted enforcement of the bans because he found that they likely violated the state constitution\u2019s rights to privacy and self-determination. He said it wasn\u2019t the court\u2019s role to determine whether the state constitution guarantees the right to abortion, but it is its role to decide whether the new bans violate constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.But the state Court of Appeals reinstated enforcement of the bans and the state Supreme Court opted in August to keep them in place while it reviewed the case.\n\nOn Thursday, the high court ruled that the abortion providers, who challenged the two bans on the premise that they violate patients\u2019 constitutional rights, lacked the \u201cthird-party standing\u201d to do so.Lambert, though, wrote that the providers do have \u201cfirst-party\u201d constitutional standing to challenge the trigger ban, pointing to \u201cfinancial harm\u201d as sufficient grounds for such standing.As a result, the justices sent that part of the case back to the circuit court in Louisville to review the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the trigger ban violates the state constitution.However, the abortion providers offered \u201cno arguments concerning their own rights\u201d in challenging the six-week ban, the court noted.With Kentucky\u2019s near-total ban left intact, abortion rights groups said they would continue helping Kentuckians \u201cget the care they need, including helping patients find care out of state.\u201d \n\nThirteen states have current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, including Wisconsin, where there\u2019s a legal question over which law is in effect but where clinics have shut down. Bans and tight restrictions are currently on hold because of court action in at least six states.Meanwhile, a Texas lawsuit poses a threat to the nationwide availability of medication-induced abortion, which now accounts for the majority of abortions in the U.S. The case filed by abortion rights opponents seeks to reverse Food and Drug Administration approval of mifepristone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
