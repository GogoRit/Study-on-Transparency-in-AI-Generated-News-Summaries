This doctor works in a \u201csurge state\u201d \u2013 one that allows abortion and has been seeing an influx of patients from neighboring states that have banned the procedure.\n    \n\n            The doctor ran the request by her hospital\u2019s media department, even though she knew they would say no. They said no.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Davis gives a statement at a press conference alongside attorney Ben Crump.\n\nWBRZ\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nLouisiana woman who alleges she was denied abortion after fetus' fatal diagnosis says 'it should not happen to any other woman'\n\n\n\n\n            She said it\u2019s just one more disappointment in a series of disappointments.\n    \n\n            It started soon after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, when she and other maternal-fetal medicine specialists got on a call with their hospital\u2019s administrators.\n    \n\n            \u201cMy assumption, as a state with relatively liberal abortion laws, is that we would step up in a number of ways, like structural ways to meet the surge we knew we would see. And I thought we would use our position as a respected women\u2019s health institution to continue to educate about the impact these laws have on women\u2019s health,\u201d she told CNN.\n    \n\n            But on the call, \u201cit became pretty clear that [the medical center] was not going to take a particularly activist approach\u201d and would not make it easy for doctors to describe the impact of the new laws to the public.\n    \n\n            She said she and her fellow high-risk pregnancy doctors were crushed.\n    \n\n            \u201cPeople cried on that call \u2013 like 40-, 50-year-old women were in tears when they realized the extent to which the institution was going to make this difficult,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n  \n\n\n\n\n            Then, last week, the doctor thought she might be seeing a glimmer of hope. \n    \n\n            She said a physician in a leadership position at the hospital was disappointed that they\u2019d had to say no to the journalist\u2019s request to embed at their hospital. She said the doctor in the leadership position told her that \u201d \u2018We have to stop muzzling physicians. I want to figure out a way to get our voices out there.\u2019 \u201c\n    \n\n            \u201cThey\u2019re just a doctor \u2013 they\u2019re not corporate \u2013 but maybe it was a little bit of a thaw. I\u2019m a tiny bit more optimistic,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Lindsey Knight and Casey Hicks contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
