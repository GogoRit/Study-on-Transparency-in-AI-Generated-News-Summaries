Marshall Statement on Value Them Both Amendment Result \n\n\n\n(Washington, D.C., August 2, 2022) \u2013 U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. \u2013 an OBGYN who delivered more than 5,000 babies \u2013 released the following statement on the result of the Value Them Both Amendment:\n\u201cWords could never express the sadness and emotion myself and many Kansans are feeling after the Value Them Both amendment was not adopted. This is an enormous blow to efforts to protect the sanctity of life in Kansas.\n\u201cToo many times I\u2019ve seen sadness and hurt, without an explanation why \u2014 this is one of those moments. While I don\u2019t have an answer, I do know that God works all things for good for those who trust him.\n\u201cI want to thank everybody in the pro-life community who worked so hard to get this amendment passed. Tonight, we must still go to bed with faith and hope, for tomorrow we must be as dedicated to the sanctity of life, and to the fight to protect the lives of moms and unborn babies.\n\u201cEach of us will have to pray and look in our hearts to see what\u2019s next. However, we must not rest as there is much work to be done to support moms who are contemplating abortion, and decide instead for life. Let us all reach out and give them all the help and hope we can.\n\u201cAs an OBGYN who delivered more than 5,000 babies and fought each day of my more than 25 year career to protect moms and babies, I remain as dedicated as ever to doing everything in my power as a U.S. Senator to protect life at all costs.\u201d\nBackground:\nSenator Marshall practiced medicine in Great Bend, KS for more than 25 years. As an OB/GYN, he delivered more than 5,000 babies, giving him a deep appreciation and passion for the sanctity of life and an intimate understanding of the healthcare system. During his time in medicine, Senator Marshall was more than a physician. For 25 years, he was a business owner who signed a paycheck every other week for a practice that grew from 5 people to eventually more than 300.\nLast month, Senator Marshall served as Ranking Member for a U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) hearing on abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade and returning the issue of abortion to state governments.\nUpon entering the U.S. Senate in January 2021, Senator Marshall\u2019s first bill was the\u00a0Protecting Life in Crisis Act.\u00a0This legislation would prohibit any funds that are authorized or appropriated for the purposes of preventing, preparing for, or responding to the COVID\u201319 pandemic, domestically and internationally, from going toward abortions or abortion coverage. Additionally, Senator Marshall is an original cosponsor of the following pro-life bills:\nBorn Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act: This bill requires that appropriate care be given to any child who survives an attempted abortion. The bill also allows federal murder charges to be brought against anyone who intentionally kills such a born-alive child.Prohibiting Federal Emergencies for Abortion Act: The bill would prohibit the declaration of a Federal emergency relating to abortion.Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act: This bill would exclude elective abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from the Title X family planning program.Life at Conception Act: This bill ensures that current right to life protections granted by the 14th Amendment are truly guaranteed to all human beings, including unborn children at all stages of development. The Constitution already guarantees the right to life in the 14th Amendment, this bill simply enforces the law and ensures those same protections are extended to the most vulnerable members of our society.Defund Planned Parenthood Act: This bill would ensure that federal tax dollars are not going to Planned Parenthood or any other organizations that perform abortions. Funds for these services would continue to be provided to entities that are eligible and not performing abortions, such as community health centers.No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act: This bill would codify the Hyde Amendment, prohibiting Federal funding for elective abortion, as a permanent, government-wide prohibition. It also would restrict Obamacare\u2019s premium tax credits from being used for elective abortion coverage on the exchanges.Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: This bill prohibits abortions after 20-weeks, a point at which research has shown unborn children feel pain.Down Syndrome Protection Act: This bill prohibits the performance of an abortion being sought due to the unborn child having Down syndrome.Protecting Life and Integrity in Research Act: This bill would prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from conducting or supporting any research involving human fetal tissue that is obtained pursuant to an induced abortion.Support and Value Expectant (SAVE) Moms and Babies Act: This bill would prevent labeling changes for already approved abortion drugs; prevent providers from dispensing these drugs remotely, by mail, or via telemedicine; and prevent the FDA from approving any new chemical abortion drugs.Women\u2019s Public Health and Safety Act: This bill clarifies the authority of states to exclude providers of elective abortion like Planned Parenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Planned Parenthood receives about half a billion dollars in tax-payer funding per year, most of which comes from Medicaid.Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act (PRENDA): Currently, only 11 states ban abortions that are sought on the basis of sex. PRENDA would combat the worrying trend of sex-selective abortion in America by making it a federal crime to abort a child based on his or her gender.Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act: This bill would require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 15 miles of their practices.\u00a0 The bill also requires abortion centers to meet state-mandated requirements for ambulatory surgery centers.Parental Notification and Intervention Act: This bill prohibits a person or organization from performing, facilitating, or assisting in the performance of an abortion on an un-emancipated minor without first complying with parental notification requirements.Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act: The bill would codify an expanded version of the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy, also known as the Mexico City Policy. Specifically, the bill would ensure that no funds be made available to foreign non-governmental organizations, multi-lateral nonprofits, and quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations that perform abortions, counsel for abortion, lobby for abortion policies or expanded access, or provide funding or resources for any entity, including domestic non-governmental organizations and non-profits, that perform abortions abroad.\n\n###\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrint\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLike\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPrevious Article \n\nNext ArticleNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nNewsroom\nFor Kansans\n\nOnline Casework Resources\nWinter Heating Assistance Resources\nMedicare Open Enrollment\n\n\nContact\n \n\n Menu\n\n\nAbout\nNewsroom\nFor Kansans\n\nOnline Casework Resources\nWinter Heating Assistance Resources\nMedicare Open Enrollment\n\n\nContact\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
