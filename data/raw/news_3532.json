(Getty)A pro-life group is taking legal action against Birmingham City Council over a 'buffer zone' surrounding an abortion clinic.Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, 45, who runs 40 Days for life Birmingham, is upset her group is not allowed to protest near Robert Clinic in Kings Norton.In September, the city council issued a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to protect patients and staff from chanting, graphic pictures and being blocked from entering the clinic.Vaughan-Spruce is challenging the validity of the PSPO, arguing the local authority has exceeded its powers.Read more: Calls to strip minister of abortion role after she opposed legislation in Northern IrelandA pro-life group is taking legal action against Birmingham City Council. (Getty)Vaughan-Spruce, who the Christian Legal Centre is supporting, said: \u201cThrough this action I am not asking for anyone to agree with what 40 Days believes; others have the right to disagree.\u201cHowever, I am asking for justice to be upheld despite our differences in belief.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe believe it is totally disproportionate and unnecessary to ban prayer connected to abortion in an area where a Catholic Church is, as well as banning the use of the words \u2018baby\u2019 or \u2018mum\u2019 in any text or imagery.\u2019\u201dVaughan-Spruce\u2019s lawyers will ask The High Court to declare the PSPO \u201cunlawful, unjustified and an interference with Miss Vaughan-Spruce\u2019s and other pro-lifers\u2019 rights\" under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).Read more: Abortion buffer zone \u2018victory\u2019: the 10-year battle to protect the rights of womenBut locals living near Robert Clinic said there were \u201csad and frustrated\u201d after pro-lifers began to protest there again despite the buffer zone.Resident Liz Bates told the Birmingham Mail: \"We are concerned that the increased prominence of their protest, with signs, will prove to be a flash point and bring more tension to our neighbourhood.\"The protest caused regular disputes and arguments outside the clinic, this is not going to be any different. We are calling on the council to extend the Buffer Zone further as this is causing distress and tension.\"Police and local authorities can apply for buffer zones to be set up if they receive complaints, but these zones can be contested in court.Pro-abortion protesters during a counter-protest on abortion rights at Parliament Square. (Getty)Last month, MPs supported proposals to introduce buffer zones around abortion clinics and hospitals in England and Wales.The House of Commons voted 297 to 110, majority 187, in favour of an amendment to the Public Order Bill in a bid to offer greater protection to women by preventing protesters from gathering.The move, pushed by a cross-party group of MPs, would introduce buffer zones around abortion clinics and hospitals where it would be an offence to interfere, intimidate or harass women accessing or people providing abortion services.Those convicted could face up to six months in jail for a first offence or two years for further offences.A buffer zone would apply to an area which is within 150 metres from any part of an abortion clinic or access point to any building or site that contains an abortion clinic.Labour MP Stella Creasy, who proposed the new legislation, said the zones would protect women.She said: \u201cIt does not stop free speech on abortion. It does not stop people protesting.\u201cIt simply says you shouldn\u2019t have the right to do this in the face of somebody \u2013 and very often these people are right up in front of people.\u201d View comments Recommended StoriesYahoo SportsNFL free agency good, bad and ugly: How has your favorite team done so far?Which teams should be most excited after a week of NFL free agency?1d agoYahoo SportsPass or Fail: Houston Texans show off new road uniforms after Reddit leakTexans CEO and Chairman Cal McNair took to Reddit to show off one of the team's new uniform combinations in response to a leak.16h agoYahoo FinanceThe CEO of Warren Buffett's favorite oil company thinks its stock is 'very undervalued'Occidental Petroleum's CEO said the company will focus on paying off debt for the next couple of years as it puts a pause on aggressive share buybacks.3h agoYahoo SportsMarch Madness: Ranking the NCAA men's tournament teams from 1 to 68UConn is the favorite, but there are at least eight others who are legit contenders to cut down the nets in April.2h agoYahoo SportsTimberwolves star Anthony Edwards throws down ridiculous dunk of the year over John Collins in win vs. JazzJohn Collins got put on a wild poster on Monday night, and had to leave the game due to a head injury.13h agoYahoo SportsBaker Mayfield gets called 'a 10 on the pr--- scale' by Bucs GM, then thanks him: 'I'll take that'Baker took it as a compliment, even though it didn't really sound like one.6d agoYahoo Sports2024 Fantasy Baseball: Jackson Holliday leads 5 key draft sleepers from the infieldDalton Del Don examines potential draft values with the upside to make a difference in fantasy baseball leagues.1d agoYahoo FinanceFed's inflation fight will affect housing supply for decades, says Redfin CEOThe housing market is showing signs of a recovery, but Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman warns higher rates will affect the housing sector for decades.2d agoYahoo SportsNearing a loaded 2024 NFL Draft, Justin Fields and the 2021 QB class remind us the position is a crapshootWhy Fields wasn\u2019t scooped by other teams largely centers on his one year of rookie contract control, which features a fifth-year option that will be set at $25.6 million.2d agoYahoo SportsAaron Rodgers says 'Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy' in wake of report he believed in conspiracy theoryRodgers' statement comes a day after a CNN story detailing comments Rodgers made about the shooting in 2013.5d agoYahoo SportsNL East season preview: What's in store for the Braves, Phillies, Mets, Marlins and Nationals in 2024?The Braves are aiming for a seventh straight division title.
