Here\u2019s a handy reference of facts when discussing with friends and family at the dinner table.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tACLU\n\n\n\nShare This Page\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 23, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s shameful overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, voters overwhelmingly showed up and showed out to protect reproductive freedom during the midterm elections. With the holiday season fast approaching, abortion is likely to come up in conversations about the news \u2014 including among friends and family.\nHere, we share a handy reference guide on this timely issue \u2014 full of the quick, crucial facts on abortion rights you\u2019ll want to be equipped with if it comes up at your dinner table.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT:\nThe Facts \n\n\nAbortion is overwhelmingly safe.\nThe right to abortion is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans.\nAbortion is common. One in four women who are able to get pregnant will have an abortion at some point.\nAbortion is essential health care, a constitutional right, and a human right.\n\nAbortion should be accessible to anyone who needs it. Period.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT:\nWhat Forced Pregnancy Is and Isn\u2019t \n\n\nWhen it comes to discussing abortion access, the focus should remain centered on the people who need, or will need, this critical care \u2014 and the direct harm forced pregnancy places on lives.\nDespite how anti-abortion politicians may frame it, forced pregnancy is not some political talking point: Forced pregnancy is taking away a person\u2019s constitutional and human right to control their body and their future.\nDenying someone abortion care has devastating and lasting consequences for the pregnant person \u2014 it can jeopardize their health, economic well-being and ability to determine their own future, for not only themselves but their family.\n\nForced Pregnancy laws include:\n\nAll bans on abortion.\nMedically unnecessary restrictions designed to shut down clinics so that people have to travel further to get abortion care.\nCreating medically unnecessary hoops to jump through in order to discourage and block people from getting an abortion.\nLaws that require insurance plans to exclude abortion coverage.\nLaws designed to run out the clock that force people to delay their abortion care.\nMedically unnecessary laws that increase the cost of care but do nothing to increase patient safety.\nDenying people under 18 years of age access to confidential care by requiring the consent of others.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT:\nWho Forced Pregnancy Impacts the Most \n\n\nWhile it has been a legal right for five decades, politicians have long passed laws that push abortion out of reach. The impact of those policies falls disproportionately on those struggling financially; Black, Indigenous, and people of color; undocumented people; young people; and LGBTQ people.\nBlack, Indigenous, and other people of color do not have equal access to health care, from abortion to prenatal care to preventive care. Their concerns are often ignored or not taken seriously by medical providers. They have worse outcomes for COVID-related health issues, higher rates of maternal and infant death, and are more likely to be investigated, prosecuted, and punished for their pregnancy outcomes.\nSome people have the resources to overcome the obstacles imposed by anti-abortion laws, but people with low incomes, young people, and undocumented people are more likely to be forced to continue a pregnancy even if that\u2019s not the outcome they want.\nAbortion access for all means ALL. Restrictions on abortion care directly impact transgender men and nonbinary people \u2014 and we\u2019re fighting to protect the reproductive freedom of everyone who can get pregnant.\n\nAdditional information about forced pregnancy and an overview of the ACLU\u2019s ongoing legal battles fighting abortion bans can be found here:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              End Forced Pregnancy            \n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but the ACLU will never stop fighting for your reproductive rights.\n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT:\nThe Landscape of Abortion Access \n\n\nWithin a week of the Dobbs decision, several states banned abortion entirely or at the earliest stages of pregnancy and, by design, abortion was inaccessible in a handful of states because of the uncertainty left by conflicting abortion restrictions.\nAbortion rights earned resounding victories across every state where it was on the ballot. Kansas, Kentucky and Montana voters successfully voted against anti-abortion ballot initiatives. And California, Michigan, and Vermont voters triumphantly protected abortion access by voting affirmatively on their ballot measures.\nAbout 13 states currently have full bans or severe restrictions to abortion access in effect, and about 11 other states have attempted to implement abortion bans which have been temporarily blocked by federal and state courts.\nThe same states that are banning abortion also have some of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country, and the consequences will fall hardest on Black women and other people of color. Already, Black women are three times more likely than white women to die during childbirth or shortly thereafter.\nAbortion isn\u2019t the only right at stake: the same extremists seeking to ban abortion are also coming for our rights to access birth control, gender-affirming health care, marriage equality, and the right to vote.\n\nListen to our At Liberty podcast for an in-depth analysis of where abortion rights stand after the midterms.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Abortion Rights Won the Midterms, Now What?            \n\n\nThe midterms gave us a sense of where voters stand on abortion access. So, what comes next following the many reproductive rights victories?\n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT:\nAbortion at the Supreme Court\r\n\u00a0\t\n\nThe Mississippi case: Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\nThe state of Mississippi asked the court to expressly overturn Roe v. Wade and take away the federal constitutional right to abortion. Full stop. The case was argued by the Center for Reproductive Rights before the Supreme Court on Dec. 1, and decided on June 24, 2022. The decision shamefully overturned Roe, and had an immediate, far-reaching, and devastating effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization            \n\n\nThe case was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights \u00a0in March 2018 on behalf of Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u2014the last remaining...\n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\nThe Georgia case: Sistersong v. Georgia\nOn November 15th, in a case brought by the ACLU, the Superior Court of Fulton County struck down Georgia\u2019s ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, allowing health care providers in the state to once again provide essential abortion and miscarriage care to Georgians beyond the earliest weeks in pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              SisterSong v. State of Georgia            \n\n\nThe case was filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County on June 26 by Georgia physicians, reproductive health care providers, and advocates...\n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT:\nThe Future of Abortion Rights\r\n\u00a0\t\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs was an unprecedented attack on women\u2019s rights and reproductive freedom, but we\u2019ll continue to fight for abortion access and challenge abortion bans wherever we can \u2014 and you can, too.\nVoters in Michigan, Kentucky, Vermont, California, and across the country have demonstrated they will protect reproductive freedom and stand up for the ability to access essential abortion care in overwhelming numbers. In Michigan, voters passed one of the most comprehensive constitutional amendments that will preserve the right to reproductive freedom for generations to come.\nHere are six ways you can continue the fight for abortion rights no matter where you live.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Six Ways You Can Join the Fight for Abortion Rights            \n\n\nThis is a perilous moment for our rights, but there are still ways to take action to support and protect abortion rights.\n\n\n\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\n\nThrough litigation, advocacy, and people power, we must continue fighting for abortion in the courts, in statehouses, and at ballot boxes across the country. The courts have shown us that they won\u2019t save us from cruel political attacks on our bodily autonomy. But we have a message for them: Politicians don\u2019t get the final say, we do. Together, we can and will take back our right to abortion and ensure every person can get the care they need, no matter where they live, how much money they have, or who they are.
