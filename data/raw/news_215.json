Here\u2019s Where The Fight Could Head Next.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nBy Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux\nFiled under Supreme Court\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPublished Jun. 29, 2020\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOn Monday morning, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s liberals yet again to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that could have left the state with a single clinic.\nThis case was one of the most-watched items on the docket this term for a reason. It was the first ruling on abortion since President Trump appointed two new justices to the court, which meant abortion-rights opponents were optimistic that a new conservative majority might be willing to undo past decisions on abortion rights \u2014 even though the Louisiana law was basically identical to a Texas restriction that was struck down by the court in 2016. The laws banned doctors from providing abortions unless they had admitting privileges at a local hospital.\n[Related: The Supreme Court Put DACA\u2019s Fate In The Hands Of Voters]\nIt turned out this was a bad bet. Roberts ultimately wasn\u2019t willing to backtrack on what the court had so recently decided. \u201cThe Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons,\u201d he wrote in a separate opinion from the majority. \u201cTherefore Louisiana\u2019s law cannot stand under our precedents.\u201d\nBut this could turn out to be only a temporary setback for anti-abortion activists. Roberts made it clear that he still thinks the 2016 ruling was incorrect. This means abortion rights will likely be back on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket soon, and it\u2019s very possible that in a future case, Roberts will be willing to uphold other restrictions that could severely limit access to the procedure.\nAs the map below shows, states have passed plenty of different types of restrictions already.\n\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s ruling means that the center of gravity in the abortion debate will likely shift away from requirements placed on clinics \u2014 particularly those that are similar to the ones struck down in Texas and Louisiana. According to the Guttmacher institute, a research organization that supports legal abortion, 14 states, including Louisiana and Texas, have passed admitting-privileges restrictions since 2011. The Supreme Court striking those laws down is a significant victory for abortion-rights supporters, because those types of restrictions were very onerous for doctors to comply with. A ruling in favor of Louisiana in this case would have almost certainly made it even harder to get an abortion in the state \u2014 and perhaps also in other parts of the country.\nBut as you can see in the chart above, there are still hundreds of other laws that limit abortion rights on the books. And a few kinds of laws that several Republican-controlled legislatures have recently passed could turn into the next big front in the abortion wars.\n[Related: If The Supreme Court Lets The Electoral College Vote However It Wants, Will Chaos Ensue?]\nOne such category includes bans on a specific second-trimester abortion procedure that involves dilating the patient\u2019s cervix and removing the fetus in pieces (on the chart, these are represented by the blue dots \u2014 the category for restrictions on a certain type of abortion or for specific reasons). And according to Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law and the author of \u201cAbortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present,\u201d anti-abortion advocates could argue that these bans are in line with a Supreme Court case decided in 2007, where the court upheld a federal ban on another commonly used method of second-trimester abortion.\nAnother possibility is that anti-abortion opponents will start to focus on laws that ban abortion solely for specific reasons \u2014 like when the fetus has genetic abnormalities, or if the goal is to ensure a child of a specific sex or race (these are also represented by blue dots on the chart). The Supreme Court sidestepped ruling on one of these bans last year, leaving the possibility that they could return to the court in the future.\n[Related: Here\u2019s Why The Anti-Abortion Movement Is Escalating]\nThere are also many outright bans on abortion at different stages of pregnancy \u2014 including laws like the one passed earlier this month in Tennessee, which would prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion starting around the sixth week of pregnancy.1\nAs I wrote last year, these types of bans are increasingly popular in the anti-abortion movement. But they\u2019re riskier propositions from a legal perspective, because they directly challenge the court\u2019s original precedent in Roe v. Wade \u2014 and they\u2019re also not really in line with most Americans\u2019 views about when abortion should be legal. That is, most Americans think Roe v. Wade should not be reversed, and many think abortion should be legal in the first trimester.\n[Related: Will The Supreme Court Finally Force Trump\u2019s Tax Returns To Be Released?]\nSo another option that could be more palatable \u2014 both to Roberts and the general public \u2014 is a set of restrictions that land closer to the threshold for fetal viability, which is around 22 weeks. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily involve a full-scale reversal of precedent, which Roberts seems reluctant to consider at this point. For instance, in today\u2019s case the court brushed aside anti-abortion advocates\u2019 request to revisit several decades of precedent that allows abortion doctors to sue to protect or expand abortion rights on behalf of their patients, rather than forcing patients themselves to sue.\nIt\u2019s hard to predict which of these restrictions are most likely to end up at the Supreme Court or how quickly that would happen. But Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said that while Roberts\u2019s emphasis on maintaining precedent may prompt anti-abortion advocates to change their strategy, some of these other laws could get a warmer reception from the chief justice. \u201cThere are just so many varieties of restrictions on abortion that the Supreme Court hasn\u2019t definitively weighed in on,\u201d she said. \u201cThis kind of ruling is an invitation to bring them different kinds of restrictions.\u201d\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Biden Is Currently Competitive In Georgia And Texas\n\n\nAll VideosYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe new Tennessee abortion restrictions do not appear on the map above because they have yet to be signed into law.\n \n\n\nAmelia Thomson-DeVeaux is a senior editor and senior reporter for FiveThirtyEight.   @ameliatd\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\nSupreme Court (306 posts)\nAbortion (166)\nAccess To Abortion (46)\nJohn Roberts (36)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGet more FiveThirtyEight\t\t\n\n\n\nStore\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nData\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @FiveThirtyEight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nMasthead\n\n\nPitch FiveThirtyEight\n\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPowered by WordPress VIP \n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\n\n\nInterest-Based Ads\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.
