Wade.\nSince then, voters in Kansas have rejected a ballot measure that would have changed that state\u2019s constitution to let lawmakers tighten restrictions or ban abortions. Kentucky was among a handful of states with abortion referendums on the ballot this fall.\nThe Kentucky Supreme Court has a hearing next week on challenges by the state\u2019s two remaining abortion clinics to the near-total abortion ban approved by lawmakers. The high court ruled this summer that the ban would stay in place while it reviewed the challenges.\nAbortion-related court battles have been frequent and fierce in Kentucky since Republicans took full control of the legislature after the 2016 election. Lawmakers enacted a series of laws adding restrictions and requirements for those seeking to end their pregnancies.\nFervor ran high on both sides during the campaign, as donations poured in, politicians spoke out, volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and advocates accused the opposition of misleading voters.\nThe legislature previously enacted a so-called trigger law banning nearly all abortions if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The only instances when abortions are currently allowed in Kentucky are to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life or to prevent disabling injury. There are no exceptions for rape or incest victims. Pointing to the extremely narrow exceptions, abortion-rights supporters said the legislature\u2019s hardline stand on abortion made constitutional protections necessary.\nAbortion opponents, in pushing for the amendment, said it would have ensured abortion policy comes from the legislature \u2014 where they say it belongs \u2014 and not from the courts.\nExplore more of our Vote 2022 coverage\n\nAnalyzing key midterm races that could decide control of the House\nA look at the closest midterm races that could decide control of the Senate\nCritical gubernatorial campaigns and the contentious issues that could decide them\nHow the Associated Press calls winners on election night\nHow to watch midterm election results with PBS NewsHour\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A volunteer with Protect Kentucky Access circles vote \"no\" on brochures with information on Amendment 2 ahead of a canvassing action in Lexington, Kentucky, on Oct. 1.
