(WOWT) - Signatures in Bellevue are being collected in an attempt to ban abortion in the city and to shut down the outspoken abortion clinic, CARE, that operates there.The driving force behind the cause isn\u2019t from Bellevue, however. He\u2019s from Texas.\u201cFifty-one cities have passed ordinances outlawing abortion within their city limits, and they did so because abortion may be going on elsewhere, but they didn\u2019t want it happening in their own communities,\u201d Mark Lee Dickson tells 6 News.Dickson is the director of the Right to Life organization in East Texas, and the founder of the Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn.Dickson travels from state to state, helping residents craft ordinance proposals to outlaw abortion in their cities, including states where abortion is still legal, like Nebraska.So far in Nebraska, Dickson has helped two small towns: Hayes Center, with a population of fewer than 300 people; and Blue Hill, with a population of less than 900. The towns have passed bans despite having no clinics with abortion access.\u201cPeople started asking, \u2018When are you going to come to this side of Nebraska? When are we going to go after Bellevue?\u2019 \u201dDickson was reached out to by Dr. Pat Castle, the founder of the LIFE Runner organization operating out of the Omaha-metro area \u2014 and a global pro-life organization. Castle, from Papillion, recruited three active, pro-life Bellevue residents to submit the ordinance proposal to the city. The ordinance proposal is a request for a special election, meaning petitioners must gather signatures from 20% of verified Bellevue voters. After that, the issue goes before the City Council. If the council fails to pass it, the issue goes to Bellevue voters in a special election.Abortion advocates say it would be detrimental if the ordinance passes.\u201cIt\u2019d be extremely damaging for the community, and not only that, but it\u2019d be damaging for the whole state,\u201d says Shelley Mann, a representative for the CARE abortion clinic in Bellevue.Last week, Mann told 6 News that since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, and even in the months leading up to it, they have seen an increase in patients.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen four different states\u2019 worth of patients in the last 24 hours, so there\u2019s a lot of people utilizing this location for those services.\u201dAlthough the ordinance proposal \u2014 which varies from city to city \u2014 has passed in 51 cities, only Lubbock, Texas, actually had an abortion clinic.Bellevue would be the second.Dickson said the ordinance passed in Lubbock had exceptions, and Bellevue\u2019s likely would, too.\u201cBy talking about abortion, we\u2019re talking about the intentional ending of an innocent child\u2019s human life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so were not talking about ectopic pregnancies, we\u2019re not talking about the removing of a dead child due to miscarriage, were talking about the intentional killing of a human being made in the image of God.\u201dHe said in cases like these, doctors must prove that the abortion was performed in order to save the life of the mother.\u201cYou know, if this clinic were to have to close in Bellevue, we would definitely look at opening another clinic in Omaha,\u201d Mann said.Copyright 2022 WOWT.
