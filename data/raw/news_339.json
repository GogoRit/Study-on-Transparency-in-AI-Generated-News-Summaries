May our disputes not be held in the streets and may they not be the cause of more infections,\u201d Morawiecki said. \nThe appeal didn\u2019t stop protesters with signs calling for abortion rights from blocking streets and traffic circles in Warsaw, Poland\u2019s capital, and other cities like Krakow and Bialystok for the 12th straight day. \nEarlier Monday, a leader of the protests said the contested court ruling that unleashed public anger must be withdrawn.\nKlementyna Suchanow, leader of the rights organization Women\u2019s Strike, said that more protests will come during the week, despite a ban on public gatherings of more than five people because of the coronavirus pandemic. Poland reported almost 15,780 new cases Monday. \nNationwide protests by hundreds of thousands of people have been held daily since Oct. 22 when a constitutional court barred abortions of fetuses with congenital defects, further narrowing one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation. \nWhen it is published and takes effect, the court ruling will mean that an abortion is only permitted in Poland when a pregnancy threatens the mother\u2019s health or is the result of crime like rape or incest.\n\u201cThe ruling by the so-called Constitutional Tribunal must be withdrawn,\u201d Suchanow said, stressing that the legal status of the court itself is being contested.\nCritics question the independence of the tribunal after the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party put its loyalists in the court shortly after it took power in 2015. Some say the move was a breach of the law. \nSuchanow said that Poland\u2019s abortion law needs liberalization, but admitted it may not be possible under the current conservative government, which has a narrow majority in the lower house of parliament.\nSupport for the ruling party started shrinking even before the abortion ruling. The government\u2019s moves to control the judicial system, a new animal rights law and remarks against LGBT rights by top officials created political divisions and sparked protests.\nSome surveys show most people want the party leader and deputy prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, to step down, especially after he called last week on his supporters to counter the protesters and defend churches against attacks. \nSuchanow said she didn\u2019t blame protesters who at some point last month disturbed Masses or sprayed graffiti on churches, saying leaders of Poland\u2019s influential Catholic Church should hear believers\u2019 critical voice.\nProtests were also planned by health care employees who say their sector is poorly organized and has reached its limit in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A Woman holding a placard takes part in a protest against the ruling by Poland's Constitutional Tribunal that imposes a near-total ban on abortion, in Warsaw, Poland, October 30, 2020.
