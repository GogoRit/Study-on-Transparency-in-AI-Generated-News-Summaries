Given the role of old fetal cell lines in more than half a century of vaccine development\u2014including options for a COVID-19 vaccine\u2014many have been able to reconcile the use of fetal tissue from decades-old abortions while opposing the use of fetal tissue from new abortions for further testing.\nThat\u2019s actually the current position of the Trump administration as well. Last year, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced plans to discontinue research \u201cthat requires new acquisition of fetal tissue from elective abortions,\u201d though it will still allow the use of abortive fetal tissue through older cell lines, of which there is plenty in supply.\nTrump\u2019s treatment included an antibody developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which used a fetal tissue cell line from an abortion in the 1970s to test the efficacy of the drug. Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates also use this cell line.\nThe actual drug cocktail contains two antibodies. The first uses embryonic mouse stem cell lines\u2014not human ones\u2014genetically altered to contain human antibodies from previously recovered patients, a research technique often termed \u201chumanized mice.\u201d The second antibody is produced in hamster cells.\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute, affiliated with the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, deemed it an \u201cethical treatment\u201d because of the composition of the drug. The institute has not advocated against the use of animal stem cells.\nAs far as the testing, \u201cthere are ethically derived cell lines that could be used instead,\u201d said David Prentice, the institute\u2019s vice president and research director. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that they chose to do the tests with the old fetal cell line.\u201d\nBut Lozier, like other religious groups that oppose abortion, sees a distinction between testing a treatment using the old cell lines and using abortions to obtain further fetal tissue for research.Researchers sought fetal tissue from elective abortions dating back to the 1960s, creating cell lines that are still used today, after having been multiplied in a lab and frozen. Two of these older fetal cell lines are used mainly to manufacture vaccines, including those for rubella (in the MMR) and chickenpox. The other two are immortalized cell lines, meaning they will grow continuously. Some of these are used in current COVID-19 vaccine candidates.\nThe Lozier Institute tracks pharmaceutical companies\u2019 use of these abortive cell lines in the development, production, and testing of COVID-19 vaccine options; some use them throughout the development process, and others only in testing.\nPrentice felt that the same reasoning for the moral good of vaccines holds true for the Regeneron treatment the president received.\nThough a growing number of individual Christians refuse vaccines on moral grounds, many institutions, such as the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and the Catholic church, support immunizations while acknowledging their dismaying history. They make the case that the use of older fetal cell lines, while not ideal, is not creating additional harm. As the Catholic church concluded for vaccines: Beneficiaries of the drug are not culpable in the original sin of the abortion.\nIn a previous CT interview, Francis Collins, the director of the NIH and a committed Christian, suggested comparing it to an organ donation after a tragic shooting, saying that the giving of tissue would still be considered \u201ca noble and honorable action\u201d even though we acknowledge an evil was done.\nAn evangelical Protestant, Prentice weighs other ethical questions against arguments to refuse vaccines: \u201cIs there a grave reason to use it (such as preventing death or serious illness)? If yes, is there any alternative?\u201d If not, he says, people should feel free to ethically receive the vaccine or drug in question.\nThe Catholic church wrote that doctors and families may determine it necessary to use vaccines developed using the fetal cell lines to prevent illness and death. It suggested that they also have a duty to oppose the use of the fetal cells and pressure the medical industry to use alternative methods.Prentice offers a similar support. \u201cFuture directions for use of fetal tissue from ongoing abortion will hopefully be to move swiftly to better, modern techniques that do not use fetal tissue from elective abortion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile most pro-life groups remain unenthused about the use of the abortive tissue in the COVID-19 vaccine candidates, as with other vaccines, they have not suggested people to refuse treatments or immunizations that are developed with the cell lines.\nPrentice, who joined the first fetal tissue ethics board formed by a presidential administration, said those who feel the use of abortive fetuses is morally repugnant \u201cshould also feel a duty to advocate for a licitly-produced alternative.\u201d That board includes many others who have publicly expressed pro-life views.\nPer the new direction of the HHS, the board met in July to review present-day research proposals requiring acquisition of fetal tissue. It recommended only one proposal out of 14, though final decisions lie with the HHS. The recommended proposal\u2014approved by two-thirds of the board\u2014planned to use existing tissue, and if successful, wouldn\u2019t require its future use.\nThe criteria the board used included review of the procedures for informed consent, which were not satisfying to some members in a number of cases. Though there are National Institutes of Health procedures in place today, to some, lack of consent tainted the process of obtaining the original fetal cell lines.\nSome also raised issue with an NIH call for research proposals that originally required scientists to use fetal tissue to compare their treatment with alternatives. \u201cThis was an unfortunate specification, as there is neither ethical nor scientific justification for a specific fetal tissue comparator,\u201d said Prentice, suggesting there are other possibilities.\nKathleen Schmainda, a Catholic and a biophysicist at the Medical College of Wisconsin who also served on the ethics board, said that alternatives \u201care proven to be scientifically viable and often scientifically preferable.\u201d\nShe pointed to the list of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in trials that do not use fetal tissue cells as evidence that scientists are preferring not to use them in some cases. For example, several Chinese vaccine candidates use vero monkey cells. The Moderna and Pfizer candidates use no cells in the design or production instead creating the vaccine with a genetic sequencing on computers, though they use fetal cell lines in lab testing.One avenue for ethically obtaining fetal tissue could be the use of banks that maintain fetal tissue from miscarriages, said Schmainda. While some scientists will say they prefer abortive fetal tissue because it is healthier, Schmainda maintains that most miscarriages are due to pregnancy complications, not genetic abnormalities.\nBoard chair Paige Comstock Cunningham, who is also the interim president at Taylor University, could not be reached for comment. The ethics board is dissolved each year. If President Trump is reelected, a new ethics board will assess proposals in coming years.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0CoronavirusDonald TrumpEthicsMedicationMedicine and HealthPro-Life MovementScience\n\nPosted by:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRebecca Randall\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead These NextRelated\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEvangelical Trump Supporters and Critics on Repeat for 2024\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWith Nikki Haley out after Super Tuesday, \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d are once again disappointed with the choices for president.\r\n\t\t\nHarvest Prude\nTrending\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter 140 Years, Alliance University Will Close\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFormerly Nyack College, the school was in bad financial shape for several years.
