The protests were organized by Hoosier Jews for Choice, Indiana NOW, and MADVoters. Devan Ridgway, WTIU News\r\n\tA crowd gathered outside the Monroe County Courthouse Monday night, joining statewide protests of the near-total abortion ban that was set to take effect Tuesday.\n\r\n\tJessica Marchbank is the director of All Options Pregnancy Resource Center, which helps pay people\u2019s abortions expenses, along with other services like The Hoosier Diaper Program.\u00a0\n\r\n\tShe attended Monday\u2019s demonstration and the one last September, when Indiana became the first state to pass a ban with Senate Enrolled Act 1.\n\nRead more:\u00a0Indiana's near total abortion ban was set to take effect Aug. 1. Here's what you need to know\n\r\n\t\u201cBetween September of 2022 and (Monday), I feel like the energy was similar, but maybe even a little bit more, because people have already lived through one week of a ban,\u201d Marchbank said.\n\r\n\tFor the last year, a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality put the ban on hold.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\tImage from September 2022's demonstration in Monroe County. (Devan Ridgway, WTIU News)\u00a0\n\n\r\n\tThe Indiana Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban didn\u2019t violate Indiana\u2019s constitution, which meant it would go into effect August 1st.\n\r\n\tThat is, until the ACLU filed a petition for rehearing petition Monday, which the state court must now address.\n\nLack of abortion access\u00a0\n\r\n\tBut for Marchbank, Indiana\u2019s ban is effectively in place, as Planned Parenthood and other clinics across the state stopped providing abortions.\u00a0\n\nRead more:\u00a0Planned Parenthood halts abortions in Indiana; ban has not yet taken effect\n\r\n\t\u201cSo it's not like they would suddenly be able to start today or tomorrow,\u201d Marchbank said.\u00a0\n\r\n\tHer office was quiet Tuesday morning, receiving no new requests for help to fund abortions, despite the ban still being on hold. The center normally funds 20 abortions per day and communicates with 20 to 40 people.\n\r\n\tShe\u2019s not surprised. Calls dropped off briefly last year when the ban first passed last year but picked up again quickly. The fiscal year 2022 to 2023 saw nearly three times the call volume from the year before.\u00a0\n\r\n\t\u201cThe numbers have definitely dropped way down starting (Monday). That may just be people aren't sure that they can contact us or what their options are.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarchbank prepares diaper orders Tuesday morning for program participants.\u00a0(Devan Ridgway, WTIU News)\u00a0\n\r\n\tBut now All Options won\u2019t be funding anyone to travel into Indiana for abortions, which made up about 10 percent of its clients before, according to Marchbank.\n\r\n\tMarchbank said clients have been more confused and anxious over the last year.\n\r\n\t\u201cEven after we say: \u2018There are clinics available to you, we can help. It's okay.\u2019 There's still kind of the response of, \u2018But I don't know how I'm going to pay for it.\u2019\u00a0\n\r\n\tMarchbank assures clients her organization is ready to help pay. She advises clients not to focus on the sticker price clinics list to them, and for All Options to help, clients need to have an appointment on the books. \u00a0\n\r\n\tShe makes recommendations of clinics available to someone based on their location and gestation period.\n\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s a response of, \u2018But I can't find an appointment anywhere.\u2019 And that has sort of been the common thread for hundreds of people who have contacted us this month.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ACLU of Indiana\u2019s Rehearing Petition\n\r\n\tThat was the point of the ban, Senator Shelli Yoder said, and the exemption if a pregnant person\u2019s serious health or life are at risk leaves too much room for interpretation.\u00a0\n\r\n\t\u201cA bill that is really intended to control people will innately have questions and cause confusion and chaos.\u201d\n\r\n\tThat\u2019s part the ACLU\u2019s rehearing petition.\n\r\n\tIU humans rights and legal expert Shruti Rana said, the court\u2019s ruling protects the right to abortion when \u201cthe pregnant person\u2019s life is at risk or there\u2019s serious health risk.\u201d\n\r\n\tThat\u2019s different from the ban\u2019s language, which said a pregnant person can obtain an abortion \u201cwhere it's necessary to prevent death or serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\n\r\n\t\u201cThose are two different phrases,\u201d Rana said. \u201cIt's unclear how they interact. I would also note that the language that's in the Indiana abortion ban is not a medical term, it's not a legal term.\u201d\n\r\n\tWhich makes it hard for medical and legal professionals to determine what it means.\n\r\n\tRana said the state supreme court can choose to do a few things: deny the petition without addressing its question, address it in the petition hearing and resolve some of the ambiguity, it could pass the ACLU\u2019s question to another court or forum, or it could modify the pause on the ban.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRana discusses the rehearing petition at the Maurer School of Law.\u00a0(Devan Ridgway, WTIU News)\u00a0\n\r\n\tShe said while petitions for rehearing are common, the stakes are high in this case.\u00a0\n\r\n\t\u201cDoctors usually don't wait and let a patient's condition deteriorate. They try to intervene at the first moment,\u201d Rana said. \u201cI think one way of interpreting what we're seeing from the Indiana Supreme Court is that the (it) is uncomfortable with reducing the right to privacy so far, that a woman doesn't have a right to preserve her own life.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\n\tThe rehearing is unlikely to change the outcome of the ban going into effect soon, though IU legal experts say the ban will probably face other challenges.\n\nThe ban can\u2019t take effect until the Supreme Court answers the ACLU\u2019s petition, which could happen at any time.\n\r\n\tAnother suit against SEA 1, claiming the law infringes on the plaintiff\u2019s deeply held religious beliefs, will be held in December.\u00a0\n\r\n\tMarchbank wants people to know her center is still open and serving people.\nTags:Abortion banSupport independent journalism today.
