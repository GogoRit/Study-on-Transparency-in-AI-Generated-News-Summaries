Her husband now spends most of his time with the wife he took after Agatha failed to become pregnant, with whom he\u2019s had several children. Agatha won\u2019t tell me her age, but she will tell me about how it feels not to have a child. \u201cI cannot explain the emptiness. I don\u2019t wish even an enemy to experience what I have gone through.\u201d \nThema* also spent years trying to conceive with her husband. \u201cWhen you get married and don\u2019t get pregnant, people talk,\u201d she says. She knew people in her village were gossiping about her, and saying she must be a bad person. Between the gossip and her own deep sorrow about not being able to conceive, she says the mental anguish was nearly unbearable.\nWhen the world is more threatened by overpopulation than underpopulation, should the sorrow of these women be a public health concern? \nIt's an especially fraught question now\u00a0at the height of the coronavirus pandemic\u2014infertility treatment involves health personnel and supplies that may be needed elsewhere, exposure to others, and for villagers living far from cities, often requires extensive travel. But infertility in LMICs has been a matter of global indifference since long before the birth of the first test tube baby in 1978. \nA commission supported by The Lancet and the Guttmacher Institute estimates that between 49 million and 180 million couples worldwide are affected by infertility; the prevalence has not decreased in 20 years. It affects up to 15% of reproductive-aged couples worldwide, according to a 2010 WHO estimate. And it\u2019s more common in poor countries because of a higher prevalence of untreated STDs and pregnancy-related infections.\nIn 2013, Canadian ethicist Marie-Eve Lemoine and colleagues made the case for fertility as a human right in a paper in the journal Public Health Ethics. Infertility is often blamed on the woman even when it may be the man who is at fault. Lemoine and her colleagues note that in developing countries, women who don\u2019t have children are subject to ostracism and isolation, and suffer economically when their partners leave them. \nThe researchers concluded that accepting infertility in the context of overall population growth is unethical. \u201cIgnoring the needs of the infertile minority,\u201d they write, \u201cis not the appropriate way to control population growth in overpopulated countries.\u201d \nMany of the advocates for more attention to infertility say making medical care available should be part of family planning programs. Mahmoud Fathalla, the former director of HRP (Human Reproduction Programme) a joint reproductive health program of the WHO, World Bank and other institutions, writes, \u201cIf couples are urged to postpone or widely space pregnancies, it is imperative that they should be helped to achieve pregnancy when they so decide, in the more limited time they will have available.\u201d Otherwise they may not be so willing to use contraception in their younger years.\nFinancial support for infertility treatment in LMICs has been almost non-existent. HRP lists only 3 small NGOs on its website. Ask Marie Thoma, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland who studies the epidemiology of infertility, about funding for research and she laughs. The first paper she co-authored was unfunded. The Guttmacher Institute has offered some support, and Thoma says several US government agencies have recently shown some interest.\u00a0\nThe Merck Foundation is one of the few NGOs dedicated to infertility, with a program called \u201cMore than A Mother\u201d in sub-Saharan Africa. The Foundation has several goals: to reduce stigma by educating the public through singing and dancing, training health care providers, and pushing governments to offer access to infertility care. \nRudolph Kantum Adageba, a Ghanaian OB/GYN, runs the clinic where Agatha and Thema sought care. He trained in Russia, India, and the US, then returned to his native Ghana to help women there. Adageba\u2019s clinic in Kumasi is one of several in Ghana. None are supported by the country\u2019s public health sector.\nAdageba says there should be more government support. \u201cLack of fertility care is unfair and discriminatory because infertility is a disease,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a huge problem in Ghana not to have children, especially for the women.\u201d Agaba and Thema\u2019s stories are not unusual. \u201cWomen are stigmatized, at risk of divorce, at risk of being mocked by other women, and they are not treated with respect,\u201d he says.\nBut counting cases is difficult. Maria Thoma\u2019s interest in infertility began when she realized how sparse information is on infertility in LMICs. As a side project while writing up a study on of infertility among women in the US, she looked into what was happening in poorer countries. She found only bits of information. \u201cInfertility is hard to measure,\u201d Thoma says. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting pregnant after a period of time: It\u2019s a non-event.\u201d So she and her colleagues worked out a theoretical way to estimate infertility in LMICs. \nMen present a special problem. Measuring male infertility requires sperm counts, which can be expensive to do and require a certain amount of cooperation by men who might be uncomfortable with the request for a sample. And if they live in a place where infertility is automatically assumed to be the fault of the woman, they may not want to find out. \nAdageba, the OB/GYN in Ghana, is trying to garner more interest in infertility. During his residency training, he noticed there was nothing his hospital could offer to women who had problems such as tubal blocking. Today he runs one of several fertility clinics in Ghana. At his hospital in Kumasi, hundreds of women go through a total of about 500 IVF cycles per year, and $4,000 to $5,000 out-of-pocket\u2014far lower than fees in wealthier countries, but a fortune for many Ghanaians. Although Ghana has a good health insurance system, it doesn\u2019t offer any financial support for fertility treatments. Says Adageba, \u201cPeople save for years. They take out loans, sell personal property.\u201d Both Agatha and Thema took out loans they\u2019re still repaying years later.\nAdageba\u2019s patients tend to wait too long to seek care. \u201cPeople go for prayers, herbalists, pastors,\u201d he says. \u201cThey go to places where the problem cannot be solved, and they waste time and money. Age has caught up with the women.\u201d The current coronavirus pandemic, meanwhile, has curtailed IVF treatments at Adageba\u2019s clinic and at clinics around the world until COVID-19 is no longer a threat. \nAdageba\u2019s patient Thema eventually did get pregnant, and at the age of 43 is a very proud mother. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cThe baby is almost 3 years old.\u201d She\u2019s nearly forgotten the 8-hour long bus trips she took several times to reach the clinic, and the loans her husband took. \nAs of several months ago, Agatha had not gotten pregnant. She had vowed through tears never to give up. But she no longer responds to phone messages, and has not been seen at her treatment center for months. \n\u00a0\n*Not her real name\nFor the latest, most reliable COVID-19 insights from some of the world\u2019s most respected global health experts, see Global Health NOW\u2019s\u00a0COVID-19 Expert Reality Check.\nJoin the tens of thousands of subscribers who rely on Global Health NOW summaries and exclusive articles for the latest public health news.
