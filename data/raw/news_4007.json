Gee, a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of their facility. This would effectively shut down nearly all of the state\u2019s remaining abortion clinics. \nThe Supreme Court struck down a similar law in 2016 and could rule similarly this time, with Chief Justice John Roberts again voting with the liberal wing, as he did when the Court decided to temporarily stay June one year ago; but this is by no means certain. After Trump\u2019s appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, rightwing forces have clearly felt the wind in their sails with a conservative majority, and anti-abortion groups have ramped up their offensive against reproductive rights.\nLast year, nine states passed restrictive abortion bills throughout the south and midwest in the hopes of igniting a relitigation over Roe. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s pending \u201cgag rule\u201d aims to bar federal Title X funding to any clinics providing pro-choice reproductive and contraceptive care. This would jeopardize access to other critical health services, like cancer screenings and HIV tests, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals, people of color, LGBTQ people, and rural patients. \nStruggle From Below Needed To Win\nDespite these intensified attacks, this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Marches were far smaller and fewer as Trump enters his fourth year as president. The Democratic Party has done everything to point movements exclusively toward the ballot box, perpetually deferring an urgently needed fightback that will never come from the party leadership. Mainstream women\u2019s organizations have fallen in line, clinging to defensive legalistic strategies and relying solely on the courts rather than on the power of an organized, militant women\u2019s movement to challenge the right-wing establishment. Such a mass movement first won abortion rights in the 1970s, despite a conservative Supreme Court majority under Republican President Nixon. \nWhile we are not yet seeing the organized women\u2019s movement we need, class struggle in the U.S. is on the rise, offering methods of organized collective struggle that can empower the women\u2019s movement against a universally exploitative system. Many of the recent strikes have been led by women, from #RedForEd to the hotel strikes; the latter featured men and women fighting side by side against sexual harassment on the job, as did #MeToo walkouts amongst tech workers. \nDefend The Right to Choose: Fight for Medicare for All!\nBernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation covers \u201ccomprehensive reproductive, maternity, and newborn care.\u201d By repealing the Hyde Amendment\u2019s ban on federal funding for abortions, it ensures abortion care is free and accessible to all working people. This would be a massive step forward alongside a proposed Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which prohibits states from enacting restrictive abortion laws.  But the Democratic Party establishment has made it clear they have no intention of allowing Medicare for All to pass. Even Elizabeth Warren, under the pressure of the party\u2019s moderate and corporate agenda, has begun to drop her calls for Medicare for All, not mentioning it once during the most recent presidential debate. \nThe National Nurses Union, which has endorsed Sanders and his program, as well as unions which have recently gone on strike over the rising healthcare costs, are also instrumental to leading and organizing a formidable multi-gender movement with working class leadership. Days of mass action and democratic conferences to strategize the way forward can prepare the ground for escalating tactics that can win comprehensive Medicare for All, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, and other massive reforms like the Green New Deal. Such decisive victories would further embolden the women\u2019s and workers\u2019 movements in the U.S. and worldwide to take on the billionaire class\u2019s stranglehold on society, and fight for a socialist future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest articles\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare\n\u201cI Am Buried In Bills\u201d: How Under The US Health System, The Patient Always Loses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare\nHealthcare In Freefall: Biden & Trump Can\u2019t Heal Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomy\nMaxed Out: Why Working People Are Drowning In Credit Card Debt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Predatory Trap Of Payday Loans: How The Banking System Exploits The Working Poor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigrant Justice\nBorder Deal Shows The Crisis Facing Both Democrats & Republicans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Politics\nThe Two-Party System Is Killing Us \u2013 Can We Build An Alternative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagsabortionPaper Issue 60Roe v.
