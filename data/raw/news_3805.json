The girl, who lives with her extended family, wanted to end the pregnancy, which could have endangered her life at such a young age. Under Brazilian law, which allows abortions in cases of rape and when it is necessary to save the pregnant person\u2019s life, she had the right to do so. However, the hospital where she was admitted refused to perform the abortion, alleging it did not have the authority\u00a0to conduct the procedure. Following a judge\u2019s intervention and a 900-mile journey to receive care, the girl finally had the abortion on August 17. \nBut her ordeal didn\u2019t end there.\nFollowing the judge\u2019s ruling, an anti-abortion activist published the girl\u2019s name and the name of the hospital where she would have the procedure, in violation of Brazilian law. Anti-abortion protesters then blocked access to the hospital and harassed and insulted its personnel. When the girl arrived, she had to enter the facility hidden in the trunk of a minivan. She was holding on to two stuffed animals.\nSadly, this girl\u2019s case is far from uncommon in Brazil. Studies estimate that every hour, 4 Brazilian girls aged up to 13 are raped. In most cases, the perpetrator is a relative. Even though they are entitled to a legal abortion, it can be nearly impossible to access one. Only 76 hospitals, in a country of 210 million people, were performing legal abortions in 2019. In June, that number shrunk to 42 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Under international human rights law, denying or delaying abortion access for rape survivors can amount to torture. Brazil has to do better to ensure at least that the restrictive categories of persons allowed legal abortions there can access them, and safely.\nHuman Rights Watch has also documented the devastating consequences of Brazil\u2019s severe abortion restrictions and urged authorities to expand access to safe and legal abortion beyond existing categories: rape, when it is necessary to save the pregnant person\u2019s life, or when the fetus has anencephaly.\nEvery woman and girl should be able to exercise her reproductive rights, live without fear of violence or discrimination, and maintain her health, privacy, and dignity. Brazil\u2019s harsh abortion restrictions and failure to ensure access to it are putting millions of them at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Brazil \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nChildren's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion Sexual Violence and Rape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nEcuador's Uptick in Violence Heightens Risks for Schoolchildren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nFire Deaths in Peruvian Mine Demonstrates the Failings of Sustainability Certification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Became Scared, This Was Their Goal\u201d\n\n\nEfforts to Ban Gender and Sexuality Education in Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 14, 2021\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWhy Do They Want to Make Me Suffer Again?\u201d\n\n\nThe Impact of Abortion Prosecutions in Ecuador \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nEcuador's Uptick in Violence Heightens Risks for Schoolchildren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nFire Deaths in Peruvian Mine Demonstrates the Failings of Sustainability Certification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIsrael Not Complying with World Court Order in Genocide Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
