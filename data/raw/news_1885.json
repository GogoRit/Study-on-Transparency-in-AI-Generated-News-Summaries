Hall had a nonviable pregnancy and had to leave the state in order to terminate, revealing gaps in the state\u2019s miscarriage exception after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nFive Texas women who say they were denied medically necessary abortions are suing the state, seeking to clarify when the procedure is permissible under state law.\nThey are joined in the lawsuit by two OB-GYNs who say \u201cwidespread confusion among the medical community\u201d has left them unable to fully perform their jobs.\nThe lawsuit was announced Tuesday at a press conference where the plaintiffs shared stories of navigating life-threatening pregnancy complications in the largest state in the nation to ban abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe state of Texas says they want to preserve life by banning safe, legal abortion,\u201d said Anna Zargarian, who had to travel to Colorado to get an abortion after her water broke at 19 weeks of pregnancy. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt my life matters less than it did during this situation.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs are not asking the courts to overturn Texas\u2019 abortion bans, but rather to clarify under what circumstances doctors can terminate pregnancies.\n\u201cTexas\u2019s abortion bans can and should be read to ensure that physicians have wide discretion to determine the appropriate course of treatment, including abortion care, for their patients who present with emergent medical conditions \u2014 without being second guessed by the Attorney General, the Texas Medical Board, a prosecutor, or a jury,\u201d the suit says.\nThe lawsuit was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York legal group that has led many of the recent legal fights to protect abortion access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit asks a judge to rule that abortion is permitted in cases in which a pregnant person has a physical condition or pregnancy complication that makes continuing pregnancy unsafe, has a condition that is exacerbated by or cannot be treated during pregnancy, or receives a diagnosis of a fetal condition that is incompatible with life.\nTexas\u2019 intersecting abortion laws allow doctors to terminate pregnancies only to save the life of the pregnant patient, but the lawsuit argues that those statutes are vague and conflicting, leaving doctors unsure of how to safely proceed.\nThere have been several bills filed to widen those exceptions to allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, or pregnancy anomalies that make the fetus incompatible with life, but they are not expected to advance in the Republican-dominated Legislature.\nLauren Hall, one of the plaintiffs named in the suit, was thrilled when she learned she was pregnant. But at her 18-week anatomy scan, she learned that her fetus was developing without a skull, a lethal fetal anomaly known as anencephaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHall\u2019s doctor said they couldn\u2019t help her, she told The Texas Tribune in September. She would have to remain pregnant until she miscarried or delivered a baby that could not survive outside the womb.\nOr, the doctor quietly suggested, Hall and her husband could leave the state.\n\u201cAnd she said, \u2018If you do that, don\u2019t tell anybody why you\u2019re traveling, don\u2019t tell your jobs, don\u2019t tell anyone at the airport,\u2019\u201d Hall told the Tribune. \u201cWhich sounds extreme, but Roe had just been overturned. Everyone was so scared.\u201d\nThis tragic, earth-shattering news, and the unimaginable choice she now faced, sparked a mental health crisis, Hall said. But she worried that telling a health care provider about her situation would invite more questions and, potentially, legal repercussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHall and her husband eventually cobbled together the money to buy last-minute flights to Seattle, where she was able to get an abortion. Hall said many people in her life had no idea how narrow the exceptions in the law were until she experienced it firsthand.\n\u201cThey were just all shocked, like, \u2018Surely, there\u2019s an exception for this,\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t occur to them that a ban would include cases like this.\u201d\nOne of the other plaintiffs, Amanda Zurawski, learned at 17 weeks of pregnancy that she was miscarrying and at a high risk for infection. But the fetus still had a heartbeat and her life wasn\u2019t in danger, so she was sent home until she became septic.\nZurawski, who attended the State of the Union in February as First Lady Jill Biden\u2019s guest, was left physically and emotionally scarred by the delay; one of her fallopian tubes is permanently closed, and she said Tuesday that she\u2019s terrified as she resumes in vitro fertilization treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe barbaric restrictions our lawmakers have passed are having real-life implications on real people,\u201d she said during the press conference on the north lawn of the Texas state Capitol. \u201cThe people in the building behind me have the power to fix this, yet they\u2019ve done nothing. In fact, they\u2019re currently trying to pass even more restrictive measures.\u201d\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights said Tuesday that it is continuing to look for other avenues to challenge state-level abortion bans in court, while advocating for federal abortion protections.\nThe group unsuccessfully challenged Texas\u2019 Senate Bill 8, which in 2021 banned abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, and argued on behalf of Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization in the case that overturned Roe v. Wade last summer.\nThis lawsuit, however, represents the first case brought by people who have had their pregnancy care directly impacted by new, post-Roe abortion laws, said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese women \u2026 represent only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Northup said. \u201cThis is the first lawsuit in the nation, but tragically it is unlikely to be the last.\u201d\nDisclosure: The New York Times has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
