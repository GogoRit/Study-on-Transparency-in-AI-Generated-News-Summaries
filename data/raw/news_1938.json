left, a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming's new law banning most abortions, hugs her attorney after Ninth District Court Judge Melissa Owens issued a temporary of the law Wednesday, March 22, 2023 in Jackson, Wyoming.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is legal again in Wyoming, just days after a near-total ban went into effect.About 50 people, mostly women, filled Judge Melissa Owens\u2019 Ninth District Court Wednesday afternoon.After a nearly four-hour hearing, Owens issued a temporary restraining order on the recent ban, known as the Life is a Human Right act, saying lawmakers violated the separation of powers when they tried to define abortion as \u201cnot health care.\u201d\u201cThe state cannot legislate away a constitutional right,\u201d Owens said in her decision.It\u2019s the second time a ban passed by the legislature has been held up in the courts, and the second time Owens has issued a temporary block.One of the plaintiffs, local OB-GYN Giovannina Anthony, breathed a sigh of relief when the judge announced her decision. Anthony, who is one of the only providers in the state, said she had to cancel six appointments with abortion patients in the last few days, and now she can reschedule them.\u201cI\u2019m so relieved to be able to continue providing our care,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cIt is a great day for women\u2019s rights at least temporarily in the state of Wyoming.\u201dNot everyone who attended the Wednesday hearing was in support of Owens\u2019 decision.David Bott, a local reverend at the Redeemer Lutheran Church, said he was \u201cmiserable\u201d after the ban was put on hold.\u201cThe unborn are in peril once again,\u201d he said.Persistent legal challengesThe GOP-led legislature passed the Life is a Human Right act in early March in order to address some of the questions about the state\u2019s previous abortion ban, which was challenged in the courts last year.The new law bans all abortions, expect in instances of rape, incest or dire risks to the pregnant patient\u2019s life. And providers can be charged with a felony for giving an abortion in Wyoming, meaning up to five years in prison, a fine of $20,000 or both.Republican Governor Mark Gordon let the new ban pass without his signature on Friday, saying in a letter that he\u2019d prefer to see a constitution amendment, rather than passing laws only to be challenged in the courts.\u201cI understand the Legislature\u2019s effort to improve Wyoming\u2019s pro-life legal framework and preemptively clarify some of these legal questions,\u201d Gordon wrote. \u201cHowever, I am nonetheless concerned that, in practice, this bill would instead complicate and delay the resolution of these central and foundational constitutional questions\u2026\u201dA group of abortion supporters \u2014 including Anthony and local nurse Danielle Johnson \u2014 also filed a legal challenge late last week, requesting a temporary hold on the ban as the case makes it way through the court.The situation mirrors what happened in summer of 2022, when Wyoming\u2019s trigger ban went into effect and the same group sued to block it. Since then, that ban has been in legal limbo, until Sunday when it was voided by the new law.The debate over health careIt\u2019s written in the state constitution that Wyomingites have the right to make health care decisions. The key question in this case: does abortion qualify as health care?The plaintiffs argued this is not for state lawmakers to decide.\u201cFor 200 years, courts have interpreted constitutions, not legislatures,\u201d said John Robinson, one of their lawyers.At the end of initial arguments, Owens said she was \u201cstill hung up on abortion not being health care.\u201d\u201cAn abortion can only be performed by a licensed medical professional,\u201d Owens said. \u201cSo what authority does the legislature have to declare that abortion is not healthcare when our laws only allow a licensed medical professional to administer one?\u201dThe defense lawyer with the Wyoming Attorney General\u2019s office, Jay Jerde, argued that lawmakers have the ability to decide what\u2019s available and what\u2019s not in terms of health care.\u201cThe intentional killing of an unborn child can not be considered to be health care \u2014 it just can\u2019t,\u201d Jerde told the judge. \u201cThe discussion has to be held in terms of both pregnant women and the unborn child. They both have constitutional rights.\u201dThe plaintiffs argued the law discriminates on the basis of sex and doesn\u2019t offer equal protection to women. According to Robinson, women aren\u2019t just \u201cvessels\u201d from the moment of conception until childbirth.\u201cThey\u2019re individuals,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re citizens. They have inalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These individuals don\u2019t give up those rights from the moment of conception.\u201dJerde, on the other hand, told the judge there\u2019s no equal protection argument to be made in this case.\u201cWhen it comes to pregnancy and abortion, men and women are not similarly situated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dPublic reaction to the blockFew people at Wednesday\u2019s hearing vocally supported the abortion ban. Bott, with the local Lutheran church, said that he wasn\u2019t surprised to be in the minority.\u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a God-fearing, bible-believing Christian, and Teton County is not very amenable to traditional Christianity.\u201dMidway through the hearing, he said he was praying for Owens to deny the plaintiffs.Marti Halverson, who leads the advocacy group Wyoming Right to Life, also attended and said she was supportive of the ban.A few local elected officials were present, including Jackson Town Councilor Jessica Sell Chambers and Teton County Board of Commissioners Vice Chair Natalia Macker.Chambers said she teared up with relief when the decision came down, but she highlighted that the fight is far from over.\u201cI\u2019m just putting my faith in the courts at this point to really get us an answer to this question that is forever looming, especially in our state,\u201d Sell Chambers said.Judge Owens said the block on the abortion ban is effective immediately, and it\u2019ll hold until she takes further action in future hearings.Gordon also signed another law last week which bans abortion pills. That law is slated to go into effect in July, when plaintiffs plan to request another emergency block.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nPolitics & Government\nabortionTeton CountyWyoming CourtsWomen's Health\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanna Merzbach\n\n\n                \n                    Hanna is KHOL's senior reporter and managing editor.
