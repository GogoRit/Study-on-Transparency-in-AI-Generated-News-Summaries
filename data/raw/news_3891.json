It aims to raise awareness about the historical and socio-economic barriers faced by people accessing sexual and reproductive care. We spoke to Annabel about the work of the collective and its plans for the coming year.\nAs the founder of Decolonising Contraception, could you tell us how it came into being?\nI\u2019m a community sexual and reproductive health registrar and, while I was training, I felt there was an absence of discussion about how present racial inequalities and cultural and historical factors are\u00a0in the day-to-day work we do. I also noticed mistrust of medical professionals, which we\u2019ve seen rear its head throughout COVID-19.\nIn June 2018, I wrote an article for gal-dem magazine (How reproductive medicine has been used to oppress people of colour) and I spoke to colleagues in sexual health about what we could do. We ran an event on the subject of decolonising contraception in for Black History Month in 2018. That was well-attended, so we ran another four events that year, on things like, \u2018Patriarchy and the pill\u2019, \u2018Sexual health and taboo in the south Asian community\u2019, and from there, things really spiralled.\nWe\u2019ve grown into a collective of sex educators, clinicians, campaigners, journalists, researchers and community organisers. Breaking silence is key, but we also felt like we needed to do more work with communities. The manifesto (Sexfesto) on our website sets out what we\u2019re all about. This year, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of policy and consultation work and not as much community work as we would like to. We\u2019ve recently had some funding confirmed for the next 12 months, so we\u2019re feeling a bit liberated! Hopefully it will allow us to do exactly what we want to do, rather than just what people ask of us.\nHow do you describe the issues you\u2019re tackling to someone who is new to it?\nFirst, I would ask, \u2018Have you ever struggled to access a service or have you ever encountered a health professional and felt they were judging you?\u2019 If I\u2019m talking to somebody who is living as a minoritised, marginalised person, I would add, \u2018Do you feel that you have to be more secretive about things, or have you ever felt that your experiences aren\u2019t quite the same as the white population around you; or that your experiences are not spoken to?\u2019\nThere\u2019s this thing I call \u2018sexy\u2019 sexual health. Everyone is really happy talking about sexy sexual health! A programme might show people who are having lots of sex, and it\u2019s fun and edgy, and they can address the fact that this person might now have a sexually transmitted infection, because they had this really raunchy night. But nobody wants to talk about the \u2018unsexy\u2019 sexual health, which is the majority of sexual health that we see in clinical settings.\n\nFind out more in our About HIV pages\nFor the majority of people we see with poor sexual health, sex is not a purely enjoyable experience. It\u2019s complex. It\u2019s not because the sex they are having is not enjoyable, necessarily, but there are other social factors that mean they\u2019re struggling. They might be using a lot of drugs or they might be in a relationship in which they\u2019ve not been able to vocalise what they need, which could be for their partner to wear a condom \u2013 it\u2019s complicated. That unsexy part of sexual health never really gets the time of day.\nFor example, there\u2019s the fact that people don\u2019t feel like they can tell other people that they have herpes. It\u2019s extremely stigmatising, and nobody really talks about the huge mental toll that takes on a lot of people. Most sexual health professionals will tell you that, most weeks, they give someone a diagnosis or they see someone who has herpes who is really mentally struggling.\nUltimately, there\u2019s a reason our sexual health is worse. Nothing anybody else is doing seems to be making much progress, if we\u2019re entirely honest. The statistics have not got any better. We know it\u2019s not because certain demographics are just \u2018risky\u2019. Clearly, for the type of medicine that sexual and reproductive health is, the material substance of people\u2019s lives really matters \u2013 things like safe and secure housing matter in terms of sexual and reproductive health. We\u2019re trying to challenge people to think about the whole picture.\nWhat have been some of your successes so far?\nThis year we\u2019ve had lots of little wins. We published Contraception is about Everyone and got it out there. I think that really made people understand more about where we are at and where we\u2019re travelling. We had a lot of interaction from people sharing it online, and people contacting us and using it.\nWe have been working with BPAS (British Pregnancy Advisory Service) on a policy document that should come out soon, based on a workshop we ran at the start of the year with Black women and a non-binary individual talking about contraceptive use and contraceptive coercion. Honestly, people don\u2019t understand how much of a problem it is. This work really speaks to a lot of things that people are experiencing but feel they can\u2019t say or they haven\u2019t had the space to articulate.\nWe are also working with Bloody Good Period on a project called Decolonising Menstruation. They work on issues around period poverty (being unable to afford sanitary products) and period shame and there is definitely some work to be done on cultural beliefs around menstruation. People sometimes don\u2019t want medical management or even to discuss their periods. The project allows us to unpack those things and signpost people to important information. It also covers stopping periods and the menopause. It\u2019s something that comes up a lot, when I\u2019m online or when I\u2019ve been counselling people about treatment for heavy bleeding or fibroids. Sometimes people don\u2019t want anything to stop their periods, and are trying to understand when it\u2019s okay to have an intervention because your quality of life is not good.\nWhat do you plan to focus on over the next year?\nParticularly with the impact of COVID-19 and clinics closing, there\u2019s a real need for a radical voice on equality and justice in reproductive health. We have to keep challenging policy makers and asking them whether decisions are fair and equitable.\nThis year we have spoken to many health organisations and I feel people increasingly know what we are about. Now there\u2019s the work of translating that, challenging what people are producing and making sure this is feeding into change. It\u2019s not always fun work and people don\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s important, strong work. We\u2019re always in meetings, we\u2019re always showing up, we\u2019re always asking and answering questions. It may not be visible, but it\u2019s actually a large part of what we do.\nThe kind of things people will see more of include the Sex Agenda podcast. We produced one season already and we\u2019re going to do another, alongside a wider Sex Agenda project, with zines and events, to raise awareness of the parts of sexual health that people don\u2019t often get to discuss.\nThis year, we had planned to run a festival, Sex Fest, but we had to postpone it because of COVID-19. Sex Fest is about demystifying, destigmatising, and unpacking sometimes difficult topics in a relaxed environment. It will be fun and informative. The idea was built on imagining a space that I wish had existed for me, a decade ago. People can eat, drink, there\u2019s music, but there are also talks going on, and people can build an agenda around what they want to know.\u00a0I hope that will happen in the latter half of 2021. It\u2019s something I\u2019m committed to doing in person, rather than online. We have done a lot online this year, but this is about bringing people together, particularly queer young people. I think people need Sex Fest now, after all of this time in quarantine, so when it\u2019s safe to do so, we will bring it back.\nFind out more on the Decolonising Contraception website.\nAnnabel also writes a column in gal-dem magazine called Decolonising Healthcare.\nThis eFeature appeared in the December 2020 edition of the Eurobulletin. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this page useful/interesting/informative?\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell us more\n\n\nWhat made it useful/interesting/informative (or not)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you tell us more about yourself?\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m living with HIV\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not living with HIV\n\n\n\nI\u2019m supporting somebody with their health\n\n\n\nMy work relates to HIV\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a healthcare provider\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a student / researcher\n\n\n\nI work for an NGO / charity / community organisation\n\n\n\nI work in government / policy / programming\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nCan you tell us why you visited aidsmap today?\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have any other comments?\n\n\n\n\n      Please don\u2019t include questions or personal details as we are unable to reply.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated topics\n\nReproductive health\nContraception\nSexual health\nActivism & civil society\nEthnic & cultural minorities\nAfrican migrants\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPrint\nSubscribe to emails & news feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our email bulletins.\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nMore news\n\n\n\n\nYoung people\n\u201cWe went back to the community and told them it didn\u2019t work\u201d \u2013 lessons  learned from a trial of youth-friendly health services \n\n31 August 2023\n\n\n\n\nInjectable & long-acting HIV treatment\nTop 5 stories on HIV in Africa from IAS 2023\n\n23 August 2023\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights\nCoercive reproductive healthcare practices reported by many women living with HIV\n\n26 July 2023\n\n\n\n\nAccess to healthcare\nWhy do women in Europe cross borders for abortion care?\n\n12 May 2023\n\n\n\n\nVaginal rings & topical PrEP\nDapivirine vaginal ring safe to use in third trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding\n\n21 February 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors\u2019 picks from other sources\n\n\n\n\nImproving HIV care\nIs a new era of HIV and SRH integration dawning in Zimbabwe?\nSuccess of \u2018one-stop-shops\u2019 for sexual and reproductive health and HIV services leads to major national rollout\r\n\n\nBe In The Know\n11 Oct 23\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights\nKenya: Landmark Ruling Exposes Discrimination in Forced Sterilization of HIV-Positive Women\nIn a momentous legal development today, on September 21, 2023, Honorable Justice Mrima delivered a landmark judgment.
