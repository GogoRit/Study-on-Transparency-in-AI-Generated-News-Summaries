District attorneys will now have to decide whether to prosecute Texas doctors and health care workers if they perform an abortion not meant to save the life of the pregnant patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming an abortion in Texas is now a felony punishable by up to life in prison. The new state law, which has only narrow exceptions to save the life of a pregnant person, went into effect in August, two months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The law has forced Texans to seek abortions in other states.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to matter who your county prosecutor is if you live in a place where there\u2019s a state law that has criminalized doctors and nurses and health care providers,\u201d Harris said.\nHarris said the U.S. Department of Justice is working with state attorneys general to ensure Americans have a right to travel, but \u201cnot the one in Texas,\u201d she said, referring to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nAt the fundraiser, Harris endorsed Beto O\u2019Rourke for governor and highlighted for the audience some of the Biden administration\u2019s achievements: distributing pandemic relief; passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which caps drug prices for Medicare recipients; passing a hefty infrastructure bill; and making historic strides to address the climate change crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she also spent a lot of her address discussing the U.S. Supreme Court decision this summer in the Dobbs v. Jackson case, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cThe United States Supreme Court just took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhile extremists \u2014 so-called leaders \u2014 trumpet the rhetoric of freedom, they attack the very foundations of freedom.\u201d\nShe blamed Texas\u2019 elected GOP leaders for removing women\u2019s freedoms, calling them \u201cthe ones passing laws making it difficult for people in the states to vote.\u201d\nHarris added, \u201cOne of those people is the governor of this very state.\u201d Even before the Dobbs decision, she said, Gov. Greg Abbott and other leaders passed some of the \u201cmost radical, most anti-women laws in the country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris warned that overturning Roe was just a first step for Republicans.\n\u201cWhere do we think this is heading?\u201d Harris asked the crowd. \u201cJustice Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud. Contraception is on the line. Marriage equality is on the line. With Republican party leaders in charge, health care is on the line.\u201d\nOne topic noticeably absent from her visit was immigration.\nShortly after Biden took office, he assigned Harris the responsibility of immigration. In June 2021, Harris she traveled to Guatemala and Mexico, a trip she said was an effort to tackle the root causes of illegal immigration. A few weeks after that trip, she visited Border Patrol facilities in El Paso and met with migrant aid groups, but the vice president has not yet visited the Rio Grande Valley, where a large number of border apprehensions are happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictably, Harris\u2019 visit drew barbs from Texas Republicans, including Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, who have criticized the federal government\u2019s stance regarding the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\u201cTexans have been forced to bear the consequences of this Administration\u2019s failure to address the border crisis, including the historic number of illegal crossings as well as the tragic rise in migrant deaths, drug smuggling, fentanyl overdoses, and cartel violence,\u201d Cornyn said in a statement Friday. \u201cUnfortunately, the Administration\u2019s Border Czar hasn\u2019t seen the epicenter of their self-inflicted crisis firsthand, which has overwhelmed our border communities and law enforcement.\u201d\nCornyn\u2019s jab at Harris came after Cruz put pressure on the Biden administration on immigration, threatening Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas with impeachment for \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d at the southern border in a letter to the department Thursday.\nFederal immigration agents have recorded 2.1 million encounters at the Southwest border \u2014 a record number \u2014 in the first 11 months of fiscal year 2022, which ended Sept. 30. That\u2019s a 24% increase from the entire previous fiscal year. Of those, more than half occurred at the Texas-Mexico border, where agents recorded 1.2 million encounters during the first 11 months of fiscal year 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose numbers include repeat border crossings by individuals who made more than one attempt. And those repeat crossings have helped drive the number of encounters higher.\nIn March 2020, the Trump administration invoked an emergency health order known as Title 42, which immigration agents have used to immediately send back to Mexico many people trying to cross the border, including asylum-seekers, without having to file charges and wait on the formal deportation process.\nImmigration agents record a person attempting to cross more than once during the same fiscal year as a new encounter. The latest recidivism rate available shows that it\u2019s at 27%, the highest it\u2019s been since fiscal year 2015.\nReporter Uriel J.
