Cramer Votes to Uphold Sanctity of All Life, Opposes Democrats\u2019 Abortion Bill\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON\r\n\u2013 U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) voted against Democrats\u2019 radical\r\nabortion-on-demand bill. The bill would create nationwide right to abortion,\r\nregardless of the upcoming Supreme Court ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s\r\nHealth Organization. It would also pre-empt pro-life state laws, including\r\nNorth Dakota\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cThe\r\nright to life is our most fundamental right, most often taken for granted each\r\nday when we wake up and enjoy our lives. This extreme measure destroys protections\r\nfor the most vulnerable by usurping states\u2019 rights to protect life. The\r\nsanctity of life is not a political fight, but a fight for humanity itself. It\r\nis unconscionable for Democrats to not only attempt to legislate the\r\nlegalization of abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, but also\r\noverride the will of states and their citizens. I have always promised the people\r\nof North Dakota I would fight for life at all stages. I will always fulfill\r\nthat promise,\u201d said Senator Cramer.In\r\naddition to permitting abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, the bill\r\nmakes every state a late-term abortion state, invalidates laws currently in\r\neffect protecting pain-capable unborn children or protecting babies with\r\nheartbeats, forces states to allow mail-order abortions without an in-person\r\nvisit, prohibits states from protecting babies from discriminatory abortions,\r\ninvalidates laws preventing coerced abortions, and outlaws parental\r\nnotification.Background:Last\r\nweek, Senator Cramer issued\r\na statement emphasizing the implications of the Supreme Court leak and\r\nunderscoring his concern for the legitimacy, confidentiality, and independence of\r\nour highest court.\u201cThe\r\nfar\u00a0left is attempting to bully justices into submission instead of\r\nletting the judicial branch\u00a0perform their duties\u00a0without influence or\r\nbias.\u00a0The final decision has not been released and I will not speculate on\r\nits contents.\u00a0However, the impact of this case cannot be\r\noverstated.\u00a0Each and every life is precious and sacred\u00a0and I will not\r\nshirk away from this conviction,\u201d said Senator Cramer.Senator\r\nCramer\u00a0received\u00a0an\r\nA+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List for his strong legislative record\r\nsupporting pro-life measures. In February, he voted\r\nagainst Abortion On Demand Until Birth Act, which would legalize abortion\r\nthrough all nine months of pregnancy while simultaneously striking down\r\npro-life laws at the state and local level in North Dakota and across the\r\ncountry.Senator\r\nCramer also joined\u00a0Senators\r\nRoger Wicker (R-MS), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), and over 200 members of Congress\r\nin filing an amicus brief supporting the State of Mississippi in\u00a0Dobbs\r\nv. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization,\u00a0urging the U.S. Supreme Court\r\nto\u00a0uphold\u00a0Mississippi\u2019s\r\nlaw protecting life.\r\nIn the 117th\u00a0Congress, Senator Cramer has co-sponsored several\r\npro-life bills including legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of\r\nfertilization, protect unborn babies who may be targeted for abortion because\r\nof their gender or physical condition, and give states the authority to exclude\r\nabortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds. He has\r\nalso pledged to vote against any bill that would undermine the Hyde Amendment,\r\nwhich is a legislative provision barring the use of federal funds to pay for\r\nabortion\u00a0or other abortion-related activities.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Print\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n      \n\n\n\n\n Tweet\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: \nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Previous Article\n              \n\n\n\n                Next Article\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            How Can We Help?\n          \n\n\n\n            About Kevin\n          \n\n\n\n            News\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal\n\nmodal close button\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              How Can We Help?\n            \n\n\n                      Scheduling Requests\n                    \n\n                      Academy Nominations\n                    \n\n                      Help With A Federal Agency\n                    \n\n                      Internships\n                    \n\n                      Tour Requests\n                    \n\n                      Flag Requests\n                    \n\n                      Congratulatory Letters\n                    \n\n                      Vaccination Requirements for Guard Members\n                    \n\n                      Mobile Office Hours\n                    \n\n\n              About Kevin\n            \n\n\n                      Biography\n                    \n\n                      Media Kit\n                    \n\n                      Committee Assignments\n                    \n\n\n              Issues\n            \n\n\n                      Issues\n                    \n\n                      Legislation\n                    \n\n                      2020 Presidential Election Court Cases\n                    \n\n\n              News\n            \n\n\n                      Press\n                    \n\n                      Weekly Town Hall Schedule\n                    \n\n                      Media Kit\n                    \n\n                      Newsletter Archive\n                    \n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n                      Contact Kevin\n                    \n\n                      Newsletter Signup\n                    \n\n                      Offices\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal\n\nmodal close button\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
