The film is being released by First Look Media\u2019s Topic Studios and Magnolia Pictures and opens in virtual theaters nationwide on July 31.\n \n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Intercept          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      media@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Supreme Court Upholds Trans People\u2019s Workplace Protections \u2014 but Trans Lives Remain Under Constant Threat      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Religious Freedom Demands That Women Be Denied Birth Control, Trump Administration Tells Supreme Court      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        ICE\u2019s New York Office Uses a Rigged Algorithm to Keep Virtually All Arrestees in Detention.
