(Courtesy Center for Pregnancy Concerns)Center for Pregnancy Concerns\u2019 Howard St. location expected to open on schedule\n June 11, 2020By Erik Zygmont \n\nFiled Under: Feature, Local News, News, Respect Life\n\n\nThe Howard St. building required major work to serve as a viable location for the Center for Pregnancy Concerns. (Courtesy Center for Pregnancy Concerns)\nThe pro-life Center for Pregnancy Concerns (CPC) will open as planned at 328 N. Howard St. in Baltimore, next door to the city\u2019s Planned Parenthood location, late this summer, according to Gina Ruppert, executive director of CPC.\n\u201cAmazingly, building was not affected by all of the shutdowns,\u201d she said.\nThe lack of traffic in fact simplified the delivery of construction materials and general access to the building, she added.\nIt took close to $1 million and several years of fundraising for the gut-and-rehab project to get to this point, said Ruppert. Local businesses have helped with material donations, such as some lumber, the building\u2019s HVAC system, and lighting, she added.\nRuppert praised the construction crew, which she said has expressed no position on CPC\u2019s mission but has proven hardworking and easy to work with.\nThough CPC is ecumenical, Ruppert herself is a lifetime parishioner of Sacred Heart in Glyndon, and earlier in the spring buried a Jerusalem cross and several holy medals in the building\u2019s newly-poured basement floor.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting really excited,\u201d she said. \u201cThe building\u2019s been a long time coming, but the timing couldn\u2019t be better, with the quarantine and baby boom everyone\u2019s been predicting. We will be timely for helping some women.\u201d\nShe described the building layout as \u201ckind of like a shotgun \u2013 it goes straight back, and it\u2019s narrow.\u201d\nThe first floor will include a waiting area and desk in front, two sonogram rooms, three counseling rooms, and an office, all on the first floor. Due to financial constraints, the upper floors will be stabilized but not utilized.\nThe new location will have three full-time staff: a nurse/manager, a sonographer, and a counselor. Always critical to CPC\u2019s mission, volunteers will play a role here, too.\nGina Ruppert is the executive director of the Center for Pregnancy Concerns. (George P. Matysek/CR Staff)\nMeanwhile, CPC\u2019s location at St. Rita Parish in Dundalk, in service for 13 years, has closed. Ruppert explained that CPC was unable to renew the lease due to a pipe leak, consequent moisture problems, and the prospect of an expensive repair.\nCPC\u2019s Essex location, approximately six miles away from St. Rita and accessible by bus, will serve those women who would go to the latter, Ruppert said.\nShe said the apparently strategic location is a \u201cfirst\u201d for CPC, which is currently celebrating 40 years in existence. While other pro-life centers famously set up shop close to abortion providers, CPC never has, and it didn\u2019t seek out the Howard St. location \u2013 it was offered by pro-life activists.\n\u201cWe accepted it not knowing what we were accepting,\u201d Ruppert said, referring to the cost of the rehab.\nEven with the apparently strategic location, CPC\u2019s primary focus is helping women, not battling the neighbors. COVID-19 has temporarily closed its physical location, but women are still accessing it via its helpline or word of mouth, including by sidewalk counselors outside the Baltimore Planned Parenthood, which is, by extension, outside CPC itself, though the building currently lacks signage.\nSometimes, women consult both organizations as they come to their decision.\n\u201cThey come to us before, they come to us after, and sometimes they come to us during (their visits to Planned Parenthood),\u201d Ruppert said.\nShe noted that chemical abortions \u2013 in which the patient ingests a series of pills that end the young life in utero \u2013 have become more prevalent, accounting for more than 40 percent of abortions before nine weeks.\nIn her column in the second May edition of CPC\u2019s monthly newsletter, Ruppert described a woman who took the first abortion pill of the regimen.\nWhile she \u201cthought the abortion pill was the answer to alleviating her stress and worry,\u201d Ruppert wrote, she instead \u201cfound herself questioning her decision and then in a state of panic.\u201d\nThe woman called the Abortion Pill Rescue hotline, which connected her with a local pro-life doctor, and then with CPC for a sonogram, which determined \u201cby God\u2019s grace, her baby\u2019s heart was still beating,\u201d Ruppert wrote.\nGina Ruppert, center, consults with workers at the CPC\u2019s new Howard St. location. (Courtesy Center for Pregnancy Concerns)\n\u201cCPC was able to assist this mother with an ultrasound, counseling, and encouragement in her brave struggle to choose life.\u201d\nDue to COVID-19, CPC has been able to offer only curbside services or, by appointment, emergency sonograms for \u201cabortion vulnerable\u201d women, Ruppert said.\nThe organization\u2019s 24-hour helpline has nevertheless been busy, and, according to Ruppert, the CPC had assisted approximately 250 women and families seeking diapers, wipes, and other essentials, even making deliveries to women who, due to an ill household member, were under strict quarantine.\nThe Howard St. opening is fast approaching, but that is not CPC\u2019s only urgent project.\n\u201cLocation is important in this instance, but most important is to have a great web presence, because that is where women go for info,\u201d Ruppert said. \u201cWhen you have something strange growing on your elbow, where do you go? Not right to the doctor.\u201d\nAlso see:\nNew head of pro-life outreach takes helm as wall separates two sides of moral divide\nPlanned pro-life pregnancy center in downtown Baltimore gets boost\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nErik Zygmont\n\nA journalist since 2005, Erik wrote for small-town publications in New Hampshire before he left for Germany, where he taught English for two years, starting in 2009. He moved to Baltimore and served as editor of the Baltimore Guide from 2012 to 2015. He then served as a staff writer for Catholic Review until August 2017 when his family made plans to relocate from Maryland. He currently serves as a freelance contributor. \nErik is grateful for the richness of the Catholic faith he has experienced since, owing both to his access as a journalist and the Baltimore Archdiocese being the Premier See.\nView all posts from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest news delivered twice a week via email or text message, sign up to receive our free enewsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| MOST POPULAR |\n\n\n\nWhy the new season of \u2018The Chosen\u2019 will be delayed on streaming\n\n\n\nThree Coptic Orthodox monks murdered in their monastery in South Africa\n\n\n\nDocumentary covers FBI file kept on Archbishop Sheen\n\n\n\nMother Mary Lange awards announced\n\n\n\nMarchers at Maryland March for Life call for defeat of constitutional amendment\n\n\n\n| Latest Local News |\nAndrew Ciofalo, journalism innovator and Catholic Review collaborator, dies at 89Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours reflect on 200 years of serviceNotre Dame Prep mural brings 150-year history, spirit alive\n| Latest World News |\nPapal envoy asks prayers for peace, solidarity with victims of warLa Crosse bishop resigns for health reasons; Detroit auxiliary named successorMemory book: Pope reviews his life and shares dreams for future\n| Catholic Review Radio |\nCatholicReview \u00b7 Catholic Review Radio\nFooterOur Vision\nReal Life.
