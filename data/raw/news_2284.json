The billboard\u2019s message simply reads: \u201cAlive. Human. Unprotected.\u201d, and directs viewers to RoevWade.us, a project of St. Joseph County Right to Life which provides information on the infamous Supreme Court decision.\nVandals spraypainted the billboard with an anti-police acronym \u201cACAB\u201d and another obscure message which appears to read, \u201cKill 200.\u201d\nThis is the third incident of vandalism that has struck St. Joseph County Right to Life in recent months.\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nThe first occurrence was last September, just after the discovery of 2,246 aborted babies\u2019 remains at the home of local abortionist Ulrich Klopfer. In the days following the news, the pro-life group discovered spray paint on four of their bench ads near the local abortion facility. Those ads promoted life-affirming resources such as Abortion Pill Reversal and Women\u2019s Care Center, a local pregnancy help center.\u00a0\nThe second incident was in December, shortly before Christmas. Again, the pro-life group found spray paint on six of their bench ads promoting resources for women in need.\n\nSt. Joseph County Right to Life\n\n\u201cThis is concerning,\u201d said Jackie Appleman, executive director of Right to Life Michiana. \u201cThe vandalism is escalating from simply hiding helpful resources to promoting violence. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t surprising because the abortion movement is intolerant to other views and promotes violence.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cThe vandalism is escalating from simply hiding helpful (pregnancy help) resources to promoting violence\"\nThe vandalism comes amidst tensions over the controversial opening of an unlicensed abortion facility in South Bend. In response to the facility\u2019s opening, pro-life groups have been promoting alternatives to abortion throughout the city. Women\u2019s Care Center, a local pro-life pregnancy help center even opened a new location right across the street from the facility\u2014something which South Bend Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg attempted to stop.\nAs concerned as St. Joseph County Right to Life is about the upswing in tensions, they remain mission-focused.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing the abortion movement does is going to stop us,\u201d says Melanie Garcia, outreach manager for St. Joseph County Right to Life. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to stop us from being out there and educating the public on the value of life and violence of abortion.\u201d\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nSt Joseph County Right to Life\nRight to Life Michiana\nJackie Appleman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Franklin\n\nKatie Franklin is a writer for Heartbeat International.
