But groups that support abortion rights like Planned Parenthood sued. They called the orders unrealistic because forcing a woman to wait weeks or months for an abortion could prevent a woman from getting one at all.The ban was originally blocked by a district judge, allowing abortions to continue while court proceedings played out. The 5th Circuit\u00a0overruled that decision\u00a0on a 2 to 1 vote and allowed the ban to proceed. It is\u00a0expected\u00a0that the U.S. Supreme Court will take the issue up next.The ban is set to expire on April 21st but could legally be extended. Similar legal battles are taking place in Alabama, Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma.Latest in Human Rights2:39Texas judge rules woman can obtain emergency abortion despite banTexas law prohibits abortions in almost all cases but Kate Cox sued after doctors said her baby's condition makes it likely to die in the womb.0:44Texas woman sues to have an abortion after fatal diagnosis of fetusKate Cox is 20 weeks pregnant and says doctors told her continuing the pregnancy also puts her life at risk from complications.New York to offer refuge for people seeking transgender careGov.
