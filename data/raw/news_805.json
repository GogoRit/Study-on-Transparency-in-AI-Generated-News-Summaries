The court granted the preliminary injunction stating that the plaintiffs, Hoosier Jews for Choice and five women, are \u201clikely to prevail on their claims that S.E.A. 1 violates RFRA\u201d (Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act).\u00a0\nThe law, Senate Enrolled Act 1, was also temporarily blocked in September as part of another lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Indiana, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Lawyering Project, and WilmerHale on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center, which claims the abortion ban violates both the Indiana Constitution\u2019s right to privacy and equal privileges protections. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cAbortion is legal in Indiana today. This preliminary injunction acts as a second layer of protection, ensuring the rights of Hoosiers on the grounds of religious freedom,\u201d said Ken Falk, ACLU of Indiana Legal Director. \u201cThis decision represents another crucial victory for abortion access, and we will continue to fight this ban until it is blocked for good.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the ACLU of Indiana lawsuit, although some religions believe that human life begins at conception, this is not an opinion shared by all religions or all religious people. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe plaintiffs represent a wide variety of faiths including, Judaism, Islam, and independent spiritual belief systems. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestore Abortion Access Now\n\n\n \n\nSIGN THE PETITION \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLet's Talk About Abortion, Indiana \nView Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated IssuesReproductive Freedom & Women's Rights\nReligious Liberty\n\n\n\nDocumentspdfAbortion_Ban_RFRA_preliminary_injunction.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related content    \n\n\n \nIndiana\u2019s Abortion Ban: A Violation of Religious FreedomSeptember 8, 2022\n\n \nACLU of Indiana Claims Abortion Ban Violates Indiana\u2019s Religious...September 8, 2022\n\n \nAbortion Access in IndianaJuly 6, 2022\n\n \nChaplain Offices Have No Place in Indiana Public SchoolsFebruary 26, 2024\n\n \nStatement Against SB 50, Chaplains in Public Schools Bill February 1, 2024\n\n \nChaplains in Public and Charter SchoolsJanuary 23, 2024\n\n \nMedicaid Coverage for Pregnancy ServicesJanuary 17, 2024\n\n \nPregnancy AccommodationsJanuary 17, 2024\n\n \nSales Tax Exemption for Feminine Hygiene ProductsJanuary 17, 2024\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch aclu-in.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress\nCareers\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on YouTube\nACLU on Instagram\nACLU on Threads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 ACLU of Indiana\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
