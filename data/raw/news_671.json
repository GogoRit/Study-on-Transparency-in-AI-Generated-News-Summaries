Jen Day of Gretna spoke at a State Capitol rally this spring of opponents of a \u2018trigger\u2019 abortion bill proposed in the State Legislature. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014 After an eight-hour debate Wednesday, the Nebraska Legislature was unable to overcome a filibuster against a bill that would ban abortions in Nebraska if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.\nThe vote to invoke cloture to allow Legislative Bill 933 to advance from first-round debate failed by two votes, 31-15, likely killing the bill\u2019s chances in 2022. Overcoming a filibuster requires 33 votes.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe bill was introduced by State Sens. Joni Albrecht and Mike Flood and had 23 cosponsors.\n  State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston\u00a0(Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\n Pull motion\n\nA rarely used \u201cpull motion\u201d was necessary to bring the bill up for debate by the full Legislature after votes were lacking to advance the bill from the Legislature\u2019s Judiciary Committee.\nAlbrecht said that the measure, called \u201cThe Human Life Protection Act,\u201d was necessary for Nebraska to be ready if the Supreme Court strikes down a woman\u2019s right to abortion.\n \u2018Trigger\u2019 law\n\nThirteen other states, including neighboring Missouri and South Dakota, have enacted so-called \u201ctrigger\u201d laws that would make abortion illegal upon a Supreme Court ruling.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to kill babies in Nebraska anymore. We\u2019re going to take care of them,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cNo one should have the right to kill an unborn child that doesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha (Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\nOpponents of LB 933, led by Omaha Sen. Megan Hunt, called the measure an affront to women\u2019s rights and one that was so poorly drafted that it could outlaw some contraceptives and lead to felony charges against doctors.\n \u2018Deeply flawed\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is deeply flawed legislation,\u201d said Lincoln Sen. Adam Morfeld.\nSpeaking at a noon-hour rally by opponents of LB 933, Dr. Maureen Boyle, an obstetrics and gynecology physician from Omaha, said the proposal could lead to felony charges for doctors who have to perform an abortion to save the life of a mother.\n Faces a felony\n\n\u201cI never, ever want to hesitate to treat a patient because of a risk of a felony,\u201d said Boyle, whose parents were former Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle and Anne Boyle, a longtime member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission.\nMaureen Boyle said she quickly amassed 150 signatures from doctors to an online petition opposing the bill. The Nebraska Medical Association and Nebraska Pharmacists Association also opposed the bill.\nBut Albrecht said all 13 states that have passed trigger bills so far have made it a felony to perform an abortion. She and other supporters said a physician would be charged only they intentionally and knowingly violated the abortion ban.\u00a0\nAlbrecht also said she would work with Omaha Sen. Bob Hilkemann, a retired physician, to consider his amendment, which\u00a0would remove the \u201cfelony\u201d language and require that a violation be reported to the state medical board for disciplinary action.\n  State Sen. John Lowe of Kearney (Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\n \u2018Chicken Little\u2019\n\nKearney Sen. John Lowe called the threat of criminalizing physicians a \u201cChicken Little\u201d argument.\nThe eight-hour debate was often emotional and turned personal at times. Senators told stories about their families, their religious faith, troubled pregnancies and their attempts to adopt.\n\u00a0Voices rose when opponents said that a total ban on abortion could force a 12-year-old victim of incest or a rape victim to carry a baby to term.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your heart?\u201d said Lincoln Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks.\u00a0\n Two doctors do most abortions\n\nFlood pointed out that only four doctors performed abortions in Nebraska during 2021, with two doctors performing four procedures, and two others performing 2,374.\nThe senator said Nebraska is a \u201cpro-life state.\u201d He said that LB 933 would just be the next step following a 2011 bill that he sponsored that banned abortions past the 20th week of pregnancy, unless a woman\u2019s life was in danger.\nHunt said the LB 933 redefines life as beginning at \u201cfertilization.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, she said, it would make it a felony to dispose of fertilized embryos and would ban the use of an IUD, a contraceptive device placed in a woman\u2019s uterus that blocks pregnancy.\n\u00a0Opponents of LB 933 also disputed that Nebraska was a pro-life state, pointing out that a poll of 500 registered voters, released Wednesday by the ACLU of Nebraska, indicated that 55% opposed such a ban, with only 40% supporting it.\n  State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln\u00a0(Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)\n \u2018Sledge hammer\u2019\n\nOpponents of the bill, dressed in pink and carrying signs reading \u201cStop the Bans\u201d and \u201cKeep Abortion Safe & Legal,\u201d filled the Capitol Rotunda during the noontime rally.\n\u201cThis bill takes a sledge hammer to our bodily autonomy,\u201d said Lincoln Sen. Anna Wishart.\nOmaha Sen. John Cavanaugh said passing a law that would be triggered by a Supreme Court ruling was a bad idea. What happens if the court doesn\u2019t strike down Roe v. Wade, or if it\u2019s just a partial repeal, Cavanaugh asked.\nBut Flood said if the Nebraska Legislature doesn\u2019t act and Roe v. Wade is struck down this summer, a special session might be necessary.\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that tracks abortion laws, predicted in a report last year that 26 states would ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is struck down. Those states included Nebraska and all of its surrounding states except Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\u2018Trigger\u2019 abortion bill fails by two votes to overcome eight-hour filibuster\nby Paul Hammel, Nebraska Examiner April 6, 2022\n\u2018Trigger\u2019 abortion bill fails by two votes to overcome eight-hour filibuster\nby Paul Hammel, Nebraska Examiner April 6, 2022\n LINCOLN \u2014 After an eight-hour debate Wednesday, the Nebraska Legislature was unable to overcome a filibuster against a bill that would ban abortions in Nebraska if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe v.
