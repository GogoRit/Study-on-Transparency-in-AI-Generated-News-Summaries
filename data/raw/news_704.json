Uncertainty looms as Oklahoma clinic braces for Texas-style abortion banCarmen Forman\n\u00a0\n|\u00a0OklahomanShow Caption\n\nHide Caption\n\nOK's new abortion laws negatively impact women's health, Planned Parenthood staff sayIf HB 4327 or SB 1503 pass, they would effectively stop most abortions by allowing private citizens to sue anyone who \"aids or abets\" a woman seeking an abortion.Bryan Terry, OklahomanTULSA \u2014 In the days leading up to her abortion, a patient at Planned Parenthood\u00a0searched the internet several times a day to make sure Oklahoma's abortion\u00a0laws hadn't abruptly\u00a0changed, said reproductive health assistant Marie Hoffmann.In the week between making the appointment and coming in for the procedure, the woman was extremely anxious about\u00a0legislation that could drastically and suddenly\u00a0change the state's\u00a0abortion laws, said Hoffmann, who works at the Tulsa Planned Parenthood clinic.Oklahoma is poised to implement a Texas-style abortion ban any day now after the GOP-dominated Legislature gave final passage to a bill Gov. Kevin Stitt is expected to sign. An even more restrictive near-total abortion ban\u00a0is still moving through the Oklahoma Legislature.\"On top of already being anxious enough about having to have an abortion, how much that's going to cost, how she's going to get here and just the anxiety of having an abortion ... then she has to worry about whether or not she is going to be able to keep this appointment,\" Hoffmann said.\u00a0On a recent visit, an air of uncertainty hung in the clinic as\u00a0what happens next at the Oklahoma state Capitol could dictate the future of reproductive health care in the state.\u00a0A week later, the clinic had stopped offering\u00a0the procedure and was rescheduling patients at clinics in some neighboring states in anticipation that Stitt would sign a six-week abortion ban enforced through civil lawsuits.\u00a0A Planned Parenthood location in Oklahoma City previously provided\u00a0abortions, but relied\u00a0on out-of-state doctors flying in\u00a0to perform them. In anticipation that\u00a0state leaders could implement\u00a0restrictive new laws soon, the Oklahoma City clinic\u00a0paused abortion services in recent weeks, and was sending patients to Tulsa\u00a0where there is a local doctor on site.Up until recently, when patients called the Tulsa clinic to make an appointment, Planned Parenthood representatives put them on the schedule, but warned the procedure may not happen if Oklahoma law changes, said nurse practitioner Melissa Wilson.\u00a0\"We've always known that Oklahoma is not the friendliest state when it comes to abortion,\" Wilson said.\u00a0\"We've been kind of fortunate these past few years that these bills that have been passed have been shut down. This year, we've just not been as fortunate.\"Related: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signs near-total abortion ban that will take effect in AugustTexas-style anti-abortion bills advancing in OklahomaThe Legislature on Thursday sent Stitt\u00a0a bill that closely mirrors\u00a0a restrictive anti-abortion law implemented in Texas that could ban most abortions after six weeks.\u00a0Senate Bill 1503 would take effect immediately upon Stitt's signature, which could occur any day. If approved, Oklahoma would be the second state, after Idaho, to copy Texas' restrictive anti-abortion law.\u00a0Still working its way through the Legislature is House Bill 4327,\u00a0a Texas-style\u00a0bill that would halt\u00a0abortions performed at any point in a woman's pregnancy, which goes a step further than the measures that effectively ban\u00a0abortions\u00a0after a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected.If HB\u00a04327 is\u00a0approved,\u00a0Oklahoma's\u00a0Texas-style anti-abortion law would\u00a0be more restrictive than the six-week ban\u00a0that has forced thousands of\u00a0Texans\u00a0to seek out the procedure in neighboring states.Both could\u00a0prove difficult to\u00a0block\u00a0in the courts.\u00a0Because of emergency clauses on the bills, both\u00a0could take effective immediately upon the governor's signature.The sooner the legislation can take effect, the better, said Rep. Wendi Stearman, R-Collinsville.\"We're talking about life, and that is an emergency,\" said Stearman, who\u00a0authored\u00a0HB 4327.If either of the Texas-style abortion bills\u00a0are\u00a0signed into law, they would effectively stop most abortions by allowing private citizens to sue anyone who \"aids or abets\" a woman seeking an abortion, with limited exceptions. Successful plaintiffs could be awarded\u00a0at least $10,000 in damages.Women seeking an abortion could not be sued.\u00a0SB 1503 closely mirrors Texas' Senate Bill 8, including the ban on abortions after a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected. That\u00a0typically occurs around six weeks into a pregnancy, often before a woman knows she is pregnant. The legislation includes an exception\u00a0for women who undergo an abortion due to a medical emergency.Oklahoma currently prohibits\u00a0most abortions after 20 weeks.\u00a0Although many\u00a0anti-abortion laws approved by the GOP-led\u00a0Legislature are challenged in court and never end up taking effect,\u00a0lawsuits may not stop the Texas-style bills even though they flout longstanding\u00a0abortion protections established through\u00a0Roe v. Wade.\u00a0In anticipation that Stitt signs SB 1503, local abortion providers already filed a lawsuit asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to block the measure from taking effect.\u00a0Sen. Nathan Dahm, R-Broken Arrow, who co-authored HB 4327, said the Texas law was an ideal measure to copy because the courts haven't struck it down.\u00a0\"There's precedent for it to immediately go into effect and not be struck down as it goes through the process through the courts, and it will more likely withstand any court challenges,\" he said.The Texas law has been in effect since Sept. 1 and likely hasn't been struck down because\u00a0of its unique\u00a0enforcement structure\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the\u00a0law isn't being enforced by the state, but rather through the threat of civil lawsuits.Abortion law signed Oklahoma Governor Kevin StittGov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill to punish medical providers who perform abortions with up to 10 years in prison or fines of up to $100,000.Addison Kliewer, OklahomanTexas patients find refuge in OklahomaSince September, Oklahoma has become a refuge for Texans seeking an abortion.\u00a0Planned Parenthood officials say\u00a0their clinics in neighboring states saw an 800% increase in Texas patients in the months immediately following the passage of SB 8.In August, Texans made up just 9% of those who received an abortion in Oklahoma. By October, more than half of the women who underwent\u00a0the\u00a0procedure in Oklahoma were from Texas, according to state health data.If Oklahoma enacts even more restrictive abortion laws, some Texans may have to travel as far as Kansas or Colorado for the procedure. Many Oklahomans could be forced to travel out of state for an abortion, as well.\u00a0At the Planned Parenthood clinic in Tulsa, reproductive health specialist Juliana Cicco said the staff is tired after being inundated by Texas patients for more than six months. To accommodate the influx of patients, staff often worked\u00a0at the clinic for hours after it closed for the day.Nevertheless, hearing the stories of patients who spent hours on the road, struggled to take time off work and had to rearrange their schedules and possibly seek out\u00a0child care to\u00a0travel to the Tulsa clinic is what gives\u00a0Cicco the strength and motivation to keep working despite the burnout.\u00a0\"I don't want to see anyone that I love or care about, or just anyone in the state, have to go through what people in Texas have been having to go through,\" she said. \"It's horrible. I can't believe that this is where we're at currently\u00a0that we are forcing people to travel hours and hours and hours to just receive basic health care.\"Republican politicians have expressed frustration\u00a0that Texas' restrictive abortion law\u00a0led to more women seeking the procedure in Oklahoma.\u00a0Stitt recently said a restrictive new abortion law will stop women from crossing state lines for reproductive care. The governor signed into law this month a bill that\u00a0classifies performing an abortion as a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison or $100,000 in fines.\u00a0Abortion providers and reproductive rights groups have challenged the\u00a0law in court.\u00a0\"That\u2019s certainly not our intent to have Texans and people from other states flooding to our state to have abortions,\" Stitt\u00a0said at the bill signing ceremony.\u00a0\"Hopefully, this bill will hurt that.\"Stitt has vowed to sign all anti-abortion bills that advance to his desk.\u00a0As the U.S. Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi, abortion rights supporters and those who oppose the practice are anxiously watching for the court's decision.Like many conservatives, Stitt hopes\u00a0the court reverses longstanding abortion protections and allows states to regulate the practice.\u00a0\"We want it clear that we want to choose life in Oklahoma,\" Stitt said.\u00a0\"We don\u2019t want to allow abortions in the state of Oklahoma.\"\u00a0As new laws loom, patients already seeking abortions in other statesEven before a Texas-style abortion bill advanced to Stitt's desk, the legislation was having a chilling effect on local clinics, said Dr. Joshua Yap, who works at the Tulsa Planned Parenthood facility.\u00a0Because of the uncertainty surrounding when the bills may\u00a0take effect, some patients chose\u00a0to schedule their procedure in other states, racking up additional travel miles and expenses in the process, Yap said.\u00a0In the clinic, staff have felt\u00a0the weight of patients' fears and stresses over the proposed laws, Yap said.\u00a0Yap is one of the only Oklahoma abortion providers who lives in the state. However, if Texas-style abortion bans\u00a0take effect, he plans to regularly fly to Kansas to work there.\u00a0These bills would create a tiered system in which only the women who have the money, resources and means to travel out of state will be able to get an abortion, Yap said. Low-income Oklahomans and minorities will be disproportionately affected by near-total abortion bans, he said.\u00a0Yap said he doesn't think there's anything he could say that would talk Stitt out of approving a Texas-style\u00a0ban.\u00a0\"I would have a message more for patients who are seeking abortions,\" he said. \"Their voices deserve to be heard.\u00a0We feel for them, and their\u00a0sacrifices they have to make and we'll continue to try to make sure they can get the access to care.\"\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
