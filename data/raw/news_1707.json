Joni Albrecht bringing legislation forward again this sessionNebraska lawmakers introduced new anti-abortion legislation Wednesday.By Gina Dvorak and Brian MastrePublished: Jan. 11, 2023 at 12:35 PM CSTShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInLINCOLN, Neb. (WOWT) - One week into the new legislative session, and many senators are picking up where they left off last year: Abortion is back on Nebraska\u2019s legislative agenda.State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston was joined by several Nebraska lawmakers in the capitol rotunda Wednesday morning for a news conference to announce a bill she is introducing in the 108th Legislature that would move Nebraska\u2019s abortion law from prohibiting after 20 weeks to 6 six weeks into the pregnancy.RELATED: Abortion by the numbers in NebraskaMost women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant at that stage. The American Pregnancy Association notes that \u201cWeeks four through seven are when most women discover they are pregnant.\u201d\u201cA six-week abortion ban is an abortion ban,\u201d said State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. \u201cIt effectively bans abortion for everyone. A lot of people don\u2019t even know they are pregnant until after six weeks.\u201dIf passed, it would be one of the most restrictive abortion laws for a state that hasn\u2019t outright banned the procedure.\u201cThat decision belongs to women and their doctors,\u201d said State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. \u201cIt does not belong to politicians.\u201dNEW YEAR, NEW VOTEAlbrecht\u2019s trigger bill banning abortion in Nebraskas failed last year by two votes. Then-Gov. Pete Ricketts said he would call a special session if he knew the vote would pass, but that never happened.6 News asked Albrecht whether she had the 33 votes to get her new legislation passed and prevent a filibuster. Democratic senators blocked a total ban that way last year.\u201cI believe I do,\u201d she said.The difference this year: two votes.With a new legislature, the Republican believes she has a better chance at getting the legislation passed.\u201cWe have 85% of the babies who would be saved with this six-week ban,\u201d she said.But abortion rights supporters say this new bill should be treated and rejected the same as last year\u2019s bill.\u201cThe idea of a six-week bill is preposterous. Most people don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant in the first six weeks,\u201d said Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. \u201cBy the time you find out you\u2019re pregnant, this has the effect of a complete ban, which is what it is.\u201dWHAT\u2019S IN THE NEW BILLThe latest Nebraska abortion bill would ban the procedure once cardiac activity is detected in an embryo \u2014 often around six weeks into a pregnancy.The new bill has no criminal penalties but does propose costing doctors their medical licenses if they perform the procedure past the six-week mark.\u201cThe people of Nebraska are taking an heroic step in recognizing the science \u2014 that the unborn child is human who needs protection,\u201d Dr. Katrina Furth said.The bill also allows for some medical emergency exceptions as well as exceptions for rape and incest; and specifies that the pregnancy has to be inside the uterus, which means such a law wouldn\u2019t interfere with in vitro fertilization.\u201cThere is nothing in this bill that keeps me from providing necessary medical care to a pregnant woman or from terminating a pregnancy in the rare and tragic instance when the mother\u2019s life is at stake,\u201d said Dr. Robert Plambeck, an OB-GYN in Lincoln.Nebraska State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston announced Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2023, that she will be introducing an anti-abortion bill.(Brian Mastre / WOWT)But abortion rights supporters say women need safe, legal, and available services \u2014 and that this bill does the opposite of that.\u201cPeople know pregnancy is complicated. There is no one size fits all solution,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can\u2019t allow lawmakers to pass this one-size-fits-all abortion ban.\u201dAlbrecht\u2019s bill also includes the Nebraska Pregnancy Help Act, establishing an annual $10 million tax credit for donations to pregnancy help organizations \u2014 those that provide free services that \u201chelp women carry their pregnancy to term, encourage and enable parenting or adoption, and promote healthy childbirth,\u201d according to the NFA release.A new anti-abortion bill was the focus of today's actions at the unicameral.Albrecht also released a statewide poll conducted by the Nebraska Family Alliance that shows a majority of Nebraskans support such a bill. But the polling utilizes \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d phrasing, which abortion advocates like Planned Parenthood have called misleading.A similar bill in Iowa was blocked by the state courts about a month ago after lawyers for Planned Parenthood argued that allowing the bill to proceed would circumvent the legislative process, despite the U.S. Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade.But Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska says the majority of Nebraskans actually want abortion services to remain accessible. An ACLU of Nebraska survey released in March supported that statement.\u201cThis egregious bill goes against the will of Nebraskans, a majority of whom want abortion to remain safe and legal, and will have ramifications for generations to come,\u201d said Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska. \u201cWe cannot know a person\u2019s situation \u2014 their health, wellbeing, risks, and futures. Every Nebraskan deserves the right to control their reproductive health and their future. This bill strips them of that right. Politicians should not be making decisions for Nebraska families.\u201dREAD THE NEW BILL\nCopyright 2023 WOWT.
