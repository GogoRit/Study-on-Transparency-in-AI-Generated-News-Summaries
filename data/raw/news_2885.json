With the upcoming Dobbs v. Jackson decision, abortion is constantly in the faces of the post-abortive, reminding them of the preborn child they had a hand in killing. This is extremely difficult for them as many know that their abortion was wrong, and Hawkins and Rowe argue that it our job to help heal their pain, not make them feel worse. \u00a0\n\nRowe asserts that many post-abortive men and women have found themselves in a time of shame and regret after an abortion because they jumped to have an abortion before really thinking about what they were doing. She explains that many of these rash decisions come from a mindset of instant gratification which has been thoroughly engrained in our society and causes us to make choices immediately without taking much time to think before acting.\nTune in today to learn how Chemical Abortion pills are also specifically affecting the post-abortive and how the Pro-Life Generation can help heal those hurt by the violence of abortion!\nClick HERE to listen!\nClick HERE to subscribe to Explicitly Pro-Life. \n\n Post Views: 1,177\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
