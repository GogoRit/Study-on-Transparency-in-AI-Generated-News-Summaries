(Kathryn Ziesig/Jackson Hole News&Guide/pool)\n\n\n\n\n \nWe appreciate you being a member of the WyoFile community. Our work is made possible by dedicated members like you who invest in our reporting - thank you!\n\n\nJACKSON\u2014Two legislators and an anti-abortion group can\u2019t immediately intervene in a suit that asserts a Wyoming abortion ban violates the state constitution, a district judge decided Monday.\nAfter hearing oral arguments, Ninth District Judge Melissa Owens said she needs more time to determine whether the Republican lawmakers and a nonprofit can fully participate in a suit that has so far blocked the state from enacting the abortion ban law.\nOwens heard about 40 minutes of arguments from Peter Modlin, who represented four women and two groups who challenged the Wyoming abortion-ban law, and Denise Harle, representing the legislators and Right to Life of Wyoming.\n\u201cThis is an extremely difficult decision for this court,\u201d Owens said. \u201cI want to take my time in deciding this.\u201d\nShe could issue a decision in a week or two, she said.\nThe challengers to the abortion ban, including Danielle Johnson, Kathleen Dow, Dr. Giovannina Anthony and Dr. Rene Hinkle, sued the state saying the 2022 abortion ban law violated Wyoming\u2019s constitutional guarantee that individuals can make their own health care decisions. The legislators and Right to Life of Wyoming say they should be allowed to argue aspects of the issue that the Wyoming attorney general\u2019s office is not addressing.\n\u201cThey will be free to continue legislating and advocating.\u201dattorney Peter Modlin\nThe legislators \u2014 Reps. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams (R-Cody) and Chip Neiman (R-Hulett) \u2014 were sponsor and co-sponsor of the abortion ban bill respectively.\nRodriguez-Williams is CEO and executive director of the Serenity Pregnancy Resource Center, according to LinkedIn and briefs filed in the case. As a lawmaker, Neiman had the authority to regulate health and safety as part of his office, filings state.\nRight to Life Wyoming should be allowed into the lawsuit because it was the chief lobbyist for the abortion ban law, which \u201crises or falls with this case,\u201d Harle said. Should courts find the law unconstitutional, all the group\u2019s work would be futile, she said.\n\u201cTheir interests may not be adequately represented\u201d by the attorney general\u2019s office, Harle said of her clients. No one wants this case to go up to the Wyoming Supreme Court, a perceived inevitability, \u201con a one-sided record.\u201d\nConcern, not an interest\nBut none of the proposed intervenors established a valid reason for the privileged legal status, said Modlin, one of the attorneys challenging the abortion ban law.\nThe proposed intervenors had a concern, he said, rather than an interest that would be affected by the case\u2019s outcome. Lawmakers can still pass laws, regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, he said. Right to Life of Wyoming, \u201ctheir interest comes down to advocacy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey will be free to continue legislating and advocating,\u201d Modlin said; the case will not impair that.\nFurther, the proposed intervenors have the same objective as the state, Modlin argued, and so should not be allowed to participate directly.\nNinth Judicial District Judge Melissa Owens greets the courtroom Nov. 21, 2022 at the beginning of a hearing on whether an anti-abortion nonprofit and two state lawmakers can intervene in Wyoming\u2019s abortion legal battle. (Kathryn Ziesig/Jackson Hole News&Guide/pool)\n\u201cWhat it really boils down to is because the attorney general did not introduce evidence at the preliminary injunction case, [state attorneys] cannot be trusted to represent proposed intervenors interest,\u201d Modlin said. Disputes over litigation status are not enough to rebut the presumption that the state and the proposed intervenors have the same objective, he said.\nRight to Life of Wyoming and the lawmakers sought to argue points the plaintiffs themselves raised, such as whether a decision to have an abortion is a health care decision protected by the Wyoming Constitution. Harle\u2019s clients believe the rights to make health care decisions \u201cdo not, and never were understood, to create or protect a right to elective abortion in Wyoming,\u201d a brief states.\nHarle asked that if Owens decides the intervenors shouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate as a matter of law, the judge should let them into the case on a permissive basis. In contrast, Modlin said the proposed intervenors can participate by filing amicus briefs. Those are legal papers that aim to help the court decide an issue but are filed by parties who cannot make direct arguments in the courtroom.\n \n\n\nBECOME A WYOFILE MEMBER!\nStories like this are free to read, but not free to produce.

They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\u201d\n\u2015 Methodist Pastor David Barnhart\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nHarvey Reading says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 5, 2022 at 1:23 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAMEN!!\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeorge wilten says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 23, 2022 at 7:23 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember anyone voting for \u201cRight to Life Wyoming\u201d to represent Wyoming residents about anything.

Amicus briefs are specifically designed for them to do present their views without wasting the court\u2019s valuable time. Based on the Wyoming Constitution, the Attorney General is the best spokesman for the state. That individual is responsible for representing the state, independent of whoever holds that office. These individuals should butt out, especially since this law violates the very constitutional amendment that Right to Life advocated a few years ago.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nEd Bales says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 22, 2022 at 11:46 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nNow we get to see if \u201cRule of Law\u201d still exists in Wyoming, and whether the Wyoming Constitution is worth the paper it was written on.

All of my clients believe they made the best choice for themselves at the time.  There is no grief and recrimination.

Neither of them have had a. happy or normal life since. Both have had drug or drinking issues and abnormal relationships with their families. The families in both cases were supportive of the woman to differing degrees. So I can\u2019t say from anything other than that but I know my one of these women was a relative of mine and she is still in a battle to get her life in order. The other woman was my roommate many years ago and last I knew her life was in a down ward spiral. Both have talked about their decision and even though they won\u2019t say they regret it they will say their life has never been the same since. So, I would wonder about the mental health of these women. I know two others who thought of abortion and  then didn\u2019t do it. One was raped and then gave the baby up for adoption the other a native american woman decided to keep her baby even though she faced a lot within her native people. She went on to become a nurse within her community. The one who gave her child up for adoption has never regretted her decision and has gone on to marry and have a family. Both seem to be doing better than the two who chose abortion. But that is just my experience with 4 women put in that situation. I only wish the best for whoever has to make such a decision. It is a huge one that from what I have seen no matter what they choose could affect them for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nVicki LINDNER says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 25, 2022 at 8:48 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nActually, i think there have been studies done on the after effects of abortion on a woman\u2019s psychological health and while some may have regrets most do not.

The decision belongs the individual who has rights and the physicians who treat the patient.  You have no standing.\nKeep your religious beliefs in your home and church.  The majority of men and women are not religious and should not be forced to adhere to your beliefs.  In addition there is a huge wall between religion and government and it is still in tact.
