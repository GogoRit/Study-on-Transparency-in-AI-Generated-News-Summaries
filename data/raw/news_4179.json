Among the starkest expressions of that trend has been Washington\u2019s new alliance with some of the world\u2019s\u00a0worst violators of women\u2019s rights (including Saudi Arabia, Libya, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, among others) to combat a seemingly innocuous bit of medical vocabulary\u2014namely, \u201csexual and reproductive health.\u201d \n\nOne of the signature marks of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been deepening cooperation with authoritarian countries. Among the starkest expressions of that trend has been Washington\u2019s new alliance with some of the world\u2019s\u00a0worst violators of women\u2019s rights (including Saudi Arabia, Libya, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, among others) to combat a seemingly innocuous bit of medical vocabulary\u2014namely, \u201csexual and reproductive health.\u201d\nLast September, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar read a\u00a0statement\u00a0on behalf of this new U.S.-led coalition before the United Nations General Assembly condemning that phrase, and others like it, as \u201cambiguous terms and expressions\u201d that can \u201cundermine the critical role of the family and promote practices, like abortion, in circumstances that do not enjoy international consensus and which can be misinterpreted by U.N. agencies.\u201d Notably, of the 20 other signatories, only two, Brazil and Poland, are consolidated democracies (and even they are\u00a0slipping into authoritarianism).\n \n\n\n\n\nThe concept of sexual and reproductive health and rights emerged in the mid-1990s. Up until then, global health organizations had been working on the Malthusian assumption that population would outgrow the food supply, and they thus focused almost exclusively on family planning as a means of population control. That paradigm eventually drew the ire of women\u2019s rights groups for ignoring the individual needs and desires of women, prompting a shift toward a more expansive definition of reproductive health\u2014one that included things like access to contraception and abortion, maternal health, safe sex, and prevention of female genital mutilation and sexual violence. Today, the World Health Organization defines reproductive health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing in all matters relating to the reproductive system.\u201d\nThe United States is the largest funder of these services, giving between\u00a0$400 million and $600 million annually. Ninety-five percent of that goes directly to implementing partners in recipient countries and, historically, 5 percent has been channeled through the United Nations Population Fund, the U.N.\u2019s sexual and reproductive health agency (which the United States helped create). Like Republican administrations before his, Trump\u2019s Department of State\u00a0discontinued support for the agency, claiming it \u201cparticipates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\u201d It has also proposed drastic cuts to funding for sexual and reproductive health\u00a0for fiscal year 2020. The Trump administration also reinstated and dramatically expanded the Mexico City policy, which opponents refer to as the \u201cglobal gag rule.\u201d The policy prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. funding if they \u201cperform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.\u201d\nGlobal restrictions on abortion have been implemented to varying degrees by conservative administrations from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, but Trump\u2019s cuts to sexual and reproductive health go deeper and are farther-reaching than ever before. Egged on by the religious anti-abortion groups that form a core part of his base, Trump has employed a version of the Mexico City policy that extends not just to the $500 million or so in U.S. funds for family planning, but to all of the United States\u2019 roughly $10 billion in global health assistance. Trump isn\u2019t just going after abortion. He\u2019s going after what conservative religious groups decry as a broader feminist takeover of global health.\nThe results of these policies are already bearing out. In 2018, the HIV/AIDS research nonprofit amfAR conducted a\u00a0survey\u00a0of partners in 45 countries for the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to see how they were responding to U.S. restrictions. The most common response (42 percent) was that organizations provided less information on sexual and reproductive health, which included cuts to pregnancy counseling.\nBut sexual and reproductive health care is about more than just abortions, which themselves can be an important component of reproductive care. Services include HIV testing, cancer screening, and education about child marriage and human trafficking. Trump\u2019s cuts to sexual and reproductive health are affecting all of these services, too.\n\u201cOne of the realities of global health delivery is that you may only have one organization who\u2019s serving huge swathes of the population.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the realities of global health delivery is that you may only have one organization who\u2019s serving huge swathes of the population,\u201d said Jennifer Sherwood, the public policy manager at amfAR. \u201cIf you had a Planned Parenthood affiliate close down, they were certainly not only providing contraception, but they were providing HIV testing, vaccines, mother and child health services, circumcisions, and all sorts of things like that. So if you have a full clinic closure or even a reduction in their ability to do mobile outreach, you are really seeing cuts to all these different kinds of services.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a dangerous step backward for young women and girls, for whom sexual and reproductive health programming is a critical tool to learn not just about family planning, but also about safe pregnancy, sexual violence, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and more. These are things that inevitably lead to women being more socially and economically empowered, a fact that may help explain why the United States was joined in its coalition almost exclusively by states that treat women as second-class citizens and generally resist calls for gender equality. Gender equality is a fundamental principle of sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nThat the United States has planted its flag so firmly in their camp is an ominous sign for the world\u2019s women and girls, who, despite recent progress, continue to face an onslaught of preventable health threats.\nIn the developing world, at least\u00a010 million\u00a0unintended pregnancies occur each year among girls and young women aged 15 to 19 years old, and complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for those in this age group globally. Worldwide, an estimated\u00a015 million\u00a0adolescent girls and women aged 15 to 19 have experienced forced sex at some point in their life. One in six women alive today were married as children. In sub-Saharan Africa, seven in 10\u00a0young women do not have comprehensive knowledge about HIV, yet adolescent girls and young women are among the hardest hit by the disease. They represent 10 percent of the population in that region but 20 percent of all new HIV infections. In 2017, HIV was\u00a0among the top five causes of death\u00a0globally for girls aged 10 to 14 years old.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Filipina health worker speaks to pregnant women on family planning in Navotas City, suburban Manila, on March 3, 2011.\n\nA Filipina health worker speaks to pregnant women on family planning in Navotas City, suburban Manila, on March 3, 2011.\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Steps Up War on Reproductive Rights\n\n\nU.S. diplomats team up with a \u201crogues\u2019 gallery\u201d of conservative states to roll back global reproductive health gains of the past quarter-century.\n\n\n\n        Report    \n|\n\n\n    Colum Lynch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden speaks at a podium in the State Dining Room of the White House.

The Trump administration\u2019s more expansive approach threatens to worsen the spread of that virus. In his recent State of the Union address, Trump\u00a0vowed\u00a0to \u201ceradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade,\u201d a goal shared by the United Nations. But the previous executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, Michel Sidib\u00e9, warned\u00a0last year that \u201cservices for adolescent girls and young women are especially failing to reach those who are falling the furthest behind.\u201d Cuts to sexual and reproductive health programming are likely making things worse.\n\u201cThere is sort of this fracturing of the civil society organizations among those who continue to receive U.S. money versus those who don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThere is sort of this fracturing of the civil society organizations among those who continue to receive U.S. money versus those who don\u2019t,\u201d said Sherwood, although she also noted that this fracturing may be precisely the point for the Trump administration.\u00a0\u201cIts intention is to sever referral networks specifically for abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cBut of course, that\u2019s not how global health works. If you sever the relationship between two organizations in relation to abortion, you\u2019re also separating referral pathways to all those other services that a person might need.\u201d\nAfter Azar\u2019s statement last September, the minister for foreign trade and development of the Netherlands, Sigrid Kaag, issued\u00a0one of her own. This one was signed by 58 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Tunisia, and Australia. It said, \u201cInvesting in comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services \u2026 is necessary to address the needs of women, girls, adolescents, and people in the most marginalized situations who need these the most.\u201d\nThe message from fellow donor countries was clear. They will continue to support sexual and reproductive health and rights, even if the United States and its newly minted coalition of largely authoritarian states do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRikha Sharma Rani is a freelance writer based in the Bay area.\n\n\n\nRead More On\n\n        Donald Trump |\n        Health |\n        Women\u2019s Rights\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Filipina health worker speaks to pregnant women on family planning in Navotas City, suburban Manila, on March 3, 2011.\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Steps Up War on Reproductive Rights\n\n\nU.S. diplomats team up with a \u201crogues\u2019 gallery\u201d of conservative states to roll back global reproductive health gains of the past quarter-century.\n\n\n\n        Report    \n|\n\n\n    Colum Lynch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden speaks at a podium in the State Dining Room of the White House.
