She wrote this commentary for CalMatters.\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a scary time to be pregnant \u2013 especially if you\u2019re incarcerated.\nThat\u2019s because high-density prisons and jails are like Petri dishes for the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the CDC doesn\u2019t identify pregnancy as a high-risk condition for COVID-19, it does urge \u201cextra precautions.\u201d\nMore than enough reason for the California state Senate not to jettison Assembly Bill 732, as it streamlines its bill load to address the pandemic.\n \n \n\nAB 732, authored by Democratic Assemblyman Rob Bonta from Oakland, would establish uniform standards for pregnancy and reproductive health care for state prisons and county jails, codifying regulations mostly in place at state facilities, but not throughout the state\u2019s 121 county jails.\nMany of the regulations for reproductive care in California\u2019s state prisons were adopted after successful lawsuits forced the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to accept standards guaranteed under federal law.\nThe lesson? Provide and pay for reproductive care \u2013 or get sued and pay even more in legal fees.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a CalMatters member today to stay informed, bolster our nonpartisan news and expand knowledge across California.\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMost people have never thought about pregnancy behind bars,\u201d said Minouche Kandel of the ACLU, an AB 732 sponsor.\nBut we should, as national research on prisons found \u201c3.8% of newly admitted women and 0.6% of all women were pregnant\u201d in 2016.\nIn California, more than 5,000 women are held in state prisons and about 9,000 in county jails.\nLorena Garcia Zerme\u00f1o with California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, another AB 732 sponsor, acknowledges that \u201csome county jails are trying to do a better job than others,\u201d but the \u201cquality of reproductive health care shouldn\u2019t be tied to where a person is incarcerated.\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why more than 50 organizations signed on to support AB 732: to require a consistent standard of pregnancy and reproductive care for incarcerated people \u2013 in prisons and county jails.\nSo why is the California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association opposing AB 732?\u00a0\u00a0\nThey claim the bill would create a local mandate, requiring services without funding for \u201cspecific, inflexible and costly prenatal and postpartum care for pregnant county jail inmates.\u201d\nA tried and true, but in this case, irrelevant argument.\nThe U.S. Constitution and legal precedent already require that health care, including reproductive services, be provided in prisons and jails.\nThe real issue is power, not cost.\nToo many sheriffs consider their counties like territories in the Wild West, where their word is law.\nSome provide decent care, others don\u2019t.\nIn 2016, the ACLU published \u201cReproductive Health Behind Bars in California.\u201d It paints a disturbing picture of pregnant people in some county jails being shackled, or not provided timely prenatal care, vitamins and nutrition supplements.\nIn 2018, Candace Steel filed suit against the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office for placing her in isolation while pregnant and then ignoring her screams as she gave birth without medical assistance.\nIn moving the case forward, U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote that the sheriff\u2019s treatment of Steel was \u201ca textbook example of deliberate indifference.\u201d\nThat\u2019s legal shorthand \u201cfor conscious or reckless disregard of the consequences of one\u2019s acts or omissions.\u201d\nWouldn\u2019t it be smarter \u2013 and kinder \u2013 for county sheriffs to ensure basic care for pregnant people \u2013 rather than write big checks to law firms?\nOf course it would \u2013 and it\u2019s time for the sheriffs\u2019 association to end their opposition to AB 732.\nIt\u2019s also time for the state to collect and make public standardized reports on health care quality in county jails \u2013 including reproductive care.\nWithout information, there can be no accountability.\nAs the ACLU learned while developing \u201cReproductive Health Behind Bars in California,\u201d it currently takes time-consuming public records requests to assemble a statewide picture of the quality of health care in California\u2019s local jails.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has laid bare the threadbare nature of our health care system. Despite a common threat and unifying fear, we remain divided into communities of health-care haves and have-nots.\nThe purpose of AB 732 is to safeguard the least among us, to guarantee incarcerated people a minimum standard of pregnancy and reproductive care.\nI\u2019d call that a moral mandate.\n_____\nKate Karpilow is a writer who previously directed the California Center for Research on Women and Families at the Public Health Institute, Kate.Karpilow@comcast.net.
