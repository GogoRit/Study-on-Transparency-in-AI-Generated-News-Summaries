Wade, allowing states to set their own laws regulating abortion procedures. Texas has a \u201ctrigger\u201d law in place that will ban all abortions from the moment of fertilization starting 30 days after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, which is typically issued about a month after the initial opinion.\nBut clinics and abortion funds are ceasing services now because the attorney general of Texas and some anti-abortion activists are arguing that state laws that banned abortion before Roe v. Wade \u2014 that were never repealed \u2014 could now be in effect in Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must pause abortion services at our separate organizations while our legal teams continue to review today\u2019s devastating ruling and how it impacts and triggers existing Texas laws, including total abortion bans,\u201d said Jeffrey Hons, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Texas.\nHe said abortion services at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas and Planned Parenthood South Texas have all ceased.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an advisory Friday warning that some prosecutors could immediately pursue criminal prosecutions based on violations of Texas abortion prohibitions predating Roe v. Wade that the Legislature never repealed.\n\u201cAlthough these statutes were unenforceable while Roe was on the books, they are still Texas law,\u201d Paxton wrote. \u201cUnder these pre-Roe statutes, abortion providers could be criminally liable for providing abortions starting today.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the state\u2019s pre-Roe status, providers and abortion funds have ceased operations in the legal confusion.\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health, the nation\u2019s largest independent abortion provider, said it has temporarily halted abortion services in its four Texas clinics located in Austin, Fort Worth, McAllen and McKinney.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t agree with Paxton about the interpretation of the ban, but to protect our staff and patients from hostile officials in Texas, we have ceased providing abortion care today,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, in a press conference Friday.\nAlamo Women\u2019s Reproductive Health, which provides abortion services in San Antonio, has also stopped providing abortions Friday, said Andrea Gallegos, the clinic\u2019s executive director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion funds, too, have paused operations amid the threat of legal action in Texas. The Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, an abortion fund that provides financial assistance to people seeking abortions, and the Texas Equal Access Fund both said they have stopped funding abortions in Texas due to the state\u2019s pre-Roe status.\n\u201cDue to the uncertainty and risk of what the decision could bring, we are pausing funding today until we have had a chance to understand the decision,\u201d the Texas Equal Access Fund wrote on Twitter.\nTexas first enacted a criminal ban on abortion in 1854. That ban was never repealed, but a 2004 case in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that by passing laws that govern abortions \u2014 such as the availability of abortions for minors and the practices of abortion clinics \u2014 the Texas Legislature repealed its old bans by regulations that implied the ban was no longer in effect.\nStill, Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general for Texas and the architect of Senate Bill 8, which banned abortions in Texas as early as six weeks, argued that the pre-Roe statute is immediately enforceable in Texas except procedures necessary to save the life of the patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, prosecutors did not pursue charges against patients or providers under Texas\u2019 laws because courts would not uphold convictions under Roe, he said. Now, \u201cno such obstacle exists anymore because Roe has been overruled,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe opinion has spooked providers and funds enough to cease abortion services immediately, accelerating the arrival of the post-Roe world in Texas: a world in which people who need abortions must spend time, money and resources to travel outside of the state to obtain services, a monetary privilege many can not afford.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lilith Fund said that because anti-abortion activists are arguing that the laws predating Roe v. Wade could go back into effect, they ceased operations to protect abortion fund staff and volunteers from the risk of arrest even while legal analysis \u201cis still in the early stages.\u201d\n\u201cLilith Fund has been forced to pause direct funding of abortion care while we evaluate the impact of the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme court,\u201d a statement from the Lilith Fund said. \u201cWe are evaluating how we may be able to otherwise assist pregnant Texans, but do not yet have answers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily Berman, an associate professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said it's unclear whether the old bans would be upheld in court.\n\"We are in a gray area with respect to what are sometimes called zombie laws, the pre-Roe holdovers,\" Berman said. \"In some ways, it\u2019s sort of going to be up to local prosecutors to decide if they want to bring cases.\"\nShe said that while prosecutors could decide to wade into such a legal battle, if they simply wait for Texas' \"trigger\" law to take effect, their cases will be on more solid footing.\nTexas\u2019 \u201ctrigger\u201d law won\u2019t go into effect until 30 days after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, which could take about a month to be published. Texas\u2019 law will have narrow exceptions to perform abortions only to save the life of a pregnant patient or prevent \u201csubstantial impairment of major bodily function.\u201d It will criminalize the person who performs the abortion, not the person who undergoes the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half of all states are expected to essentially ban abortion in the coming months.\nSome clinics in neighboring states have also said they have paused abortion services Friday. Planned Parenthood Great Plains said Friday that it has stopped providing abortions in Arkansas.\nIn Texas and other states where abortion procedures will no longer be legally protected, Whole Woman\u2019s Health said it will continue to operate a program that provides financial assistance to patients who need to travel for out-of-state care.\n\u201cWe will do everything we can to help obtain safe, timely, affordable care for those whose rights and access to safe and legal abortion services have been cruelly and unjustly revoked,\u201d Miller said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provider, which largely serves the South and Midwest, said it will continue to operate clinics in Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Alexandria, Virginia; and Charlottesville, Virginia. It will also offer abortion pills by mail to patients in Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico and Virginia. The abortion provider said it is \u201cexploring plans\u201d to expand in-clinic and mail services in additional states where abortion is legally protected.\nHons, of Planned Parenthood South Texas, said he is not aware of any facilities in Texas performing legal abortions today, and he said Planned Parenthood South Texas would not resume abortion services until they have \"clear\" legal counsel to do so.\n\u201cOur ability to do work is on pause,\" Hons said. \"We look forward to resuming every aspect of assistance and support that we can as soon as we know that doing so is compliant with the new legal framework.\"\nJames Barrag\u00e1n contributed reporting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
