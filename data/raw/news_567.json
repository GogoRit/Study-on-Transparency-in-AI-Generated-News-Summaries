Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters\u201cMy body, my choice\u201d, \u201cThe revolution has a uterus\u201d and \u201cYou have blood on your hands\u201d read some of the placards at the protest.Some of the participants on Friday also wore green handkerchiefs around their necks \u2013 the symbol of abortion rights activists in Argentina, where abortion was legalised last month.Thousands also took to the streets in Warsaw and other major cities on Wednesday, and on Thursday several protesters were arrested after entering the perimeter of the constitutional court, which issued the ruling.The verdict means that all abortions in Poland are now banned except in cases of rape and incest, or when the mother\u2019s life or health are considered to be at risk.The ruling found that abortions in cases of foetal abnormalities were incompatible with the constitution.Predominantly Catholic Poland already had one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive laws on abortion. There are fewer than 2,000 legal abortions there every year and women\u2019s groups estimate that an additional 200,000 women abort either illegally or abroad.The government said the ban will halt \u201ceugenic abortions\u201d, referring to the termination of foetuses diagnosed with Down\u2019s syndrome, but human rights groups said it will force women to carry non-viable pregnancies.The ruling first came out in October, but the government had held off on formalising it amid mass protests that quickly adopted broader anti-government slogans.Ludwik Dorn, a commentator writing in the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, said the government probably decided to publish the ruling now in order to ensure that protests \u201cburn out\u201d before more anti-government anger rises over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the vaccine rollout.\u201cNow was the least bad time,\u201d he wrote.Dorn also said the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party could be hoping for divisions between opponents of the ruling \u2013 those who want wider abortion rights and those who support the previous status quo.Explore more on these topicsPolandAbortionEuropeHealthWomennewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Poland to implement near-total ban on abortion imminently27 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Poland delays abortion ban as nationwide protests continue3 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
