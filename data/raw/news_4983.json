Wade Decision Looms, Local Pro-Life Groups Remain Committed\n\nMarch 30, 2022\n\t\t\tBy Melissa Enaje\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA handful of speakers carried the official banner at the front of the sixth annual Gift of Life Walk New York City, March 25.

When drivers stopped at the light, some were either in support or disagreement with the pro-life message, but Pederse met a driver who gave a thumbs up for the cause and shaked her hand. \n(Bottom Right) Dawn Eskew, President & Founder at non-profit Personhood Education NY, sponsored the March 25 walk. Eskew\u2019s background as a chemist and bioethicist only propelled her knowledge as a pro-life advocate whose organization\u2019s mission is to uphold the sanctity of every human life from conception to natural death.\n\nOutspoken pro-life advocate Rev. Clenard Childress from New Calvary Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, was invited to speak about the pro-life cause to walk attendees. His years in ministry date back to the late 1970\u2019s leading his church\u2019s youth department. \n\n\nPraying before a replica of the statue of Our Lady of Fatima at noon, Father Boquet led the Act of Consecration in unison with Pope Francis and clergy around the world, consecrating Ukraine, Russia, and humanity to the Blessed Mother. A group of four men then carried the statue on a platform and processed with her throughout the streets.\n\n\n\n Knights of Columbus member Boris Musich is a frequent attendee at pro-life marches including the Gift of Life walk. The knight from Colon-Msgr. Higgins Council #309 at St. Francis of Assisi Church, Astoria was glad the turnout went well for this event.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLOWER MANHATTAN \u2014 With their two children and a stroller in tow, Ingrid and Elder Castro celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary in an unusual way on March 25 \u2014 marching in a pro-life demonstration through the canyons of Lower Manhattan.\nThe family traveled from Westchester to join more than 100 demonstrators for the sixth annual International Gift of Life Walk, a march and rally that brought together pro-life activists and groups from across the tri-state area. \nFor the Castros, it was a symbolic gesture of their union, as well as being part of their commitment as missionaries with Bonds of Marian Love, an international Catholic community that started in Colombia and has satellite groups in the Diocese of Brooklyn.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pro-life ever since we can remember,\u201d said Ingrid, \u201cand we try to live it with our lives. This is a cause very dear to our heart and our community.\u201d\nRally participants heard from a variety of pro-life leaders including Father Shenan Boquet, president of Human Life International, and Theresa Bonopartis with the post-abortion ministry Entering Canaan.\nWhile the mood of the participants was energetic, on the minds of many was a looming decision being deliberated in a courthouse not close to Manhattan.\nSpeaker Rev. Clenard Childress from New Calvary Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, spoke about the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s most significant abortion ruling in decades \u2014 Roe vs. Wade \u2014 in a way that envisioned Roe being overturned.\n\u201cThis is necessary for us as a people of God \u2026 to be in the public square crying out against the unlawful, heinous, barbaric treatment that we have towards our unborn,\u201d Childress said. \u201cIt is insidious.\u201d\nRev. Childress has been an outspoken pro-life advocate dating back to his years leading his church\u2019s youth ministry in the late 1970s.\nAll eyes are on the high court for its decision in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which involves a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks.\nIf the court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs, expected in June or early July, overturns the high court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, it will leave the abortion question up to individual states.\nAlready, lawmakers in several states are working to codify Roe in their laws. In Colorado, the Reproductive Health Equity Act, which was passed last week and set to become law, would permit on-demand abortion for the full 40 weeks of pregnancy, as well as entrench into law that a \u201cfertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights under the laws\u201d of that state. Other states have passed bills similar to the Mississippi law.\nIn a March 21 statement, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and chairmen of eight USCCB committees, joined together to say they are recommitting its resources and ministries to various initiatives and agencies that support pregnant women in need, their children, and their families.\n\u201cThe Catholic Church has a long history of service to those who are most vulnerable and remains the largest private provider of social services in the United States,\u201d they said. \nCathy Donohoe, president of the Queens-based organization The Bridge to Life, attended the rally with several members of her pro-life group. Donohoe said at the rally that if there is to be a post-Roe society, it needs to \u201cget activated and get educated.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to get more women support centers,\u201d Donohoe said. \u201cWe need to let young women know that Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t the place to go when you want to make life-affirming decisions.\u201d\n\u201cWomen deserve better. Mothers deserve better,\u201d she added. \u201cTheir babies deserve to be protected.\u201d\nPraying before a statue of Our Lady of Fatima at noon, Father Boquet led the Act of Consecration in unison with Pope Francis and clergy around the world, consecrating Ukraine, Russia, and humanity to the Blessed Mother. \nFour men then carried the statue on a platform and processed with her throughout the streets. \nAs the groups proceeded, Dawn Eskew, leader of Personhood Education NY, moved among the groups speaking with other leaders and then jumped into the back of the sound truck to address the rally. \nEskew, whose organization was a key sponsor of the event, stressed that even in an abortion-friendly state such as New York, \u201cThis is a spiritual battle and we need prayer. That\u2019s the only way we can move ahead.\n\u201cIf Roe v. Wade is still there, our work doesn\u2019t change. We continue,\u201d Eskew added. \u201cIf Roe v. Wade is overturned, still our work doesn\u2019t change because we still have that extreme abortion bill that\u2019s in place. \n\u201cFor the rest of the country, it\u2019s very positive. For New York, our work doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\n\nTags: Bonds of Marian Love, Catherine Donohoe, Dobbs v. Jackson, International Gift of Life Walk-NYC, Roe v.
