Wade.\n\n\nLast Updated: January 11, 2024\nPublished: December 5, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\negearing/Getty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tracker is a joint project of the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Brennan Center for Justice.\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling that the federal Constitution protects a right to abortion. In the wake of the Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a number of states quickly moved to enforce abortion bans and restrictions, spurring a slate of emergency litigation to protect reproductive rights under state law. In this tracker, the Brennan Center for Justice and the Center for Reproductive Rights aggregate pending and completed state court litigation against bans that were, or would have been, unconstitutional under Roe.\nThis is not a summary of abortion access in the states \u2014 for information on the current status of state abortion bans and restrictions, as well as laws protecting abortion access in the states, please see the Center for Reproductive Rights\u2019s After Roe Fell: Abortion Laws by State. To learn about state court decisions that established state constitutional protections for abortion rights prior to Dobbs, please see the report on State Constitutions and Abortion Rights.\nAs of January 11, 2024, a total of 40 cases have been filed challenging abortion bans in 23 states, of which 22 remain pending at either the trial or appellate levels.\nSo far, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that its state constitution protects the right to an abortion\u00a0and struck down a 6-week ban, but then reversed course to uphold a virtually identical ban a few months later. The Idaho Supreme Court has \u200bheld that the state constitution does not protect the right to abortion.\nSeveral courts have also declared that their state constitutions provide limited rights to abortion. For instance, the North Dakota Supreme Court and the Indiana Supreme Court have ruled that their state constitutions protect the right to an abortion when necessary to preserve life or health.

Wade, a state court blocked Arizona\u2019s pre-Roe\u00a0near-total ban. In the wake of\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Arizona\u2019s attorney general asked the state court to lift its injunction. In response, the plaintiffs argue that Arizona\u2019s abortion laws need to be harmonized, which would mean that the pre-Roe\u00a0ban does not apply to abortions provided by licensed physicians and must remain blocked to that extent. An intermediate appeals court temporarily blocked the ban, reversing the trial court\u2019s order that had allowed the ban to take effect.

They\u00a0also argue that the ban is void because it violated federal constitutional precedent when it was enacted, and under Georgia jurisprudence, a subsequent change in federal law cannot revive such a law. A trial court struck down the ban as void, but the Georgia Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, upheld the ban, and remanded the case for consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional claims.\nKey Documents\nComplaint\u00a0(July 26, 2022)\nOrder\u00a0denying preliminary injunction (August 15, 2022)\nOrder granting partial judgment on the pleadings (November 15, 2022)\nStay order (November 23, 2022)\nOrder reversing partial judgment on the pleadings (October 24, 2023)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo state court challenges to abortion bans filed after Dobbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState court challenges to abortion bans filed after Dobbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\n\n\n\nAdkins v.

They also request a ruling that any enforcement of the bans by state officials against physicians who provide abortion care to such people would be beyond the scope of the official\u2019s authority. Additionally, they claim that the bans,\u00a0as applied to pregnant people with emergent medical conditions,\u00a0violate the state constitution\u2019s 1) rights to enjoy and defend life, pursue happiness, and secure safety (Art. I., \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13) and 2) guarantee of equal protection (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2). Finally, they claim that the bans,\u00a0as applied to Idaho-licensed physicians treating pregnant people with emergent medical conditions,\u00a0violate\u00a0the state constitution\u2019s\u00a03) rights to acquire, possess, and protect property and due process (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13).\u00a0A trial court partially rejected the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that the exceptions to the abortion bans need to be interpreted through a declaratory judgment and allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the bans violate the state constitution\u2019s inalienable rights clause (Art. I., \u00a7 1),\u00a0as applied to people with emergent medical conditions, to proceed.\nKey Documents:\nComplaint\u00a0(September 11, 2023)\nMemorandum of Decision and Order on Motion to Dismiss (December 29, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood v.

I, \u00a7 1), 2) guarantee of equal privileges and immunities (Art. I, \u00a7 23), and 3) due course of law clause through its unconstitutionally vague language (Art. I, \u00a7 12). A trial court preliminarily blocked the ban. After keeping the injunction temporarily in place while it heard an appeal, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled on the merits of whether the Indiana Constitution protects a right to abortion and\u00a0vacated the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\u00a0According to the court, the state constitution\u2019s due process right to privacy (Art. I, \u00a7 1) does not protect the right to abortion except when necessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or to protect a patient from a serious health risk. Though the court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had previously withdrawn their vagueness claim (Art. I, \u00a7 12), it declined to rule on their privileges and immunities claim (Art. I, \u00a7 23) since that claim was not part of the appeal.\u00a0The Indiana Supreme Court denied the request for rehearing, allowing the ban to take effect.\u00a0The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint to challenge both the ban\u2019s medical exception for patients facing a serious health risk and its requirement that abortion care occur in hospitals or an ambulatory outpatient surgical center majority owned by a hospital as violations of the state constitution\u2019s inherent rights clause.\nKey Documents\nComplaint (August 31, 2022)\nOrder granting preliminary injunction (September 22, 2022)\nOrder granting transfer and extending preliminary injunction (October 12, 2022)\nOpinion vacating preliminary injunction (June 30, 2023)\nPetition for Rehearing (July 31, 2023)\n\u200bOrder Denying Petition for Rehearing (August 22, 2023)\nAmended Complaint (November 9, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous Plaintiffs v.

I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 12). A trial court preliminarily blocked the ban. On appeal, the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the trial court did not properly assess all the factors for issuing preliminary relief and ordered the trial court to reassess whether each of those factors had been satisfied. Upon doing so, the trial court again blocked the ban.\u00a0The North Dakota Supreme Court subsequently upheld the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction of the ban. The Court first concluded that the text of the state constitution and North Dakota\u2019s history and traditions reveal that there is a fundamental right to an abortion when necessary to preserve the life or health of the patient. It then determined that the ban is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. The Court declined to rule on whether the state constitution protects the right to abortion beyond a situation in which the pregnant person\u2019s life or health is at risk.\nThe plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to challenge a second near-total ban passed by the legislature in 2023, which they claim violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) \u00a0guarantee of due process \u2014 the exceptions to the ban are insufficiently clear (Art. I, \u00a7 12) and 2) guarantee of inalienable rights, including life, liberty, safety, and happiness, which are protected through the due process clause, because the ban prohibits abortions when needed to protect the pregnant person\u2019s mental health or when the fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy and sustain life after birth (Art.

I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 16, 21), 2) guarantee of equal protection (Art. I, \u00a7 2), and 3) guarantee of due process \u2014 the law is insufficiently clear (Art. I, \u00a7 16). A trial court preliminarily blocked the ban. An intermediate appeals court rejected the Defendants\u2019 appeal of the trial court\u2019s order.

They also argue that Oklahoma precedent prevents the legislature from delegating the state\u2019s police power to private citizens.\nPlaintiffs further claim that the near-total ban violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) guarantee of due process \u2014 right to choose to terminate a pregnancy and bodily integrity (Art.

They also argue that Oklahoma precedent prevents the legislature from delegating the state\u2019s police power to private citizens.\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to temporarily block the two bans pending a decision on whether to take jurisdiction of the case and rule on the merits. The Court subsequently assumed jurisdiction over the case and applied its recent precedent holding that the Oklahoma constitution protects abortion when necessary to preserve a patient\u2019s life. It held that both the private enforcement bans had unconstitutionally narrow medical exceptions that could not be severed from the remainder of the statutes and struck them down. The Court did not rule on whether the state constitution protects the right to abortion beyond a situation in which the patient\u2019s life is at risk.\nKey Documents\nComplaint\u00a0(April 28, 2022)\nOrder denying request for temporary restraining order and temporary injunction (May 3, 2022)\nFirst supplemental application for original jurisdiction and petition for declaratory and injunctive relief and/or writ of prohibition (May 26, 2022)\nOrder denying request for temporary restraining order and temporary injunction (June 27, 2022)\nOrder assuming jurisdiction and granting declaratory relief (May 31, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma Call for Reproductive Justice v.

Tit. 21, section 861) and 2022 near-total abortion ban (S.B. 612)\nDescription: Plaintiffs claim that the bans violate the state constitution\u2019s 1) inherent right to personal autonomy and bodily integrity (Art. II, \u00a7 2), 2) guarantee of due process \u2014 right to health (Art. II, \u00a7 7), and 3) guarantee of due process \u2014 the laws are insufficiently clear (Art. II, \u00a7 7). They also seek a declaratory judgment that the pre-Roe\u00a0ban was repealed by implication. The Oklahoma Supreme Court summarily denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to block the bans pending a decision on whether to take jurisdiction of the case and rule on the merits.\u00a0The Court subsequently assumed jurisdiction over the case and ruled that the text of the state constitution and Oklahoma\u2019s history and traditions reveal that there is an inherent right to an abortion\u00a0when necessary to preserve the life of the patient. It then determined that while the pre-Roe\u00a0ban is constitutional, the 2022 ban is unconstitutional as to its requirement that a pregnant person must wait until they are experiencing a medical emergency before seeking a life-saving abortion. It also concluded that the pre-Roe\u00a0ban was not unconstitutionally vague nor repealed by implication.

Additionally, they claim that the death and substantial injury exception to the ban violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) right to privacy (Art.

Furthermore, the plaintiffs claim that the rape exception violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) right to informational privacy (Art. I, \u00a7 10) and 2) guarantee of equal protection (Art. I, \u00a7 3). Moreover, they claim that the fatal fetal anomaly exception violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) right to privacy (Art. I, \u00a7 10), 2) guarantee of equal protection (Art. I, \u00a7 3), 3) guarantee of due process \u2014 life and liberty (Art. I, \u00a7 3), and 4) guarantee of due process \u2014 the law is insufficiently clear (Art. I, \u00a7 3). The plaintiffs also claim that ban\u2019s provision barring Planned Parenthood and its affiliates from using state funds to provide abortions or related services violates 1) the state constitution\u2019s ban on legislation prescribing punishments without a trial (Art. I, \u00a7 4), 2) the state constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection (Art. I, \u00a7 3), and 3) federal law allowing Medicaid recipients to seek care from any qualified healthcare provider willing to provide services (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)). Finally, they claim that the ban is void because it conflicts with state supreme court precedent holding that a nearly-identical 6-week ban violated the South Carolina constitution.

Finally, they claim the rape exception violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) right to informational privacy (Art. I, \u00a7 10) and 2) guarantee of equal protection (Art. I, \u00a7 3). After assuming jurisdiction over the case, the South Carolina Supreme Court temporarily blocked the ban pending a decision on the merits.\u00a0The Court then permanently blocked the ban, reasoning that it violated the South Carolina constitution\u2019s right to privacy. According to the Court, the state\u2019s ban was an unreasonable limitation on that right\u00a0for reasons including that\u00a0six weeks is not sufficient time for women to determine whether they are even pregnant, let alone take steps to terminate their pregnancies.

They also claim that Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, as applied to pregnant people with emergent medical conditions, violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) right to life (Art.

I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 25, and 27), 2) Equal Rights Amendment (Art. IV, \u00a7 1), 3) right to uniform operation of laws (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 24), 4) right to bodily integrity and privacy (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, 11),\u00a05) right of conscience (Art. I, \u00a7 4), and 6) right to privacy (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14). A trial court preliminarily blocked the ban. The defendants appealed to the Utah Supreme Court, which has kept the injunction temporarily in place pending a decision on the merits.\nThe plaintiffs\u00a0subsequently requested that the trial court also allow them to challenge the hospital-only requirement, which they claim functionally bans abortion and violates the state constitution\u2019s 1) right to determine family composition and to parent (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 25, and 27), 2) Equal Rights Amendment (Art. IV, \u00a7 1), 3) right to uniform operation of laws (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 24), 4) right to bodily integrity and privacy (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, 11), and 5) right to privacy (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14).\u00a0A trial court preliminarily blocked the ban.\nKey Documents\nComplaint (June 25, 2022)\nOrder granting temporary restraining order (July 27, 2022)\nOrder granting preliminary injunction\u00a0(near-total ban) (July 19, 2022)\nOrder granting appeal and denying stay of preliminary injunction (October 3, 2022)\nMotion to file supplemental complaint (April 3, 2023)\u00a0\nOrder granting preliminary injunction (hospital-only requirement) (May 2, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVermont\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo state court challenges to abortion bans filed after Dobbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVermont\n\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo state court challenges to abortion bans filed after Dobbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\n\nWashington\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo state court challenges to abortion bans filed after Dobbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState court challenges to abortion bans filed after Dobbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Health Center of West Virginia v.

Miller and Patrick Morrissey\nLaw(s) challenged: Pre-Roe\u00a0near-total abortion ban (W. Va. Code \u00a7 61\u20132\u20138)\nDescription: Plaintiffs claim that the ban violates the\u00a0state constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process \u2014 the law is insufficiently clear (Art III, \u00a7 10). They also claim the state cannot enforce the ban because 1) it has since passed many laws regulating legal abortion that conflict with the ban and 2) it has fallen into disuse for over half a century. A trial court preliminarily blocked the ban. The legislature passed a new ban while the state\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia (the state\u2019s highest court) was pending.
