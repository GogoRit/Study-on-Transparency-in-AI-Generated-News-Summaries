(AP) \u2014 Virginia Republicans stepped up their criticism this week of the rhetoric being used by their Democratic opponents in abortion-focused messaging in this year\u2019s critical legislative elections. A recent flurry of Democratic-sponsored ads and mailers in battleground districts expected to determine political control of the General Assembly have warned that Republicans would use a newfound legislative majority to ban abortion, including in cases where the pregnancy resulted from rape or a mother\u2019s life was at risk. Virginia, currently under divided political control, now allows elective abortions in the first and second trimesters and is the only Southern state that has not implemented new restrictions since the end of Roe v. Wade. In their messaging, Democrats have cited recent strict bans enacted in other GOP-led states, along with Republican candidates\u2019 legislative records, past public statements and news articles, to bolster their claims. Republicans, who are largely campaigning on GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s proposed ban on abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, say their opponents are misrepresenting those sources or candidates\u2019 past statements in an exploitative effort to drive turnout. \n\n\u201cWith no vision to offer the Commonwealth in this election and nothing to inspire Virginians to vote for their extreme candidates, Virginia Democrats are reverting to their tired tactics of overt falsehoods and flagrant fearmongering,\u201d Youngkin\u2019s political action committee said in a news release Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBettors counting on upsets as they put money on long shots this March Madness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch Madness kicks off with First Four games and teams looking to do some bracket busting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch Madness brackets are here. Here\u2019s how to pick your teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery General Assembly seat is on the ballot this year, with early voting already underway, in an election cycle that will determine partisan control of the House of Delegates, now GOP-led, and the Democratic-controlled Senate. Virginia\u2019s narrow political divide and unusual off-year schedule mean the contests typically draw outsized national attention and are often viewed as a possible bellwether for the coming year\u2019s federal elections. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican staffers and campaign operatives in Virginia have been arguing for weeks that Democrats are overreaching or outright lying in their messaging. But the conversation escalated Tuesday after Joel Griffin, the Democratic nominee in a competitive Fredericksburg-area Senate race, publicized a new ad criticizing his Republican opponent, Tara Durant.\n\n\u201cTara Durant supports letting Virginia ban abortions with no exceptions. ... She supports letting Virginia force a 10-year-old rape victim carry to term,\u201d female speakers warned in the video. Included as citations for both statements was a 2022 Facebook post from Durant praising the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.Durant, a current member of the state House who has said she backs the governor\u2019s 15-week proposal, responded by saying Griffin had \u201ccrossed a line\u201d with the new ad.The ad \u201csmears Tara Durant -- a mother of two young women -- as wanting to force a 10-year-old victim of rape to carry a child. Such an unnerving, unfounded charge warrants nothing but clear-cut condemnation,\u201d her campaign said in a statement. \n\nGriffin then responded in part by pointing out a flier from Durant\u2019s competitive primary that called Durant \u201ca proven champion for the unborn\u201d and \u201c100% pro-life.\u201dRepublicans are suddenly moderating their rhetoric and long-standing opposition to abortion access at the advice of pollsters, House Democratic Leader Don Scott argued in an interview Wednesday. Anti-abortion groups have seen a string of losses in statewide ballot fights since the U.S. Supreme Court ended constitutional protections for abortion last year.Scott and other Democrats also say they are skeptical that a Republican majority would not seek to go further than Youngkin\u2019s 15-week proposal \u2014 which would still accommodate most abortions, according to the latest available federal data. They frequently invoke The Washington Post\u2019s reporting last year that Youngkin told a conservative audience he would \u201chappily and gleefully\u201d sign \u201cany bill ... to protect life.\u201d\n\nYoungkin\u2019s press office did not directly answer questions Wednesday from The Associated Press about whether the governor would sign a stricter ban, or legislation that did not contain exceptions, though spokeswoman Macaulay Porter reiterated Youngkin\u2019s support for the 15-week legislation.House Speaker Todd Gilbert said he did not believe a measure more restrictive than the governor\u2019s current proposal could clear the Legislature. \u201cLet\u2019s use me as an example. I am no less a pro-life member of the Legislature than I\u2019ve ever been. But I understand that that\u2019s not where the majority of Virginians are on this issue,\u201d he said in an interview, calling the governor\u2019s proposal an attempt to find consensus. He added that if Republicans retain their House majority, \u201cthere will be no deviating\u201d from the campaign platform. Democrats in recent years have shown they are the extremists on the issue, Gilbert said, both for their support for the removal of limits on abortion later in pregnancy and their advocacy for a proposal that called for enshrining \u201ca fundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d in the state constitution.\n\nIn other swing districts around the state, debates like the Griffin-Durant exchange have also played out.In a competitive suburban Richmond state Senate race, Democratic nominee Schuyler VanValkenburg\u2019s campaign ran an ad featuring a woman who said his Republican opponent, Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant \u201cwants to ban abortion, take away a woman\u2019s choice.\u201d Dunnavant, a practicing OB-GYN, carried legislation this session that would have added limits on third-trimester abortions and has since said she supports legal abortion through 15 weeks and afterward only in cases of rape, incest, to save the mother\u2019s life and in cases of severe fetal anomalies.\u201cI don\u2019t support an abortion ban. Period,\u201d Dunnavant said in an ad that aired soon after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
