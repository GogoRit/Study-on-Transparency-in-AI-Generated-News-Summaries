Jackson Women's Health Organization abortion case. | Katie Yoder/CNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Katie Yoder \n\nWashington D.C., May 12, 2022 / 09:35 am\nMore than 70 pro-life leaders, including Archbishop William E. Lori who leads the U.S. bishops\u2019 pro-life committee, are demanding that state lawmakers refuse to punish or criminalize women who obtain abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cAs national and state pro-life organizations, representing tens of millions of pro-life men, women, and children across the country, let us be clear: We state unequivocally that any measure seeking to criminalize or punish women is not pro-life and we stand firmly opposed to such efforts,\u201d the May 12 letter to state lawmakers reads.\u00a0\nThe letter comes as lawmakers in states such as Louisiana consider legislation that could subject women who obtain abortions to criminal prosecution and prison.\nLaura Echevarria, a spokesperson for the National Right to Life, the pro-life group that coordinated the letter\u2019s release, told CNA that it responded, in part, to actions by states like Louisiana. The letter also responded to rhetoric from abortion activists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has been a long-standing policy issue of ours\u201d and many of the other signers,\u00a0Echevarria said. \u201cWe felt we needed to make it clear that this was something that we did not agree with. That we do not believe in prosecuting women who have had abortions. We see them as a second victim in these situations.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that this was very clear to state legislators, but also to the public-at-large,\u201d she added. \u201cWe do not want women thinking that this is something that the movement approves of, because we don\u2019t.\u201d\nIn addition to Lori, signers include Carol Tobias of the National Right to Life, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, Jeanne Mancini of the March for Life, and Catherine Glenn Foster of Americans United for Life. You can read the full letter below:\n\nThe open letter follows a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion that suggests justices will overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, later this year.\nThe letter takes care to say that there are two victims with every abortion: both the mother and her unborn child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe mother who aborts her child is also Roe\u2019s victim,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cShe is the victim of a callous industry created to take lives; an industry that claims to provide for \u2018women\u2019s health,\u2019 but denies the reality that far too many American women suffer devastating physical and psychological damage following abortion.\u201d\nIn bold text, the letter adds, \u201cWomen are victims of abortion and require our compassion and support as well as ready access to counseling and social services in the days, weeks, months, and years following an abortion.\u201d\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe, as the leaked draft suggests, the issue of abortion will be left up to each individual state \u2014 and elected lawmakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut in seizing that opportunity,\u201d the letter cautions, \u201cwe must ensure that the laws we advance to protect unborn children do not harm their mothers.\u201d In other words, the letter continues, \u201cturning women who have abortions into criminals is not the way.\u201d\nSeveral organizations, many of them run by Catholics, offer healing and hope to women harmed by abortion, including Project Rachel, Rachel's Vineyard, and Silence No More Awareness Campaign.\u00a0\nWhile the Catholic Church condemns abortion, it also stresses the importance of forgiveness and mercy for the women who have obtained abortions. Just as the unborn have inherent dignity and worth as human persons, so do their mothers.\n\u201cThe Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy,\u201d the Catechism of the Catholic Church reads, but instead \u201cmakes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoric \u2018Requiem for the Forgotten\u2019 Mass to premiere in Miami\u00a0\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPro-life advocacy, \nArchbishop William Lori, \nDobbs v.
