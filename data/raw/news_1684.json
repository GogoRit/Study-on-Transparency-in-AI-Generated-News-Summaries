(Jess Mador/WABE)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court is preparing to take up a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in March. After the law known as House Bill 481 took effect last fall, clinics that provide abortion have had to adjust to the restrictions.\u00a0\nIn this story, we spend time with some Atlanta abortion providers and patients caught at the center of Georgia\u2019s battle over abortion access.\nIn her tiny office at Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center in DeKalb County, Tracii Wesley sits at a computer.\n\u201cToday is a clinic day, a surgical abortion, medical, pill abortion day,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe pulls up the day\u2019s patient schedule.\u00a0\nThe sun isn\u2019t even up yet.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m printing the list for today of how many patients we have. I bet they got at least 40 folks on here, if not more,\u201d said Wesley.\u00a0\nThis clinic provides abortion three days\u00a0per week. Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest.\u00a0\n\u201cBe advised. We have three on standby.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe radio clipped to Wesley\u2019s yellow safety vest crackles with the voice of a security guard stationed outside the brick building in the parking lot.\u00a0\n\u201cSecurity has advised me we\u2019ve got three patients already waiting in the parking lot. So, I\u2019m going to head upstairs and start getting them up and getting them in,\u201d Wesley said.\nSecurity is Wesley\u2019s number-one concern.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s a retired Gwinnett County police officer who served 24 years in the department. Before that, she served in the military for a decade.\nHer experience comes in handy working at the clinic because abortion days always attract a handful of anti-abortion protesters. It\u2019s always the same few people.\nThe staff at the clinic are on a first-name basis with the protesters.\u00a0\nThey stand on the curb with a speaker as patient cars enter and leave the lot.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take the power of God into our own hands. And he has worked throughout the course of human history,\u201d a protester said. \u201cIt never ends well for people that do this, and it won\u2019t end well for you if you continue where you\u2019re going. Trust Christ, ma\u2019am.\u201d\nWesley trains her security team to be vigilant, to watch for suspicious activity and keep protesters off the property and away from patients.\n\u201cThe biggest thing is do not engage with them because they\u2019re going to say things and are going to poke the bear,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to try to get a response out of you.\u201d\nShe stays mostly at the clinic entrance at the top of a small hill while security guards monitor the parking lot down below.\u00a0\nA clipboard is always in hand.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning. Good morning. How are you all this morning? Do you have an appointment,\u201d she said to patients approaching the clinic.\u00a0\n\u201cCan I see your ID, too?\u201d\nAfter Wesley\u2019s inital check-in outside, the patients go inside to fully register at the front desk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThey do bloodwork. They do an ultrasound,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s during the ultrasound, they find out how far along they actually are.\u201d\nHow far along in their pregnancies. Georgia\u2019s cutoff is about six weeks.\nSince the law has been in effect, front office supervisor Antoinette, who doesn\u2019t want to give her last name out of concern for her safety, said they turn away an average of five to seven patients every day.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can\u2019t care for people who are over six weeks. Most women don\u2019t know that they\u2019re six weeks and or pregnant in the first place,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sometimes patients aren\u2019t aware of the law.\u201d\nThose who are too far along get counseling and information about abortion access in nearby states.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe closest option is in Greenville, South Carolina. Others are in North Carolina, and Florida.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA patient checks in for an abortion appointment at Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center in Atlanta. (Jess Mador/WABE)\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Kleenex that we go through every week,\u201d said Wesley. \u201cUsually by the time they come outside, if I see them with their white paper, I know they were turned away.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d the security guard said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, I got room for two cars, four people,\u201d Wesley said.\u00a0\u00a0\nEvery surgical abortion patient is required to come with a driver, who also picks them up after the procedure.\n\u201cWhat type of vehicle did you drive today? What color?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThis continues all day.\u00a0\nWesley checks in patients and their drivers one by one.\u00a0\nThe cars mostly have Georgia plates, but other states, too \u2014 Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Ohio.\u00a0\nAnd Mississippi. That\u2019s where the next patient is from.\u00a0\nTo get to the clinic, she said she and her friend drove overnight to Georgia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo we had to leave like around 12, 12:30, no later than 1 a.m.\u201d\nMississippi enacted a so-called trigger law after the U.S. Supreme Court decision last summer overturning Roe v. Wade. Now, abortion is allowed only when a woman\u2019s life is in danger or in cases of rape reported to law enforcement.\nThe Mississippi patient said she\u2019s relieved she was able to travel to Atlanta for an abortion, but wishes she didn\u2019t have to.\nShe said she worries for patients who are unable to make the trip out of state.\u00a0\n\u201cI feel like it should be offered closer there because some people don\u2019t have a way to drive five hours or eight hours. You know, you just don\u2019t never know what somebody\u2019s situation is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got room for two cars, four people,\u201d Wesley said, checking in more patients and drivers.\n\u201cTwo cars, four people on their way up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood copy. I\u2019ll be at the top of the hill.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWesley said she loves what she does at Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a job for me. I\u2019m very passionate about what I do here,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a woman, and it affects me like it affects everybody else.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nShe said she tries to comfort abortion patients and make their visits a little easier.\u00a0\u00a0\nWesley is quick to offer patients and drivers a kind word.\u00a0\n\u201cI can see how it hits them in their spirit and I see the tears welling up in their eyes,\u201d Wesley said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right. I said God is a forgiving God. Please, know this one incident is not going to determine the trajectory of the rest of your life. Things happen. But from this, take the lesson. And that\u2019s it, and I ask them if I can give them a hug.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the six-week ban took effect, Wesley said it\u2019s been tough turning so many patients away.\u00a0\nNow, the Georgia Supreme Court is expected to take up a lawsuit challenging the ban this spring.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen's Health\n\nJan 13, 2023\nDate set for oral arguments in case over Georgia\u2019s abortion law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Care\n\nJan 6, 2023\nClarkston\u2019s free comprehensive health clinic looks to expand impact in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen's Health\n\nJan 6, 2023\nGeorgia may not see expanded access to abortion pills despite FDA rule change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid\n\nDems press Kemp on handling of Medicaid \u2018unwinding\u2019 after thousands of Georgia kids lose health coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Legislature\n\nGeorgia lawmakers advance bills to give those convicted of minor crimes easier path to work, housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFani Willis\n\nTrump seeks to appeal decision not to disqualify district attorney from Georgia election case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection\n\nFormer Georgia Lt.
