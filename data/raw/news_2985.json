EJ MontiniArizona RepublicRepublican governor candidate Kari Lake is the in-your-face smack-talking candidate, right?The tough one.The former news reader will stare you down and wag her finger under your nose if she feels like you\u2019re challenging her.So, why is it that she seems kind of mealy-mouthed compared to Democrat Katie Hobbs when it comes to one of the most volatile issues facing politicians:Abortion.Katie Hobbs is\u00a0unwavering about abortionHobbs is unwavering in her support of reproductive freedom.Check her campaign website, in which she says in part:\u201cLet me be clear \u2013\u00a0the decision to have a child should rest solely between a woman and her doctor, not the government or politicians \u2026 .\u201cThat\u2019s why as governor, I will fearlessly work to increase access to abortion services and reproductive care, use my veto pen to oppose any restrictive and extreme measures coming from the legislature, and make sure that women and families have the resources they need to thrive right here in Arizona.\u201dOn the offense:Dems seek election wins to restore abortion rightsLake, on the other hand, has lately seemed to be vacillating, treading very close to the path of the namby-pamby.For example, after declaring victory in the GOP primary and having told Hobbs through the media, \u201cI\u2019m coming for you,\u201d Lake was evasive when asked by a reporter if she\u2019d be pushing for more strident abortion laws in Arizona.Does Kari Lake support abortion exceptions?When Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, Arizona was left with conflicting laws on the books.There is the pre-statehood ban that has no exceptions and would make doctors who perform abortions criminals. And there is the law passed by the Legislature this year banning abortions after 15 weeks except for medical emergencies and with no exceptions for rape or incest.Earlier in the campaign the candidates for governor were asked about the conflict and what their stands were.Hobbs was resolute in her support of abortion rights.Lake didn\u2019t comment on the conflict but, through her campaign sent a note to The Arizona Republic saying, \u201cKari is pro-life but supports exceptions\u00a0for rape, incest and life of the mother.\u201dAgain, though, Arizona law allows for no exceptions.How does Lake feel about that?Who is coming for whom on this issue?When Lake was asked after declaring victory about her position she said, \u201cWe have great laws on the books and we\u2019re going to work with those.\u201dFirst, laws that conflict are not \u201cgreat.\u201dSecond, Lake said she supported exceptions for rape and incest and Arizona\u2019s laws don\u2019t allow that, so how would she \u201cwork with those\u201d?Or has she changed her position?Karrin Taylor Robson has finally turned against Trump Why the Biden/McCain friendship is a threat to MAGA Gov. Hobbs yanked her agency nominees. What's next? Want more opinions? Here's how to get them in your inboxOr is she hedging her bets and running a little scared, like Republicans across the country, since voters in Kansas overwhelmingly chose to protect abortion rights?What\u2019s certain is that coming out of the gate, the finger-wagging, smack-talking Lake doesn\u2019t look so tough compared to Hobbs.Which begs the question:Exactly who is coming for whom?Reach Montini at ed.montini@arizonarepublic.com.For more opinions content, please subscribe.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center azcentral Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.azcentral.com.
