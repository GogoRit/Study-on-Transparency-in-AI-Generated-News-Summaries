Politically, at least, the two have been cleft apart and set at odds. The pro-life campaign is viewed by some as a conservative \u201cwhite men\u2019s culture war,\u201d while the anti-racism project is seen often as a solely progressive movement.\nThe last election hinged in part on these real and perceived tensions. Future elections will do the same. As philosopher Scott Coley notes, \u201cWe are forced to choose between the rights of the most vulnerable,\u201d namely the unborn, \u201cand the rights of all but the most vulnerable,\u201d namely immigrants and people of color.\nAlthough our politics pit these movements against each other, the two in fact share the same moral nucleus. The anti-abortion cause and the anti-racism cause are sibling abolition movements that protest two different cultures of exploitation and devaluation. What, then, can the pro-life campaign learn from the racial justice project?\nSince the advent of Roe v. Wade 48 years ago, the \u201creproductive justice\u201d movement has embraced a conditional view of human life. The worth of an unborn baby is contingent upon a mother\u2019s preparedness, her consent, even her personal interest or desire. The child has value insofar as the mother says it does. Case in point: A recent Time essay by Stephanie Land suggests that you can name and love your \u201cblastocyst,\u201d even if you terminate the pregnancy.\nBy contrast, the largely Christian abolition project of the 19th century was built on the view that all human life has intrinsic value. Today\u2019s antiracism movement reflects that same ethic by saying: Racial justice is not conditional. Black lives are valuable irrespective of circumstance, irrespective of personal bonds between blacks and whites, and irrespective of anyone\u2019s interest or awareness (although those matter). As Dennis Edwards writes for CT, we \u201cdismantle systems of injustice\u201d precisely because all of us \u201chave been created in the image of God.\u201d\nThese principles are almost entirely absent from the pro-choice campaign. Arguably, the entire movement is heir to American slavery. Under the Dred Scott ruling of 1857, a slaveholder decided the value of a black person\u2019s body. In a Roe v. Wade world, the mother determines the value of the unborn child. She is the legal \u201cowner.\u201d\nThe parallels here aren\u2019t merely symbolic\u2014they point us toward praxis.\nFree NewslettersGet the best from CT editors, delivered straight to your inbox!\n\n\n\n More Newsletters\nFirst, pro-lifers are fighting for the abolition of abortion, nothing less. The abolitionists of the 19th century were calling for the total and complete end to slavery, not just the overturning of Dred Scott. Similarly, we are calling for the definitive end to abortion on demand. Overturning Roe is a necessary first step. But our cry for justice goes way beyond: We want our nation\u2019s government to outlaw one human being owning another, and we want that ruling to extend to all 50 states.\nSecond, we are fighting to outlaw abortion in order to secure rights for the unborn. Frederick Douglass, the black Christian abolitionist, once asked, \u201cAre the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us [blacks]?\u201d We can pose that same question in the abortion debate. Like the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, and the 14th, which promised citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States,\u201d we need constitutional amendments that recognize unborn children.\nAs any critic will point out, American politics makes it difficult to bring about the comprehensive justice required to end abortion. In addition to laws, we also need parental leave legislation, poverty alleviation, and a culture of maternal support. We\u2019re nowhere near any of those goals. Nonetheless, the persistent blindness of this nation doesn\u2019t decrease the moral urgency of declaring the same truth over and over again: The child inside the womb has intrinsic value and deserves the same right to life as a child outside the womb.\nIn the book of Isaiah, the prophet calls his people to \u201cseek justice\u201d and \u201cdefend the oppressed\u201d (Isa. 1:17). That is our timeless mandate. As Tim Keller argues, biblical justice \u201cis based on God\u2019s character\u2014a moral absolute,\u201d while other philosophies are \u201cbased on the changing winds of human culture.\u201d That moral absolute applies to black lives then and now, just as it applies to the unborn. And that moral absolute is what we carry into the public square, even as it defies the partisan logic of our day.\nAndrea Palpant Dilley is online managing editor at CT.\nHave something to add about this?
