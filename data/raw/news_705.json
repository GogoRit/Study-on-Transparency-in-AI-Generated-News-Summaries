(AP) \u2014 Abortion-rights groups went to court Thursday seeking to restore abortion services in Kentucky, where the last two abortion clinics signaled they couldn\u2019t immediately comply with sweeping new restrictions imposed by the Republican legislature.\nTwo lawsuits filed in federal court in Louisville asked that a judge intervene to block the law from taking effect while the case is litigated.\nKentucky\u2019s GOP-dominated\u00a0legislature overturned\u00a0Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s veto of the abortion measure on Wednesday as the chants of abortion-rights advocates shouting \u201cbans off our bodies\u201d echoed through the statehouse. They joined Republican lawmakers across the country in passing new restrictions, while some Democratic-led states have worked to preserve or expand access.\nREAD MORE: As political dominance wavers, Arizona Republicans fight culture war battles against abortion and LGBTQ rights\nIn Kentucky, the new law is filled with revisions to the state\u2019s abortion laws, with many new requirements that clinics must meet.\nThe two remaining abortion clinics in Kentucky \u2014 both in Louisville, the state\u2019s largest city \u2014 can\u2019t comply because the law mandates a new regulatory process that hasn\u2019t been set up yet, resulting in an \u201cunconstitutional ban on abortion in Kentucky,\u201d the plaintiffs said.\n\u201cIt is impossible to comply with its vast provisions, resulting in an immediate ban on abortion in the commonwealth absent this court\u2019s intervention,\u201d they said.\nKentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, said he is ready to defend the new law.\n\u201cThe General Assembly passed HB 3 to protect life and promote the health and safety of women, and we are prepared to earnestly defend this new law against the legal challenge from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday.\nAbout half of all abortions performed in Kentucky are the result of medication procedures. The new law, which took effect immediately, requires such women to be examined in person by a doctor before receiving the abortion pills through a registration process that hasn\u2019t been established, they said.\nREAD MORE: Michigan governor sues for reproductive rights, asks court to recognize right to abortion\nEMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center was closed Thursday and cannot provide abortion services until a court grants a temporary restraining order, while Louisville\u2019s Planned Parenthood location remained open for other services such as STD testing, ultrasounds and birth control, their spokespersons said.\nNo protesters appeared at midday outside the Planned Parenthood office, and only two stood silently holding signs outside the surgical center, which has been targeted so frequently by protests that the city passed a law in 2021 creating a 10-foot-wide buffer zone.\nThe new Kentucky law also requires new reporting that will violate patient privacy, providing women with no protection against having their identities exposed through the information submitted by the clinics, the abortion-rights groups said.\nOpponents also condemned the new law for failing to make exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. \u201cThose are violent crimes,\u201d Democratic Rep. Rachel Roberts said. \u201cThis bill forces those women to be violated again.\u201d\nWith this law, Kentucky now aims to ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, replacing the 20-week limit in the state code.\nThe 15-week ban is modeled after a\u00a0Mississippi law the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0is considering in a case that could dramatically limit abortion rights in many states. The law\u2019s supporters wanted Kentucky\u2019s stricter ban in place in case the Mississippi law is upheld. In\u00a0Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0signed a 15-week abortion ban into law on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A pro-choice demonstrator holds a sign outside the United States Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2021.
