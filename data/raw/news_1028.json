PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 A judge declared most of Minnesota\u2019s restrictions on abortion unconstitutional on Monday, including the state\u2019s mandatory 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that both parents be notified before a minor can get an abortion.Ramsey County District Judge Thomas Gilligan also struck down Minnesota\u2019s requirements that only physicians can perform abortions and that abortions after the first trimester must be performed in hospitals. His order took effect immediately, meaning the limits can\u2019t be enforced.The abortion rights groups behind the lawsuit said the ruling came at a crucial time, just over two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion across the country. Providers have been preparing for a surge in patients from neighboring upper Midwest states, and even farther away, where abortion has become illegal or is expected to become restricted.\n\n\u201cIt underscores that Minnesota has the need to serve as a leader in providing abortion care to millions that will need it across the country, especially those in our region,\u201d said Erin Maye Quade, advocacy director for Gender Justice. Removing those \u201conerous barriers\u201d will lead to even more people coming to Minnesota for abortion care, she added. \nGilligan ruled that the state\u2019s restrictions were unconstitutional under a landmark 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling known as Doe v. Gomez, which held that the state constitution protects abortion rights. The judge called that case \u201csignificant and historic\u201d and said it\u2019s unaffected by the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese abortion laws violate the right to privacy because they infringe upon the fundamental right under the Minnesota Constitution to access abortion care and do not withstand strict scrutiny,\u201d Gilligan wrote.\n\nThe judge also drew a distinction between the Gomez case and last month\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling. \u201cUnlike the Dobbs Court, which threw out nearly fifty years of precedent, this court must respect the precedent set by the Minnesota Supreme Court in Gomez and that precedent will guide this court\u2019s decisions in this case,\u201d Gilligan wrote. Under the laws Gilligan struck down, physicians were required at the start of the 24-hour waiting period to provide information to the patient about the risks of the procedure, the probable gestational age of the fetus, the risks of carrying the pregnancy to term, and fetal pain. The laws also required disclosure about welfare benefits that might be available for prenatal care, childbirth and neonatal care, and that the father would be liable for child support.The ruling means that no parental consent is needed for a minor to get an abortion in Minnesota. Gilligan noted that minors had been otherwise free to make their own reproductive and other health care decisions in the state, without notifying a parent.In about the only victory for supporters of the restrictions, the judge let stand the state\u2019s data reporting requirements for abortion providers. But he he struck down a provision imposing felony criminal penalties on those that fail to report their data. \n\nOpponents of abortion rights condemned the decision as judicial activism. Speaking to reporters, Republican attorney general candidate Jim Schultz called on Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison to appeal the ruling and accused him of failing in his duty to aggressively to defend state laws that were adopted by the Legislature.\u201cThey went about the defense of these statutes in a half-hearted manner because Keith Ellison, as always, puts his personal beliefs above Minnesota law,\u201d Schultz said. While Ellison is an abortion rights supporter, and has said he would have voted against the restrictions back when he was a legislator, he acknowledged previously that his office had an obligation to defend the restrictions. He said he has not decided whether to appeal.\u201cMy team and I are reviewing the 140-page decision and are beginning to consult with our clients about any next steps,\u201d the attorney general said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Judge Gilligan, who has had this case for three years, has put much thought into this decision that he clearly did not take lightly.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s largest anti-abortion group, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, also condemned the ruling.\u201cThe laws challenged in this case are common sense measures that support and empower pregnant women,\u201d MCCL said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling striking them down is extreme and without a foundation in the Minnesota Constitution. It blocks Minnesotans from enacting reasonable protections for unborn children and their mothers.\u201dBut groups behind the lawsuit said the ruling will benefit patients from restrictive states who are now expected to come to Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWith abortion bans in half the country set to take effect in the coming weeks and months, it is more important than ever to leverage protections in state constitutions like Minnesota\u2019s,\u201d Amanda Allen, senior counsel and director at the Lawyering Project, said in a statement. \u201cMinnesota has the chance to be a safe place for people amidst this national public health crisis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
