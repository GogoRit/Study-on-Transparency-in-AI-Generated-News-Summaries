The legislation is called the Reproductive Freedom Act (RFA). (WABE/Jess Mador)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Assembly Democrats are introducing legislation that would safeguard abortion access in Georgia.\u00a0\nThe Reproductive Freedom Act calls for repealing House Bill 481\u2019s abortion restrictions and expanding Georgia\u2019s network of abortion providers.\nIt would also allow more health insurance plans, including state employee health plans and Medicaid plans, to cover abortion services.\nDozens of abortion-rights supporters packed the Capitol Tuesday for the legislation\u2019s unveiling.\nThe bill was created in conjunction with the Amplify Georgia coalition of abortion-rights organizations and medical providers. \nThe coalition includes several plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging H.B. 481 on constitutional grounds. \u00a0\n\u201cSeventy percent of Georgia wants abortion access. We are here to demand that this is what we want as a vision for the future of abortion care in this state,\u201d said Sandy Springs Democratic State Rep. Shea Roberts, who co-sponsored the legislation.\u00a0\nRoberts spoke publicly last year about her own experience deciding to end a pregnancy more than a decade ago. She said her doctors recommended termination because of serious pregnancy complications. \nUnder Georgia\u2019s abortion restrictions, she said patients in similar situations today could face risky delays in treatment. \n\u201cNow, under our current abortion ban, doctors are consulting with their attorneys before advising their patients,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re being forced to gauge when a pregnant patient is just close enough to death before administering lifesaving care or be faced with potential prosecution. This is dangerous and it has to stop now. Abortion care is health care and it should be treated as such.\u201d\nOpponents of abortion rights in Georgia say the state\u2019s law prohibiting abortions after around 6-weeks of pregnancy also allows for exceptions for miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, and does not harm pregnant women or interfere with patient care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAn appeal in the lawsuit over H.B. 481 is set to be heard in March at the Supreme Court of Georgia.\u00a0\u00a0\nAtlanta Democratic State Sen. Sally Harrell cosponsored the bill on the Senate side.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Legislature\n\nFeb 8, 2023\nGeorgia Senate: Make it a felony to pay for sex or to pimp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Legislature\n\nFeb 8, 2023\nGeorgia lawmakers seek to regulate solar panel installers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Legislature\n\nFeb 7, 2023\nGeorgia Senate leaders to investigate European trip spending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid\n\nDems press Kemp on handling of Medicaid \u2018unwinding\u2019 after thousands of Georgia kids lose health coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Legislature\n\nGeorgia lawmakers advance bills to give those convicted of minor crimes easier path to work, housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFani Willis\n\nTrump seeks to appeal decision not to disqualify district attorney from Georgia election case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection\n\nFormer Georgia Lt.
