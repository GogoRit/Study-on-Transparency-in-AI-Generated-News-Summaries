(LEX 18) \u2014 Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has announced his office will join 18 states in filing an amicus brief before the U.S. Supreme Court. The states support upholding Mississippi\u2019s law banning abortion at 15 weeks.In the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Mississippi's sole abortion clinic, Cameron's office says the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit wrongly invalidated Mississippi's 15-week law, which their state legislature passed.\"The Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s standard for evaluating state abortion laws and denies the state of Mississippi the right to enforce the 15-week law passed by the state's legislature,\" said Attorney General Cameron. \"Invalidating Mississippi's law endangers the ability of lawmakers to legislate effectively and risks making the Supreme Court the nation's sole arbiter of the impact of medical advances on abortion laws.\"The brief argues that the court's decision contradicts previous Supreme Court rulings. Cameron's office says the ruling also conflicts with Roe v. Wade, which itself recognized that state legislatures may respond to evolving medical information.Attorneys General from Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia joined General Cameron in signing the brief.You can read the brief here:\n\n\nCopyright 2020 Scripps Media, Inc.
