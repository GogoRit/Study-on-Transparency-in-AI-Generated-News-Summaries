Several weeks ago I had reported on my initial power draw investigation results covering the different display modes of the screen:\nMuch like on the Galaxy S20 series, the OnePlus 8 Pro incurs a large static power draw penalty when switching from 60Hz to 120Hz. This is a increase in the baseline power of the phone, no matter the type of content that you\u2019re displaying, and will even incur on a pure black screen.\n\nOnePlus 8 Pro Baseline Power usage (Black Screen)\nWhilst OnePlus does include refresh rate switching mechanisms based on scenarios such as video playback, the lack of a true variable refresh rate (VRR) mechanism that works on the per-frame basis and is implemented on the deeper OS and GPU driver levels, means that current generation high-refresh rate devices will have to suffer from a larger than usual power and battery life penalty.\n\nIn our web browsing test, we see the clear impact of the 120Hz refresh rate on the OnePlus 8 Pro as it reduces the battery life of the phone in the test by 22% compared to its regular 60Hz mode. As a note- we\u2019re testing at QHD resolution here as generally there\u2019s very little power benefit from using lower resolutions.\nIn terms of absolute results, the 9.71h of the 120Hz mode here are adequate but not great. The results fall in line with the S20+ at 120Hz, but short of the bigger battery capacity of the S20 Ultra. At 60Hz, the 8 Pro moves back in at 12.31h which is a great result and will get you through even the most extensive usage days.\nWhilst many will have looked forward to the OnePlus 8 Pro results, the really interesting results belong to the smaller OnePlus 8. The phone here was able to showcase outstanding battery life figures. The 90Hz mode only has an 8% impact on the battery runtime in this test, and in the 60Hz mode the phone lasted for a staggering 14h which is amongst the best results we\u2019ve ever measured on a phone.\n\nIn PCMark, the smaller OnePlus 8 again takes the lead in terms of longevity with its 60Hz mode. The 8 Pro also does quite well at 60Hz, and both phones lose respectively 15.4% and 16.4% of their runtime when switching over to 90Hz and 120Hz modes.\nWhilst the OnePlus 8 Pro pretty much fell in line with what we\u2019ve expected in terms of its battery life, falling in line with the 120Hz power behaviour of the S20 phones, it\u2019s the regular OnePlus 8 which surprised a lot given that it features a slightly smaller battery, notably surpassing the efficiency of the OnePlus 8 Pro. Given its form-factor and weight, it\u2019s easily the longest-lasting device of its class, with only other heavier, bigger battery phones being comparable in terms of battery longevity.\n\n\nDisplay Measurement\nCamera Recap - Amongst The Best\n\nIntroduction & Design\nSystem Performance\nGPU Performance\nDisplay Measurement\nBattery Life - Excellent & Adequate\nCamera Recap - Amongst The Best\nVideo Recording\nConclusion & End Remarks\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n92 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\njaju123 - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link\nHi Andrei thanks for the review.Did you encounter the low brightness green tint issue on the OP8 Pro? I haven't seen any mention of it here.Thanks\n\n\n\nAndrei Frumusanu - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link\nI didn't have the problem on my device.\n\n\n\nMrPhilo - Tuesday, June 30, 2020 - link\nNew update has increased minimum brightness so you would not see it anymore. Installing a custom kernel and changing the brightness to lowest you will see it.\n\n\n\nFlunk - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link\nSure, if flagship means adding a bunch of pointless features and charging too much for the phone. I think reviewers failing to take value into account in reviews have to take at least some of the blame for these crazy phone prices.Oneplus' quest to make their products irrelevant has now met its totally forseen conclusion. \n\n\n\nBedfordTim - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link\nIt would be nice to see a flagship camera in something like a P30 Lite.\n\n\n\nclose - Tuesday, June 30, 2020 - link\nThat's kind of what flagship means... Manufacturers bundle the best they have and when they run out of the good stuff they start bundling trinkets, bells, whistles, ribbons... And for most people buying the flagship isn't a matter of need but of want. They have the money, they want the image, even if many of the actual features are superfluous.I think what the title actually means is that OP started up by branding the devices as \"flagship killer\", the \"80% flagship at 20% of the price\" so to speak. With OP8 they are now \"just\" a flagship. As an OP owner I have a hard time justifying 700-1000E for this. That's not to say it's bad but it doesn't stand out of \"the pack\" (overstatement, I know) of Android flagships.\n\n\n\npjcamp - Tuesday, June 30, 2020 - link\nI dunno. I see flagships subtracting options. You can't have expandable storage, you can't have a headphone jack, but you need to pay more to do without those things.\n\n\n\ns.yu - Wednesday, July 1, 2020 - link\nCouldn't agree more!\n\n\n\nRetycint - Thursday, July 2, 2020 - link\nFlagships were never meant to be good value-for-money. Not in the smartphone industry, not in the electronics industry, not ever.\n\n\n\neastcoast_pete - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link\nThanks Andrei!  I especially appreciate the section and detail on the video performance. However, that leaves me with a question: so, which phone is currently the best for video?  It seems that even the so-called flagship models all have significant problems; one has artifacts, the next doesn't do a good job on stabilizing etc.  So, which one is currently the leading candidate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSK Hynix Starts Mass Production of HBM3E: 9.2 GT/s\n\n\nNVIDIA's 'cuLitho' Computational Lithography Adopted By TSMC and Synopsys For Production Use\nStarTech Unveils 15-in-1 Thunderbolt 4/USB4 Dock with Quad Display Support\n\nQualcomm Announces Snapdragon 8s Gen 3: A Cheaper Chip For Premium Phones\nBIOSTAR Debuts Barebones A620MS mATX Motherboard For Ryzen 7000 Processors\nFirst DNA Data Storage Specification Released: First Step Towards Commercialization\nAsus Launches Low-Profile GeForce RTX 3050 6GB: A Tiny Graphics Card for All PCs\nAsus Adds Support for 64GB Memory Modules to Intel 600/700 Motherboards\nWestern Digital Launches PC SN5000S SSD: Low-Cost Meets High Performance\nNETGEAR Introduces WBE750: First Insight-Manageable Wi-Fi 7 Access Point Targets Congested Deployments\nCorsair Launches New XH405i Custom Water Cooling Kits And XG7 RTX 4080-Compatible Water Blocks\nASML Delivers First 2nm-Generation Low-NA EUV Tool, the Twinscan NXE:3800E\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
