(AP) \u2014 After acknowledging that murder is already a crime, the West Virginia Senate on Monday passed a bill to penalize physicians who don\u2019t provide medical care to a baby born after an abortion attempt.\nSenators unanimously approved the measure following lone testimony from a Democrat who said lawmakers have wasted time angling for political points on a bill that has no impact instead of working on the state\u2019s more serious problems.\n\u201cA child born alive who would somehow be killed, that would be murder. It would clearly be murder, there\u2019s nobody doing that and if they do do it they\u2019re in jail,\u201d said Harrison County Sen. Mike Romano, adding that the bill \u201cisn\u2019t going to change anything.\u201d\nThe bill, dubbed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, subjects medical professionals to discipline from their licensing board if they do not care for a child born after an abortion procedure.\nREAD MORE:\u00a0Judge strikes down new federal abortion rule\nIn a previous debate, some Republicans in the House of Delegates conceded that the bill is more about sending a political message than solving an ongoing problem, especially since existing laws already protect newborns and that the state bans abortions after 20 weeks. One Independent delegate has also noted that laws about providing medical care could change.\nThe House must approve minor amendments to the bill before it goes to the office of Gov. Jim Justice, whose spokesman didn\u2019t return a voicemail seeking comment on whether the Republican would sign it into law.\nElizabeth Nash, state policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, has said such proposals are often employed around election seasons to \u201cgin up the base in some way.\u201d\nA similar measure was vetoed last year by North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor, who said the proposal was unnecessary and that newborn babies are already protected by existing laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                The southern view of the West Virginia Capitol taken from the Kanawha River banks.
