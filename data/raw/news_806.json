Wade was overturned \u2014 Republican lawmakers are pushing for further restrictions on reproductive health, even in states where abortion is already banned.\u00a0\nBut fissures are already emerging. Now, anti-abortion lawmakers must decide if they will push new abortion bans \u2014 a subject of debate among some abortion opponents \u2014 if they will amend existing bans to allow for abortions in cases of rape or incest, or if they will move to other reproductive health issues such as contraception. Abortion opponents have struggled to agree on all of them, especially with total abortion bans proving unpopular among voters.\n\u201cWe will see this split in the Republican Party around following essentially their base, which wants to ban abortion without any exceptions, and the larger public,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNear-total abortion bans are in effect in 13 states, and others have limited access: In Georgia, the procedure is banned for people later than six weeks of pregnancy, and in Florida and Arizona, it is banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Bans in seven other states have been temporarily blocked but could take effect pending state court rulings.\u00a0\nWith Republicans controlling the U.S. House, federal abortion legislation \u2014 whether a ban or national protection \u2014 is unlikely to pass. State legislatures are the likeliest source of new abortion policy, and most work only part-time, meeting to consider bills for a few months either every year or every other year. The legislative year typically starts in January, but lawmakers are starting to prefile bills, offering a first glimpse into what they hope to accomplish next year.\u00a0\nWatching the state lines\nTwo bills in Texas, one of the few states that has bills prefiled, show how legislation could prevent people from leaving the state to access abortion.\nRepublican lawmakers have put forth a bill that would prohibit government entities from giving someone money that might be used to travel out of state for an abortion. Another bill would eliminate state tax breaks for businesses in the state that help cover their employees\u2019 travel costs associated with getting an abortion outside of the state.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

If you have any questions, contact us at [email\u00a0protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough no other states have similar bills yet, those could, if passed, offer a model for other states seeking to restrict abortion access further without directly banning interstate travel. Texas has already banned abortion completely, and it was the first state to eliminate access to abortions after six weeks, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned.\u00a0\nIn Missouri \u2014 which, prior to Roe\u2019s overturn had some of the most restrictive abortion policies in the country \u2014 lawmakers have begun to pre-file bills intended to keep people from accessing abortion. The procedure is already banned there, but no state law prevents people from getting medication abortion pills from another state, or from traveling out of state for an abortion.\nIf passed, these bills could change that. One would make it a felony to transport drugs that are intended to be used to induce an abortion, though the bill would not criminalize pregnant people. (Similar legislation last year did not pass.) Another bill would treat a fetus as a person \u2014 legislation that could effectively equate abortion with murder. Both could pass this session, Nash said, though it\u2019s hard to tell what abortion bills lawmakers will prioritize until they come back to the capitol.\nEmergency contraception access\nIn states with abortion bans in place, some lawmakers and lobbyists, notably in Idaho and Missouri, have expressed interest in limiting access to some forms of emergency contraception such as Plan B. Major anti-abortion groups, such as Students for Life and several state-based chapters of the Right to Life organization, also oppose the so-called morning-after pill.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not clear if those types of restrictions will gain traction \u2014 at least immediately. In a recording obtained by ProPublica of a meeting between anti-abortion organizations and Tennessee lawmakers, some abortion opponents suggested legislators hold off on passing contraception regulations for at least a few years, until outrage over state abortion bans had abated.\u00a0\nThe Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion lobbying group, will be working closely with state legislatures on a handful of issues this year, said state policy director Katie Glenn. Glenn, one of the people present at that meeting, told The 19th that Plan B restrictions are not something she has heard as \u201ca mainstream Republican or pro-life view.\u201d\nAnti-abortion protesters attend a rally for  reproductive rights at the Texas Capitol in May 2022.\n (Montinique Monroe/Getty Images)\nFurther restrictions\nIn some states where abortion is not yet banned \u2014 including Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida \u2014 there will likely be renewed discussion over further limiting when in pregnancy people can get abortions. In all four states, Republicans control the legislatures, though North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor could veto some proposed restrictions.\u00a0\n\u201cA year ago, Roe v. Wade was very limiting and now we\u2019re going to have a lot more of a conversation about where states want their laws to end up,\u201d Glenn said.\nFlorida legislators have already said they intend to pass a new abortion ban this year, though it\u2019s not yet clear how early in pregnancy they will limit the procedure. In South Carolina, whose six-week ban has been blocked by state courts, legislators came to an impasse this summer over the details of their proposed near-total abortion ban \u2014 specifically whether to include exceptions for people pregnant because of rape or incest. (In practice, such exceptions don\u2019t actually work. Still, laws without any exception whatsoever have proven to be exceptionally unpopular with voters.)\n\u201cThis is the split in the party that is creating a problem for them. They can\u2019t get their people in line,\u201d Nash said. \u201cIs that going to continue? Or are people going to essentially get beaten into submission by leadership or the governor?\u201d\nBeyond gestational limits, the Susan B. Anthony List also intends to focus on curtailing access to medication abortions, the two-drug regimen used to terminate a first-trimester pregnancy. In states where abortion remains legal, that could mean laws banning people from getting medication abortions through telemedicine, in which pills are sent through the mail and a patient consults with a medical provider virtually. The practice is endorsed by medical experts as well as the Food and Drug Administration and World Health Organization.\u00a0\nMedication abortions are the most commonly used method for people seeking to end a pregnancy. Pills taken from home can be easier to manage than traveling out of state for an abortion, which can cost hundreds of dollars and require time off work, explaining one\u2019s absence to friends and family and setting up days\u2019 worth of child care \u2014 often insurmountable barriers for people seeking to terminate a pregnancy.\nMedication abortions have also become far more prevalent in states where abortion is illegal; people in Texas have been able to acquire medication from Mexico, and research shows that people across the country living in states with abortion bans have had the pills mailed from European health care providers.\u00a0\nAbortion opponents are also seeking a way to limit people\u2019s ability to get those pills, particularly by leaning on state law enforcement to block access to medication abortions. But it\u2019s not yet clear how they might do that, or what kinds of laws state legislators might pass.\u00a0\nCriminalization of abortion\nLast spring, Louisiana lawmakers debated whether to pass a law treating abortion as murder, a definition that would have criminalized people who get abortions. But that bill failed to gain traction, and it\u2019s not clear if anti-abortion lawmakers will pursue similar legislation this year. Abortion bans typically do not directly punish the pregnant person, and only a handful of states have laws explicitly penalizing people who acquire an abortion outside the medical system.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to try to put some kind of guardrails to limit access to care, some kind of penalty,\u201d Nash said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would be [treating abortion as] murder versus something else that might be more palatable.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nState lawmakers prepare for a future without Roe v.
