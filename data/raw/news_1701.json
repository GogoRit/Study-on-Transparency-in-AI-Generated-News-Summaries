And with a new chief justice and two new members on the seven-person court following last year\u2019s general election, there\u2019s still no clarity over whether the temporary bans on abortion could be lifted or kept in place.According to a court spokesperson, the new court can still rule on the case without scheduling a new round of oral arguments, though justices can still request additional arguments.The court heard arguments last November on multiple challenges to the state\u2019s 2019 trigger law, which outlaws abortions in all but life-threatening cases after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, and a separate law that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.The ACLU sued to block the bans on behalf of the state\u2019s two abortion providers, EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center and Planned Parenthood.The providers and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is defending the bans in court, are either mum on the issue, or aren\u2019t sure what happens next.Angela Cooper, communications director for the ACLU of Kentucky, which is representing the providers, said it\u2019s unclear when a decision will come in.\u201cOur legal team continues to prepare to litigate the case as the case is ongoing. We really hoped to get a decision from the court before the new year. That didn\u2019t happen so they could issue the decision at any time, or they could ask us to reargue in front of the new justices, that\u2019s also a possibility,\u201d she said.Cameron did not respond to requests for comment.Abortion rights advocates and providers filed the lawsuit last summer after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision allowed abortion bans to go into effect in states like Kentucky.The challenge seeks to overturn Kentucky\u2019s abortion bans by arguing there is a right to abortion under the state constitution.Though a trial court initially blocked the bans while the lawsuit proceeded, abortion access has been almost totally cut off in Kentucky since August. That\u2019s when the state Court of Appeals ruled the bans could be enforced while the legal challenges continue. The Kentucky Supreme Court later upheld that decision, and agreed to hear an appeal of the preliminary ruling.Justices heard arguments in the case on Nov. 15, one week after Kentucky voters rejected a referendum to add anti-abortion language to the state constitution. The proposal would have made it harder for the reproductive rights advocates\u2019 case, which is seeking to enshrine abortion rights under the state\u2019s fundamental legal document.Former Chief Justice John Minton\u2019s chief of staff Katie Shepherd told the Lexington Herald Leader in October that the court couldn\u2019t definitively say the case would be decided before the end of last year, but \u201cit is always the intent that the Court that hears a case will decide that case.\u201dNorthern Kentucky University constitutional law professor Kenneth Katkin said it\u2019s unusual that the high court is taking a long time over a temporary injunction hearing regardless of how high profile the case.\u201cTime is of the essence. It is an emergency motion and every day that they don\u2019t decide, that provides the possibility that there\u2019s women in Kentucky who have a constitutional right to reproductive rights who are being denied that right. They haven\u2019t said anything about it, and I would call this delay a dereliction of duty,\u201d Katkin said.New justicesThe court that rules on the case will not be the same as the one that heard the case.Since oral arguments over the abortion ban took place, Chief Justice John Minton and Justice Lisabeth Hughes have retired. They were replaced by two new associate justices, Angela McCormick Bisig and Kelly Thompson, who won their new jobs during last year\u2019s general election.Justice Laurance VanMeter, who was first elected in 2016 and previously served on the Court of Appeals for a decade, is the high court\u2019s new chief justice.Al Cross, a longtime journalist and director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, said the Supreme Court was already divided, but having two new members could make reaching a final ruling more complicated.\u201cIn this case you have a very fractured court, a very important issue and two new justices,\u201d he said \u201cOne or both of them might see a gap in the arguments or brief that they would like to see filled in another argument or oral briefing,\u201d Cross said.Former Justice Bill Cunningham, who served on the court from 2007 to 2019, said he was surprised that a decision had not been reached before the new justices were sworn in.\u201cWe don\u2019t get two new justices everyday, but it\u2019s very unusual to get a rehearing or a delay on a temporary injunction case, because we\u2019re not ruling on whether abortion is enshrined in the constitution. It\u2019s a high profile case, but it didn\u2019t need to take this much time,\u201d he said.\u201cIt does not take this long to resolve a temporary injunction matter, however high profile the case.\u201dThough the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will only extend to whether Kentucky\u2019s abortion bans should be enforced while the lawsuit takes place, the case will be the first time the court has weighed in on the issue in the wake of Dobbs. The larger question of whether Kentucky\u2019s abortion bans are constitutional is still pending in Jefferson Circuit Court. That case still has to make its way through the judicial system.Where abortion in Kentucky standsIt\u2019s unclear how the court will rule,but during oral arguments, some justices grilled Kentucky Solicitor General Matt Kuhn, who defended the abortion ban.Kuhn argued that the court should reject the challenge because abortion isn\u2019t mentioned in the state constitution.\u201c[The constitution] is not pro-choice or pro-life, so the question must be left to the General Assembly. That Kentuckian who wants abortion rights should pick up the phone and call their assembly member,\" he said.Some justices voiced skepticism of Kuhn\u2019s arguments, pointing out that the Kentucky Constitution was ratified in 1891, before women even had the right to vote.If the court upholds the bans, Kentucky abortions would remain banned in all cases except to save the life of the pregnant person, and providing an unlawful abortion would remain a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.But if the court were to rule in favor of EMW and Planned Parenthood, abortion access would be expanded by temporarily blocking the six-week ban and trigger law. But the state has other abortion bans on the books, including one forbidding the procedure after the 15th week of pregnancy.Lawmakers passed the 15-week ban earlier last year, mirroring the Mississippi law that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in its Dobbs decision.Kentucky\u2019s version of the 15-week ban was not challenged in state court, though a federal lawsuit over the measure is ongoing.Republican lawmakers have said they are mulling new abortion legislation, and some have floated the possibility of creating exceptions to allow the procedure in cases of rape and incest.In a statement, Republican Senate President Robert Stivers said it\u2019s unclear whether lawmakers will try to pass more abortion restrictions. That will depend on how the court rules.\u201cWhat legislation may or may not be necessary is unclear until the court makes its decision,\u201d Stivers said. \u201cWhile nothing prevents individual lawmakers from introducing legislation, Senate leadership\u2019s perspective is that the Kentucky Supreme Court must first speak on the matter. Kentuckians are overwhelmingly pro-life and the Kentucky General Assembly has been a leader in championing legislation to protect the life of the unborn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNews\nabortionreproductive rightsKentucky Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivya Karthikeyan\n\n\n\n\n\n                        See stories by Divya Karthikeyan\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit seeks to kick Louisville Democratic state Rep.
