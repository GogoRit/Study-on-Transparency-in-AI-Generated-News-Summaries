It\u2019s intended to free up personal protective equipment \u2014 like masks and gowns \u2014 and hospital beds.Louisiana joins Texas, Ohio and Mississippi in banning most abortions during the pandemic.Reproductive health advocates have slammed the move. They say abortion is an essential health care service \u2014 one that can\u2019t be delayed \u2014 and accuse states of using the pandemic as an excuse to ban abortions. They argue that abortion procedures use a limited amount of equipment. Nationally, about 0.01 percent of abortions require follow-up care at a hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNews\ncoronavirusCOVID-19public healthreproductive rightsAbortion\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRosemary Westwood\n\n\n                \n                    Rosemary Westwood is the public and reproductive health reporter for WWNO/WRKF.
