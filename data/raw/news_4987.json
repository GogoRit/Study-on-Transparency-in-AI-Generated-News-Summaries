Wade.\nImpact Research conducted the ACLU-commissioned poll earlier this month, finding 55% of respondents opposed the proposed ban and 40% of respondents supported it. Results show an even more significant gap in intensity. Strong opposition to the ban outpaced strong support by a 20-point margin.\nThe release of the poll comes while Nebraska state senators are considering a request to pull the so-called \u201ctrigger ban\u201d LB933 out of committee, which could set up debate in the near future.\u00a0\nACLU of Nebraska Legal and Policy Counsel Scout Richters said the Nebraska Legislature should pay attention to the findings.\n\u201cFrom the packed committee hearings to the results of this poll, Nebraskans have been clear that we don\u2019t want state senators banning abortion,\u201d Richters said. \u201cWe know this ban would fall hardest on our neighbors who already face barriers to health care, including Nebraskans who are working to make ends meet, rural Nebraskans, Nebraskans of color and young Nebraskans. It\u2019s time for state senators to start recognizing the impact and to stop the bans. No one should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will or to leave the state to get the care they need. Abortion is still safe and legal in Nebraska, and it must stay that way.\u201d\nAmong the poll\u2019s other findings:\n\nState senators could face political consequences if they support the bill. The poll found 46% of respondents would be less likely to vote for a candidate who supports a ban on all abortions compared to 32% of respondents who said a candidate\u2019s support of a total ban would make them more likely to support the candidate.\n55% of respondents said the U.S. Supreme Court should not overturn Roe v. Wade compared to 34% who said it should be overturned.\nWhen asked to choose which issues state senators should be prioritizing, only 13% of respondents selected limiting abortion access as one of their top two choices out of seven provided issues. Respondents were much more likely to say legislators should be focused on reducing property taxes (44%) and helping families deal with rising costs (39%).\u00a0\n\nImpact Research surveyed 500 registered Nebraska voters from March 2 - 7. Respondents were evenly distributed across Nebraska\u2019s three congressional districts to ensure geographic representation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeople Power \nView Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentspdfimpact_-_aclu_ne_summary_memo_final.pdf\npdfbaseline_aclu_ne_abortion_poll_mar_2022.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch aclunebraska.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Assistance\nPress\nCareers\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 ACLU of Nebraska\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
