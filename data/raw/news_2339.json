Trump and an anti-abortion Senate majority in 2020.\n    \n\n            The group Susan B. Anthony List and its super PAC Women Speak Out PAC unveiled a campaign that \u201cwill include boots on the ground, voter contact mail, phone calls, and digital ads, and is part of the organizations\u2019 overall $52 million budget for the 2020 cycle,\u201d according to a press release. SBA List has long been a strong Trump ally \u2013 the group\u2019s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, served as the national chairwoman of the 2016 Trump campaign\u2019s Pro-life Coalition. \n    \n\n            The group\u2019s announcement suggests a 2020 funding showdown over abortion rights brewing between rival advocacy groups. Planned Parenthood unveiled a $45 million 2020 electoral program in October focusing on battleground states \u2013 the group\u2019s self-identified largest program to date. \n    \n\n            SBA List\u2019s ground team \u201cwill expand in phases to Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin and will make four million visits to voters overall before Election Day,\u201d the press release continued. The group currently has about 200 canvassers working in Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, and has made more than 460,000 home visits so far in battleground states, according to a memo on the campaign.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe stakes of this election could not be higher,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, national spokeswoman for SBA List and its super PAC, adding that \u201cPresident Trump has governed as the most pro-life president in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n    \n\n            Quigley also falsely claimed that Democrats favor infanticide \u2013 the practice of killing a child after it has been born. Although Democrats widely support abortion rights, no candidate has expressed such a position.\n    \n\n            She indicated that the group would target demographics that historically backed Democrats.\n    \n\n            \u201cFrom now until Election Day, our team will go door-to-door visiting traditional Democrat voter groups who may simply be unaware of the Democrats\u2019 support for extreme pro-abortion policies,\u201d Quigley continued. \u201cOur focused, battle-tested voter outreach method will ensure we reach the voters who can provide President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates the winning margin on Election Day.\u201d\n    \n\n            Trump and SBA List have shown mutual support on several fronts. The group has cheered the administration\u2019s surge of judicial nominees and Department of Health and Human Services measures to regulate or restrict abortion access, as well as condemned the impeachment inquiry. Trump offered a keynote address at the group\u2019s Campaign for Life Gala in 2018. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
