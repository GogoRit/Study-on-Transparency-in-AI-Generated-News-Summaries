Norma McCorvey, the \"Jane Roe\" of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous \"conversion\" to anti-abortion\u00a0activism was a con job.\nMcCorvey\u00a0told\u00a0filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, \"AKA Jane Roe,\"\u00a0\"I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.\"\nFor pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey's \"conversion\" as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don't want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless \"abortion industry.\"\nMcCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too\u00a0feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was \"saved\" by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can't be trusted with autonomy, and need \"godly\" men to guide them.\u00a0\n(Benham, a supposedly wise and \"pro-life\"\u00a0guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among\u00a0the protesters, clinic staff\u00a0and the pregnant people seeking care.)\u00a0\nHaving spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey's \"conversion\" was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped,\u00a0even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn't try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn't seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended\u00a0a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.\u00a0\nSo yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers \u2014 nearly half a million dollars over the years \u2014 sounds about right.\nBut the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn't about McCorvey's character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It's no\u00a0exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire\u00a0raison d'\u00eatre is telling lies \u2014 often over-the-top, melodramatic lies \u2014 in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the \"right\" of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.\u00a0\nThe anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become\u00a0one big, long con.\u00a0\nThe over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them\u00a0too closely, likely out of fear that they're actually too ridiculous to be believed.\nFor instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that\u00a0doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a\u00a0baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek\u00a0\u2014 a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a \"delicacy\"\u00a0\u2014 claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)\nTo bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have \"survived\" abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have\u00a0no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice \"testimony\" is all to often as McCorvey described it: \"[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.\"\nBut this \"born alive\" mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump's weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable\u00a0that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.\nThe \"baby parts\" debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group\u00a0sober-minded devout Christians who just love \"life,\" but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.\u00a0\nA series of \"undercover\" videos purporting to \"prove\" that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling \"baby parts\" out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden\u00a0in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would\u00a0turn out to be\u00a0bullshit, but\u00a0too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by\u00a0their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as\u00a0serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.\u00a0\nSure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn't sell baby parts.\"\u00a0They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research \u2014 research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been\u00a0altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden\u00a0and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.\u00a0\nThis myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when\u00a0anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest\u00a0buffer zone around clinics by claiming\u00a0they were merely \"sidewalk counselors\" trying to \"help\" women.\nAn investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They're a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.\u00a0\n\"If women want careers and education and everything and they don't want children,\" one protester complained to Filipovic, \"what are they doing having sex?\"\nAnother complained that \"there were no problems\" back when women\u00a0\"had to be obedient to their husbands.\"\nInstead of contraception, a protester argued, \"the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.\"\nThe court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters\u00a0merely wished to \"counsel\" women.\u00a0\nAnti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they're righteous warriors\u00a0going up against a sleazy \"abortion industry\" and trying to \"save\" women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.\u00a0\nIn truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them\u00a0of their rights and subjugate them\u00a0both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stand with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny\u00a0and lurid fantasy.\nThe press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are\u00a0trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers\u00a0literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie\u00a0will help open up some eyes.\u00a0\nBut it's also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually\u00a0about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don't want or can't bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It's a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amanda Marcotte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Marcotte is a senior politics writer at Salon and the author of \"Troll Nation: How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Rat-F*cking Liberals, America, and Truth Itself.\" Follow her on Twitter\u00a0@AmandaMarcotte\u00a0and sign up for her biweekly politics newsletter, Standing Room Only.\nMORE FROM Amanda Marcotte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics   ------------------------------------------\nAbortion\nAka Jane Roe\nAnti-choice Movement\nCommentary\nEditor's Picks\nNorma Mccorvey\nPlanned Parenthood\nPro-choice\nRoe V.
