They argue that the right for people to make decisions about their bodies \u2013 including abortions \u2013 is guaranteed by the Indiana Constitution, specifically its right to liberty.\n\nREAD MORE: Judge blocks Indiana abortion ban week after it took effect\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\r\n\tA county judge agreed, halting the law in September. It\u2019s remained blocked since, during the appeals process. The Indiana Supreme Court is now set to determine the issue, hearing arguments in the case Thursday.\n\r\n\tThere\u2019s no indication yet how long the justices might take to make a ruling.\n\nContact reporter Brandon at\u00a0bsmith@ipbs.org or follow him on Twitter at @brandonjsmith5.\n\r\n\tCopyright 2023 IPB News.
