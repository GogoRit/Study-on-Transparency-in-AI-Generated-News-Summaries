People Human Rights Watch interviewed said that gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and nonbinary people were subject to increased violence based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender women are often perceived as gay men in Syria and are targeted for the same reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\u201cThey Treated Us in Monstrous Ways\u201d\n\n\nSexual Violence Against Men, Boys, and Transgender Women in the Syrian Conflict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the full report in English\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGay and bisexual men, transgender women, and nonbinary people said they were targeted for sexual violence during Syria\u2019s conflict for being perceived as \u2018soft\u2019.\u201d said Zeynep P\u0131nar Erdem, fellow in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights program at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. \u201cMen and boys \u2013 regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 are vulnerable to sexual violence in Syria and often remain unseen and without the support all survivors of sexual violence urgently need.\u201d\nHuman Rights Watch conducted interviews in Lebanon with 40 gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and nonbinary individuals, as well as four heterosexual men who experienced sexual violence in Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMany people have been subjected to sexual violence during Syria's civil war, resulting in ongoing trauma. Men and transgender women are particularly vulnerable. Z. P\u0131nar Erdem, the Promise Institute for International Human Rights Fellow at Human Rights Watch, discusses her new report, and how we can help these sexual violence survivors.\n\n\n    READ THE INTERVIEW\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewees said they were harassed and sexually abused at checkpoints because they were \u201csoft looking,\u201d meaning perceived as effeminate in this context. In detention centers, detainees were subject to intensified interrogation or torture if their sexual or gender identity was exposed. Sexual violence also took place within the ranks of the Syrian army. Interviewees described being subject to rape, genital violence, threat of rape, forced nudity, and sexual harassment.\nSurvivors told Human Rights Watch that they did not seek medical or mental health services in Syria for many reasons, including shame, fear, and stigma, and a lack of trust in the health care system. The survivors who fled to Lebanon told Human Rights Watch they found limited services and inadequate support from humanitarian organizations that are often poorly funded and not equipped to meet the needs of male survivors of sexual violence. Service providers often lack training in response to male survivors and some belittle them, which contributes to poor treatment and re-traumatization of those seeking help.\nSurvivors described a range of emotional and psychological symptoms, including symptoms consistent with depression, post-traumatic stress, sexual trauma, loss of hope, and paranoid thoughts. They also suffer physically, including severe pain in their rectum and genitals, rectal bleeding, and muscle pain, and may have contracted sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.\nIn 2013, the UN Security Council for the first time stated in Security Council Resolution 2106 that conflict-related sexual violence also affects men and boys. The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and nongovernmental organizations, including All Survivors Project, the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, Lawyers & Doctors for Human Rights, and the Refugee Law Project, have provided significant documentation on the nature and extent of sexual violence perpetrated against men and boys in Syria and elsewhere, and the specific needs of male survivors.\nIn March 2018, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic published a report with detailed evidence on sexual violence against men and boys in Syria. On April 23, 2019, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 2467 on conflict-related sexual violence, which recognizes that men and boys are targets of sexual violence in both conflict and post-conflict settings. Resolution 2467 acknowledges the need for enhanced medical and mental health support for survivors and calls on UN member countries to ensure that they receive nondiscriminatory access to medical and psychosocial care based on their needs.\nHumanitarian organizations and service providers in Lebanon should provide targeted medical services, including mental health support, to both male and female survivors of sexual violence. They should train their staff including case managers, social workers, and frontline medical workers on the specific needs of men, boys, and transgender women.\n\u201cMen and boys and trans women can experience deep shame, stigma, and silence due to sexual violence. It is vital to challenge the social and cultural assumptions that they should be invulnerable,\u201d said Erdem. \u201cServices need to be funded, and tailored to support their access and care, without diverting funding from services for women and girls.\u201d\nSelected Quotes from Survivors:\nYousef, a 28-year-old gay man, was detained by the Syrian intelligence agencies. He told Human Rights Watch that he was not detained because he was gay, but once his sexual orientation was revealed, sexual violence during interrogations increased drastically:\n\n\nAll the aggression was multiplied by 10 I would say. They were happily doing it. They were of course raping us with sticks. They rape you just to see you suffering, shouting. To see you are humiliated. This is what they like to see. They had a stick inside my anus, and they started saying, \u2018This is what you like, don\u2019t you like it?\u2019 It went up till my stomach.\n\n\nNaila, a 21-year-old transgender woman described being gang raped in a central prison as a minor:\n\n\nThey brought the stick of a mop and they inserted it in our anus. A strong bleeding started, and we were mutilated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nLebanon Syria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights Sexual Violence and Rape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 6, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nTunisia: Two-Year Sentence for Homosexuality \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 12, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nBrazil: Protect Sexual, Reproductive Rights in Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThey Treated Us in Monstrous Ways\u201d\n\n\nSexual Violence Against Men, Boys, and Transgender Women in the Syrian Conflict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 6, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nTunisia: Two-Year Sentence for Homosexuality \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 12, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nBrazil: Protect Sexual, Reproductive Rights in Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
