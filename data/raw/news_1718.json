(AP) \u2014 From beach cities to snow-covered streets, abortion supporters rallied by the thousands on Sunday to demand protections for reproductive rights and mark the 50th anniversary of the now-overturned Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision that established federal protections for the procedure.The reversal of Roe in June unleashed a flurry of legislation in the states, dividing them between those that have restricted or banned abortion and those that have sought to defend access. The Women\u2019s March, galvanized during Donald Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration in 2017 amid a national reckoning over sexual assaults, said it has refocused on state activism after Roe was tossed.\u201cThis fight is bigger than Roe,\u201d Women\u2019s March said in a tweet. \u201cThey thought that we would stay home and that this would end with Roe \u2014 they were wrong.\u201d\n\nA dozen Republican-governed states have implemented sweeping bans on abortion, and several others seek to do the same. But those moves have been offset by gains on the other side. Abortion opponents were defeated in votes on ballot measures in Kansas, Michigan and Kentucky. State courts have blocked several bans from taking effect. Myriad efforts are underway to help patients travel to states that allow abortions or use medication for self-managed abortions. And some Democratic-led states have taken steps to shield patients and providers from lawsuits originating in states where the procedure is banned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Assembly passes a $2 billion tax cut package.

But freshly energized anti-abortion activists are increasingly turning their attention to Congress, with the aim of pushing for a potential national abortion restriction down the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday\u2019s main march was held in Wisconsin, where upcoming elections could determine the state Supreme Court\u2019s power balance and future abortion rights. But rallies took place in dozens of cities, including Florida\u2019s state capital of Tallahassee, where Vice President Kamala Harris gave a fiery speech before a boisterous crowd.\n\n\u201cCan we truly be free if families cannot make intimate decisions about the course of their own lives?\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd can we truly be free if so-called leaders claim to be ... \u2018on the vanguard of freedom\u2019 while they dare to restrict the rights of the American people and attack the very foundations of freedom?\u201dIn Madison, thousands of abortion rights supporters donned coats and gloves to march in below-freezing temperatures through downtown to the state Capitol.\u201cIt\u2019s just basic human rights at this point,\u201d said Alaina Gato, a Wisconsin resident who joined her mother, Meg Wheeler, on the Capitol steps to protest.They said they plan to vote in the April Supreme Court election. Wheeler also said she hoped to volunteer as a poll worker and canvass for Democrats, despite identifying as an independent voter.\u201cThis is my daughter. I want to make sure she has the right to choose whether she wants to have a child,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nBuses of protestors streamed into the Wisconsin capital from Chicago and Milwaukee, armed with banners and signs calling for the Legislature to repeal the state\u2019s ban.Eliza Bennett, a Wisconsin OBGYN who said she had to stop offering abortion services to her patients after Roe was overturned, called on lawmakers to put the choice back in the hands of women. \u201cThey should be making decisions about what\u2019s best for their health, not state legislatures,\u201d she said.Abortions are unavailable in Wisconsin due to legal uncertainties faced by abortion clinics over whether an 1849 law banning the procedure is in effect. The law, which prohibits abortion except to save the patient\u2019s life, is being challenged in court.Some also carried weapons. Lilith K., who declined to provide their last name, stood on the sidewalk alongside protestors, holding an assault rifle and wearing a tactical vest with a holstered handgun.\u201cWith everything going on with women and other people losing their rights, and with the recent shootings at Club Q and other LGBTQ night clubs, it\u2019s just a message that we\u2019re not going to take this sitting down,\u201d Lilith said.\n\nThe march also drew counter-protestors. Most held signs raising religious objections to abortion rights. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to get involved with politics. I\u2019m more interested in what the law of God says,\u201d John Goeke, a Wisconsin resident, said.In the absence of Roe v. Wade\u2019s federal protections, abortion rights have become a state-by-state patchwork.Since June, near-total bans on abortion have been implemented in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. Legal challenges are pending against several of those bans. The lone clinic in North Dakota relocated across state lines to Minnesota.\n\nBans passed by lawmakers in Ohio, Indiana and Wyoming have been blocked by state courts while legal challenges are pending. And in South Carolina, the state Supreme Court on Jan. 5 struck down a ban on abortion after six weeks, ruling the restriction violates a state constitutional right to privacy.Wisconsin\u2019s conservative-controlled Supreme Court, which for decades has issued consequential rulings in favor of Republicans, will likely hear the challenge to the 1849 ban filed in June by the state\u2019s attorney general, Josh Kaul. Races for the court are officially nonpartisan, but candidates for years have aligned with either conservatives or liberals as the contests have become expensive partisan battles.Women\u2019s rallies were expected to be held in nearly every state on Sunday.The eldest daughter of Norma McCorvey, whose legal challenge under the pseudonym \u201cJane Roe\u201d led to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, was set to attend the rally in Long Beach, California. Melissa Mills said it was her first Women\u2019s March.\u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable that we\u2019re here again, doing the same thing my mom did,\u201d Mills told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost 50 years of hard work.\u201dThe Women\u2019s March has become a regular event \u2014 although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 since millions rallied in the United States and around the world the day after Trump\u2019s January 2017 inauguration.Trump made the appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency. The three conservative justices he appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 all voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.__Associated Press journalists Chris Megerian and Seung Min Kim in Washington, D.C., contributed. __Claire Rush and Harm Venhuizen are corps members for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
