Rubio explained the framework in an op-ed in the Washington Examiner. See press highlights below.\u00a0\u00a0Washington Examiner: \u201cRubio unveils \u2018pro-family\u2019 framework after Dobbs ruling\u201d (Kate Scanlon, Washington Examiner, 6/24/2022)\u00a0\n\nAs the Supreme Court struck down its Roe v. Wade decision in its ruling Friday in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) unveiled a corresponding legislative proposal he said would support mothers and babies.\u00a0\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision was a victory for the unborn and mothers in America. But our work is not done,\u201d Rubio told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \u201cWashington can and must do more for mothers, babies and young children. My plan will lay the groundwork for this support and empower communities to better serve families across the country.\u201d\u00a0\nA framework for Rubio\u2019s Providing for Life Act, released Friday by his office, says the bill would combine previous proposals he has advocated, including making the adoption tax credit fully refundable, further expanding the child tax credit, including making it available for parents of an unborn child, as well as his New Parents Act, a proposed bill he introduced with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) that would allow new parents, including adoptive parents, to use up to three months of their Social Security benefits to finance paid parental leave.\n\n\u00a0Washington Examiner: \u201cSupreme Court abortion decision draws congressional GOP praise and Democratic ire\u201d (Kate Scanlon, Washington Examiner, 6/24/2022)\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) unveiled Friday legislation he said would support new mothers and babies to correspond with the decision. He said in a statement that the court\u2019s ruling \u201cto allow states to regulate abortion was right constitutionally and morally.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFor nearly half a century, a nation founded on God-given rights denied those rights to its most vulnerable citizens and more than 63 million Americans never got the chance to pursue their dreams,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut we must not only continue to take steps to protect the unborn, we must also do more to support mothers and their babies. I will soon introduce a bill to ensure we do everything we can to give every child the opportunity to fully access the promise of America.\u201d\n\n\u00a0The Blaze: \u201cWith the pro-life movement\u2019s phase one complete, Marco Rubio outlines his vision for a \u2018post-Roe America\u2019\u201d (Chris Pandolfo, The Blaze, 6/24/2022)\n\nPro-life Republicans have for years faced accusations from Democrats that they do not care what happens to families once children are born, that they have no plan to help expecting mothers with unplanned pregnancies. In answer to this accusation, now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has put forward \u201ca pro-life plan for post-Roe America.\u201d\u00a0\nIn a framework released Friday, Rubio outlined his vision for what Congress should do to support pregnant women and new moms, as well as those with young children, now that states are permitted to regulate or outlaw abortion.\u00a0\nHis proposals, collectively called the \u201cProviding for Life Act,\u201d would create a federal paid leave program, expand child tax credits, and make several reforms to child support and welfare programs.\n\n\u00a0The Atlantic: \u201cAmerica Is About to See Just How Pro-life Republicans Actually Are\u201d (Elaine Godfrey, The Altantic, 6/28/2022)\n\nSenator Marco Rubio released a slate of proposals to support pregnant women and families.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0News Nation: \u201cHow will America care for more pregnant women?\u201d (Cassie Buchman, News Nation, 6/26/2022)\n\nU.S. Sen.

It includes using Social Security benefits to finance parental leave; expanding the Child Tax Credit for children under 6; and adding funds to the Women, Infants and Children program, known as WIC, which supports poor mothers and young children.\n\n\u00a0Washington Post: \u201cThe nominal ways Biden could expand abortion rights\u201d (Amber Philips, Washington Post, 6/27/2022)\n\nHere, there could be some room for bipartisan action. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who, like most Republicans, celebrated the fall of Roe, is introducing legislation focused on this.\u00a0\nHe said in a statement that the government needs to expand the child tax credit for working families.\u00a0\nHe wants more federal support to help mothers carry a pregnancy to term: \u201cExpectant mothers \u2014 especially those who are surprised by, and unprepared for, pregnancy \u2014 require additional support in the form of mentorship, counseling, medical care and more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a0Washington Post: \u201cOpinion: The pro-life movement\u2019s work is just beginning\u201d (O. Carter Snead, Mary Ann Glendon, Washington Post, 6/29/2022)\n\nAt the federal level, Republican [Sen.] Marco Rubio of Florida\u2026announced the Providing for Life Act.

Wade Overturned, Marco Rubio Readies the Providing for Life Act\u201d (Kevin Derby, Florida Daily, 6/28/2022)\n\nWith the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade on Friday, U.S. Sen.

Marco Rubio of Florida said on Twitter, \u201cI will soon introduce a proposal to support mothers and their babies so that every child has a real opportunity to pursue the promise of America.\u201d\u00a0\nHis proposal would allow for paid family leave, but it would require parents to use their Social Security benefits and delay retirement. It would also expand payments from the child tax credit, but not every parent would be eligible for full benefits as Biden allowed with his one-year expansion of the credit in 2021.\u00a0\nAnnouncing the framework in a Washington Examiner editorial, Rubio said, \u201cWhat we need is a pro-life plan for post-Roe America.\u201d\n\n\u00a0The Daily Signal: \u201cHere\u2019s Where to Go If You Need Help With Your Unexpected Pregnancy\u201d (Douglas Blair, The Daily Signal, 6/28/2022)\n\nMississippi has a similar funding stream and a handful of other states have this as well. So I think we\u2019ll see more and more of this and certainly new and creative bills at the federal level. I know Sen. [Marco] Rubio introduced a new bill on Friday that is along these lines and more, and so I\u2019m excited to see more and more of this at the federal level.\n\n\u00a0The Week: \u201cWhere does the American pro-life movement go from here?\u201d (Joel Mathis, The Week, 6/28/2022)\n\nSen.

There\u2019s no reason Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s (R-FL) paid leave program shouldn\u2019t be up for strong consideration, for example.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Orlando Sentinel: \u201cRoe v. Wade abortion ruling could shake up Florida elections\u201d Steve Lemongello, Orlando Sentinel, 6/29/2022)\n\nAt the federal level, longtime abortion opponent Marco Rubio is pushing his proposals to \u201cdo more for unborn children and their mothers,\u201d including expanding the federal child tax credit, making the adoption tax fully refundable and allowing new parents to pull from their Social Security benefits.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Business Insider: \u201cConservatives tossed out Roe v.

Marco Rubio of Florida introduced a \u201cpro-life\u201d framework shortly after the Supreme Court threw out Roe v. Wade. \u201cFor years, I have emphasized that Congress can and must do more for unborn children and their mothers,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cWe need to adopt pro-life policies that support families, rather than destroy them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Axios: \u201cAnti-abortion rights movement struggles to find post-Roe North Star\u201d (Alayna Treene, Axios, 7/10/2022)\n\nSen.
