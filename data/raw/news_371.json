Read our\u00a0privacy noticeVogue Poland has been praised for making a powerful pro-choice statement with its latest issue, which stars model and activist Anja Rubik on the cover draped in crimson fabric.The model\u2019s ensemble mimics that of the red lightening bolt that has become synonymous with the protests that have erupted across Poland in the wake of the country\u2019s near-total ban on abortion.On 22 October, the constitutional court ruled that aborting fetuses with congenital defects violates the constitution, which tightened what was already one of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws.The ruling would mean that abortions are only permitted in cases of risk to the woman's life or crime i.e. in cases of rape or incest.RecommendedEqual pay day: Meet the women who took on unequal payThe ruling prompted nationwide protests, with more than 100,000 people gathered in Warsaw earlier this month, leading the government to delay the publication and implementation of the high court ruling.Now, Vogue Poland has taken a stance against the ruling with its latest issue, which bears the words \u201cthe power of woman\u201d across it in bold white text.\u201cAnything that concerns Polish women concerns us,\u201d reads a statement from Vogue Poland shared on Instagram.\u201cThis has been the case since the first issue of Vogue Poland and will always hold true,\u201d it continues.\u00a0\"That is why we asked supermodel and - or perhaps, these days, first and foremost - activist @Anja_Rubik to create our cover story.\u00a0\u201cShe photographed herself with the symbols so dear to millions of our countrywomen. We stand by you.\u201dRubik has posted about the cover on her own Instagram, calling it one of the \u201cmost important and personal covers and portraits in my career\u201d.The 37-year-old continued: \"A woman\u2019s right to choose is the litmus test for a healthy, progressive society.\u00a0RecommendedPoland delays implementing abortion ruling amid protests\"This moment in time will affect the Polish community for decades to come. The state is suppressing women with their total ban on abortion and restriction of their reproductive rights.\u00a0\u201cReproductive rights are human rights, they guarantee the freedom to decide about our life, our bodies, our health and our destiny.\u201dBoth posts have garnered hundreds of thousands of likes and comments from women praising the publication for its stance.More aboutabortionabortion banVoguePolandJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Vogue Poland praised for pro-choice cover in wake of abortion banVogue Poland praised for pro-choice cover in wake of abortion banVogue Poland\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
