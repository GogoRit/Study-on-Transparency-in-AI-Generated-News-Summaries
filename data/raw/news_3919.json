              Jessica M. Vaught, MD\r\n                                \n\n\n\n\nFrom access to contraception to severe menstruation pain, discussing relevant reproductive issues is essential for our sexual health and wellness. As education, awareness, research and attitudes progress, it\u2019s also important to stay up to date on the most recent guidelines.\nWondering what\u2019s new in the world of reproductive health topics in 2020? Here are five to know about:\n1. Birth Control Has Become More Widely Available\nFor years, physicians and lawmakers have pushed policies that help prevent unintended pregnancies. One of the best methods for pregnancy prevention \u2014 contraception \u2014 has become even more widely available both nationally and internationally. Through the work of organizations like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), people around the world have access to assistance with family planning.\u00a0\nBeyond having access to contraception, women also need to be educated about birth control and their options for usage. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other reproductive health experts want to make certain that women are undergoing proper screenings too, as \u201cthe pill\u201d or an IUD don\u2019t prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and other reproductive health-related conditions.\n2. The Rates of HPV Have Increased\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV) is so common that \u201cnearly all sexually active men and women get the virus at some point in their lives, \u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although there is no cure for this virus, only a few strains of it are harmful out of the over 40 types of HPV. For those infected with HPV, it\u2019s important to discuss with your doctor which type you have and whether that puts you at an increased risk for cervical cancer or genital warts.\nOf course, given the increased prevalence of this\u00a0 virus, it\u2019s even more vital to use proper protection. Again, anyone who\u2019s sexually active also should be screened regularly for STDs.\n3. The Education and Screening for Endometriosis Is Improving\nIn 2020, there will be an even greater push to make sure the diagnostic problems surrounding endometriosis are being addressed. Unfortunately, research has shown that endometriosis often goes undetected because women\u2019s reports of pain and other symptoms aren\u2019t taken seriously. In some cases, women also diminish their own pain and falsely believe that everyone must go through this.\u00a0\nEndometriosis occurs when tissue starts to grow outside of the uterus on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or other areas near the uterus, such as the bowel or bladder. These growths lead to painful periods, pelvic pain between periods and/or pain with sex. In the past,\u00a0 it took up to 10 years on average for women to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis. Now, groups such as the World Endometriosis Organization are working with the medical community and policy-makers to ensure that physicians have a greater understanding of how to screen for this condition.\u00a0\n4. Women\u2019s Pain Still Isn\u2019t Taken Seriously Enough\u00a0\nEndometriosis isn\u2019t the only gynecological condition that can cause severe pain. Certain menstrual disorders, such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) or fibroids, also can\u00a0 affect a woman\u2019s quality of life. Sometimes these conditions may go unnoticed because of the subjective nature of pain, yes, but research shows that women\u2019s pain is taken less seriously. Women\u2019s physical symptoms also may be dismissed as being the result of emotions, leading to less effective treatment.\nWhile the medical community is systematically trying to address this issue, there are a few things that women can keep in mind. For instance, going through a bottle of ibuprofen in a week and missing work during your period is not normal. If you have to regularly reschedule social activities due to pain, you may be suffering from a reproductive health issue. So, it\u2019s important to meet with a gynecologist and ask specific questions. By taking control of your own health, you\u2019re more likely to receive the treatment you need.\n5. Products Targeting Women\u2019s \u201cVaginal Health\u201d Often Are Unnecessary\u00a0\nIn recent years, there\u2019s been a proliferation of vaginal health products. From spritzes to washes and wipes, companies are trying to convince women that the vagina needs to be cleaned all the time. Yet, there is no evidence that women need these products. In fact, the Office of Women\u2019s Health (OWH) strongly advises against douching, a custom that became popular after companies started stocking douche products in stores across the U.S.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile douches and similar products may claim to benefit women\u2019s intimate areas,\u00a0 some of these relatively unregulated products could potentially cause harm. Instead, it\u2019s best to let your vagina clean itself. For those who are concerned about their vaginal health, there\u2019s no need for embarrassment! By getting the right information through your healthcare provider, you\u2019ll feel empowered to make safe and educated decisions about the products you use.\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Recent|Women\n\n\n\n\r\n                                    Understanding the Morning-After Pill\r\n                                \n\n\n\r\n                    Christine C.
