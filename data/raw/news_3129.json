Pippen was going into her junior year at Belmont Abbey when she found out she was pregnant. She recalls feeling afraid, thinking that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the challenges of both motherhood and study.\n\n\n\n\n\nEncountering MiraVia changed her perspective. In addition to the generous material assistance provided, she said the community of mothers \u201cgoing through the same thing\u201d was a vital support.\nPippen gave birth to her son, Avery, and graduated from Belmont Abbey in 2017. She currently works for both the college and MiraVia, encouraging other women facing similar situations to trust that God has a plan for them.\n\u201cYour world is not ending,\u201d shared Pippen in a video testimony. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s just beginning.\u201d\n\u00a0\nResponding to a Need\nMiraVia is one of several apostolates providing similar support on college campuses. Students for Life America\u2019s initiative Standing With You provides a database of pregnancy and parenting resources for students in need, including the Mothers Living and Learning Program at the College of St. Mary in Omaha, Nebraska, and BabySteps at Auburn University.\nMiraVia, which means \u201cMiraculous Way,\u201d originated in 1994 under the name \u201cRoom at the Inn, Inc.\u201d in Charlotte, North Carolina. Executive Director Debbie Capen says there were two influences that served as an impetus for the beginning of MiraVia.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOne was the Feminists for Life study titled, \u201cPerception Is Reality.\u201d It \u201cexposed the fact that the vast majority of colleges have little to no resources for pregnant students,\u201d said Capen.\u00a0\nThe second factor was the generosity of Benedictine Abbot Placid Solari of Belmont Abbey. He told a board member that if they ever considered serving college-age women, the monks would donate the land.\n\u201cIt was also at a time when the organization was doing its long-range strategic planning,\u201d said Capen. \u201cIt became quite clear that this was a very underserved population of women, who were pregnant with no resources, that were slipping through the cracks.\u201d\nCapen got involved in the ministry after her own experience of being pregnant in college. Instead of offering her support, her campus health clinic simply advised her to look up abortion providers in the Yellow Pages. Sadly, estranged from her faith and feeling abandoned, Capen chose abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she experienced a reversion to her faith, she also sought to come to terms with what she had done. She received healing through Rachel\u2019s Vineyard retreats and began supporting Room at the Inn\u2019s pro-life efforts. When she attended the apostolate\u2019s annual banquet and learned that they were planning to open a college residence, she recalls wanting to jump out of her chair and say, \u201cSomebody gets this. Somebody understands this need for college students.\u201d She began volunteering and eventually started working for the apostolate.\n\u00a0\nSet Up for Success\nSince opening nearly 10 years ago, the MiraVia residence has been a home for students from nine different states who have studied at 12 different colleges. Counting its years as Room at the Inn, the apostolate has served 567 mothers and babies.\u00a0\nMiraVia residents either attend Belmont Abbey College, which offers all student mothers full tuition, or other schools in the area. If student mothers are already at another local school, they usually remain enrolled there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDepending on their focus or their major, we want them to be able to complete their education as expeditiously as possible,\u201d said Capen. \u201cIt really is a case-by-case basis on what makes sense for them and their plans.\u201d\nStudent mothers don\u2019t need to be Catholic to come to MiraVia. \u201cJust like any other Catholic hospital or Catholic college, we serve out of our faith, to support and protect women and the unborn,\u201d said Capen. \u201cWe welcome everyone.\u201d\nSome student mothers are recent high-school graduates who are still figuring out their way forward. MiraVia has them meet with college counselors to determine their educational goals.\nIn addition to providing material and residential support, MiraVia also offers professional case management with a social worker on staff, life-skill classes and faith enrichment and Bible studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[Residents] can now focus on making the right plans for their future,\u201d said Capen.\nSome moms choose adoption, while moms who keep their children can stay at MiraVia up until their child turns 2 years old.\n\"We really want to give them enough time and support that\u2019s meaningful,\u201d explained Capen, noting that MiraVia helps mothers find jobs, housing and childcare \u201cso they\u2019re not set up to fail.\u201d\n\u201cThey can adjust to pregnancy, then adjust to parenting, and succeed in school, and then they\u2019ve got plans for independence,\u201d she said.\n\u00a0\nGoing Forward With Faith\nWomen who come to MiraVia often say the same thing: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this at every college?\u201d\nOne day, Capen hopes it will be. Similar to Newman Centers, she envisions an apostolate like MiraVia at colleges across the country and is happy to partner with others looking to bring similar support to student mothers in their own region.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapen trusts that if the ministry expands, it will be under the same spiritual patronage that got it started. Her predecessor at MiraVia, Jeannie Wray, prayed to Our Lady of Guadalupe for help with the fundraising needed to build the residence, promising to make a pilgrimage to Our Lady\u2019s shrine in Mexico City.\u00a0\nAs Capen put it, Our Lady came through in an obvious way.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on Dec. 12, but in the week leading up to Dec. 12, we received a donation out of the blue of over $100,000 from a donor we had never come across before,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was clear that Our Lady of Guadalupe seemed to have a special place in her heart for this ministry.\u201d\nMiraVia has also been devoted to St. Joseph from the beginning. Capen says St. Joseph\u2019s vocation as the protector of the Blessed Mother and Child Jesus made him a clear patron of the apostolate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe just seemed to be the right saint to look after the same needs that our moms have: the housing, the support, the strength, [and] the stability,\u201d said Capen. \u201cWe have invoked his intercession many times, especially over the past year, in the Year of St. Joseph.\u201d\n\n Capen acknowledges that it can be scary to experience an unplanned pregnancy and to see one\u2019s life go in an unexpected direction. Women are driven to abortion, she says, by fear and a lack of hope.\nBut when women \u201csee the other student mothers who are happy and successful, that fear melts away. They can now envision a path that includes their education and the child.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \ncatholic college students\nchoosing life\nprolife witness\nprolife movement\n\n\n\n\nBea Cuasay Bea Cuasay writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.
