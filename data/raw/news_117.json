Feb. 26, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n print\n write a letter\n\n\n\n              Waskom, on the Texas-Louisiana state line, was the first town to declare itself a \"sanctuary for the unborn.\" (Image via City of Waskom)  \n\nIn response to a wave of tiny East Texas towns passing ordinances to ban abortion and condemn pro-choice groups as crime syndicates, the ACLU of Texas and its national parent organization are hitting back with a federal lawsuit.\nThe complaint, filed in U.S. district court in Marshall, names seven cities as defendants for violating pro-choice advocates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights to free expression and association under the First Amendment. By ideologically designating those groups as criminal entities, the towns are illegally imposing punishment without a fair trial, the ACLU argues.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese ordinances are unconstitutional,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anjali Salvador, staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbortion is legal in every state and city in the country, and cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their important work \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when they do so in a way that violates their First Amendment rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn a campaign led by anti-abortion activists at Texas Right to Life, the all-male Waskom City Council passed an ordinance in June 2019 declaring itself a \u00e2\u0080\u009csanctuary city for the unborn\u00e2\u0080\u009d and abortion an \u00e2\u0080\u009cact of murder with malice aforethought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not long afterward, the Texas cities of Gary, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Naples, and Wells followed suit. Of course, the ordinances can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take effect at this point considering Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land; however, if the historic precedent is overturned, abortion would then become illegal in those municipalities (combined population: 12,120).\nThe measures didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just (symbolically) ban abortion but also barred eight reproductive rights organizations (including Planned Parenthood and Whole Woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health) from operating within city limits, deeming them \u00e2\u0080\u009ccriminal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abortion assistance non-profits the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund, who are represented by the ACLU in the suit, were also targeted; neither one performs abortions, but they do provide direct financial assistance to women who want to end their pregnancy but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford the full cost. They also advocate and educate people in east Texas about reproductive rights and access and seek to reduce abortion stigma; TEA Fund had planned to expand its scope of advocacy work in the area.\nThat education work is especially crucial in light of the highly misleading ordinances. By claiming to ban the constitutionally protected procedure, the ordinances create the impression that the residents of those cities can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exercise their right to an abortion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough that part of the ordinances will not take effect unless Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey are overturned, all residents of these cities are likely not aware of this limitation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes the ACLU. And without the abortion support groups around to inform citizens of their rights \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of their core missions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that cloud of disinformation is destined to become much worse. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA major part of our work is to make sure every Texan knows their rights and can find legitimate, fact-based information about getting an abortion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regardless of income or zip code,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Amanda Beatriz Williams, executive director of Lilith Fund. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese would-be abortion bans are deliberately designed to confuse people about their rights and push safe abortion care further out of reach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd violating the vague ordinance could subject the groups to prosecution. If a person or entity \u00e2\u0080\u009cprocures, aids, or abets an abortion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they could face a civil cause of action. While Roe may not get overturned anytime soon, that section is immediately enforceable, casting a chilling effect on the groups. Since the law is so broad, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear what qualifies as a violation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 billboards and social media campaigns to combat abortion stigma? Training volunteers (even remotely) on how to advocate against local anti-abortion restrictions? Hosting an event? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hazy (and likely intentionally so) and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the problem.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaintiffs are also concerned that the ordinances have exacerbated hostility to abortion advocacy, making any advocacy in these cities more difficult and also potentially unsafe for employees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d write the ACLU. Kamyon Connor, executive director for TEA Fund, called the extreme ordinances another \u00e2\u0080\u009ctactic\u00e2\u0080\u009d for abortion opponents to \u00e2\u0080\u009cscore political points\u00e2\u0080\u009d by infringing on the ability of their groups to educate and activate communities about their rights and the resources available to them.\n\n\nGot something to say on the subject?
