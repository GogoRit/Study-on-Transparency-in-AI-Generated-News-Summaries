(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014 The path to passage for a proposed ban on Nebraska abortions after an ultrasound detects cardiac activity ran into a Ralston-sized roadblock on Wednesday.\nRalston State Sen. Merve Riepe, a former hospital administrator who supported previous efforts to restrict abortion, proposed amending the restriction in Legislative Bill 626 to instead make abortions illegal after 12 weeks.\u00a0\n  Nebraska State Sen. Merv Riepe, District 12. (Photo by Craig Chandler.)\nHe said he and other senators who oppose abortion but prefer a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d want to discuss an alternative to the \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d which sponsors have said would essentially ban abortions after about six weeks of gestation.\n\u201cI wish we would\u2019ve had the debate before things got introduced, but we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to do what it takes when something deserves a discussion.\u201d\nRiepe said he filed the amendment and walked over to explain his reasons for filing it to State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who sponsored LB 626. Riepe was a co-sponsor of the more restrictive bill.\nRiepe said the \u201csix-week ban is tantamount to a total ban,\u201d which many of his constituents oppose, he said. His comments echoed the views of most of the doctors who testified against LB 626 in a public hearing.\nRiepe said that he doesn\u2019t like surprises and that he didn\u2019t like surprising anyone with his amendment. But, he said, he was surprised when LB 626 was introduced instead of a 12-week ban.\nAlbrecht disappointed\nAlbrecht told him Wednesday she was disappointed by his amendment. She told reporters that losing Riepe\u2019s vote for cloture might put the bill at risk of falling to a filibuster from abortion rights advocates.\nThe bill needs 33 votes to overcome a filibuster. Albrecht said she has just enough support to get the bill over the line, but a single supporter\u2019s departure could stall it.\nShe said Riepe\u2019s 12-week ban \u201cis not acceptable to myself or the other 32 (supporters).\u201d She argued that her bill is \u201cnot about a ban.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d she said, adding that his amendment has created confusion about whether he will ultimately vote for the bill or not.\nRiepe said he has no problem being the 33rd vote to get LB 626 past the first round of debate. But he wants \u201ca full and fair debate\u201d on his amendment in the second round of debate, he said.\u00a0\n  State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston speaks during debate in the Nebraska Legislature. (Unicameral Information Office/Unicameral Update)\nRiepe said he knows this is going to turn people against him, but he said the discussion is worth having, even if it means he has to \u201cget a dog so I can have a friend.\u201d\nSenators had discussed 12 weeks\nAnti-abortion groups including Nebraska Right to Life and the Nebraska Family Alliance have argued that Nebraska should ban abortion outright.

Wade was overturned.\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court took that step in June and sent the decision back to the states, Riepe said he gladly signed onto a letter last summer by then-Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers to support a 12-week ban in a special session, but supporters couldn\u2019t find the 33 senators needed.\nHe said he was surprised to see the new legislation come back using cardiac activity as the standard, because that usually occurs around six weeks of gestational age.\nRiepe said he has heard from doctors and constituents that most women won\u2019t know they are pregnant in time to make an ultrasound appointment, let alone decide.\nHe worries that women who want to terminate their pregnancies might try to induce their own abortions or harm themselves.\nHe said he also worries that LB 626 will encourage women who miss the cardiac deadline to accuse a partner of sexual assault, which could lead to criminal investigations and charges.\nAll sides watching\nAndi Curry Grubb of Planned Parenthood of Nebraska said her group is not celebrating Riepe\u2019s amendment, because it still restricts a woman\u2019s ability to exercise autonomy over her body.\nGrubb said state senators who oppose abortion are figuring out that Nebraskans don\u2019t want them to pass a bill \u201cas extreme as LB 626.\u201d And women and their allies need to keep working.\n  Hundreds pack a hearing room to testify for and against Legislative Bill 626, the bill that would ban abortions in Nebraska after an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity.
