Now that the procedure will soon be mostly illegal in the state, it had an idea: help open a clinic a mile across town \u2015 and the state line \u2015 in Bristol, Virginia, where abortion remains legal. (Sam Whitehead / KHN)\n\n\n\n\n\nElected leaders in Bristol, Virginia are pushing forward a zoning law that would prohibit new abortion clinics within city limits, part of a local backlash against a Tennessee clinic that made the short move across state lines once Roe v. Wade was overturned.\u00a0\nThe five-member Bristol Virginia City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted in favor of the resolution to ban any facility that \u201cintentionally causes(s) the death or termination of a pre-born human life at any stage of development.\u201d\u00a0\nThe resolution, which must go through several additional steps before becoming law, also stops existing clinics from expanding or undergoing renovations.\u00a0\nBristol\u2019s effort to restrict abortion clinics is among the first by a local government in a state like Virginia \u2014 where abortion remains legal \u2014 since the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion in June. Two other Virginia cities, Tazewell and Russell, have also enacted resolutions declaring themselves a \u201csanctuary  for the rights of the unborn.\u201d Neither of those cities has an existing abortion clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state does not dictate what every local district does. City Council has full authority to stop other abortion clinics from coming here.\n\n\n\u2013 Bristol, Virginia Councilmember Kevin Eads\n\n\nBut these cities\u2019 early efforts to harness land use ordinances or other local laws to bar abortion clinics may not be the last.\u00a0 Abortion bans or severe restrictions in nearly half the states in the nation have prompted clinics in cities where the procedure is newly illegal to move to cities where it still remains accessible, but not universally supported.\n\u201cIt feels like this may be the first of many,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, who tracks public policy for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.\nBristol\u2019s vote Tuesday was in direct response to the opening of the Bristol Women\u2019s Health Center in July. The center had operated a few miles from Virginia in the twin city of Bristol, Tenn. for more than 30 years, before making the move across state lines to continue to provide services to patients in the surrounding Appalachian region. The relocated clinic remains the closest abortion provider to patients in Knoxville, Kingsport and elsewhere in northeastern Tennessee.\u00a0\nBristol Councilmember Kevin Wingard called the zoning measure \u201cthe most important issue\u201d ever to come before city leaders. He contends the city has the legal authority to stop abortion clinics from coming to town.\u00a0\n\u201cThe state does not dictate what every local district does,\u201d Wingard said. \u201cCity Council has full authority to stop other abortion clinics from coming here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether those claims can pass legal muster.\nLocal governments typically do not attempt to regulate clinics providing abortion, which until this year was a federally protected right. With the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, states now have the authority to regulate or restrict abortion rights. Bristol\u2019s legal authority to enact new zoning laws that ban new abortion clinics remains in question.\u00a0\nRandall Eads, Bristol\u2019s city attorney, said he was in the process of reviewing the language of the ordinance and would provide his legal assessment to the Bristol City Council at their Nov. 15 meeting.\n\u201cI have completed some preliminary research, but I have not made a conclusion as to whether the language of the ordinance, as written, could withstand a legal challenge,\u201d Eads told the Lookout.\u00a0\nThe Virginia-based Family Foundation, which has long advocated against abortion and aided in the drafting of the proposed zoning regulations, said in a statement that \u201cBristol, Virginia has been a \u2018good place to live\u2019 and residents imply want to ensure that it remains so, for both born and unborn community members.\u201d\nNash said the local efforts are sending a more ominous message.\n\u201cOne of the things that has struck me about this is the message it\u2019s sending to patients is you don\u2019t matter; this community doesn\u2019t care about your needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sends a very bad message to people accessing healthcare, particularly when we\u2019re seeing that people are traveling hundreds of miles.\u201d\nText of proposed Bristol Virginia resolution\nNo land, building, structure or other premises located within any zoning district of the City of Bristol may be used to carry out any practice, process, or procedure that is designed to intentionally cause the death or termination of a pre-born human life at any stage of development. The already existing use of any buildings or structures for such purposes must conform to this regulation whenever they are enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered, and any nonconforming building or structure may not be moved on the same lot or to any other lot in order to carry out the nonconforming use.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXBristol, Virginia city council moves to ban new abortion clinics\nby Anita Wadhwani, Tennessee Lookout October 27, 2022\nBristol, Virginia city council moves to ban new abortion clinics\nby Anita Wadhwani, Tennessee Lookout October 27, 2022\n Elected leaders in Bristol, Virginia are pushing forward a zoning law that would prohibit new abortion clinics within city limits, part of a local backlash against a Tennessee clinic that made the short move across state lines once Roe v.
