Abortions fell by 60 percent in Texas the first month after SB8 took effect. Abortion providers asked both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to expedite their attack on the law by sending the case to a lower court, but they refused to do so. Most recently, on February 24, the Texas Supreme Court heard argument from attorneys for the Office of the Attorney General regarding whether any state governmental entity is authorized to enforce SB8.\u00a0\u00a0\nTexas SB8 is a pro-life law that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, when fetal cardiac activity can be detected. Also known as the \u201cHeartbeat Bill,\u201d the law protects the unborn from gruesome medical procedures that involve dismemberment in the mother\u2019s womb. According to recent studies, before SB8 was enacted, 84 percent of women seeking abortions in Texas were over six weeks pregnant by the time they chose to terminate.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSimply by having SB8 enacted, thousands of lives have already been saved in Texas. Stopping abortion providers from conducting these barbaric practices is yet another win for our great state. I will continue to fight tirelessly for the rights of the unborn,\u201d Attorney General Paxton said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive email updates from the OAG Press Office:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\nAttor\u00adney Gen\u00ader\u00adal Pax\u00adton Sues Yelp Over Dis\u00adcrim\u00adi\u00adna\u00adtion Against Cri\u00adsis Preg\u00adnan\u00adcy Centers\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against Yelp after the company violated Texas\u2019s Deceptive Trade Practices Act by appending inaccurate and misleading language to listings on pregnancy resource centers appearing in the search results on Yelp\u2019s app and website.\nSeptember 28, 2023  | Press Release\n\n\n\n\nPax\u00adton Sues Biden Admin Over Its Efforts to Force Abor\u00adtions in\u00a0Texas\u00a0\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding their use of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) to require hospitals to perform abortions.\nJuly 14, 2022  | Press Release\n\n\n\n\nPax\u00adton Joins Coali\u00adtion to Stop Title X\u00a0Funds from Being Used for Abortions\nAttorney General Ken Paxton joined a\u00a0multistate coalition\u00a0filing an amicus brief in federal court, seeking\u00a0to prevent Title X funds from being used to subsidize abortions\u00a0under a\u00a0rule issued by the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0(HHS).\nNovember 16, 2021  | Press Release\n\n\n\n\nSee all News\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\n\n\n\nPO Box 12548Austin, TX 78711-2548\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild Support\n\n\nCrime Victims\n\n\nConsumer Protection\n\n\nOpen Government\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Divisions\nOpinions\nInitiatives\nHuman Resources\nNewsroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Money Goes\n\n\nADA Compliance\n\n\nCompact With Texans\n\n\nCost Efficiency Saving Ideas\n\n\nReporting Fraud\n\n\nState Agency Contracts\n\n\nTRAILS Search\n\n\nTexas Homeland Security\n\n\nTexas Veterans Portal\n\n\nTexas.gov\n\n\nAccessibility & Site Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
