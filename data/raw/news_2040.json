A three-hour commute proves itNews Sports Counties Business Music Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals  POLITICSThree women sue Tennessee over abortion law they say causes 'catastrophic' risksThe Center for Reproductive Health, a New York-based nonprofit legal firm, represents the women. They are challenging the law under the state constitution. Melissa BrownNashville TennesseanThree Tennessee women who say the state's abortion law endangered their lives sued on Monday, arguing the law is too restrictive and vague about when doctors can legally terminate a pregnancy with serious complications.One woman, 27-year-old Katy Dulong, said she was denied needed health care when she was diagnosed with a pregnancy complication that would cause her lose the pregnancy in November 2022. The hospital denied Dulong medication to induce labor, only providing her sanitary pads to manage a miscarriage at home.When she returned to the hospital a week later, doctors discovered the baby's body was almost entirely in Dulong's vaginal canal and there was no amniotic fluid left. Her doctor spent two hours on the phone to get permission to give her medication to induce, the lawsuit alleges.Dulong was at serious risk for sepsis when she birthed the baby, who died, in a hospital bathroom within an hour of taking the medication to induce labor, according to the lawsuit.Two doctors are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court late Monday evening, which argues Tennessee's law violates the state constitution and asks a judge to clarify the circumstances under which doctors can legally perform abortions.\"Vague abortion bans like Tennessee\u2019s inevitably hinder or delay the delivery of necessary medical care,\" the lawsuit states. \"And, contrary to its stated purpose of furthering life, Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban exposes pregnant people to grave risks of death, injury, and illness, including loss of fertility \u2014 making it less likely that every family that wants to bring a child into the world will be able to do so.\"The Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based legal firm, represents the Tennessee women and is likely looking to build on its recent Texas lawsuit as a possible blueprint for undercutting abortion restrictions elsewhere.A Texas judge last month temporarily ruled the state's abortion law is too restrictive, staying the law ahead of a full trial, and the legal group announced similar legal filings in Oklahoma and Idaho on Tuesday.Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the Texas lawsuit was the \u201ctip of a very large iceberg\u201d and sparked feedback from other states, including the plaintiffs in the three lawsuits announced on Tuesday.\u00a0The CRR announced the filings in a news conference on Tuesday.\u201cThey\u2019ve each been through unspeakable trauma,\u201d Northup said of the plaintiffs. \u201cToday, they are holding their state governments accountable for the suffering that their laws have caused.\"Opinion:Abortion ban has led to an OB/GYN shortage. It will be lethal in rural Tennessee | Opinion'Pre-Roe v. Wade was not easy':Illegal abortions shaped these Tennessee doctors' careersTennessee's trigger abortion banWhen the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision providing abortion rights nationwide last summer, Tennessee had a law ready to snap into place to end all abortion rights. Referred to as the state's \"trigger\" ban, the law was among the strictest in the nation, one of only three states not to provide legal exceptions for abortions even to save a pregnant patient from death or serious injury.Tennessee Republicans argued a narrow carve-out in the law allowed doctors to save the life of a pregnant patient, but a doctor would have to knowingly commit a felony to do so. Multiple doctors told The Tennessean the risk for legal jeopardy was too high and would negatively affect reproductive health outcomes in the state.The Tennessee General Assembly last spring codified narrow legal exceptions for abortions performed to save the life or prevent serious injury to a pregnant patient. A broader bill, carried by Republican lawmakers, to allow abortions in the event of fatal fetal anomalies failed to advance amid intense anti-abortion lobbying, despite widespread public support for legal abortion rights.The anti-abortion lobbying push was led by Tennessee Right to Life, whose chief lobbyist said earlier this year the law should not allow doctors to subjectively choose when to intervene in high-risk pregnancy conditions, as some conditions will \"work themselves out.\"Tennessee physicians like Dr. Laura Andreson, who is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, have for months decried this argument as a fundamental misunderstanding of medical care. Andreson, a Franklin OB/GYN, is joined in the lawsuit by Dr. Heather Maune, a Nashville-based OB/GYN.Among the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit is Allie Phillips, a Clarksville woman who became pregnant with her second child in November 2022. Phillips feared she could be at high risk for pregnancy complications due to her previous gastric bypass surgery, she told The Tennessean in March, but she and her husband were overjoyed to learn they were having a girl, who they named Miley Rose.At a February anatomy scan, Phillips received the news that her daughter was measuring a month behind developmental schedule. Miley Rose's kidneys were significantly undersized, her heart had developed only two chambers, and there were signs of a deadly condition where the brain isn't correctly formed.It was unlikely Phillips could carry to term and would be at risk for miscarriage and other complications until she miscarried. If the pregnancy lasted to term, the baby was unlikely to survive or would live just a short time on hospice care, something Phillips and her husband did not want to put a child through.The couple made the decision to travel out of state to terminate the pregnancy.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely inhumane to force anybody out of their own home to have to seek health care. It\u2019s wrong on so many different levels,\u201d Phillips said.\u00a0The third plaintiff in the lawsuit, 31-year-old Nicole Blackmon, was taking medications to treat a brain tumor-like condition called pseudotumor cerebri when she learned she was unexpectedly pregnant in July 2022. Her pregnancy was high risk due to the condition, and Blackmon was also struggling with mental health issues following the tragic loss of her teenaged son who had died in a drive-by shooting.Doctors decry abortion ban:Why doctors are decrying Tennessee's 'dangerous' abortion ban as lawmakers debate changeOther healthcare news:Tennessee's transgender health care law: What to know about latest legal wranglingIn August 2022, an anatomy scan showed her baby's major organs had developed inside a sac on the outside of the baby's body, indicating a severe fetal development diagnosis of limb-body-wall complex. In later appointments, the diagnosis was confirmed and she was advised to consider an abortion, \"because her baby was no longer receiving nutrients through the placenta, was extremely unlikely to survive to birth, and continuing the pregnancy would put increasing strain on Nicole\u2019s body,\" the lawsuit states.Blackmon could not afford the out-of-state medical and travel costs to seek an abortion elsewhere. She continued the pregnancy in Tennessee while developing severe side effects, including headaches, blurred vision and increased blood pressure, which were warning signs of preeclampsia and a potential stroke.She was given medication to induce labor in December 2022 after her water broke at 31 weeks. After 32 hours of labor, she gave birth to a stillborn baby, a boy she named Ethan, and she was diagnosed with a placenta infection, according to the lawsuit.Blackmon on Tuesday called Tennessee's law \"cruel\" and her pregnancy experience \"torture that no one else should ever have to face.\"\"No one should have to endure the emotional and physical pain, and risk to their life, that I have suffered in Tennessee,\" Blackmon said. \"That law forced me to carry a baby for months that was never going to live, and easily could have killed me. I should have been able to get an abortion in Tennessee to protect my health.\"The Tennessee Attorney General's Office, which defends the state in lawsuits, said Tuesday afternoon it had not yet been served the complaint.Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
