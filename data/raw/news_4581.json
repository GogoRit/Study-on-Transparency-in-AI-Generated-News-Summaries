She pleaded not guilty.\n\u201cBringing charges against a lawmaker for a peaceful protest is an undeniably alarming escalation in the Polish government\u2019s efforts to criminalize not just abortion but anyone who openly supports reproductive rights,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cSuch brash attempts to silence women\u2019s rights activists and ride roughshod over free speech protections shows how fragile all rights are in Poland today.\u201d\nOn October 25, 2020, alongside her husband, Piotr Wielgus, Scheuring-Wielgus carried a banner in a Toru\u0144 church reading, \u201cWoman, you can decide for yourself\u201d to protest a Constitutional Tribunal ruling that essentially eliminated access to legal abortion in Poland. In December 2020, Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro initiated a motion to strip Scheuring-Wielgus of her parliamentary legal immunity for the protest.\nOn November 4, 2022, parliament voted in favor of the motion and the prosecutor pursued charges against Scheuring-Wielgus even though Toru\u0144 district court in October 2021 upheld her husband\u2019s acquittal for \u201coffending religious belief\u201d in relation to the same incident.\nIn October 2020, Poland\u2019s politically compromised Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortion on grounds of \u201csevere and irreversible fetal defect or incurable illness that threatens the fetus\u2019 life\u201d is unconstitutional, virtually eliminating access to legal abortion in the country. Previously, over 90 percent of the approximately 1,000 legal abortions performed annually in Poland were on this ground.\nAbortion is now only permitted to safeguard a woman\u2019s life or health or if the pregnancy results from a crime, such as rape or incest. In practice, multiple barriers make it almost impossible for those eligible for a legal abortion to obtain one. Evidence consistently demonstrates that laws restricting or criminalizing abortion\u00a0do not eliminate\u00a0it, but rather\u00a0drive people to seek abortion through means that may put their mental and physical health at risk and diminish their autonomy and dignity.\nSince the Law and Justice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107, PiS) came to power in 2015, Poland\u2019s government has carried out a sustained attack on sexual and reproductive rights, particularly access to abortion, and on abortion rights activists. Abortion activists say the government is increasingly using the law to target them. Justyna Wydrzy\u0144ska, of\u00a0Abortion Dream Team, was charged with assisting someone to have an abortion and illegally \u201cmarketing\u201d medication without authorization after allegedly helping a woman get pills for a medication abortion in 2020. Wydrzy\u0144ska faces up to three years in prison.\nGovernment data has shown an increase in charges of \u201coffending religious feelings\u201d under Law and Justice. In 2020, the government used this provision to prosecute three activists for posting images of a religious icon with a rainbow halo, often associated with activism for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. In January, an appellate court upheld their acquittal.\nUnder the leadership of Ziobro, who also serves\u00a0as justice minister, the far-right Solidarna Polska party \u2013 part of Poland\u2019s conservative ruling coalition \u2013 submitted legislation in October that would amend the criminal code to include publicly insulting or ridiculing the church as an offense punishable by up to two years in prison\nThe Polish government should drop spurious charges against Scheuring-Wielgus and other women\u2019s and LGBT rights activists, and reverse course to ensure access to safe, legal abortion and other essential reproductive health care, Human Rights Watch said.\nScheuring-Wielgus has been targeted before. Parliament voted in April to remove her legal immunity from prosecution for hanging a poster on the door to Toru\u0144 cathedral saying \u201cBaby shoes remember. Stop pedophilia.\u201d It referred to revelations of sexual abuse by Catholic clerics in Poland. In November, the national police chief requested removal of another Left party parliamentarian\u2019s immunity for hanging posters supporting the Women\u2019s Strike on office doors of Law and Justice politicians in I\u0142awa in November 2020.\nUnder Law and Justice, attacks on women\u2019s and LGBT rights by high-ranking government officials, ultra-conservative groups, and the media have fostered an increasingly hostile environment for activists and rights defenders. Groups including Abortion Dream Team have been the targets of bomb and death threats.\nThe European Commission in December 2017 initiated action against Poland under European Union (EU) Treaty article 7 \u2013 the provision under which action can be taken against states that put EU values at risk \u2013 in response to threats to judicial independence. The Commission should update and broaden its reasoned opinion under article 7 to reflect threats to free speech and the growing impact of the erosion of judicial independence on women\u2019s and LGBT rights, Human Rights Watch said. EU member states should adopt rule-of-law recommendations and vote under article 7 to determine there is a clear risk of a serious breach of EU values in Poland.\n\u201cEuropean Union leaders should not simply stand by and tolerate a member state targeting elected representatives for exercising free speech and peacefully supporting women\u2019s fundamental human rights,\u201d Margolis said. \u201cThe Polish government is only growing bolder in its efforts to undercut women\u2019s rights and rights defenders, and decisive action to stop it can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia European Union Poland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nFree Speech Sexual and Reproductive Health Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 13, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: End Prosecution of Abortion Activist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2021\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: A Year On, Abortion Ruling Harms Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Can\u2019t Do My Job as a Journalist\u201d\n\n\nThe Systematic Undermining of Media Freedom in Hungary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 13, 2022\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: End Prosecution of Abortion Activist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2021\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: A Year On, Abortion Ruling Harms Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
