Their father was taking the picture, and Lucy (17) is not in the photo.\u00a0 (photo: Courtesy photos / Erika Bachiochi )\n\n\n\nRoxane Salonen \nFeatures\nDecember 15, 2022\n\n\nTo worldly ears, words describing Erika Bachiochi \u2014 a pro-life Catholic, feminist intellectual and mother of seven \u2014 likely stir confusion.\nIndeed, elements of this Holy-Spirit-driven legal scholar do not fit tidily in a box.\u00a0\nHer longtime friend Katie Elrod, agrees, saying Bachiochi represents \u201cthe third way\u201d in her unique ability to foster difficult conversations. \u201cShe\u2019s very even-handed and fair-minded and is always looking to see the best in every argument, to bring people closer to God and the Church,\u201d Elrod told the Register. \u201cBut if she\u2019s seemingly paradoxical, that\u2019s because we\u2019re limited in our thinking.\u201d\nElrod calls Bachiochi\u2019s responses in a recent interview with New York Times writer Ezra Klein \u201cmasterful,\u201d exhibiting clarity, charity, warmth and humor, while presenting \u201ca really bold, new vision of what it means to be a woman.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has developed a lot of mercy for women, while striving to be an excellent wife, mother and friend, and does it with a lot of sincerity,\u201d Elrod continued. \u201cThere are no precepts or false modesty with her. I find that to be rare.\u201d\nAlexandra DeSanctis, an Ethics and Public Policy Center colleague, said Bachiochi seeks to be a bridge in helping bring those from the pro-choice position to a pro-life view, \u201cjust as she herself was helped across the bridge.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that more in the wake of Dobbs,\u201d DeSanctis told the Register. \u201cHer writing and speaking has formed and shaped my own, of why abortion is not a feminist proposal at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Early Years\nBaptized as an infant, Bachiochi did not grow up in a religious household. Her mother\u2019s three divorces, and suicides of two friends, set her on a path of recklessness and addiction as a teen, she said, plunging her into introspection at a young age.\nBy 17, she had begun attending 12-step meetings and cultivating a prayer life. \u00a0\nBachiochi attended Middlebury College in Vermont, taking up women\u2019s studies and sociology. \u201cI called myself a socialist feminist,\u201d she told the Register, even volunteering one summer for her congressman, Bernie Sanders.\u00a0\nAs addiction recovery took hold, healing family wounds, she began to work to see her own part in her past. \u201cI stopped blaming everyone around me \u2014 especially my mother,\u201d she said, and she began praying constantly, relying on God for her sanity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBachiochi spent time her junior year in Washington, D.C., at a program for the study of American politics and public law, discovering the work of Mary Ann Glendon and the Communitarian Movement, a 1990s bipartisan critique of liberal individualism in favor of robust communities. Though \u201cadamantly pro-choice,\u201d when law professor Helen Alvar\u00e9, in charge at the time of pro-life communications for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was invited in as a guest to describe the pro-life position in one of her classes, Bachiochi was struck by her \u201caffect and evident joy.\u201d Her experience in D.C. caused a pivot in Bachiochi\u2019s studies, with a new focus on constitutional law and political theory, with her becoming \u201creoriented toward the pursuit of truth\u201d and away from self through reading ancient philosophy.\nLater, Bachiochi accepted an invitation to Middlebury's Newman Club by a Catholic lecturer she had met at a seminar and found the Catholic students demonstrating a surprising humility, love of God and depth. \u201cThey were seeking what I wanted, but it intertwined with all this Catholic talk that made me very uncomfortable,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSo I went back to my dorm, got on my knees \u2014 which was my habit \u2014 and asked God if he had a son. And that was the beginning of my religious conversion.\u201d\nSoon thereafter, she found herself at Mass \u2014 and was hooked. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019d been baptized as a child, that there was some sort of rootedness, or whether it was just the crucifix that spoke to my heart,\u201d she said, but she knew she was home.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendship and Family\nIt was at Boston College, where she studied theology, that Bachiochi met Elrod, a Catholic revert, who became her confirmation sponsor upon her entrance into the Church in 1997, in her early 20s.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom the beginning, we became instant soulmates,\u201d Elrod said, calling her \u201ca great example of Aristotelian friendship \u2014 of trying to become a better version of herself for the world.\u201d\nNow head of an independent school for girls in grades 6 to 12 located just outside Boston, Elrod said \u201cthe student surpassed the teacher,\u201d with Bachiochi becoming a mentor. \u201cIt was rare for me to find a woman who had the intellectual acumen, drive and intensity \u2014 and at the same time is incredibly humble.\u201d\nBachiochi met her husband, a Catholic, following her conversion. They married during her time at Boston University School of Law, while she sought her law degree, welcoming their first child in her third year there.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThough intending to be exclusively at home with her children, Bachiochi says her \u201coveractive intellect\u201d eventually demanded an outlet, and the family needed the money. She edited her first book, The Cost of Choice, a series of essays, during her first and second children\u2019s naptimes. Her second book, Women, Sex and the Church: A Case for Catholic Teaching, also comprised a series of essays.\u00a0\nBachiochi knew well both sides of the abortion argument. \u201cI agree with a lot of feminist legal arguments, so I see my work as separating the wheat from the chaff,\u201d she said, adding that the mind always ultimately \u201csearches for truth, and our hearts long for the good.\u201d\nShe approaches feminist legal theory \u201cwith a lot of respect,\u201d she added, challenging conservatives who are inclined to \u201cjust shout, \u2018No\u2019 and thereby miss the underlying rationale for feminism, as though that\u2019s going to be convincing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Vision of Interdependence\nKatie Brizek, a graduate student focusing on the intellectual history of the Catholic Church in the United States, met Bachiochi during a summer seminar Bachiochi co-teaches through the Abigail Adams Institute soon after reading her article, \u201cEmbodied Caregiving,\u201d in First Things, which argued that humans are more interdependent, and less autonomous, than we often believe.\n\u201cThe relationships between human beings are better characterized as an alliance of trust that are interdependent, and there are seasons of greater versus lesser giving. Family, and also larger society, is premised on this,\u201d Brizek said in recollection to the Register.\nIt made her feel hopeful, she says, about how to meld her own thoughts on being human \u2014 and a woman in particular \u2014 in ways honoring her Catholic faith. \u201cI was struck that she was married and had a family, but was also clearly excellent at what she did \u2014 and seemed to be doing something new.\u201d\nThe two stayed in touch, and, recently, Bachiochi offered to review some of Brizek\u2019s own scholarly work. \u201cHer generosity and humility in her intellectual endeavors is something that, as a human being, makes you feel good,\u201d Brizek said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a mentoring relationship, but not one that is condescending or patronizing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDeSanctis agrees, noting that Bachiochi is both intellectual and sharp, with a lively mind, along with being engaging and personable.\u00a0\nShe also appreciates her intent on \u201cgetting to the root of why women seek abortion,\u201d while pointing out its harms for women. \u201cWe need to have a better solution than pitting [women] against their unborn children.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSchool of Motherhood\nBachiochi says melding motherhood with her professional work wasn\u2019t as impressive as some might think. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to be in an office, and I wasn\u2019t beholden to a boss. So I could just read alongside [the kids], like any mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI just happened to be reading feminist legal theory.\u201d\nShe discovered her niche after writing a 2011 law-review article, which \u201ccaptured the intuitions of many pro-life feminists,\u201d debunking the idea that women need abortion to be equal to men.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a time in which the phrase \u201cThe duty of the moment\u201d became prominent in her life; when \u201cpushing swings while reading law-review articles\u201d happened routinely. Tending to her kids\u2019 needs, then going about her work, whether professional or of the home, \u201cfosters for them an independence and an ability to provide for, and take care of, one another.\u201d\nMarriage, she added, also has provided a training ground for developing virtues together. \u201cIf you parent the younger children well, and give of yourself the way young children need, it provides wisdom and can become the necessary cross we need\u201d for refinement of self.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOur Current Discontent\nBachiochi believes the debates over the nature of rights, especially regarding abortion, forms \u201cthe heart of our discontent\u201d at the moment. \u201cThe incredible vitriol we experience in this space is due to the fact that it\u2019s at the juncture of two competing worldviews,\u201d reaching who we are as humans. Bachiochi centrally addresses the topic in her latest book, The Rights of Women: Reclaiming a Lost Vision (Catholic Ideas for a Secular World).\nFor pro-lifers, abortion is understood as a human-rights violation, so asserting the rights of vulnerable children is the overarching goal, she said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s better if we understand the issue from the perspective of the duties of care the mother and father owe their child \u2014 and each other.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRights are the correlative of our responsibilities to one another,\u201d Bachiochi said. \u201cFulfilling our responsibilities virtuously is what makes us happy as human beings. It begins a virtuous cycle of caring for one another.\u201d\nThat also means paying attention to laws; those built upon an incorrect understanding of who we are as humans, she says, will distort our culture.\nBut for meaningful conversations, we must seek the dignity in each other, despite diverse views, just as how her own heart had to be open before seeing the truth. \u201cWe have to encounter other human beings as human beings. That\u2019s really broken down in our culture right now,\u201d Bachiochi said. \u201cCharity has to be ahead of every argument.\u201d\nWomen in particular are often able to view a person\u2019s development in a way that \u201cgoes straight to the heart,\u201d she added, and must be central in engaging the culture in all its facets. \u201cFrom playgrounds to neighborhoods, to emergency rooms to Congress, these are all places where women with maternal hearts can help each other see what we owe one another.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nerika bachiochi\ncatholic feminism\nabortion\nDobbs v.
