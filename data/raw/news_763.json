for legal abortion at the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia on May 2, 2022. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday, August 17, 2022, issued an order temporarily blocking the state's six-week abortion ban from being enforced while a lawsuit brought by providers goes forward.\n\nJoshua Boucher/The State/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily blocked the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban from being enforced, granting a request from state abortion providers for a temporary injunction while their challenge to the law continues.\n    \n\n            South Carolina\u2019s law, \u200bS.1, \u200bhad been in effect since June 27, \u200bwhen a judge lifted a federal court\u2019s hold on the ban \u200bthe week after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n            Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and Greenville Women\u2019s Clinic, as well as two individual providers, filed their lawsuit on July 13, alleging that the six-week prohibition on the procedure violates several clauses of South Carolina\u2019s \u200bconstitution. A circuit court judge in late July declined to block the ban and recommended the lawsuit move to the state\u2019s high court.\n    \n\n            The South Carolina Supreme Court, in its \u200bunanimous ruling issued Wednesday, offered \u201cno opinion on the likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cTo the extent we address the merits, we acknowledge an arguably close question is presented, which further supports the need to maintain the status quo \u200b(that allowed abortions during the first twelve weeks, or first trimester, of pregnancy) by granting a temporary injunction,\u201d the court said.\n    \n\n            S.1, passed in 2021, had banned abortions once \u200bwhat it called a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is detected, which can be as early as \u200bfour weeks, and more commonly, six weeks \u200binto pregnancy, with exceptions for \u200bfetal anomalies, risk to the life of the mother\u200b, or in \u200bsome cases of rape or incest. \u200b\n    \n\n            \u200bThe term \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is controversial because a heart with chambers does not exist until the end of the tenth week of gestation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says the medically accurate terms are \u201cembryonic cardiac activity\u201d prior to eight weeks of gestation, and \u201cfetal cardiac activity\u201d after eight weeks of gestation.\n    \n\n            In practice, many people do not realize they are pregnant at the six-week point. \n    \n\n            With the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s order, medical providers can immediately return to providing abortions after six weeks while the case proceeds, according to a Planned Parenthood South Atlantic spokesperson, who said they \u201cwill return to providing abortions past six weeks as soon as possible, likely this week.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWe applaud the court\u2019s decision to protect the people of South Carolina from this cruel law that interferes with a person\u2019s private medical decision. For more than six weeks, patients have been forced to travel hundreds of miles for an abortion or suffer the life-altering consequences of forced pregnancy,\u201d Jenny Black, the head of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement Wednesday.\n    \n\n            South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican, said in a statement that his office was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the order, but that it was \u201cimportant to point out this is a temporary injunction.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThe court didn\u2019t rule on the constitutionality of the Fetal Heartbeat law. We will continue to defend the law,\u201d Wilson said.\n    \n\n            Legal fights are also underway in several other states over abortion bans and other laws that greatly limit the procedure after the US Supreme Court ended a constitutional right to an abortion on June 24.\n\n\n            While the six-week ban is caught up in the courts, South Carolina lawmakers are currently considering legislation that would ban most abortions ahead of a special legislative session.\n    \n\n            A state House committee on Tuesday advanced a bill that would ban abortion at every stage of pregnancy and eliminate the exception for cases of rape and incest. The bill heads to the full House for consideration later this month.\n    \n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
