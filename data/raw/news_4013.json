Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, to Poland\u2019s increased\u00a0restrictions\u00a0on access to emergency contraception, to Brazil\u2019s\u00a0clampdown\u00a0on sexual health education, this is a difficult time for women.\nBut if the global feminist movement has proved anything over the years, it is that it can overcome powerful resistance to defend the rights of marginalised groups. In 2020, it will do so again.\nThe challenge is formidable. An inevitable corollary of the authoritarianism,\u00a0ethno-nationalism, and xenophobia embraced by political leaders in many countries \u2014 in particular, Brazil, Hungary, India, Turkey, and the United States \u2014 is the perpetuation of regressive gender norms.\nAccording to \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders like Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and India\u2019s Narendra Modi, women are born to be wives and mothers; immigrants and racial, religious, and ethnic minorities are dangerous and inferior; and LGBTQI+ persons deserve ostracism, detention, or even death.\nThese leaders have emboldened people who share their views to engage in discrimination and violent attacks against racial or other\u00a0minorities, migrants,\u00a0women, and other marginalizsd groups.\nThrough measures like restrictions on abortion and contraception and the\u00a0removal\u00a0of protections for LGBTQI+ people, these leaders have sought to control people\u2019s bodies, sexuality, and reproduction, and punish those who defy their outdated beliefs.\nFor example, immediately upon entering the White House, US President Donald Trump reinstated the \u201cglobal gag rule,\u201d which, by barring US aid to any international organisation that provides, refers, or advocates for abortion care, is deadly for women.\nYet, as president of the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition and a longtime women\u2019s rights advocate, I have seen firsthand what the feminist movement can do. Consider Argentine feminists\u2019 fight against highly restrictive abortion laws.\nTwenty years ago, at the United Nations, Argentinian diplomats refused even to acknowledge sexual health or reproductive rights. But in 2005, Argentine feminists launched the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortion, beginning a grueling uphill battle against powerful adversaries.\n\n\u201c\nIf the global feminist movement has proved anything over the years, it is that it can overcome powerful resistance to defend the rights of marginalised groups.\n\nIn 2018, hundreds of thousands of activists took to the streets across the country wearing green handkerchiefs (now a global symbol of the fight for abortion rights) to\u00a0demand\u00a0that the Senate pass a bill legalising abortion. They lost, but only narrowly \u2014 an outcome that would have seemed impossible just a couple of decades earlier. And they kept fighting. Last month, Argentina inaugurated a president, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who has vowed to\u00a0legalise abortion.\nAchieving social change to protect marginalised groups is never an easy process. There are no quick victories over weak opposition. But, as feminists have proved time and again, with sustained commitment, changes that once seemed impossible can later seem inevitable.\nIn the last year alone, there have been numerous examples of such changes. The Mexican state of Oaxaca and the Australian state of New South Wales decriminalised\u00a0abortion, as did Northern Ireland, while others liberalised their laws, expanding the circumstances in which women can access safe, legal abortion services. In April, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0struck down\u00a0the country\u2019s abortion law as unconstitutional, setting the stage for decriminalisation this year.\nBeyond abortion, Austria, Ecuador, Northern Ireland, and Taiwan all\u00a0legalized same-sex marriage\u00a0in 2019. Moreover, in a striking shift of political power, Finland elected\u00a0Sanna Marin, a 34-year-old woman, as prime minister. Women now lead all five political parties comprising the country\u2019s governing coalition, and four of them are under the age of 40.\nAdvocates for women\u2019s rights are committed to making 2020 at least as important a year in the global fight for equality, not only for women and girls, but for all people. In India, for example, women are\u00a0leading protests\u00a0against a new citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims.\nParticularly inspiring are the young female and non-binary activists who are leading movements for transformative change. For example, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez is demanding gun reform in the US; Bertha Z\u00fa\u00f1iga is defending the land rights of Honduras\u2019 indigenous people; and Jamie Margolin and\u00a0Greta Thunberg\u00a0have emerged as leading climate activists.\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of the United Nations\u2019\u00a0Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which recognised women\u2019s rights as human rights and established gender equality\u2019s place on the global agenda.\nSince the platform\u2019s creation, activists have used it to hold governments to their commitments on a wide range of issues, including maternal mortality, child marriage, gender-based violence, political participation, and reproductive rights.\nFeminist activists will continue this work at the Beijing+25 Generation Equality Forum, convened by Mexico and France, in Mexico City in May and Paris in July. There, they will call for bold new commitments to address crosscutting challenges like climate change and the refugee crisis.\nThis broader perspective is vital. In fact, feminists must strengthen their alliances with other progressive movements, especially those fighting for environmental sustainability, racial justice, and LGBTQI+ rights.\nOnly by mobilising together and supporting one another\u2019s agendas can we overcome white supremacist, heteronormative, patriarchal, and exploitative forces to build a more just, equitable, and sustainable world.\nThe effects of these efforts will be shaped by decisions made by citizens and policymakers. The US presidential election in November will be particularly consequential. For better or worse, the US has an outsize impact on how the rest of the world addresses issues ranging from climate action and foreign aid to diplomacy and human rights.\nIf Trump loses the election, the US could again set a positive example, reviving multilateral cooperation, renewing support for UN agencies working on health and human rights, and ensuring that key government and judicial posts are once more occupied by qualified individuals who support human rights and the rule of law.\nBut, whatever happens, one thing is certain: the feminist movement and its progressive allies will not give up.\n\nFran\u00e7oise Girard is President of the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2020.www.project-syndicate.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    Did you find this article useful?
