Outlawing it would thus introduce a de-facto ban on the vast majority of legal abortions.\nLeader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party Jaroslaw Kaczynski has already expressed his support for the bill, along with a number of other PiS lawmakers.\nPresident Andrzej Duda has also vowed to sign such a bill into law, saying he was \u201ca strong opponent of eugenic abortion, killing children with disabilities\u201d and claiming that abortions on the grounds of foetus malformations are \u201csimply murder\u201d.\nThis is not the first time the ruling party attempts to limit women\u2019s ability to get an abortion. Although Poland already has one of the toughest abortion laws in Europe, PiS has, since coming to power in 2015, tried to implement a near-total ban, sparking mass protests and so-called \u201cBlack Friday\u201d women marches that forced the government to backtrack.\nPolish government vows not to tighten abortion law, for\u00a0now\nPublic opinion split, but leaning towards liberalization of abortion\nSupported by hard-line conservative groups, the proposals sparked outrage among local activists and international rights groups who warned that a ban on legal abortions would put the health of countless women at risk. Compared to roughly 1,000 legal abortions, analysts estimate that tens of thousands of pregnancies are illegally terminated in Poland every year \u2013 sometimes in dangerous and unsanitary conditions \u2013 while many women also decide to travel abroad, including to Germany, to have an abortion.\nA survey found that the topic remains highly contentious in Poland, with over 40% of Poles supporting the status quo, while 15% of respondents backed a total ban on abortion and more than one third in favour of liberalizing the current law, adopted in 1993 and which allows terminating pregnancies in three cases: when the mother\u2019s health is at risk, when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, and in case of fetal abnormality. A more recent opinion poll found that more than half of Poles believed women should have the right to have an abortion up to the 12th week.\nSexual education in the spotlight\nThe second so-called \u201canti-pedophilia\u201d bill, which was already discussed in Parliament last year, would ban and criminalize any attempt to spread sexual education to children in Poland.\nThe European Parliament passed a resolution last November condemning the \u201calarming, misguided and detrimental\u201d law and warning that the lack of education regarding sexuality and sexual reproduction \u201cputs the safety and well-being of young people at risk\u201d.\nAfter Warsaw mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski signed in February last year an \u201cLGBT declaration\u201d pledging, among other things, to introduce sexual education classes in line with the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines, the topic has taken center stage and divided public opinion, with conservative critics often likening sex education classes to the \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d and its attempt to \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d Poland\u2019s youth.\n\u201cThe sexualisation of children must be fought and defeated\u201d, Poland\u2019s de-facto leader Kaczynski said, labeling it as a \u201ccivilizational threat to all of Europe\u201d.\nAlthough allegedly meant to combat pedophilia and sexual abuse against children, critics fear the law, that could punish anyone who \u201cpropagate or approve of engagement by minors in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, could be used to prosecute and jail \u2013 for up to 3 years \u2013 anyone who teaches sexual education, further restricting young people\u2019s knowledge of a topic already barely taught and talked about.\nMain photo credit: Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nCouncil of Europe slams Poland over women\u2019s rights and\u00a0abortion\n\n\n\nTagsEducation \u2022 Gender \u2022 Poland \u2022 Polish politics\n\n\n \n\nAbout\n Kafkadesk Krak\u00f3w office \n\nStaffed with a growing team of passionate journalists and local contributors, our Krak\u00f3w office is fully dedicated to covering all-things Polish, from reporting on the latest news to promoting fascinating local initiatives across Poland.\n\n kafkadesk.org  \n\n\n\n\n    4 comments on \u201cPoland moves to ban abortion and criminalize sexual\u00a0education\u201d  \n\n\n\nPingback: Poland asks Czech Republic to stop cross-border \u201cabortion tourism\u201d \u2013 Kafkadesk\n\n\n\nPingback: Women\u2019s rights in the spotlight as Slovakia seeks to tighten abortion laws \u2013 Kafkadesk\n\n\n\nPingback: Freedom of intimidation in Poland: Scandal at the University of Silesia in Katowice \u2013 Kafkadesk\n\n\n\nPingback: Polish couple hand out rainbow face masks to fight homophobia and coronavirus \u2013 Kafkadesk\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\n\n\u0394 \n\n\n\nPost navigation\nPrevious Post Next Post \n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us!My TweetsKafkadesk \n\nKafkadesk\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\n \n\n\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comment\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nReblog\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nSubscribed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tKafkadesk\t\t\t\n\n\n\nJoin 692 other subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSign me up\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?
