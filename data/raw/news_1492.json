Doug Burgum signed an abortion ban at six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 even in cases of rape or incest \u2014 into law on Monday.\"This bill clarifies and refines existing state law ... and reaffirms North Dakota as a pro-life state,\" Burgum said in a statement.The law, one of the strictest in the country, takes effect immediately.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurgum's signature came after North Dakota state senators overwhelmingly passed the bill Wednesday.Supporters have said the measure protects all human life, while opponents contend it will have dire consequences for women and girls.\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards (left) speaks with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum (center) before the start of a meeting between President Biden and governors visiting from states around the country in the East Room of the White House on February 10, 2023.\u00a0\n\n            \n                / Getty Images\n\n                          \n\"We talk about rape and incest, and those are horrific circumstances,\" Republican Sen. Janne Myrdal, of Edinburg, said while speaking in support of the bill on the Senate floor. \"We certainly want to encourage any child, any woman, that experiences any of this, to immediately go to medical care and get these things taken care of before there's fertilization.\"\n\n\nMyrdal added that lawmakers should focus on catching perpetrators and boosting resources for rape kits in order to seek justice for victims, rather than fighting for abortion rights.Republican Sen. Judy Lee, of West Fargo, said in opposition to the bill that she received an email a few weeks ago from a couple with two 10-year-old foster daughters who were victims of incest.\"No 10-year old girl, who neither has a body or a mind which is capable of dealing with a pregnancy, should be denied a reasonable conversation with a medical professional and her parents about whether or not that's the right decision,\" Lee said. \"I am not in favor of abortion as a birth control means,\" she added, \"but these protections that exist are there for a reason.\"The bill passed with a 42-5 vote.\n\n\nLast month, the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled a state abortion ban will remain blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds. Lawmakers have said they are passing this abortion bill and sending a message to the state's Supreme Court that the people of North Dakota want to restrict abortion.\"North Dakota has always been pro-life and believed in valuing the moms and children both,\" Myrdal said in an interview with The Associated Press after Burgum signed the bill. \"We're pretty happy and grateful that the governor stands with that value.\"\n\n\nThe Battle Over Abortion\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas bill would make providers ask women why they're seeking abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlabama governor signs bill into law protecting IVF providers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance enshrines constitutional right to an abortion in a global first\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVS and Walgreens to start selling abortion pills this month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Republic blocks bill that would protect access to IVF nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Politics\nNorth Dakota\nAbortion\n\nFirst published on April 24, 2023 / 6:28 PM EDT\n\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.
