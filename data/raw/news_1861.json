Carney\nWashington Examiner\nJune 15, 2023\n\n\n\nDemocrats\u00a0in 2022 enjoyed campaigning against the\u00a0Republicans\u2019\u00a0\u201cnational abortion ban,\u201d which seemed to work. It sounded very absolute, and most Americans\u2019 views on abortion are not absolute.\nMost Americans believe that abortion should sometimes be illegal and sometimes be legal. Most think it is sometimes immoral, and sometimes acceptable.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Most Americans also agree with the substance of the Republicans\u2019 2022 \u201cnational abortion ban,\u201d according to the\u00a0latest Gallup Poll.\nGallup\u2019s writers chose to tout the post-Dobbs\u00a0shift in favor of abortion in this poll, but even after this shift, here\u2019s a telling fact: only 37% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in the second trimester, while 55% say it should be illegal.\nLindsey Graham\u2019s proposed \u201cnational abortion ban\u201d kicked in at 15 weeks. The poll asked about the \u201csecond three months of pregnancy,\u201d which begins in the 13th week.\nAgain, this isn\u2019t new. Gallup has always found that a majority believe second-trimester abortions should be illegal.\nSo why would the public turn against the GOP for advancing a bill to ban second-trimester abortion when the public \u2014 by a nearly 20-point margin \u2014 thinks second-trimester abortions should be illegal? Again, it was spun by the Democrats and the national news media.\n\u201cNational abortion ban\u201d sounds like a total abortion ban. And the left-leaning major news media, where more than 90% of reporters and editors are far left on abortion, generally adopted the Democrats\u2019 spin.\nCheck out this CNN\u00a0story. It simply adopts the Democrats\u2019 poll-tested wording in the headline, and makes you read until paragraph 11 to learn that the ban only kicked in when the baby was 15 weeks in gestation.\nMost Americans are not where the pro-life movement is, believing that the government has a duty to protect human life, even in its earliest stages. But most Americans are where congressional Republicans are: wanting to ban abortion after the first trimester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTimothy P.
