We've run all of the new iPhone 12 models through our battery test, and the results are mixed.The iPhone 12 mini is the smallest of the bunch and has a small battery to match, turning in the shortest runtime over 5G. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro lasted longer but are a step behind competing Android phones.See our full iPhone 12 reviewThe best phones right nowiPhone 12 mini size \u2014 here\u2019s how small it truly isBased on our tests, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the one to get if you want the longest endurance and fares well against Android phones. It doesn't quite break the 11-hour mark to land on our best phone battery life list, but it's close.\u00a0iPhone 12 battery test: How it worksHere's how the Tom's Guide battery test works. It surfs the web continuously at 150 nits of screen brightness, launching a new site every 30 seconds until the battery drains. For the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, we ran this test over 5G and 4G, and the difference was pretty dramatic.While it's not the only factor, we've included the size of the battery for each phone listed below. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro battery sizes are based on certifications and teardowns, as Apple does not list battery capacity as part of its specs.iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro battery test resultsSwipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 Battery life (hrs:mins)Battery size (mAh)iPhone 12 mini (5G)7:282,227 mAhiPhone 12 (5G)8:252,815 mAhiPhone 12 Pro (5G/)9:062,815 mAhiPhone 12 Pro Max (5G/)10:533,687 mAhiPhone 11 (4G)11:163,110 mAhiPhone 11 Pro (4G)10:243,046 mAhGalaxy S20 5G (60Hz/120Hz)9:31/8:044,000 mAhGalaxy S20 Plus 5G (60Hz/120Hz)10:31/8:554,500 mAhGalaxy S20 Plus Ultra 5G (60Hz/120Hz)12:03/9:135,000 mAhOnePlus 8T 5G (60/Hz/120Hz)10:49/9:584,500 mAhGoogle Pixel 5 (60Hz/90Hz)9:56/9:294,080 mAhiPhone 12 mini battery lifeThe iPhone 12 mini has a small 2,227 mAh battery, so it's not a big surprise that this phone lasted only 7 hours and 28 minutes on our web surfing battery over 5G. The iPhone SE 2020 lasted a considerably longer 9:18 with an even smaller 1,821 mAh battery. However, we conducted that test over 4G, which uses less power.\u00a0iPhone 12 battery lifeThe regular iPhone 12 lasted just 8 hours and 25 minutes over AT&T's 5G network. Last year's iPhone 11 lasted a whopping 11 hours and 16 minutes over 4G. To compare, we switched the iPhone 12 to 4G-only, and it endured for 10 hours and 23 minutes.\u00a0Samsung's Galaxy phones generally last longer on a charge over 5G, though they lose a lot of juice when their screens are set to the faster 120Hz refresh rate. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S20 lasted 9:31 on 5G but that dipped down to 8:04 at 120Hz.Google's Pixel 5 was nearly an hour better than the iPhone 12 at 9:56; it dropped to 9:29 with the screen set to a faster 90Hz refresh rate. Both of those times are well ahead of the iPhone 12's 8:25 result over 5G.\u00a0iPhone 12 Pro battery lifeThe iPhone 12 Pro fared a bit better, lasting 9 hours and 6 minutes minutes over T-Mobile's 5G network. That runtime jumped to 11:24 over 4G. The iPhone 11 Pro lasted 10:24 over 4G.The similarly priced Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus lasted 10:31 over 5G, which is nearly 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro. The runtime of Samsung's phone dropped to 8:55 at 120Hz, which is slightly worse than the iPhone 12 Pro over 5G.\u00a0To be fair, the Galaxy S20 Plus has a larger 4,500 mAh battery, while the iPhone 12 Pro is rated for 2,815 mAh.iPhone 12 Pro Max battery lifeNow we're talking. The iPhone 12 Pro Max's 3,687 mAh battery lasted a very impressive 10 hours and 53 minutes over 5G. That beats the iPhone 12 Pro by nearly two hours. The Galaxy S20 Ultra with its much bigger 5,000 mAh battery endured for 12 hours and 3 minutes, which fell to 9:13 in 120Hz display mode.iPhone 12 battery life: Bottom lineOf course, our web surfing test is just one way to measure battery life. And we know that no one is going to surf the web for 10 or 11 hours straight. But this test does give us a way to compare endurance across multiple phones, even if it is a taxing test.When you're not surfing the web, the iPhone 12's Smart Data mode can automatically switch to 4G to help save battery life. But this only kicks in during certain scenarios, such as when you're streaming music with the screen turned off.Overall, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro battery life is a bummer over 5G, at least when surfing the web. So you may want to manually switch to 4G in some cases to save extra juice.\u00a0Today's best iPhone 12 deals$499.99$429.99ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nGet the BEST of Tom\u2019s Guide daily right in your inbox: Sign up now!Upgrade your life with the Tom\u2019s Guide newsletter.

When it is, iPhones actually look a lot better than the rest. 2,775mAh in iPhones vs. 4,000-4,500mAh on the others. See Below:\n\nSeconds of surfing per mAh of battery drain:\niPhone 12- 10.92 sec\niPhone 12 Pro- 11.81 sec\nGalaxy S20- 8.57 sec\nGalaxy S20 Plus- 8.41sec\nOnePlus 8T- 8.65 sec\nPixel 5- 8.76 sec\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustAnotherNobody\n\n\nI'm sure when your iPhone battery runs out at 3:30pm, you'll be happy knowing that it performs better per mAh than other phones.\n\nYou'll just be wishing you had more of those mAh...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmoibensa\n\n\nJustAnotherNobody said:I'm sure when your iPhone battery runs out at 3:30pm, you'll be happy knowing that it performs better per mAh than other phones.\n\nYou'll just be wishing you had more of those mAh...\nFair point but less mAh is what allows the phone to be thinner and lighter. That\u2019s what Apple goes for\u2014not saying it\u2019s what is most important for me. As far as charge, they were able to add 5G reduce the battery size and keep battery performance (according to them) just like the previous gen iPhone 11 Pro, and that in it if itself is an accomplishment. I\u2019d be more interested to see this report with Smart Data vs 5G only\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nikjadoon\n\n\n5G battery life reductions were quite predictable. But, what actual settings did you use? There are six total options available for 5G vs 4G. You have no methodology in this article nor the iPhone 12 / 12 Pro reviews.\n\nQuestion 1: Are your \"5G\" results with 5G On or 5G Auto?\n\n\nQuestion 2: What data mode was used? Allow More Data on 5G, Standard, or Low Data Mode?\n\n\nQuestion 3: Why on Earth were some iPhones on T-Mobile's 5G and others on AT&T's 5G?\n\nThe regular iPhone 12 lasted just 8 hours and 25 minutes over AT&T's 5G network. \nThe iPhone 12 Pro fared a bit better, lasting 9 hours and 6 minutes minutes over T-Mobile's 5G network. \nThis article is genuinely incomplete. You need a rigorous testing environment (and reviewer) to publish accurate battery life results. Hope to see these corrected in this article or in a follow-up.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Spoonauer\n\n\nmoibensa said:By 5g do you mean iPhone was set to 5G only or with Smart Data?\nAlso, it\u2019s important to take into account the battery sizes. The iPhones have much lower battery maH but perform far better due to advanced chipsets and hardware+software collaborationWe used default settings with Smart Data on. Smart Data doesn't help with web surfing though. We have a separate story on performance and yes it's not close with Android.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Spoonauer\n\n\nmoibensa said:By 5g do you mean iPhone was set to 5G only or with Smart Data?\nAlso, it\u2019s important to take into account the battery sizes.

We simply wanted to show how the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro stacked up to similarly priced smartphones. Once the battery sizes become official, we will add them.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSh4veD4ve\n\n\nWas this mm-wave 5G (VZ, ATT) or sub-6 (T-Mo)?\n\nIf it's mm-wave, yes, it's powering a whole 2nd radio (well the RF portion anyway), so of course battery life will be worse. \nIf it's sub-6 like T-Mo, this is significant, because it's 1 radio, and it would be much less efficient.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicancto\n\n\nhow come iPhone 12 Pro lasted for about an hour longer than the regular iPhone 12?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2muaddib\n\n\nicancto said:how come iPhone 12 Pro lasted for about an hour longer than the regular iPhone 12?\nI think it\u2019s the testing methodology: probably reviewer was launching similar sites in circle, so some pages remained cached in memory (6gb in Pro\u2019s), hence less CPU and radio usage -> less power drained.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 13 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\nMost Popular5 top new shows to stream this week on Netflix, Disney Plus, TV and more (March 18-24)By Kelly WooMarch 18, 2024Volta a Catalunya 2024 live streams: How to watch one of the hardest stage races on the calendarBy Simon WarrenMarch 18, 2024I tried Dyson's 'most intelligent' hairdryer yet, which promises to look after your scalpBy Lucy ScottingMarch 18, 2024How to watch 'In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon' online \u2014 release date, TV channel, live streamsBy Daniel PatemanMarch 17, 2024How to watch '90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After?' season 8 online \u2014 stream from anywhereBy Aatif SulleymanMarch 17, 2024PS5 Pro could blow away Xbox on GTA 6 performanceBy Alyse StanleyMarch 17, 2024The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra now looks dead \u2014 and this is the replacementBy Alyse StanleyMarch 17, 2024How to watch \u2018The Great Celebrity Bake Off 2024\u2019 online \u2013 stream the series 7 from anywhereBy Daniel PatemanMarch 17, 2024Cheaper Meta Quest 3 Lite just leaked \u2014 here\u2019s your first lookBy Alan Martin March 17, 2024Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: Everything we know so farBy Alan Martin March 17, 2024How to watch Selection Sunday: live stream the March Madness 2024 regional line-ups and seedings online and on TVBy Aatif SulleymanMarch 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST READMOST SHARED1Amazon Big Spring Sale has arrived \u2014 5 great water bottle deals starting at $92Hurry!
