If an embryo has not been implanted, then no one is pregnant. And \"if there is no pregnancy to terminate, there can be no abortion\" the opinion reads.The opinion does not include a definition for \"living.\" The state's strict abortion ban sets life at conception, well before an embryo reaches viability.No exceptions listed in Tennessee abortion lawTennessee\u2019s \u201ctrigger ban\u201d abortion law was officially enacted in August, following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the Roe v. Wade precedent earlier this summer.The law was passed in 2019 by anti-abortion Republicans. After it took effect, medical professionals, including those who work in fertility, began raising concerns about the lack of exceptions in the law.The law includes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, nor does it have an exception for abortions performed to prevent the severe injury or death of a pregnant patient. Doctors say abortions are medically necessary in certain circumstances, such as during an ongoing but incomplete miscarriage that threatens the life of the patient.Why subscribe?Tennessean subscriber exclusive: Join our Grand Divisions politics group textPoliticians defend lawGov. Bill Lee has repeatedly said he\u2019s comfortable with the law as is.Other Republican lawmakers have claimed the law is designed to allow doctors to perform abortions during medical emergencies threatening a mother's life.But the law doesn\u2019t actually include that exception.Any doctor who performs any abortion for any reason could face criminal charges under the law. It does provide an \"affirmative defense\" clause, through which an abortion provider could defend the procedure if the pregnant patient was in danger of dying or debilitating injury. The clause takes effect only after criminal felony charges have been filed.Anti-abortion supporters of the law have argued no prosecutor would pursue a doctor for an abortion performed due to a medical emergency. Investigation and enforcement of the law falls to local law enforcement. The Tennessean in September surveyed all 32 district attorneys on what priority they place on investigating and pursuing criminal prosecutions around abortion.Few of them responded, but Barry Staubus in Sullivan County called the law \u201cuncharted territory.\u201dSkrmetti's office has not yet returned a request for comment.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
