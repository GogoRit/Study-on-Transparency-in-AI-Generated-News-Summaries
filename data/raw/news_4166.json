Data are limited, but at present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population. However, due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, pregnant women can be affected. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19. We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk. There is no evidence that pregnant women present with different signs and/or symptoms or are at higher risk of severe illness. So far, there is no evidence on mother-to-child transmission when infection manifest in the third trimester, based on negative samples from amniotic fluid, cord blood, vaginal discharge, neonatal throat swabs or breastmilk. Similarly, evidence of increased severe maternal or neonatal outcomes is uncertain, and limited to infection in the third trimester, with some cases of premature rupture of membranes, fetal distress and preterm birth reported.\nIt is important to ensure that essential health services and operations continue to address the sexual and reproductive health and rights of people living in humanitarian and fragile settings. Therefore, all emergency sexual and reproductive health services (intrapartum care for all deliveries, emergency obstetric and new-born care, post- abortion care, clinical care for rape survivors, and HIV prevention measures) and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (antenatal care, postnatal care, essential new-born care, breastfeeding support, family planning and contraception services, cervical cancer screening, clinical management of HIV and sexually transmitted infections) must remain available. A safe and positive childbirth experience includes:\n\u2022 Being treated with respect and dignity and appropriate pain relief strategies:\n\u2022 Having a companion of choice present during delivery;\n\u2022 Clear communication by maternity staff;\n\u2022 Mobility in labour where possible, and birth position of choice.\n\u2022 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (May 2020): Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection in Pregnancy, Information for healthcare professionals\n\u2022 World Health Organization (March 2020): Q&A: Pregnancy, childbirth and COVID-19\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nSource\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees\n\nFormat\n\nManual and Guideline\n\nThemes\n\nFood and NutritionHealth\n\nDisaster type\n\nEpidemic\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n+ 1 more\n\nWorld Vision South Sudan: Annual Report 2023 (October 2022 to September 2023)\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Other          \nSource\n\nWorld Vision\n\nPosted\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n1 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n+ 5 more\n\nSouth Sudan Regional Refugee Response Plan - 2022 Year End Report\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Evaluation and Lessons Learned          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n+ 1 more\n\nUNICEF South Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report No. 1 - January 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nUNICEF\n\nPosted\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n+ 3 more\n\nSouth Sudan: Refugee Policy Review Framework Country Summary as at 31 December 2021\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Analysis          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
