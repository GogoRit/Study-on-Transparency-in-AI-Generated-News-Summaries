More than 35,000 followers were stripped away from SFLA when the app blocked account managers from appealing the futile ban.\u00a0\nPerhaps they were afraid to have a real conversation \u2026 Unlike SFLA President Kristan Hawkins whose answers to the flustered questions\u00a0from a University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) student during Hawkins\u2019 recent campus stop on her\u00a0tour entitled The Future is Anti-Abortion has been a viral sensation. Watching the student refer to handmade signs as \u201cfacts\u201d in a debate didn\u2019t make her case. It\u2019s a scientific fact\u00a0that it\u2019s a baby\u2013a human being\u2013getting aborted. \u00a0\nPerhaps that\u2019s why TikTok stepped in?\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe last video SFLA posted from the UTSA event before being banned from TikTok was\u00a0going viral across many social media platforms with nearly 2.2 million views on YouTube and counting. Out of all the social media platforms the clip was published on, TikTok was the only one to deem it a violation.\u00a0\nThe video has received countless shares, likes, and commentary made by creators on the effectives of the dialogue breaking down a complex issue. YouTuber \u201cThe Officer Tatum\u201d called the exchange \u201cthe most epic beatdown I have ever seen.\u201d \u00a0\nWhat didn\u2019t TikTok like about it? SFLA account managers don\u2019t know because they were given no warning from TikTok \u2026 and no way to appeal.\u00a0\n\nThis is not the first attempt at censorship of SFLA on TikTok. The platform has previously taken down a video claiming it violated \u201ccertain terms\u201d and \u201ccommunity guidelines\u201d and suddenly restored it once SFLA reached out for explanation.\u00a0SFLA account managers note the most recent removal came without warning and explanation. \u00a0\nToday\u2019s news stems from a larger conversation on censorship that BigTech and social media platforms are adapting in their anti-free speech movement. In USA Today, attorney Jonathan Turley outlines the wave of progressives who \u201chave adopted a dangerous shift in their strategy of calling for corporations to censor speech.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nTurley writes, \u201cA glimpse of that future was made clear by Twitter last week, when the company declared that it would ban any ads disagreeing with its view of climate change. Previously, Democratic senators demanded that Twitter expand censorship to include blocking disinformation on climate change as well as an array of other areas.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWill the pro-life movement make the cut of \u201cacceptable\u201d speech in this new era of censorship or be treated like those with differing climate views? It is clear the left is using big corporations to suppress the voice of the pro-life movement, but we refuse to be silenced.\u00a0\u00a0\nSFLA is the only national pro-life organization whose fulltime mission is dedicated to training and equipping college, high school, medical, and law school students, equipping them to be effective in fighting the human rights atrocity of our day \u2013 abortion. \u00a0\nAt the heart of this effort is the need for the pro-life message to be seen and heard by the generation most targeted for abortion\u2013both when they were in the womb and now by an industry that wants to be paid to end their children\u2019s lives.\u00a0And if pro-abortion radicals are so convinced that they\u2019re right, why hide from pro-life free speech or block it? What are they afraid of \u2026 the truth? \u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Free Speech Advocates Say \u201cNO\u201d to Teachers Censoring Pro-Life Movement\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 4,257\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
