Wade, the Pro-Life Generation is all grown up and has been working in legislatures, in courts, in communities, online, and on the ground to ensure that no woman stands alone. We women don\u2019t need abortion, and it\u2019s time for our nation to recognize our dignity and the dignity of our children as we move beyond Roe. I am looking forward to engaging with students and answering all the questions they may have.\u201d \u202f\u00a0\nClick here\u00a0to watch a recent confrontation between Hawkins and a student trying to stump the pro-life expert.\u00a0\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, V.A., and WASHINGTON, D.C. (04-26-2022)\u202f\u2013\u202fWednesday,\u202fKristan Hawkins, President of Students for Life Action and Students for Life of America, will make the final stop on her Spring Speaking Tour, entitled\u202fThe Future Is Anti-Abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis evening\u2019s speech will be delivered at the University of Virginia (UVA) at 7 p.m. local time. During her speech, Hawkins will outline the Pro-Life Generation\u2019s plan for a Post-Roe and Post-Dobbs America \u2013 including SFLA\u2019s massive campaign raising awareness of nonviolent abortion alternatives, community support systems, and policy changes needed to help women and families thrive and protect them from the abortion industry.\u00a0\nAfter her speech at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) earlier this month, clips of Hawkins\u2019 interactions with pro-abortion students went viral online, garnering millions of views and tens of thousands of comments.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt tonight\u2019s stop, UVA, lead-up to Hawkins\u2019 speech has included ongoing discrimination against pro-life students and vandalization of fliers advertising Hawkins\u2019 visit. According to the SFLA Blog:\u00a0\u00a0\nNot only are anti-life students defaming posters across campus with event details, but they are also replacing them with misleading \u201cfact sheets.\u201d The defamation of Hawkins\u2019 character and objectively false information spread throughout UVA campus is alarming.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nEmma Camp, UVA senior, wrote about the consequences for viewpoint diversity in The New York Times.\u201cIn the classroom, backlash for unpopular opinions is so commonplace that many students have stopped voicing them, sometimes fearing lower gradesif they don\u2019t censor themselves,\u201d she said.\u202f\u202f\nClick here to read more at SFLA\u2019s blog.\nHawkins\u2019 unapologetic message and direct tone are known for sparking debate and backlash on university campuses. On this Spring tour, Hawkins aims to prepare students for the impending Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s HealthSupreme Court case and the possible reversal of Roe v. Wade. She will educate audiences on the resources and support systems standing ready to serve abortion-seeking women and their families and prove that America does not and never did need abortion.\u00a0\n\nTonight\u2019s Tour Stop:\u00a0\nUniversity of Virginia (VA)\u00a0\n180 McCormick Rd, \u00a0Charlottesville, VA\nNewcomb Hall Ballroom (3rd floor of Newcomb Hall)\n\u00a0Wednesday, April 27, at 7 p.m. local time\u00a0\nParking:\u00a0Central Grounds Garage400 Emmet St SCharlottesville, VA 22903\nLearn more about Kristan Hawkins at\u202fKristanHawkins.com\u00a0\nFor interviews, contact [email\u00a0protected]\n\u201330\u2013\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction), a 501c4, along with its 501c3 sister organization, Students for Life of America (SFLA), make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages.
