It\u2019s dependable, reliable, and has enough power to tow and haul almost anything that you need it to, but really, how often do you need to tow anything? Sure, there might be a few times a year that you can make good use of a Tacoma TRD Pro, but do you really need one in your everyday life? Probably not, and here are three reasons why you don\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s a truck\nTrucks are cool and practical when you need to move stuff from place to place or want to enjoy the pleasures of going off-road from time to time. But if you really think about it, the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro could be just a little too much truck for you. After all, do you really to spend $47,000 on an off-road specific pick-up that feels more at home on a serious off-road trail than it does on that nice, clean pavement on the way to your grandma\u2019s house? Probably not.\nAccording to The Drive, around 75 percent of truck owners use their trucks for towing once per year or less and nearly 70 percent of truck owners go off-road only one time per year or less. So, that basically means \u201cnever.\u201d Be honest with yourself, how often would really use a truck like this for its true intended purpose?\n2020 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro | Toyota \nThe TRD Package is awesome, but unnecessary\nWe spent a week driving the 2021 Tacoma TRD Pro around town and even had the chance to drive it in the snow. It was a lot of fun and we could easily see why a truck like this could garner so much attention from truck lovers everywhere since it\u2019s slightly lifted, looks the part, and can roll over almost anything you put underneath it.\nHowever, if you\u2019re not going to put the truck through its paces on a regular basis, you\u2019re basically wasting the extra $6,000 that you would spending over the top-line Limited trim. So, if you do have your heart set on getting a Tacoma, then just really think to yourself if you need the extra TRD stuff. The truth is, you probably don\u2019t.\n2020 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro | Toyota\nThe Tacoma TRD Pro gets terrible fuel economy\nIn its non-TRD form, the Tacoma has an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. But when you select the TRD Pro trim, those ratings go down to 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. The drop in mpg is most likely due to modified wheels and suspension, but in our real-world estimates during the time we had the truck, we averaged 15.4 mpg in combined driving.\nThat\u2019s terrible, although, we didn\u2019t expect much considering it\u2019s a truck. But again, if you\u2019re planning to buy a truck like this to drive on a daily basis, it\u2019s a good time to ask yourself if you can live with that kind of fuel economy.\n2021 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro | Joe Santos\nThe Tacoma TRD Pro is still an amazing truck\nDon\u2019t get us wrong, the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro is still an amazing truck when it\u2019s used for what it was built for. But, as the statistics show, most Americans don\u2019t use their trucks as much as they think they do, so do you really need a truck as purpose-built as a Tacoma TRD Pro? Probably not.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\tIs The Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro Worth The Extra Cash?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest in\nTips, Tricks & Trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Most Remote Road Trip You Can Take in North America Is Completely Unpaved and Over 450 Miles From the Closest Town \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Ford SUV With the Best Sales Increase Is Almost Dead \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPreparing Your Car for a Road Trip Is More Important Than You Think \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior Writer \nJoe Santos\n\nTwitterFacebookLinkedinInstagram\nJoe Santos has been an automotive journalist since 2013 and joined MotorBiscuit in 2020.
