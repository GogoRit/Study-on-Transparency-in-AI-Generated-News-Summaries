The hearing has since been removed from the meeting agenda.\"Our intent was to lease or sell a building, not to invite a forum for a national debate about abortion to the city council of Visalia,\" co-partner Patrick Orosco said.\u00a0 \"It has become that despite our best efforts.\"The nonprofit that provides family planning and healthcare services nationwide said it won't give up on its search for a new Visalia home.\"We were forced to give up our sale option due to strong objection from the community,\" said Lauren Babb,\u00a0vice president of public affairs. \"Our\u00a0goal is to find a location to give care in Visalia, and we will continue working with community partners to make sure that happens.\"More:State constitutions vex conservatives\u2019 strategies for a post-Roe worldThe Visalia Planning Commission approved the location on Mooney Boulevard\u00a0in a 4-0 decision over\u00a0some objections\u00a0to the proposed clinic.\u00a0Local developer David Paynter argued the clinic\u00a0did not have sufficient parking and would cause protesters to disrupt shoppers at neighboring retailers Bed\u00a0Bath &\u00a0Beyond and Marshalls. Paynter\u00a0manages the\u00a0businesses, as well as nearby Sequoia Mall and numerous centers along Mooney.He appealed the decision to the Visalia City Council.A public hearing to determine the clinic's fate was postponed several times as controversy around the proposal grew, attracting passionate appeals from opponents and supporters of the clinic.Supporters pointed to the family planning services that the nonprofit provides, particularly to low-income Tulare County residents.\u00a0However, critics objected mainly to Planned Parenthood's abortion services and what would have been a \"highly visible\" location in the city on one of its main thoroughfares.\"Our love for our neighbors is why we so strongly oppose efforts to perform abortions here in Visalia,\"\u00a0Patricia June Boon, a leader of Tulare-Kings Right to Life,\u00a0wrote in a recent Times-Delta opinion column.Babb told the Times-Delta that the Visalia clinic would not perform abortions on-site. She pointed out that Planned Parenthood has existed in Visalia for nearly a decade without a single protest or incident at its Stevenson Street\u00a0clinic.Tulare County has the fourth-highest rates of teen pregnancy in California and ranks among\u00a0the state's highest\u00a0in sexually transmitted diseases, as well. Babb said that's one reason\u00a0Planned Parenthood will remain committed to the region.More:Without Roe v. Wade, their abortions wouldn't have been possible\"Tulare County is a low-income region.\u00a0Our hope was to continue to expand healthcare here. I\u00a0don't think we would've anticipated this outcome,\" Babb said. \"Time is ticking as [Supreme Court decision Roe V. Wade] is\u00a0being eroded. We have to serve California no matter what.\"Before the pandemic, Planned Parenthood's Visalia clinic served about 2,000 patients annually, 75% of whom are low-income. Babb said Planned Parenthood had been searching for a larger Visalia clinic for many years so that it could treat more patients and offer primary care services.\"We had no intentions of trying to rock the boat, so to speak, when we chose this (Mooney)\u00a0location,\" Babb told the Times-Delta. \"We just chose it because it was the first one that made sense in six years.\"These Valley cities ranked the two best places to rent Arizona HS football coach rushed to hospital after game Suzanne Somers dies at 76: 'One of our brightest and most beautiful stars' Temple Israel holds special service to support Israel Seabees, veterans freshen up Ventura County Veterans Memorial Where does Oregon football stand in the national polls after loss to Washington?Joshua Yeager\u00a0is a reporter with the Visalia Times-Delta and a Report for America corps member.
