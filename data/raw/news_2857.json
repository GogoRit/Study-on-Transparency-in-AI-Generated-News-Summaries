Glenn Youngkin attended Virginia\u2019s fourth March for Life, an annual anti-abortion event held outside the Capitol, on April 27, 2022. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendees at Virginia\u2019s fourth March for Life were joined by an unexpected participant on Wednesday \u2014 Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who announced plans to join just a day before the annual anti-abortion event.\n\u201cI\u2019m the governor and I\u2019m pro-life, so it wasn\u2019t a hard decision,\u201d he told a reporter in response to one of a few questions he took from media covering the march. While Youngkin himself wasn\u2019t a speaker, his attendance was a nod to conservative voters after distancing himself from the issue at a key stage of his campaign. Shortly after winning the election, he told The Washington Post that antiabortion legislation wouldn\u2019t be on his \u201cday one agenda.\u201d\nSo far, the governor\u2019s legislative priorities have largely focused on campaign promises to ban \u201cinherently divisive concepts\u201d in public education and expand charter schools \u2014\u00a0 initiatives that have faltered in the state\u2019s Democrat-controlled Senate. But he\u2019s taken a more aggressive pro-life stance through executive actions, including appointing a new diversity officer whose job description includes serving as an \u201cambassador for unborn children.\u201d\nLaura Belchak, who attended the march in a Youngkin campaign T-shirt, cited the appointment as one example of the governor\u2019s support for the pro-life movement. Youngkin has also publicly supported what\u2019s known as a \u201cpain threshold bill,\u201d legislation that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks with exceptions in cases of rape, incest or pregnancies that endanger the life of the person giving birth, he\u2019s said.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a big move for a governor to do,\u201d Belchak said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not solely up to him \u2014 it\u2019s also the legislature. So I know we\u2019re also looking forward to picking up seats in the Senate.\u201d\nYoungkin wasn\u2019t the only member of his administration to attend the event. D.J. Jordan, the chief of staff for Attorney General Jason Miyares, was in the audience, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears spoke at a rally before the march. She described abortion as \u201cwicked,\u201d seemingly attempting to tie the issue to a renewed focus on racial disparities.\n\u201cIf I put in a bill today and the bill said \u2018Abortion is only allowed in Virginia if you are a Black woman\u2019 \u2014 only Black women could get an abortion, no one else \u2014 you know what we would say to ourselves?\u201d Spears said. \u201cWe\u2019d say, \u2018Wait a minute, why are they trying to kill all the Black babies?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou see?\u201d she continued. \u201cThen it comes home to us that abortion is wicked.
