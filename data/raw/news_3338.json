Mike Bernskoetter of Jefferson City, Justin Brown of Rolla, Mike Cierpiot of Lee\u2019s Summit, Sandy Crawford of Buffalo, Lincoln Hough of Springfield and Bill White of Joplin.\nAt least five challengers to incumbent senators touted their recent endorsement from Missouri Right to Life on social media.\n\u201cThe incumbent will not be endorsed due to his votes to fund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Dave Plemmons, the chairman of the PAC wrote in an endorsement letter sent to Joe Nicola, a candidate running for the 8th District seat currently held by Cierpiot.\nCierpiot was endorsed by the PAC in his 2018 campaign. Two other incumbents who are not being endorsed \u2013 Bernskoetter and White \u2013 were also endorsed by the PAC in 2018.\u00a0\nIt is uncertain if every incumbent being challenged for re-election will see the endorsement go to an opponent.\nBill Yarberry, a Republican candidate running against Crawford for the 28th District, said he received a June 8 letter from Plemmons that read: \u201cWe have recorded you as submitting a good survey in our records. However, the MRL State PAC will not be doing an endorsement in this race.\u201d\nCrawford was endorsed by the PAC in her 2018 campaign, and is the only GOP incumbent senator facing a primary challenger that voted in favor of an amendment to bar funds to Planned Parenthood last year.\nRepresentatives for Missouri Right to Life did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe endorsements signal the rising stakes of the upcoming Senate primaries which have the potential to reshape the make-up of the chamber that has been dogged by bitter GOP infighting between members of the conservative caucus and lawmakers generally aligned with Senate leadership.\nThis past session, lawmakers zeroed out funding for abortion providers and their affiliates through the state budget and barred Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed for services provided through the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Planned Parenthood is suing the Department of Social Services over restricted Medicaid payments as a result of a supplemental budget signed earlier this year that contained the language.\nDespite the language lawmakers added to the state budget, they failed to pass legislation that would also limit funding to abortion providers through statute. Members of the conservative caucus have continued to push for limits to be passed through state law since an essential tax on hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies, known as the federal reimbursement allowance, was renewed last year without the language.\nIn a May legislative update sent to their supporters, Missouri Right to Life lamented that language stripping funding from Planned Parenthood was not passed in statute and laid the blame at Senate leadership\u2019s feet for anti-abortion priorities not crossing the finish line this session.\nThe organization urged Senate candidates to make clear their stance on employing a rare procedural move that cuts off debate, known as the previous question, to further anti-abortion legislation.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bVery important: if you want your pro-life values protected, you will talk to your Senate candidates about their position on calling the previous question to shut down a pro-abortion filibuster on a pro-life bill in the Missouri Senate,\u201d the newsletter read. \u201cCompromise for pro-abortion Senators means gutting a pro-life bill and taking away any pro-life protections.\u201d\nReached Friday, White said he had not yet received word from Missouri Right to Life on whether the organization was endorsing his campaign.\nOn Sunday, White\u2019s opponent in the Republican primary, Jill Carter, wrote on Facebook she was honored to be the only candidate to be endorsed by Missouri Right to Life in the race.\nMissouri Right to Life\u2019s, \u201cretraction of their endorsement is a second witness to what I have seen of our current Senator and his actions,\u201d Carter wrote. \u201cWhile he would have you believe he is a \u2018champion for the unborn,\u2019 his voting record and actions in committees say otherwise.\u201d\nWhite said Friday, \u201cit\u2019s totally their choice,\u201d on who Missouri Right to Life chooses to endorse and noted in the past he both has and hasn\u2019t received their endorsement.\n\u201cThe idea that the majority of Republicans aren\u2019t pro-life is just ridiculous.

This past session, Missouri Right to Life had lobbied for lawmakers to adopt a Congressional map that would grant seven seats to Republicans \u2014 a proposal members of the conservative caucus had also called for.\nJim Lembke, a former state senator and legislative staffer running 100 PAC, a political action committee aligned with the conservative caucus, previously said the 100 PAC will not be involved in primaries with a Republican incumbent.\nOn KRTK-FM radio last week, Lembke said of all the votes taken this past session, failing to \u201cdefund\u201d Planned Parenthood was the most disappointing.\n\u201cWith a Republican supermajority we did not defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Lembke said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the issues that brought us into power. That, and the Second Amendment.
