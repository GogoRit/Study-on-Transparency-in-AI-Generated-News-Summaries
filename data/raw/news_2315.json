In The Glorias, Huerta is portrayed by actress Monica Sanchez (TV\u2019s House of Cards).\nHuerta and Steinem met in the 1960s. Although at the time, Huerta was focused on her work with the UFW and its national boycott on table grapes, Steinem was able to get her attention when she got A&P supermarkets to support UFW and its boycott.\nStanding in front of an A&P supermarket is where viewers are first introduced to Huerta in The Glorias. Her first scene comes around the 73-minute mark of the film. In it, we see Huerta, Steinem (Alicia Vikander) and African American feminist and child-welfare advocate Dorothy Pitman Hughes (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) addressing a group of people in front of the store.\n\u201cThe social and economic revolution of the farmworkers is well underway,\u201d Sanchez\u2019s Huerta says. \u201cAnd it will not be stopped until we receive equality\u2026 S\u00ed se puede!\u201d\n\nIn her final scene, which comes around the 107-minute mark, Huerta meets with Steinem (this time played by Julianne Moore) at a women\u2019s conference where she reveals to her that she is struggling with her pro-life stance on abortion that is guided by her Catholic faith.\n\u201cYou know along with C\u00e9sar [Ch\u00e1vez], I\u2019ve been anti-abortion my entire life,\u201d Sanchez\u2019s Huerta says. \u201cI\u2019m here with my fellow farmworkers to demonstrate in support of the right-to-lifers, but I look at the faces in that angry crowd and\u2026 I had to get out.\u201d Today, Huerta is a leading voice in the women\u2019s right to choose movement.\nHuerta\u2019s life and work were put under an incredible spotlight in 2017 with the award-winning documentary Dolores. But at 90 years old, isn\u2019t it about time she got her own narrative film?\nThe Glorias is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivism\namazon prime\ndolores huerta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\nSign up for our newsletter and receive the coolest updates!\n\nEmail\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nCareers\nAdvertising\nContact\nAgency\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\n\n\n              Most Popular\n          \n\n\nPHOTOS: Arca's Triumphant Homecoming at Bello Monte Acoustic Shell in Venezuela\n\n\nBy Joel Moya\n03.18.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
