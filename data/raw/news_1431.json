In every single state.\u201d\n***WATCH SENATOR MURRAY\u2019S FLOOR SPEECH HERE***\n(Washington, DC)\u00a0\u2013 Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, took to the Senate floor to fight back against the Republican national abortion ban introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)\u00a0yesterday. In the speech, Senator Murray promised to fight this bill every step of the way and to stand up for everyone\u2019s right to control their own bodies and make their own medical decisions.\n\u201cThis bill shows the true Republican position: they want to ban abortion\u2014for everyone. In every single state. And they want to punish doctors. They want to put them in prison for doing their jobs,\u201d\u00a0said Senator Murray.\u00a0\u201cSo to anyone who lives in a blue state, like mine\u2014anyone who thinks they are safe from these attacks here is the painful reality: Republicans are coming for your rights.\u201d\n\u201cSo here\u2019s my message to Republicans: If you want to go after my constituents\u2019 rights, if you want to go after women\u2019s bodies and futures, if you want to pass a national abortion ban, like this extreme bill, you are going to have to go through me,\u201d\u00a0continued Senator Murray.\u00a0\u201cBecause Democrats are going to keep standing up for women and men across the country who do not want their rights taken away.\u201d\nSenator Murray has been fighting to defend the right to abortion\u00a0since she first got into politics, and she continues to fight every day for the needs of\u00a0patients across the country.\u00a0Just yesterday, she\u00a0led 29 of her colleagues\u00a0in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action to safeguard women\u2019s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Senator Murray immediately put out a statement\u00a0following the introduction of\u00a0Republicans\u2019 national abortion ban yesterday and joined her\u00a0colleagues to\u00a0speak out\u00a0following Senator\u00a0Graham\u2019s press conference.\nEvery week since\u00a0Roe\u00a0was overturned, Senator Murray has fought to pass key protections to safeguard Americans\u2019 reproductive rights\u2014pushing to advance commonsense legislation to protect the right to contraception, protect every American\u2019s right to travel, protect doctors\u2019 right to provide\u00a0legal\u00a0abortion care, and expand our national family planning program. But at every turn,\u00a0Senate Republicans stood in the way, blocking every single bill.\nSenator Murray\u2019s floor speech, as prepared for delivery, is below:\n\u201cThank you, M. President.\u00a0\n\u201cYesterday, my Republican colleagues introduced a national abortion ban and made clear they are coming after the rights of my constituents and they are coming after the rights of people across the country.\n\u201cThis atrocious bill threatens the people of Kansas\u2014who just voted overwhelmingly to protect abortion rights, the hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan who just signed a petition for a referendum vote to protect abortion and states like mine which already have strong abortion protections on the books.\u00a0\n\u201cUp to now, Republicans have tried to play down their abortion extremism.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to run away from the consequences of their extreme agenda\u2014 Even as patients have been denied prescriptions they need. Even as doctors have been forced to wait until patients\u2019 lives are in danger before they can take action. Even as the health care crises they have caused spill across state lines to disastrous effect. But despite their empty rhetoric about \u2018leaving it to the states\u2019 the truth has been painfully clear\u2014they think they know better than women when it comes to reproductive health care decisions.\n\u201cThey have shown again and again they don\u2019t trust women to have full control over their own bodies, and they are willing to go after doctors.\u00a0\n\u201cThey have blocked the most basic bills like Senator Cortez Masto\u2019s bill making sure people can still travel to other states for legally available care and my bill making sure doctors in states where abortion is legal can\u2019t be punished for doing their jobs. Over and over they have stood in the way of Democrats\u2019 efforts to protect women\u2019s abortion rights and it is crystal clear why.\u00a0\n\u201cThis bill shows the true Republican position:\u00a0\n\u201cThey want to ban abortion\u2014for everyone. In every single state.\n\u201cAnd they want to punish doctors. They want to put them in prison for doing their jobs.\u00a0\n\u201cSo to anyone who lives in a blue state, like mine\u2014anyone who thinks they are safe from these attacks here is the painful reality: Republicans are coming for your rights.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to take my word for it: the Senator from South Carolina said yesterday, and I quote, \u201cIf we take back the House and the Senate\u2014I can assure you we will have a vote on our bill.\u201d\n\u201cThere it is. Couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the MAGA agenda. For all fifty states rights stripped away and doctors in prison.\u00a0\n\u201cRegardless of your circumstances regardless of what\u2019s best for your health regardless of your family plans\u2014of your hopes, fears, or dreams for your future. Republicans want to control your most decisions.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t trust you to have full control over your own body.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just horrifying.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd M. President\u2014when he unveiled this bill yesterday, the Senator from South Carolina also said, and I quote: \u201cI\u2019ll make a prediction: we stay on this and we keep talking about it, maybe less than a decade from now, this will be law.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the future they want\u2014a national abortion ban.\n\u201cWell let me tell you something\u2014the Senator from South Carolina may not have been paying attention\u2014but Democrats are already talking about this issue every week, every day, every opportunity. And women across the country have been with us: fighting for the right to abortion and fighting back against Republicans\u2019 harmful attacks.\u00a0\n\u201cWe saw it in Kansas, we are seeing it in Michigan, and I am seeing it everywhere I go in Washington state.\n\u201cI have been talking to doctors, patients, and women and men across the country.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd they are outraged\u2014outraged\u2014that Republicans want to take away their rights, that Republicans want to put their doctors in prison.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I am too. I\u2019ve never been madder.\u00a0\n\u201cSo here\u2019s my message to Republicans:\n\u201cIf you want to go after my constituents\u2019 rights, if you want to go after women\u2019s bodies and futures, if you want to pass a national abortion ban, like this extreme bill, you are going to have to go through me.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause Democrats are going to keep standing up for women and men across the country who do not want their rights taken away.\u201d\u00a0\n###\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPrevious Article \n\nNext ArticleNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates from Patty \n\n\n\n Sign up to receive Senator Murray\u2019s newsletter and get updates on the workshe\u2019s doing on behalf of Washington state.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Name\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast Name\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nMedium\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Patty \n\n\n\n\nBiography\nCommittee Assignments\nLegislation\nIssues\n \n\nBiography\nCommittee Assignments\nLegislation\nIssues\n \n\n\n\n\nContact \n\n\n\n\nMeet With Patty\nWrite To Patty\nOffice Locations\nShare your story\n \n\nMeet With Patty\nWrite To Patty\nOffice Locations\nShare your story\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices \n\n\n\n\nGet Help With A Federal Agency\nGrant\nInternships\nMilitary Service Academy Nominations\nOrder An American Flag\nSenate Page Program\nWashington D.C.
