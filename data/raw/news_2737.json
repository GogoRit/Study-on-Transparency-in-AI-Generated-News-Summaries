One thing she definitely pretends to do, though, is \u201cempower\u201d\u00a0women. \u201cIn the coming year, we can work to empower millions of women to lift their families out of poverty, to grow the economies in their country, to reduce dependence and to deliver on the promise of greater peace and prosperity,\u201d she said last February. Obviously, the first daughter allegedly being all about the ladies would be a lot more believable if she wasn\u2019t part of an administration that has weakened Title IX, waged a war on birth control, and tried to scrap an Obama-era rule requiring companies to report pay data by gender. Similarly, it would also be easier to believe that Ivanka was passionate about women\u2019s empowerment, particularly of the economic variety, if she didn\u2019t apparently believe that women should be forced to have babies regardless of the circumstances.In an interview with RealClearPolitics published Thursday, on the eve of an election in which evangelicals are expected to back her dad just like they did in 2016, Ivanka said that when it comes to abortion, while she \u201crespect[s] all sides of a very personal and sensitive discussion\u2026I am also a mother of three children, and parenthood affected me in a profound way in terms of how I think about these things.\u201d She added: \u201cI am pro-life, and unapologetically so.\u201d (A White House aide said \u201ca huge driving part of\u201d the first daughter\u2019s pro-life stance is \u201cwhere the Democratic Party has gone,\u201d without explaining what that meant.)While this is reportedly the first time Ivanka has publicly and unequivocally stated that she opposes abortion, it\u2019s not the first time there have been hints that she didn\u2019t believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose what to do with her own body. In 2017, she and her husband, Jared Kushner, quietly reached out to then Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and told her that if the organization wanted to continue to keep its federal funding, it would have to stop providing abortions, offering an increase if it would agree to do so, according to Richards\u2019s memoir. (Obviously, she did not take the deal.) Earlier this week, Ivanka tweeted a photo of Judge Amy Coney Barrett at a White House gathering celebrating her confirmation to the Supreme Court.Barrett, of course, is expected to help overturn Roe v. Wade the first chance she gets, having previously signed a letter calling the ruling \u201cbarbaric.\u201d She also declined to answer a question from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse re: if abortion could be made a capital crime, punishable by death.Anyway, woo-hoo women\u2019s empowerment! Up top, girlfriends!Trump gives the go-ahead to destroy America\u2019s biggest national forestThe president is never too busy to stop and give the planet an orange middle finger. Per the Washington Post:President Trump will open up more than half of Alaska\u2019s\u00a0Tongass National Forest\u00a0to logging and other forms of development, according to\u00a0a notice\u00a0posted Wednesday, stripping protections that had safeguarded one of the world\u2019s largest intact temperate rainforests for nearly two decades. As of Thursday, it will be legal for logging companies to build roads and cut and remove timber throughout more than 9.3 million acres of forest\u2014featuring old-growth stands of red and yellow cedar, Sitka spruce, and Western hemlock. The relatively pristine expanse is also home to plentiful salmon runs and imposing fjords. The decision, which will be published in the Federal Register, reverses protections President Bill Clinton put in place in 2001 and is one of the most sweeping public lands rollbacks Trump has enacted.For years, federal and academic scientists have identified Tongass as an ecological oasis that serves as a massive carbon sink while providing key habitat for wild Pacific salmon and trout, Sitka black-tailed deer and myriad other species. It boasts the highest density of brown bears in North America, and its trees\u2014some of which are between 300 and 1,000 years old\u2014absorb at least 8% of all the carbon stored in the entire Lower 48\u2032s forests combined.\u201cWhile tropical rainforests are the lungs of the planet, the Tongass is the lungs of North America,\u201d Dominick DellaSala, chief scientist with the Earth Island Institute\u2019s Wild Heritage project, told the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s America\u2019s last climate sanctuary.\u201d Unfortunately for North America, the president wants to put those lungs through a wood chipper.Billionaire money manager is sorry for doing business with a sex offender, would like to point out others did tooApparently Leon Black\u2019s parents never taught him that just because one\u2019s friends are professionally associating with a known pedophile, it doesn\u2019t mean he should too:Apollo Global Management Inc. co-founder Leon Black said he regretted doing business with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, even though other prominent people had done the same. \u201cLike many people I respected, I decided to give Epstein a second chance,\u201d Black said Thursday during a conference call to discuss Apollo\u2019s third-quarter results. \u201cThis was a terrible mistake.\u201dApollo has faced mounting pressure over Black\u2019s relationship with Epstein, who was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl and killed himself in a Manhattan jail last year.Black, 69, said he paid Epstein millions of dollars annually for his work from 2012 through 2017 and that there\u2019s \u201csubstantial documentary support\u201d for the services provided, including advice on estate planning, taxes, philanthropy and the structuring of art entities. Epstein, whom he first met in 1996, worked with many prominent people after he was released from jail and that \u201cthe distinguished reputations of these individuals gave me misplaced comfort,\u201d Black said\u2026. Last week, major consultants expressed reservations about giving new money to the asset manager and two public pensions said they were halting investments. That followed an Oct. 12 New York Times report that Black had wired at least $50 million to Epstein since the 2008 conviction. The article didn\u2019t accuse Black of breaking the law.Most PopularPhotos From Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee the Glam in Motion on the Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2024 Glam CamBy Kase WickmanBarry Keoghan, Charles Melton, and Hunter Schafer Kick Off Oscar Week in Style at Vanity Fair and Instagram\u2019s Vanities PartyBy Kara WarnerThe Times story revealed that in addition to associating with the convicted criminal in a professional capacity, Epstein \u201cfrequently hosted\u201d Black for breakfast or lunch at his New York mansion and in 2012, \u201cwhile on a family vacation in the Caribbean, Mr. Black traveled by yacht to attend a cookout at Mr. Epstein\u2019s private island residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201dIt would appear that someone is concerned about what high-speed winds might do to his comb-overX contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Elsewhere!Gen Z, Millennial voters embrace activism and voting, as youth turnout surges ahead of Election Day (Washington Post)What happens to Fox News if Trump loses?
