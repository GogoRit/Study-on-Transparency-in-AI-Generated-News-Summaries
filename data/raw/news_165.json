Wade abortion rights decision, prompting a wave of protests from Democrats and reproductive rights groups.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe 207 lawmakers signaled their position in an amicus brief supporting a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that is expected to be reviewed by the Supreme Court on March 4.The 2014 law, which was stayed by the Supreme Court in February, would require doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.Practitioners have said the law would force most of the state\u2019s abortion clinics to close, and critics of the measure argue that it unduly burdens a \u201clarge fraction\u201d of women seeking access to abortion.In 2018, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the Louisiana law in a 2-to-1 vote.AdvertisementIn their amicus brief, the lawmakers said they \u201crespectfully suggest that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s struggle to define the appropriate \u2018large fraction\u2019 or determine what \u2018burden\u2019 on abortion access is \u2018undue\u2019 illustrates the unworkability of the \u2018right to abortion\u2019 found in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and the need for the Court to again take up the issue of whether Roe and [Planned Parenthood v.] Casey should be reconsidered and, if appropriate, overruled.\u201dHow often does the Supreme Court overturn precedents like Roe v. Wade?The group of 207 lawmakers is made up of 168 House members and 39 senators. Only two of the signatories \u2014 Reps. Collin C. Peterson (Minn.) and Daniel Lipinski (Ill.) \u2014 are Democrats.Last month, 197 members of Congress also wrote the Supreme Court in support of the Roe v Wade decision. \u201cAs a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution, and one that strikes at the heart of ordered liberty and individual autonomy, a woman\u2019s right to decide to seek an abortion should be insulated from the rhetoric and interests of groups whose sole purpose is to undermine Roe and eliminate the fundamental rights enunciated in that case,\u201d that group of members wrote in their amicus brief.AdvertisementMore than a dozen antiabortion rights groups hailed the amicus brief filed Thursday and the efforts of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and others who spearheaded the move.\u201cClearly, the 207 Members of Congress who joined this brief care deeply about the health and safety of the American people and the ability of legislators to enact commonsense law that protects women and children from the abuses perpetrated by the abortion industry,\u201d Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said in a statement.Abortion rights groups responded to the news with alarm, arguing that the brief shows that the battle over reproductive rights has entered a new and urgent phase.\u201cUnfortunately, this amicus brief proves that not only is the threat to those rights very real, but it is at a critical tipping point where the minority is ready to strip our freedom away against the majority\u2019s wishes,\u201d Emily\u2019s List President Stephanie Schriock said in a statement. The group works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights.AdvertisementSamuel Lau, director of federal advocacy media for Planned Parenthood Votes, noted that public opinion polling shows a majority of Americans support abortion rights. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in July, for instance, found that 60\u00a0percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, the highest level in more than two decades.Thursday\u2019s amicus brief, Lau argued, \u201cgoes against the will of the people.\u201d\u201cThese antiabortion politicians are making it very clear \u2014 they want the Supreme Court to effectively ban abortion, precedent be damned,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the members of Congress who signed on to this amicus brief: Brace yourselves for the consequences you will face at the ballot box in November.\u201dRobert Barnes contributed to this report.Share CommentsSign uplive updatespoliticsChevronRight4:11 PMBiden campaign attacks Trump on housing record3:52 PMIllinois\u2019s 7th Congressional District: Longtime incumbent faces fight of his life3:10 PMIllinois\u2019s 12th Congressional District: Incumbent faces incumbent-supported challengerTOP STORIESPoliticsReporting and analysis from the Hill and the White HouseTrump may enlist Paul Manafort, who was criticized for Russia ties Biden and other Democrats forced to adapt to pro-Palestinian protests Analysis|\u2018Bloodbath\u2019 aside, Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric is unambiguousbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
