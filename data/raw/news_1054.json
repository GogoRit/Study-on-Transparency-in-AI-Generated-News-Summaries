people in Ohio and places extreme burdens and risks on providers of essential reproductive health care, without any valid medical justification,\u201d the brief to the court stated.\nMedical research supports their arguments to the court, the groups wrote to the court, and \u201cthe overwhelming weight of medical evidence\u201d proves abortion is a \u201cvery safe medical procedure.\u201d\nCiting medical journals, state data and other data sources, the physicians groups said complication rates from abortion average about 2%, with most complications considered \u201cminor and easily

patients die from an abortion-related complication,\u201d the brief stated, citing reports from the CDC.\nThe harm to patient health comes more in banning abortions, according to ACOG, the AMA and the SMFM, by creating consequences for pregnant patients and forcing clinicians to delay needed medical care.\n\u201cEach of these outcomes increases the likelihood of negative consequences for the patient\u2019s physical and psychological health that could be avoided if abortion were available,\u201d the groups argue.\nExceptions included in the bill are also \u201cinsufficient\u201d to protect patient health, the medical professionals concluded.\n\u201cThe legislature\u2019s attempt to identify a list of serious risks is necessarily incomplete, ill-advised and medically unsound,\u201d according to the brief.\nAgents from the state of Ohio named in the lawsuit, such as Attorney General Dave Yost, have asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit and allow the abortion law to
