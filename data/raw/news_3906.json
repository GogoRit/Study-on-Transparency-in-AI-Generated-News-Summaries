UNFPA is targeting persons with disabilities because they are a group of people who are so far left behind in the world. We have been living for so long without addressing issues about them,\u201d he said.Omar Camara, a participant described the training as \u2018crucial\u2019, pointing out that many girls and young women with disabilities lack the basic knowledge and requirement to protect them from sexual abuses.He maintained that it is high time for persons with disabilities to take a firm stand and prove to the people that disability is not inability.\u00a0\u201cAdolescent with disabilities faces numerous reproductive health problems, due to lack of information and our education sector does not recognize sexual and reproductive need and rights of an adolescent with people with disabilities,\u201d he said.Mariama Jobarteh, chief executive officer of Fankanta, said her organisation advocates for people\u2019s sexual health rights, saying persons with disabilities are no exception.\u201cWe target everybody in the country but we have a particular focus on young people. This is because young people are at a higher risk of sexual reproductive health negative outcome.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share Article \n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\nShare by E-Mail\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Previous:\n                            \n TVET UNESCO-KOICA project consultant visits MoBSE\n\n\n\n                                Next:  \n\nGambia hosts sub-regional cultural meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Other Articles In National News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational News\n\n\nNCCE concludes regional dialogue\n\nJul 8, 2022, 11:50 AM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational News\n\n\nSoil Solution first-ever Week of Soil underway\n\nNov 27, 2023, 11:49 AM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational News\n\n\nCelebrating The Francophonie means recognising the potential of peace says Minister Gomez\n\nApr 4, 2023, 12:00 PM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational News\n\n\nPress Statement Gambia Center for Victims of Human Rights Violations.
