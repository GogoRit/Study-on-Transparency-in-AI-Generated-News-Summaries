Almost all Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives stand with their party in support of abortion rights, while almost all Republicans reflect their party\u2019s position against abortion rights.\nYet the partisan divide among Americans themselves is less stark, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey. As is true on many other political issues, sizable minorities of Republicans and Democrats say they do not agree with the dominant position on abortion of the party they identify with or lean toward. And within each partisan coalition, some groups are less likely than others to agree with their party on abortion.\n\nOverall, roughly one-third of Americans who identify as Republican or as Republican-leaning independents do not agree with their party on abortion (35%), including 12% who say they agree with the Democratic Party on abortion and 23% who say they do not agree with either party. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, three-in-ten do not agree with their party on abortion, including 7% who say they agree with the GOP and 22% who say they don\u2019t agree with either party. (The same 2019 survey found that roughly a fifth to a third of Americans don\u2019t agree with their party on issues including policies to deal with the economy, health care and illegal immigration.)\n\nHow we did this\n\nTo better understand how Americans\u2019 views on abortion align with partisan identification, we analyzed\u00a0data from a previously published survey of 4,175 U.S. adults that was conducted July 22 to Aug. 4, 2019. All respondents to the survey are part of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. For more, see\u00a0the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are\u00a0the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its\u00a0methodology.\n\n\nYounger Republicans are less likely to stand with their party on abortion, with 56% of Republicans under 50 saying they agree with the GOP, compared with 71% of those ages 50 and older. Republicans who are religiously unaffiliated also are less likely than other Republicans to agree with their party on abortion. And four-in-ten Republicans who identify as liberal or moderate (41%) say they agree with the GOP on abortion, about half the share of those who identify as conservative (81%).\n\nAmong Democrats, 56% of those with a high school diploma or less education agree with their party on abortion, compared with 84% of college graduates who say this. In addition, roughly six-in-ten black (58%) and Hispanic (59%) Democrats support the party on abortion, compared with eight-in-ten white Democrats. And Democrats who identify as conservative or moderate also are much less likely to agree with their party than those who identify as liberal (57% vs. 85%). Those who live in the South (64%) or are affiliated with a religion also are less likely than other Democrats to agree with their party.\nSupport for abortion rights has increased among Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party over the past decade. And during this year\u2019s party primaries, some presidential candidates struck different notes on whether abortion opponents have a place in the party. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said \u201cbeing pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat,\u201d while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said \u201cpro-life Democrats \u2026 are part of our party, and I think we need to build a big tent.\u201d\nJoe Biden, the Democratic Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, has changed his views on abortion during his political career. While he has long supported Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling for a constitutional right to abortion in at least the first trimester, Biden also has often backed curbs on abortion. In 2006 he characterized himself as being \u201ca little bit of an odd man out in my party\u201d on the issue.\nPresident Donald Trump also has expressed different views on abortion over time. In 1999, vying for the Reform Party\u2019s presidential candidacy, he characterized himself as \u201cpro-choice in every respect.\u201d This year, he became the first sitting president to attend the March for Life and told participants: \u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\u201d\nIntraparty differences over whether abortion should be legal\nAnother way to examine intraparty differences on abortion \u2013 especially since the official stances of both parties have evolved over time \u2013 is to see how people feel about whether it should be legal.\nMost Republicans and their leaners say abortion should be illegal (62%) in all or most cases, with a larger share saying it should be illegal in most cases (45%) than in all cases (17%). Republicans who live in the Northeast and those who identify as moderate or liberal are less likely than other Republicans to say abortion should be illegal in all cases.\nDemocrats, for their part, are more unified in support of legal abortion than Republicans are against it, with 82% of Democrats saying abortion should be legal all or most of the time. But Democrats are roughly split on whether it should be legal in all cases (40%) or most cases (42%). Democrats who live in the South, those who are ages 65 and older, and those who identify as conservative or moderate are less likely than other Democrats to say abortion should be legal in all cases.\n\nWhether people hold an absolutist stance on abortion is tied to how strongly they support their party on the issue. For example, Republicans and GOP leaners who say abortion should be illegal in all cases are more likely to say they agree strongly with the GOP on abortion than to say they agree somewhat (73% vs. 9%). And Democrats and their leaners who say abortion should be legal in all cases also are more likely to say they agree strongly with their party than to say they agree only somewhat (70% vs. 11%).\nNote: Here are\u00a0the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its\u00a0methodology.\n\nShare this link:       \n\n \n\n\nJeff Diamant\u00a0 is a senior writer/editor focusing on religion at Pew Research Center. \n\nPOSTS BIO EMAIL\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletterFresh data delivered Saturday mornings\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nshort read | Sep 13, 2023Key facts about Americans and guns\n\n\nshort read | Jul 21, 2023Favorable views of Supreme Court fall to historic low\n\n\nshort read | Jun 20, 2023Support for legal abortion is widespread in many countries, especially in Europe\n\n\nshort read | May 5, 2023Narrow majorities in U.S. House have become more common but haven\u2019t always led to gridlock\n\n\nshort read | Mar 30, 2022Zelenskyy inspires widespread confidence from U.S. public as views of Putin hit new low\n\n\n\n\nMOST POPULAR\n18 in 10 Americans Say Religion Is Losing Influence in Public Life\n2More Americans are getting news on TikTok, bucking the trend seen on most other social media sites\n3What we know about unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S.\n4How Teens and Parents Approach Screen Time\n510 facts about the death penalty in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800Washington, DC 20036USA\n (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main\n (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax\n (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Topics\n\n\n\nPolitics & PolicyInternational AffairsImmigration & MigrationRace & EthnicityReligionAge & GenerationsGender & LGBTQFamily & RelationshipsEconomy & WorkScienceInternet & TechnologyNews Habits & MediaMethodological ResearchFull topic list \n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n Email Newsletters\n Instagram\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n YouTube\n RSS\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.
