In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recession and global racial justice movements, the case for such an approach is more imperative than ever.\nAs part of its collaborative process to arrive at a vision of feminist foreign policy for the United States, the International Center for Research on Women undertook consultations with hundreds of feminists from more than 40 countries around the world. Time and again, we heard that a feminist foreign policy must defend the rights that are most politicized in international policy dialogues, chief among them, sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).\n\nKey Findings\nOur definition of feminist foreign policy affirms the right to bodily autonomy for all genders and ages in line with international human rights standards. Bodily autonomy and the enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential preconditions to the meaningful participation of girls, women and gender-nonconforming people to the basic social, economic and political processes that define our societies. These include access to education, economic opportunities, and participation in peace processes.\nThe McKinsey Global Institute estimates that gender equality could add $28 trillion to the global gross domestic product\u2014but according to their report, multiple SRHR issues must first be addressed. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that COVID-19 will result in over 47 million women not being able to use modern contraceptives and predicts up to seven million new unplanned pregnancies around the globe.\nExisting Feminist Foreign Policies and Sexual and Reproductive Heath and Rights\n\nKey Recommendations\n\nThe President should announce that the U.S. will adopt a feminist foreign policy, to be co-created and implemented in consultation with feminists inside and outside of government.\nHarmful policies should be removed and reversed by the Administration and Congress.\nComprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights programs should be fully funded.\nIndividuals should be nominated and appointed for executive branch positions who are experts in their field and possess a positive record on reproductive health, rights, and justice.\nDomestic and global COVID-19 response and recovery must ensure funding to address impacts on SRHR.\nThe Biden Administration should re-engage in multilateral leadership on sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\n \n \n\nDownload Publication\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\nview all\n\n\n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\n02/15/2023\nToward a Feminist Foreign policy in the United States: A Midterm Review of the Biden-Harris Administration\n \n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPost\n08/06/2019\nDevelopment needs an intersectional lens\nBy Camille Ampey It seems like everyone wants to be an intersectional feminist these days.
