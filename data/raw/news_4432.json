Since U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death on September 18, and President Trump\u2019s nominee of conservative [\u2026]\nSusan Dunlap  \nWhen the New Mexico Legislature passed the 1969 law on abortion, it was the least restrictive version of the state\u2019s previous abortion laws, but one advocates say would be too restrictive if it goes back into effect.\nSince U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death on September 18, and President Trump\u2019s nominee of conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett, there is a heightened concern that Roe v. Wade could be overturned in the immediate future. If that happens before the state\u2019s 1969 abortion law is repealed, the state could turn back the clock to the 51-year-old law.\nAn attempt to repeal the 1969 law failed in the state Senate in 2019.\nRelated: Senate rejects repealing currently unenforceable anti-abortion law\nIf it were to become the state\u2019s law, enforcement would be a matter for each individual district attorney\u2019s office, said Matt Baca, chief counsel for the state\u2019s Attorney General Hector Balderas.\n\u201cOur office encourages them to focus their resources on prosecuting violent criminals who abuse children, and we support the repeal of this law to promote a person\u2019s ability to make their own choices about their health,\u201d Baca wrote in an emailed message to NM Political Report.\nBut that could mean a patchwork of enforcement across the state.\nThe New Mexico lawmakers wrote the 1969 law with the expectation that an abortion would be performed in a hospital \u2013 and it is written into the law that a woman who seeks an abortion would have to go before a special hospital committee to receive consent.\n\u201cThis old law does not reflect the way medicine is practiced anymore,\u201d Ellie Rushforth, reproductive rights attorney with American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, said.\nCurrently, most abortions are performed at a clinic but that, too, would change under the 1969 law.\nUnder the law, a woman would have to request the hearing if her health were in grave danger; if the fetus would likely suffer severe physical or mental defect or if the woman was the victim of incest or rape.\nBut if the woman was the victim of rape, she would have to provide an affidavit to that affect.\nWomen underreport rape due to shame, retraumatization and other reasons, such as the difficulties of getting to a conviction. Until recently, Albuquerque Police Department had a backlog of around 4,000 untested rape kits. One victim waited nearly 15 years for her rape kit to be tested by the Albuquerque Police Department, according to KRQE-TV.\nFurther, under the old law a hospital is not required to form a special hospital committee to allow a woman to make her case, nor is a hospital required to provide an abortion, even if the hospital committee gave its consent.\n\u201cForcing a woman to plead her case to get the health care she needs reflects the lack of trust and respect for her decision-making ability,\u201d Rushforth said.\nCriminal charges could be brought against anyone providing an abortion in New Mexico outside of that narrow definition of the law and the person could be charged with a fourth-degree felony.\nEstablishing the potential for charges tends to put a chill on medical professionals\u2019 willingness to perform a procedure, according to reproductive rights experts.\n\u201cThis old ban could come back to haunt us and cause real damage to reproductive health care in New Mexico,\u201d Rushforth said.\nThe ACLU of New Mexico argues that the law is unconstitutional because the state has an equal rights amendment. The amendment states that a person cannot be denied equal protection under the law based on gender.\nThe 1969 law \u201csingles out a type of medical care that people who are not capable of becoming pregnant don\u2019t access,\u201d Rushforth said.\n\u201cThat is clearly unconstitutional,\u201d she said.\nNew Mexico passed its first law banning abortion in 1907. It refers specifically to administering \u201cany medicine, drug or substance whatever,\u201d as the methods for abortion in that era. The original law, written before New Mexico became a state in 1912, declared that a doctor who provided an abortion to a woman would be charged with murder in the second degree.\nRushforth said \u201cthere\u2019s a very long history of the effort to ban and criminalize abortion,\u201d and that it goes back further than New Mexico\u2019s 1907 law.\n\u201cIt was really when it (abortion) was largely in the purview of midwifery and people providing reproductive healthcare to women outside the medical establishment,\u201d Rushforth said.\nThe medical establishment began to identify itself as a business in the late 1800s and early 1900s, she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when you really start to see the effort to criminalize abortion care. There\u2019s a very long history of politicizing that kind of care,\u201d Rushforth said.\nWith World War I recently over, the state passed a new abortion law in 1919 which mentioned the potential for a surgical abortion as well as \u201cany medicine, drug, or substance whatever,\u201d as possible methods for abortion. It was also incrementally less restrictive than the 1907 law because it allowed that if two physicians agreed that if an abortion was necessary for the health of the woman, then such an exception could be made.\nWhen the state legislature passed the 1919 law, Native Americans were still not considered citizens. The U.S. Congress passed the 19th amendment, giving women the right to vote in 1919. Congress ratified the 19th amendment in 1920. That meant that the first presidential election women were allowed to participate in was President Warren G. Harding\u2019s bid against Democrat James Cox in 1920. Indigenous people gained citizenship in 1924, though they were unable to vote in New Mexico until 1948.\nRelated: Warning: U.S. might be subjected to \u2018petticoat rule\u2019 \u2013 a celebration of women\u2019s right to vote\nThe punishment for administering an abortion continued to be murder in the second degree and a felony count. But the 1919 law added fines \u2013 $500 to $2,000 \u2013 and possible prison time from 1 to 5 years for violations.\nThe next New Mexico abortion law passed in 1964. That was the same year as the Civil Rights Act, which eliminated laws restricting African Americans from the right to vote.\nThe 1964 law continued to say that \u201cany medicine, drug, or substance whatever,\u201d as well as surgical abortions were banned. But it also added that \u201cany method or means whereby an untimely interruption of her pregnancy is produced,\u201d was also illegal.\nAfter the late 1950s, vacuum aspiration for uterine evacuation became an increasingly common method of abortion, according to a paper produced by the National Abortion Federation.\nThe 1964 law iterated that a woman could receive an abortion if two physicians deemed it necessary for the health and life of the woman.\nA year later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that married couples had a right to privacy regarding childbearing decisions and that state laws that banned the sale of contraception were unconstitutional.\nJust after the 1969 New Mexico abortion law passed, the U.S. Congress removed the ban on the dissemination of information about contraception from the nation\u2019s Comstock laws in 1971. Congress passed the Comstock Law of 1873 to prevent \u201cobscene\u201d literature from being distributed.\nWhen the state legislature revisited abortion in 1969, it was the least restrictive iteration of the state\u2019s abortion bans as it recognized rape and incest as reasons why a woman should be allowed to plead her case before a special hospital committee to have an abortion.\n\u201cMedical care has advanced tremendously in the last 50 years in all areas, including abortion care,\u201d Rushforth said. \u201cWhat was maybe seen as an advancement 50 years ago is now being mirrored by anti-abortion extremists attempting to ban abortion.\u201d\n We're ad freeThat means that we rely on support from readers like you.
