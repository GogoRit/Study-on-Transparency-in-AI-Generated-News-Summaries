Over the past eight months she had followed all the advice of her midwife and was booked to deliver in a Harare clinic.\u00a0 But when she arrived, already in labor, the clinic doors were locked. Passersby explained that the nurses were on strike. As her contractions came more quickly, Chipo and her husband took public transport to a hospital where she finally delivered. \nSimilar chaos confronted women across the city. Naked women lay on the bare floor in one makeshift delivery room. Women moved from one health care center to another looking for someplace to deliver. Some women went to private hospitals where they had to pay very high prices for delivery. \n\nAlthough governments may sign lofty declarations, they too often fail to put in place the practical strategies needed to follow through.\n\n\n\nAs that crisis grew late last year, I was attending a global summit called ICPD+25 in Nairobi. The summit\u2019s goal was to galvanize support for universal access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health information, education and services\u2014and to complete the unfinished business of the first International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held 25 years earlier.\u00a0 I was there on behalf of the Women\u2019s Action Group, an organization fighting for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women in Zimbabwe.\u00a0 But as I listened to government leaders solemnly pledge their support to the ICPD Program of Action, text messages from home alerted me to the situation on the ground and highlighted one simple fact: words alone don\u2019t save lives.\u00a0 \nAlthough governments may sign lofty declarations, they too often fail to put in place the practical strategies needed to follow through. This is unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n    A protesting nurse stands in front of police officers standing guard during a protest by doctors in Harare, Zimbabwe on September 16, 2019. \n    REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko \n\n\nTo be sure, there has been significant progress in the past 25 years, and the summit catalogued the gains. For example, global maternal mortality rates have fallen by 38 percent and the number of skilled birth attendants increased by 80 percent.\u00a0 But, as also noted by experts attending the summit, this progress has been tragically uneven. \nConsider the goal of zero preventable maternal deaths.. According to a UNICEF report, from 2000\u20132017, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia accounted for 86 per cent of maternal deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africans suffer from the highest maternal mortality ratio, 533 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births\u2014or 200,000 maternal deaths a year\u2014more than double the global average. \n\n120 times\nGreater risk of a woman in a low-income country dying from a maternal-related cause than women in high-income countries\n\nMore needs to be done in Africa. The maternal mortality ratio is unacceptable, especially considering that almost all maternal deaths are preventable by having skilled, supervised health personnel\u2014doctors, nurses, or midwives\u2014attend births and by having the proper equipment and supplies available. The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel varies greatly by global region.\u00a0 From 2012\u20132017, only 59 per cent of the births in sub-Saharan Africa were attended by skilled health personnel. In other world regions, coverage ranged from 68\u201399 percent. In Zimbabwe, the government\u2019s persistent failure to prioritize the training, pay and retention of skilled health personnel is largely to blame for the nurses\u2019 two-month strike that left pregnant women to deliver at the hands of untrained traditional birth attendants.\nMaternal mortality rates are also sensitive indicators of wealth inequality. The risk of a woman in a low-income country dying from a maternal-related cause is about 120 times greater than a woman living in a high-income country. And, most of the world\u2019s lowest-income countries are in Africa, including Niger, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Sierra Leone.\n\n\n\n\n\n    A mother and child arrive for treatment at a local government hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe on February 4, 2020. \n    REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\n\nThe majority of the world\u2019s countries, including my country Zimbabwe, left the ICPD+25 having committed to mobilize the required financing to finish the ICPD Program of Action. They committed to national budget allocations; gender budgeting and auditing; and exploring new, participatory and innovative financing instruments to ensure full, effective and accelerated implementation of the ICPD program.\u00a0\u00a0 \nLooking ahead to March 2020, governments will again gather, this time for the Commission on the Status of Women in New York. There, they will review the Beijing Platform for Action that was put in place 25 years ago to promote gender equity in health and 12 other crucial areas. \n\nAfrican countries must look closely at what it will take to save the lives of women and girls. \n\n\n\nWhile such conferences can affirm global intention toward achieving gender equality, governments must realize that making a commitment and not following through is worse than not making a commitment at all\u2014for such inaction fuels cynicism, distrust, and despair.\u00a0 African countries must look closely at what it will take to save the lives of women and girls. Rather than set priorities at the expense of women\u2019s health, they must recognize that women\u2019s health is central to a vibrant society and growing economy. But if history is any indication, governments won\u2019t do it on their own. Civil society organizations must hold their governments accountable. \nAfrica needs trained personnel to attend to pregnant women.\u00a0 It\u2019s that simple. Governments should start by allocating 15 percent of their national budgets to health\u2014as they have also committed to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Women wait in line during a UNICEF supported mobile health clinic in the village of Rubkuai in Unity State, South Sudan on February 16, 2017. \n    REUTERS/Siegfried Modola\n\n\n\nEdinah Masiyiwa\u00a0is a nurse, midwife and is the Executive Director of a women\u2019s rights organisation in Zimbabwe called Women\u2019s Action Group.\u00a0\n\n\nPregnancy\nChildbirth\nChildren\nMothers\nMaternal Mortality\nPostpartum Care\nAfrica\nSub-Saharan Africa\nHarare\nZimbabwe\nNiger\nMalawi\nMozambique\nSierra Leone\nMillennium Development Goals\nHealth Care Systems\nWealth Inequality\nLow- and Middle-Income Countries\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to stay up to\n                    date.\n                \n\n\n\n\nYour email\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for signing up!\nLook for your next weekly newsletter in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\nThe End Game for Global Health Governance Negotiations\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts and Falsehoods: Israel's Attacks Against Gaza's Hospitals\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Talk to Action: Rethinking the Language of Climate Change\n\n\n\n\n\nA Longer Life Begins in the Classroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy Birth\u2014and Then What?\n              \n\n\nby\n                  Jason Socrates Bardi \n\nWomen in sub-Saharan Africa who give birth in health care facilities may not always receive high quality postpartum care\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking Gender Equality in the Global Health Workforce\n              \n\n\nby\n                  Analyne Rapa Ignacio, Kim Sales, Reiner Lorenzo Tamayo \n\nBy adopting a gender perspective, policymakers can better address the challenges that women in the health sector face\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount Her In: The Road to Women's Economic Empowerment \n              \n\n\nby\n                  Janani Shanthosh, Emma Feeny \n\nTargeting gender-based violence and promoting economic empowerment should be global concerns\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerful Legacies: New Memoir Explores Racism in Health Care and Beyond \n              \n\n\nby\n                  Allison Krugman \n\nDr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock examines the systems that oppress Black Americans and urges her readers to challenge them \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End Game for Global Health Governance Negotiations\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts and Falsehoods: Israel's Attacks Against Gaza's Hospitals\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Talk to Action: Rethinking the Language of Climate Change\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Longer Life Begins in the Classroom\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nStay up to date with the latest trends in global health\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email address\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\nThanks for signing up\nLook for our next weekly newsletter in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout This Site\n\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit cfr.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u00a92024 Council on Foreign Relations.
