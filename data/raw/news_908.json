Anthony List welcomed the court\u2019s decision.\u00a0\n\u201cThe devastating toll of abortion on minority communities, people with Down syndrome, and thousands of missing baby girls is well documented. Tennessee\u2019s landmark pro-life laws reflect the overwhelming consensus of Americans who oppose lethal discrimination against unborn children and want far greater limits on abortion than our national status quo allows,\u201d said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement.\u00a0\nThe 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Feb. 2 allowed the law to go back into effect, after having blocked it last September. That same court last year allowed a similar ban in Ohio to remain in effect.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2020, Tennessee enacted a law prohibiting abortions conducted because of the race or sex of the baby, or because of a Down syndrome diagnosis. The legislation also bans abortion after the point at which a fetal heartbeat can be detected - as early as six weeks into pregnancy.\nSimilar laws in Mississippi, Ohio, and other states have been struck down in court. In this case, the court could be waiting to rule on the Tennessee law until after the U.S. Supreme Court hands down its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which observers say has a substantial likelihood of overturning Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\nA District Court had issued a temporary injunction against the law on the day it was signed into law. During September 2021, a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling that halted the law from going into effect.\u00a0\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which are mainly abortion advocacy groups and abortion providers, have argued the law is improperly vague.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCircuit Judge Karen Nelson Moore, dissenting to the circuit court\u2019s recent decision, wrote that \u201cDobbs is unlikely to address, let alone resolve, the vagueness concerns that led the district court to enjoin the reason bans. Although the questions presented in Dobbs are entirely unrelated to the questions posed by Tennessee\u2019s reason bans, the majority chooses to stay indefinitely the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction of the reason bans until after Dobbs is decided.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nPRO-LIFE\nABORTION\nDOWN SYNDROME\ntennessee right to life\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColombian Pro-Life Leader Says Court\u2019s Abortion Decriminalization Made Women More Vulnerable\n\n\u00c1lvarez maintained that, instead of abortion, Colombia should implement public policies related to prevention. \n\n\nDiego Lopez Marina/CNA\nCulture of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt Allows Tennessee Abortion Ban to Go into Effect\n\nA coalition of 18 states filed a brief at the court supporting Tennessee\u2019s law.\n\n\nCatholic News Agency\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Challenges Nashville Suburb's Limits on Abortion Facilities\n\nWill Brewer, the legislative lobbyist for Tennessee Right to Life, said, \u201cIt's tragic that as most Tennesseans are preparing to celebrate the birth of a child, pro-abortion activists are attacking the fundamental right to life.\"\n\n\nCatholic News Agency\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland\u2019s Controversial New Hate Crime Law Set to Come Into Effect April 1\n\nStirring up racial hatred by threatening, abusive, or insulting behavior was already illegal under Scotland\u2019s Public Order Act 1986, but the bill expands the law to other protected categories.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPontifical Gregorian University Announces Merger With Biblical, Eastern Institutes\n\nThe Gregorian currently has an enrollment of about 2,700 students, 70% of whom come from outside Italy.\n\n\nDaniel Payne/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome to the (St. Joseph) Table: Feasts Overflow With Food and Faith\n\nThe tradition originated in medieval Sicily about a thousand years ago.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chef Lauren Marchetti, With a Recipe for Meatloaf\n\n\u2018The mission is to bring peace and joy into the home,\u2019 she said.\n\n\nAlexandra Greeley\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A Purposeful Day\u2019: Helping Those With Down Syndrome Thrive Beyond the \u2018Cliff of Adulthood\u2019\n\nAs so many resources dwindle down as children with special needs grow older, Kate Ashbrook is working overtime to help young adults reach their potential.\n\n\nAlyssa Murphy\nCulture of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\nAfter her prodigious output in the early 1900s, Alice Guy moved to America and launched a movie studio in New Jersey.\n\n\nJames Day\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\nVatican Authorizes Opening of Cause for Canonization for 13-Year-Old Filipina Girl\n\n\nIreland\u2019s Snakes of Secularization\n\n\nPope Francis: God\u2019s Glory Does Not Correspond to Human Success\n\n\nIs \u2018Christian Nationalism\u2019 Really a Problem?\n\n\nBishop Barron on the Spiritual Crisis: Get In the Army of Christ\n\n\nSan Antonio Archbishop Bans Retreat Center for \u2018False Teachings\u2019 Against Pope Francis\n\n\nRiley Gaines, Other Female Athletes, Sue NCAA for Allowing Transgender Competitors\n\n\nWhat Was the Counter-Reformation?\n\n\nA Catholic School Named for St. Patrick That\u2019s Totally Free and Totally Faithful\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Social media \n\n Facebook\n\n Twitter\n\n Instagram\n\n Youtube\n\n\n\n\n Tools & Features \n\n E-Newsletters\n\n RSS Feeds\n\n Register News Widget\n\n Register Radio Podcast\n\n College Guide\n\n\n\n\n Print Subscriptions \n\n Subscribe\n\n Manage a Subscription\n\n Give a Subscription\n\n Order Bulk Subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n Marketplace \n\n Advertise\n\n Job Board\n\n EWTN Religious Catalogue\n\n\n\n\n More \n\n About Us\n\n Contact Us\n\n Support Us\n\n Archives\n\n Submissions\n\n Submit Letter to Editor\n\n Reprints and Permissions\n\n Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 EWTN News, Inc.
