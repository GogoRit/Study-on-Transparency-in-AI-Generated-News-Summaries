Russell Ott was one of only two Democrats in the South Carolina House to vote for the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act, which restricts abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected \u2014 as early as six weeks post-gestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFetal heartbeat shown during ultrasound.

Russell Ott, D, was one of only two Democrats in the South Carolina House to vote for the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act, which restricts abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected \u2014 as early as six weeks post-gestation.\nOtt told CNA on Wednesday that the abortion issue is not an \u201ceasy\u201d one for him, but that everyone\u2014including the unborn\u2014deserves an opportunity to live.\n\u201cI feel like I need to continue to be consistent,\u201d he told CNA. \u201cAn unborn child is still a human being,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cI can\u2019t separate myself from that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House passed the bill overwhelmingly on Wednesday, and on Thursday Gov. Henry McMaster, R, signed it into law. Planned Parenthood also announced on Thursday that it was challenging the law in court.\nDuring legislative debate over the bill on Wednesday, Democrats walked out of the state House chamber in protest.\nUnder the law, doctors would face a felony charge and up to two years in prison for performing an illegal abortion after a baby\u2019s heartbeat has been detected. Mothers seeking abortions could not be criminally prosecuted, however.\nAccording to data from the state\u2019s health office, 55% of abortions in South Carolina in 2019 were performed after six weeks. The legislation includes exceptions for a pregnancy as a result of rape or incest, in the case of a \u201cfetal anomaly,\u201d or when the life of the mother is at stake.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diocese of Charleston supported the legislation. The director of the state\u2019s Catholic Conference, Michael Acquilano, called the passage of the bill \u201ca historic day for the pro-life movement in South Carolina,\u201d according to The Catholic Miscellany.\nOther states have passed \u201cheartbeat\u201d abortion bans, including Georgia, Missouri, Louisiana, Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, and North Dakota.\nDuring debate over the legislation, Democratic leader Todd Rutherford said his caucus cares about \u201cpeople not dying after they\u2019re born.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that life begins when science says it does not,\u201d he said, calling the vote a \u201cfarce\u201d that is \u201cabout \u2018pretend life\u2019.\u201d Announcing the walkout, Rutherford told Republicans that his caucus would \u201cleave you all to the farce which is a debate about\u2014life?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Ott expressed reservations about the bill and said he offered several amendments to it, but ultimately decided to vote for the legislation because \u201ceveryone has a right to life.\u201d\nIn an interview with CNA on Wednesday, Ott explained his reservations and why he is \u201cpro-life for the whole life.\u201d\n\u201cI acknowledge that being a man, I can\u2019t put myself in a woman\u2019s shoes,\u201d he told CNA. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to come across as someone who is telling someone else what they can and can\u2019t do with their bodies.\u201d However, he said he had to be \u201cconsistent\u201d in his support of the right to life.\nOtt says the issue is not an \u201ceasy\u201d one for him.\nThe life issue \u201chas always been an internal struggle for me,\u201d he said, adding that he is \u201cconcerned when people say it\u2019s easy for them.\u201d\nHe said he wished state Republicans were more serious about public benefits for children and adults as they are about protecting unborn children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou want to get serious? Then let\u2019s reform our public education system in the state, which has historically lagged behind everyone else, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got food deserts. We\u2019ve got lack of broadband accessibility in the rural parts of South Carolina.\u201d\n\u201cI only see this passion from individuals when we\u2019re dealing with abortion. And so that is concerning to me,\u201d he said.\nOtt said he had reservations about the bill, including its requirement that a doctor report a rape to law enforcement. He also tried to strike a provision allowing for private attorneys to defend the bill in court on behalf of the state and at the expense of the taxpayers. He also sought to create an office that would help steer pregnant women to resources available to them. His amendments were not included in the final bill.\nHe was critical of both major political parties for using abortion as a \u201cwedge\u201d political issue.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of common ground that can be found, but it can\u2019t be found if we\u2019ve got one party that\u2019s pointing to the other party and calling them \u2018baby killers,\u2019 and we can\u2019t have it if the other party is pointing back at the other ones and saying that they don\u2019t give a darn about women,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd I just think both sides have gotten to a point where they\u2019ve dug in and they use it as a political wedge in society, and I think that is not good for us as a state or a country.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nsouth carolina\nabortion\nheartbeat bill\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle
