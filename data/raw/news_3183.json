Vigneron welcomed the faithful to the cathedral to celebrate the Mass, which coincides with the Jan. 21 March for Life in Washington, D.C., but also takes places when the universal Church celebrates Word of God Sunday, the third Sunday of Ordinary Time. \n\u201cWe must understand we have to rely on God\u2019s word in our efforts; that we take direction from the word of God in our effort to defend the right of life,\u201d Archbishop Vigneron said in his homily. \u201cOur defense of the right to life is based on God\u2019s word and His plan for human flourishment. It\u2019s not the imposition of a political ideology; it\u2019s not a partisan decision. It\u2019s act on the basis of what God has told us about how to be happy in this world and the next.\u201d \n \n\n\nA Mass booklet is pictured for the Mass for the Protection of the Unborn at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament. After Communion, Archbishop Vigneron led the congregation in praying to Our Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the unborn.\n\nCommenting on the Gospel of Luke, where Jesus preaches in the synagogue in Nazareth, Archbishop Vigneron said the work pro-lifers undertake is fulfilling the God's eternal word. \n\u201cWhen God spoke, He made the world, and today His speech remakes the world; He remakes us,\u201d Archbishop Vigneron said. \u201cThe speech Jesus gave at Nazareth is a word of deliverance, deliverance of the poor, deliverance of the downtrodden, deliverance of the homeless. The Lord concludes by saying, \u2018Today, this text is fulfilled in your hearing.\u2019 What God promised is always fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ: that God is always doing what He says He will do.\u201d \nThe word of God has guided His people throughout history, from the time of Abraham and the Babylonian exile to modern days, in which thousands march annually in the nation's capital, the archbishop said. \nMarguerite Lampertius, a member of St. Owen Parish in Bloomfield Hills, attended the Mass with her adopted teenage daughter, Ana, to give witness to life in Detroit since the pair couldn\u2019t make it to Washington this year. \n\u201cIt was God\u2019s word that inspired my husband and I to adopt,\" Lampertius told Detroit Catholic. \"So for people who are considering adoption, go to the word of God and ask for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to give you courage.\u201d \n \n\n\nAlthough attendance was sparse this year because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Archbishop Vigneron addressed those watching via livestream, as well as those who attended the March for Life this year in Washington, D.C.\n\nLampertius and her husband adopted four children from Guatemala, giving the family a unique perspective to bring to the pro-life movement, that of children born to mothers who choose life, and parents who accepted life into their families.\n\u201cAdoption is still a choice; it\u2019s not extinct or something people used to do,\u201d Ana Lampertius said. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t know if I want to get married and go through a pregnancy, but I want to adopt. I was adopted, so I want to have children who have gone through what I\u2019ve gone through, just to show that adoption is a wonderful thing. There is always a family who will lovingly take in your child and love them.\u201d \nMarguerite Lampertius added the bond she shares with her children \"is really beautiful.\"\n\u201cI feel like they (her four children) have adopted us, as we have adopted them,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful, loving relationship that\u2019s not perfect; like all families you\u2019re working through brokenness. But there is so much grace that pours in. I think of the Holy Family, St. Joseph being a foster father, an adoptive father, as a beautiful role model for adopted families.\u201d \nGod\u2019s word works on God\u2019s time \nThis year\u2019s March for Life comes at a time when the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case that could overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. At the same time, a recent petition drive seeks to overturn Michigan's century-old law prohibiting abortion, should that ruling take place. \n \n\n\nA man gazes up to the expansive stained-glass windows of the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament during the Mass for the Protection of the Unborn on Jan. 23.\n\nThe ebbs and flows of the political situation can at times feels exhausting \u2014 even disheartening \u2014 for pro-life advocates, but Archbishop Vigneron encouraged the faithful not to lose heart, because the mission comes from God\u2019s word, and will be completed on God\u2019s time. \n\u201cGod\u2019s word leaves us a path to build up a healthy human society,\u201d Archbishop Vigneron said. \u201cGod\u2019s word offers healing for the wounds afflicted by legalized abortion. God\u2019s word gives us \u2014 it gives me \u2014 renewed courage because His word is efficacious. Perhaps it's not according to the timetable we might imagine is appropriate. Sometimes, we have to wait in patience for God to act. But God will act. He will do what He says.\u201d \nAfter Communion, the faithful prayed to the Virgin of Guadalupe, patroness of unborn children, for the United States and all Americans to embrace a culture of life and mercy that can heal the many divisions the country faces. \n\u201cDon\u2019t lose heart, ever,\" the archbishop said. \"Despite the challenges we face, God\u2019s word is omnipotent, all powerful, and He will, according to His plan, through whatever work we\u2019re able to offer, accomplish His plan to remake the world as He intends.\u201d \n \n\n\t\t\tShare:\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Copy Permalink\n Print\n\n\n\t\t\tSuggested reading\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishops\nPope Francis appoints Detroit\u2019s Bishop Battersby to lead Diocese of La Crosse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nWhen it comes to changing hearts, prayer works, former abortionist tells volunteers\n\n\n\n\nPro-life\nBishops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nGospels hold clues for role of women, men in the Church, panel says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a hostile world, the vocation of Christians is to hope, pope says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPapal envoy asks prayers for peace, solidarity with victims of war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidates, catechumens take final steps on their journey to Catholic Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints Detroit\u2019s Bishop Battersby to lead Diocese of La Crosse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nLocal\nNational/World\nVatican & Pope Francis\nSports\nArts\nClergy Assignments\nObituaries\nEspa\u00f1ol\nArchives\n\n\nMedia\nVideo\nPodcasts\nGalleries\n\n\nVoices\nArchbishop Allen H.
