Newsroom, Oct 23, 2022 / 11:00 am\nAs an OB-GYN in training, Dr. John Bruchalski considered abortion to be health care. But that changed when, one night, he was caught between trying to save the life of one unborn baby \u2014 and ending the life of another.\nBruchalski, author of \u201cTwo Patients: My Conversion from Abortion to Life-Affirming Medicine,\u201d now dedicates his life to providing life-affirming health care in Northern Virginia as the founder of a pro-life faith-based obstetrics and gynecology practice, Tepeyac OB-GYN, and a nonprofit dedicated to pro-life medicine, Divine Mercy Care.\u00a0\nHe spoke with EWTN Pro-Life Weekly in an episode that aired on Oct. 20 to discuss his new book \u2014 and his pro-life conversion story.\nBruchalski said the critical point of his conversion came when he served as a second-year resident in a OB-GYN training program where he \u201clearned to do abortions at all times for whatever reasons.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne evening, he found himself \u201csplit between life and death.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIn labor and delivery that night, in one room, the mom wanted the baby so I took a good history and did everything I could to keep the baby inside alive,\u201d he remembered. \u201cBut in the next room, because the mom didn\u2019t want it, I didn\u2019t take a good history because it wasn\u2019t wanted.\u201d\nThat baby, he said, survived the attempted abortion.\n\u201cI broke the water, gave her medicine to deliver her baby,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI delivered the baby; it looked a little big. I either could have suffocated it because it was born alive or I [could throw] it on the scale.\u201d\nHe did the latter. The baby weighed more than 500 grams \u2014 or more than one pound \u2014 and he called in the neonatal intensive care doctors.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take a good history, the baby was farther along, and in walked the neonatal doctor and said, \u2018Why are you treating my patients as tumors? Come to me tomorrow, have some coffee, because you\u2019re better than this,\u2019\u201d Bruchalski remembered.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat moment, he said, jumpstarted his conversion.\n\u201cIt was the facts of OB/GYN wanting to have abortion as part of good health care, but then someone stopped me in my tracks and confronted me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s that moment that I had to respond to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, he says, he bears the \u201cscar of abortion.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a wound anymore because of Jesus\u2019 mercy,\u201d he stressed. \u201cJesus\u2019 mercy is the most wonderful medicine.\u201d\nHe stressed that there is hope for those who have been involved in abortion.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re miserable out there and you\u2019ve had scars with your own abortions or referring for abortions, are you in the doctor community, in the health care community, God\u2019s mercy is here and he just loves you more than you know,\u201d Bruchalski said.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018The Chosen\u2019 actress Elizabeth Tabish talks Season Four and her own personal faith journey\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade that leaves abortion policy up to the states, Bruchalski noted the pain, anger, and ugliness that he witnessed from abortion activists. He identified it as post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n\u201cIt takes one to know one. That\u2019s me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart got hardened.\u201d\nWhile he grew up in a Catholic family that prayed the rosary every morning, he called himself a \u201cman-pleaser\u201d rather than a \u201cGod-fearer.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet, as you do more and more abortions and you have to count body parts, and then you start killing sick children in the wombs of their mother,\u201d he said, \u201cthe pain, the hardness of heart, the sharpness, it\u2019s the opposite of being an excellent doctor.\u201d\u00a0\nToday, he dedicates his life to providing life-affirming health care as the founder of Tepeyac OB-GYN and Divine Mercy Care. He named Tepeyac, he said, after the hill that Our Lady of Guadalupe appeared to St. Juan Diego in Mexico in the 16th century.\n\u201cI put it in there because the pressures in medicine and the pressures in life are to go woke and broke spiritually,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that murdering and killing life, or always pitting mom against the baby.\u201d\nHe stressed that doctors do not need to end an unborn baby\u2019s life to save the mother\u2019s.\u00a0\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\u201cWrong answer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been treating miscarriages and ectopics and all the conditions of OB-GYN for about 28 to 29 years without having to resort to elective abortion. Never.\u201d\u00a0\nHe concluded by asking for prayers for his work, for health care providers, and for all physicians.\u00a0\n\u201cThat power of loving the patient but hating the disease and knowing that medicine is an act of mercy, that's what's going to stand up to the hatred and to the bitterness and to the pain of trying to be the best patient you can be, the best mom you can be,\u201d he said.\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nAbortion in the United States, \nEWTN Pro-Life Weekly, \nDr. John Bruchalski\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
