Wade, not weak-kneed insider Katie Boyd Britt,\u201d Scott Stone, a Durant spokesperson, said in a statement to AL.comIn the fall of 2003, Britt vetoed a resolution about parking ticket procedures. Around the same time, she did not veto a resolution about providing Morning After pills. Her decision about the parking matter led the SGA to review the question of whether the president had veto power, according to reports from that period from the UA campus newspaper. \u201cI think the SGA president should have the opportunity to veto legislation that he or she does not agree with, and currently it is unclear whether the SGA president could do that,\u201d Britt said to The Crimson White in early 2004. \u201cI would have questioned more resolutions if this discrepancy was cleared up.\u201dMorning After pills are a form of emergency contraception that stop ovulation and fertilization to prevent pregnancy. The pills do not harm an existing pregnancy, according to Yale University.The anti-Britt attack ad began running just over a week before the May 24 the Alabama Republican Primary.Britt is reiterating her pro-life beliefs in response.\u201cAs a Christian, conservative wife and mother of two precious children, I am proud to be 100% pro-life. Both my faith and the science tell me that life begins at conception, and I\u2019ll fight tirelessly to protect life in the Senate,\u201d Britt said.\u201cOver 63 million innocent unborn babies have been murdered in America since the disastrous Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, and my family and I are praying that the Supreme Court finally overturns Roe this year and allows states like Alabama to defend life.\u201dIn a statement to AL.com, Britt\u2019s campaign said Britt had no involvement in the passage of the SGA resolution.Stone, with Durant\u2019s campaign, called Britt a political insider and said she will say whatever is needed to get elected.\u201cBritt\u2019s campaign is fueled by pro-abortion donors and the Washington Establishment who support her due to her go along get along track record that includes giving teenagers greater access to abortion pills,\u201d said the Durant campaign.More than $22 million in outsider spending has benefitted all three of the candidates in the U.S. Senate race.Britt has surpassed Durant in recent polls following weeks of attack ads against him.Britt\u2019s spokesperson, Sean Ross, said the Durant ad questioning her pro-life stance is the sign of a desperate campaign.\u201cKatie\u2019s momentum is surging because Alabamians know that she\u2019ll fight for our Christian conservative values, defend the sacred right to life, and advance the America First agenda. Mike Durant is trying to deceive the people of Alabama, and he\u2019s hiding behind a narrator to do it, just like he hid from a debate.\u201dUpdate: This story was updated at 8:36 p.m. Tuesday to include more information about Britt\u2019s veto of the parking ticket resolution and the debate over the SGA president\u2019s veto powerIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
