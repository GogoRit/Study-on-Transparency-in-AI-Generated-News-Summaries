Erica Thomas speaks during a protest against abortion ban bills at the Georgia State Capitol building, on May 21, 2019. (Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\nLast December, in a pivotal moment in the nation\u2019s ongoing fight for reproductive rights, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The case centers on Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban and could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion. The case is pending until the Court makes its decisions in June.\nThere\u2019s much at stake in Georgia, where health care quality is low and anti-abortion Republicans are the majority in state government. \u201cIn the event that Roe overturns, it\u2019s a very high likelihood that either [Georgia] will completely make abortion illegal or they will restrict any abortion after six weeks,\u201d says Oriaku Njoku, co-founder and executive director of Access Reproductive Care-Southeast (ARC-Southeast).\nA recent study found that states with more abortion restrictions also have more maternal deaths. In Georgia, the Maternal Mortality Review Committee reported that Black women were 3.3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications.\u00a0\nSince 2018, over 46,000 women have received abortions at one of metro Atlanta\u2019s clinics, and 77% of those treated were Black, according to data from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Abortion advocates say abortion restrictions are harmful to Black communities, especially those in Georgia, where the maternal mortality rate once topped all states and has remained consistently high. Capital B spoke with Black abortion care advocates on the implications for Black women in the city and throughout the Southeast, if the Court overturned Roe.\u00a0\nWhat does abortion care access in Atlanta look like for Black women right now?\nAbout 89% of U.S. counties do not have an abortion clinic, and in Georgia, that rate is 95%. The National Abortion Federation provider database shows 13 in-person abortion care clinics (and two telehealth providers) in Georgia: 10 in-person clinics are in the Atlanta metro area, and the other three are in Lawrenceville, Columbus, and Augusta. In addition to abortion services, most clinics provide sexual health services, including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV testing and counseling, birth control, and pregnancy testing.\u00a0\nIn Atlanta, abortion access reflects the city\u2019s general pattern of racially segregated access to health care resources: facilities and services cluster in northside neighborhoods. But these clinics serve Atlanta, as well as the Southeast region \u2013 virtually all clinics are no more than a mile away from an interstate highway, a small convenience for those who may have to travel hundreds of miles to get needed care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAtlanta, specifically, is essentially one of the hubs for abortion in the South,\u201d Njoku said. Atlanta has become a hub because of the city\u2019s international airport and highways that crisscross the city to connect people just all over the region.\nHowever, most clinics are in Atlanta\u2019s northside neighborhoods. Still, East Atlanta, Forest Park, College Park, and Decatur each have a clinic near I-20.\u00a0\nTen percent of people who received abortions in Georgia from 1994 to 2016 were from neighboring states, like North Carolina and Alabama.\nMost clinics offer surgical and mediction abortions, depending on pregnancy age and staffing availability. All clinics abide by Georgia\u2019s current laws, which prohibit abortion beyond 21 weeks and six days, require parental notification for minors, and mandate a 24-hour waiting period after the initial appointment.\u00a0\nMost health insurance plans cover abortion services, but many adults in Georgia are uninsured. For people with few resources to seek safe care, abortion funds like Access Reproductive Care-Southeast provide financial and logistical support.\nNjoku was part of a recent study that found that 81% of people seeking help from ARC-Southeast were Black, 87% had Medicaid or no insurance, and 77% were already mothers.\u00a0\n\u201cThe same folks who have issues getting health care, any sort of health care\u2026are the same folks who are impacted [by abortion restrictions],\u201d Njoku said, adding that restrictions further exacerbate existing legislative, logistical, and financial barriers to safe abortion care.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat about medication abortion in Georgia?\nMedication abortions make up over half of those that occur before nine weeks and have a 0.4% risk of significant complications. Last December, the Food and Drug Administration approved abortion pills by mail.\u00a0\nMedication abortion is promising for women affected by logistical barriers like getting to a clinic. \u201cYou could be sitting at home in College Park and talking to your abortion provider at Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center, and go pick up your prescription near your local pharmacy,\u201d says Elizabeth Mosley, a doula and professor at Georgia State University.\u00a0\nOn Feb.9, the Georgia Senate approved a bill to ban medication abortion by mail, including on public or private college or university campuses in the state.\nThe bill co-sponsor Sen. Bruce Thompson said, \u201cIt puts great risk on those females who make that choice. What we\u2019re asking is that these females have a physician involved.\u201d\nMedication abortion has been around since 2000 when the FDA first approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies before 10 weeks and the accompanying hormone blocker, misoprostol.\u00a0\nAbortion advocates say that requiring a physician examination for medication abortion is another barrier that disproportionately affects Black people who have fewer resources to get and pay for health care.\u00a0\nNearly one in five Black women in Georgia are uninsured, and one in six Black women in Georgia say they do not have a personal doctor or health care provider.\nWhat\u2019s Georgia\u2019s track record with previous abortion legislation?\nGeorgia lawmakers are no stranger to introducing abortion restrictions, and they are not alone. The state is one of 26 that aims to ban abortion if Roe is overturned.\u00a0\nRecent years brought a tsunami of anti-abortion legislation, including one of the most restrictive to date: Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban.\u00a0\nDr. Tiffany Hailstorks is an Atlanta-based Ob-Gyn and family planning doctor who provides abortion care services. In a given week, Hailstorks sees about 20 to 50 abortion patients between two clinics: Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center and Atlanta\u2019s Women\u2019s Medical Center. She says \u201cat least half\u201d of those patients are Black women.\u00a0\nAfter Texas\u2019 ban went into effect, Hailstorks immediately noticed the fallout: patients traveling from Texas to receive abortions and asking for contraception. Her Georgia patients realized the potential consequences. \u201cIf it can happen there, it could happen here,\u201d Hailstorks said.\u00a0\nAbortion access in Georgia came under threat in 2019 when Gov. Brian Kemp signed House Bill 481, known as the fetal heartbeat bill, that would ban all abortions after six weeks or detection of a heartbeat in the womb. Abortion advocates argue many women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant before six weeks, making the bill a \u201cde facto\u201d ban on abortion. They also say it violates Roe, which says states cannot ban abortion before a fetus is viable or able to survive outside the womb under normal conditions\nThe same year, abortion advocates, including the Atlanta-based SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a federal lawsuit to keep HB 481 from going into effect. A federal judge blocked the law in July 2020, as it \u201cconstitutes a pre-viability abortion ban.\u201d Under Roe, states can not ban abortion before 24 weeks of pregnancy, which is when the fetus is viable or can live outside the womb under normal conditions. The case went to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which delayed its review, pending a decision by the Supreme Court on Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Access to abortion in Georgia depends on Roe, which now hinges on Dobbs.\nWhat is Dobbs v. Jackson, and how could it affect abortion access in Georgia?\nAn abortion rights supporter holds one of many signs that was displayed at a reproductive rights rally at Smith Park in Jackson, Miss., Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\nThe Supreme Court case case is rooted in Mississippi\u2019s 2018 prohibition of abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of fetal abnormalities or a medical emergency.\u00a0\nJackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2013 the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi \u2013 filed an emergency order to block the law, which the U.S. District Court granted, stating that it was unconstitutional.\u00a0\nState Health Officer Thomas Dobbs appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals, then to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020 where arguments were heard last December.\u00a0\nThe implications of banning abortion in Georgia are dire and overwhelming. For Black women living in Georgia, a state that consistently ranks high for maternal mortality, denying abortion is a direct threat to life. The Turnaway Study followed 1,000 women from 21 clinics who were denied access and found women who gave birth reported more chronic headaches or migraines, gestational hypertension, as well as life-threatening complications compared to those who received wanted abortions.\nIn addition to the health and medical complications, denying people abortions also has far-reaching social and financial consequences, including lasting poverty, more debt and lower credit scores, inability to cover basic expenses years later, and rearing children without a partner or family members. Denying an abortion can even affect the development and poverty level of a woman\u2019s existing children.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen it comes to folks making decisions around whether they want to be a parent or not\u2026those things are what people are considering,\u201d Njoku said.\u00a0\nThere is concern that neighboring states would follow Georgia\u2019s lead if Roe is overturned, and \u201cpatients will be traveling a distance to get abortion care,\u201d depending on the gestational limits, Hailstorks said. Likely destinations are Florida and North Carolina for pregnancies under 20 weeks, and Washington, D.C., or Colorado for pregnancies beyond gestational limits.\nNow what?\nAccess in Georgia remains legal but in danger. Atlanta advocates are working to provide care to those who need it and be more proactive against the onslaught of anti-abortion legislation. \u201cThere are moments that it feels heavy,\u201d Hailstorks said, referring to the work of ensuring patient\u2019s abortion care is \u201cseamless.\u201d Hailstorks says there is \u201ca ton of work going on in the background\u201d when coordinating an abortion.\u00a0\nGeorgia\u2019s current abortion laws and stigma all make providing abortion uniquely more difficult to provide compared to other preventive services,\u201d said Hailstorks. For example, she has to vet medical staff to ensure they are \u201cOK\u201d with providing abortion care.\u00a0\n\u201cMore restrictive legislation makes it so much harder to be able to do what is already difficult,\u201d she said.\nNjoku finds promise in the city\u2019s Reproductive Justice Commission, which works to increase awareness around access to reproductive, maternal and infant health, as well as abortion. The commission was sponsored by Councilman Amir Farokhi in 2019 in response to Georgia\u2019s heartbeat bill.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a group of folks that are like \u2018OK, well, when we\u2019re talking about reproductive freedoms, reproductive justice in this state, what does that look like? Who is impacted?\u2019\u201d\nThe commission has not been very active since it was formed in 2019, but for Njoku it reiterates that Atlanta is, \u201ca bit more progressive than other cities in the state.\u201d\n \n\n\nCapital B is a nonprofit news organization dedicated to uncovering important stories \u2014 like this one \u2014about how Black people experience America today.
