One of the most effective young advocates on behalf of the prolife movement, he speaks frequently at Christian high schools, churches, and training seminars.Host of the podcast\u00a0Un-Aborted!,\u00a0he was chagrined to discover Facebook removed a YouTube link on February 17th to a recent podcast interview with an abortion survivor, stating in vague terms that he violated their \u201ccommunity standards\u201d by posting the link.Gruber had recorded the interview with abortion survivor Melissa Ohden in January, while he was at the March for Life in Washington D.C.\u201cI shared the link to that YouTube clip on my Facebook page and my personal Facebook account,\u201d he says. \u201cShortly after doing so, Facebook notified me the post on my personal account violated their community standards.\u201dGet Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.SubscribeFacebook never stated which standards he violated. \u201cThey removed the post entirely. It is no longer accessible or can be viewed from my personal account.\u201d\u201cThey are feckless cowards. Their justification and wording was along the lines of not wanting to mislead others with incorrect information,\u201d he says.Gruber has appealed the censorship, but is not optimistic about a reversal.\u201cThis is the same debate that\u2019s been going on for years with this kind of content. It is almost exclusively conservative and pro-life content that is targeted without being told what community standards are being violated.\u201dMOREWas this article helpful?Yes1 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
