The group set up multiple signs and tables, this time not on the Esplanade but on the path between Miller Fountain and Coates Library.\nAlso unlike past TFL demonstrations, this display drew multiple protestors. Among them were senior Ben Brody and junior Grant Kinscherff. The two were unaffiliated with each other but both held signs along the path, seeking to provide an alternate perspective to the dominant display.\nBrody said his decision to protest the event was somewhat spontaneous. He walked by the demonstration on the way to class on Monday and thought that he should do something, but when he came out of class, senior Sarah Bastos was already holding a sign reading \u201cgummy bear rights.\u201d Tuesday, however, Brody saw that TFL was still demonstrating, with no one there to counter their beliefs.\n\u201cSo I went to the library, asked if they had any scrap paper and tape and a marker and they did, so I taped some papers together and wrote, \u2018Her body, her choice\u2019 on the paper, just as a way to reaffirm people who were walking by who would otherwise feel attacked or ashamed,\u201d Brody said. \u201cI sat a respectable distance away and just held the sign for an hour before I had to go to class.\u201d\nBrody felt that he achieved his goal of making people feel less ashamed. One conversation he had with a passerby stuck out to him.\n\u201cI had one woman in particular \u2026 she was walking by, visibly distraught by the imagery that they were publishing and some of the things they were saying, and then saw my sign and came up to me, crying and hugged me and said, \u2018Thank you, I needed that,\u2019\u201d Brody said.\nBrody didn\u2019t just talk to those who agreed with his stance on abortion. He was also surprised by the pro-life group\u2019s respectful reaction to his sign. He remembered when one of the JFA representatives approached him.\n\u201cOne of the adults \u2026 came over and noticed that my sign was kind of flapping around, it was just loose recycled paper. She said, \u2018Do you need some more tape? We have a little extra tape if you need it,\u2019 and then just started conversing with me,\u201d Brody said. \u201cThat was really refreshing. On the one hand, I still very firmly disagree with the message they were trying to send. On the other hand, I was not prepared for that sort of kindness.\u201d\nLike Brody, Kinscherff wanted to counter TFL\u2019s display. However, he took a more humorous approach, holding a cardboard sign that read, \u201cEat Ass.\u201d\n\u201cI like to make people laugh. I think that [the TFL display] is a pretty morbid display, and I think that people shouldn\u2019t have to look at it,\u201d Kinscherff said. \u201cI think they should have a good alternative that makes them laugh. I\u2019m not trying to convince people of anything.\u201d\nWhen Kinscherff spoke to the Trinitonian, he said he had been standing on the path with his sign for the past two hours. At the time of the interview, he was engaged in a conversation with his friend, senior Alex Jacobs, who is a member of TFL.\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to my friend Alex, but we\u2019re not having an intellectual discussion on this side of the street. People come take pictures, say hi, but I don\u2019t have a lot to talk about,\u201d Kinscherff said.\nKinscherff and Jacobs both emphasized their respect for the other\u2019s right to free expression.\n\u201cI think that Grant should be free to speak his views, just as the pro-life group should be,\u201d Jacobs said.\nTrinity students also have institutional support for expression of ideas. Trinity\u2019s Statement on Student Rights and Responsibilities protects not just personal but also public expression.\n\u201cChallenge and discomfort are essential in academic institutions, while proscription and coercion of thought have no place,\u201d the document reads in part. \u201cStudents should be free, individually and collectively, to express their views and concerns on issues of institutional policy and on matters of general interest to the student body.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLeave a Comment\n\n\nactivismalex jacobsBen Brodygrant kinscherffjustice for allpro-choicepro-lifeprotestTigers for Life\n\n\n\n\nMore to Discover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        More in Featured                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Column: 3 years of extras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDying, dying, dead: Is the MCU still alive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposition A: Your vote matters more than you think\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RA hall of fame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackpot!
