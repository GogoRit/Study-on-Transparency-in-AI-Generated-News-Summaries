Wade.\nThis is a major victory for unborn children and their mothers.\nIt all started when Mississippi passed a state law limiting abortion after 15 weeks\u2014it really was nothing extreme but was in line with the majority of the world. Seventy-five percent of countries worldwide limit abortion past 12 weeks gestation.\nBut that\u2019s not what pro-abortion activists would have you believe. Not long after the law passed, it was labeled as \u201cextreme\u201d and challenged in court. This Mississippi abortion case made it all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nWho is affected by this Mississippi abortion law?\nMothers and children benefit from Mississippi\u2019s Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018, which protects not only unborn children but also women\u2019s health and well-being.\nAt just 15 weeks, babies have a strong heartbeat and can move around the womb. It\u2019s also likely they can feel pain at this point\u2014which abortion undoubtedly inflicts.\nThe Mississippi law also recognizes that all women deserve beneficial health care, not unnecessary and life-threatening procedures such as abortion. What is often left unsaid about late-term abortions is that they put women at risk of facing severe complications, trauma, or even death. Mississippi\u2019s law protects them mentally, emotionally, and physically.\nDobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\nThe Supreme Court issued its decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Since then, more than 60 million unborn children have lost their lives to abortion.\nThe past 50 years have also seen huge advances in prenatal medicine and technology. While viability (the point at which a baby can survive outside the womb) was widely considered to be between 24 and 28 weeks gestation in 1973, it is now considered to be between 21 and 22 weeks gestation.\nThe reality is our federal abortion laws are stuck in the past. It makes sense that Mississippi would want its state law to reflect our modern scientific knowledge. Ultrasounds have helped reveal developmental characteristics such as fetal heartbeat, movement, and pain perception, characteristics that weren\u2019t widely known back in 1973 when Roe  was decided. And that\u2019s why Mississippi passed a law limiting abortions after 15 weeks in gestational age, permitting them only in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be too controversial, given that most nations put more limitations on and  most Americans  support commonsense laws like Mississippi\u2019s.\nYet pro-abortion activists were quick to challenge the law. That challenge reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where the Court was asked whether to uphold the law and overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\nCase timeline\n\nMarch 2018: Mississippi passed the Gestational Age Act. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a Mississippi abortion clinic, challenged Mississippi\u2019s law shortly after it was passed.\nJune 2020: Mississippi\u00a0asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in\u00a0after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that states cannot pass laws like Mississippi\u2019s limiting abortion before the point of viability.\nMay 2021: The U.S. Supreme Court  agreed to hear\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nDecember 2021: Oral arguments were heard  before the Supreme Court. ADF prays that the court will overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to protect the sanctity of life.\nJune\u00a02022: The U.S. Supreme Court  issued a decision\u00a0overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  \n\nOutcome\nBy overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has given lawmaking decisions about abortion back to the states. We now turn to the states to ensure that unborn children and their mothers are protected from the gruesome reality of abortion.\nEvery human life is valuable and deserves to be protected. It is now in the hands of each of the 50 states to protect the most vulnerable among us.\nThe bottom line\nEvery life is precious and needs to be protected from harm. And abortion can only bring pain and suffering.\nLearn more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
