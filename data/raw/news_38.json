Andy Beshear vetoed Senate Bill 9 last week, saying that Kentucky law already fully protects children from being denied life-saving medical care and treatment when they are born.\n\u2028That decision brought sweeping response from Todd Gray, the executive director-treasurer of the Kentucky Baptist Convention, who called it \u201cabsolutely unimaginable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2028\u201cI cannot conceive the type of thinking that allows an elected official, in this case Governor Beshear, to simultaneously preserve life by slowing the spread of COVID-19 and disregard the life of the unborn,\u201d Gray said.\nGov. Andy Beshear\nGray wasn\u2019t alone in being upset over the veto of the \u201cBorn Alive Act.\u201d House Speaker David Osborne said he was \u201coutraged and saddened over the decision to veto a bill aimed at protecting human life\u201d and Attorney General Daniel Cameron called it \u201creprehensible.\u201d\n\u2028\u201cMake no mistake, the governor had a choice and he used it to defend the indefensible,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cThe Born Alive Act simply requires physicians and other health caregivers to provide life-saving medical care to infants who survive an abortion. This is about protecting a human life outside of the womb.\u201d\n\u2028When asked about the veto at his daily press conference Friday afternoon, Beshear said he \u201cwas just not doing divisive issues right now.\u201d\n\u2028He said his full focus was on defeating the coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have 100 percent of our effort aimed toward it and we got to have unity in this Commonwealth.\u201d\n\u2028Beshear said making the bill law would result in lawsuits and \u201cpulling people one way or the other, and creating discord, in the middle of a time when we\u2019ve got to be together. I just didn\u2019t think it was the right direction for us to go.\u201d\n\u2028Bills similar to Senate Bill 9 have been struck down as unconstitutional in other states throughout the country when challenged, Beshear wrote in his veto.\n\u2028The bill also included a provision that would have allowed the attorney general to enforce a law requiring abortion clinics to have a written agreement with a hospital so that patients may be transferred to the hospital if an emergency occurs. It gives the attorney general the ability to deem what is an essential medical service. Abortion had been deemed an essential service during the COVID-19 quarantine.\n\u2028\u201cThe governor, who claims to have everyday family values, vetoed a bill that would require babies born after failed abortions to receive live-saving medical care,\u201d Cameron said.\n\u2028He called the veto an \u201caffront to the people of Kentucky,\u201d whose elected representatives voted in a bipartisan manner for the bill.\n\u2028\u201cIt\u2019s also disheartening that he would issue a veto against a bill that gives my office the authority to hold abortion clinics accountable to the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people of Kentucky elected me to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth, and I had hoped that Governor Beshear would welcome having me as a partner with the Cabinet for Health and Family Services in enforcing our health and safety laws, rather than rebuking the people\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\u2028Cameron said the governor wanted to avoid creating unnecessary divisiveness but the veto of a bill that received support from both sides of the aisle and protects the most vulnerable was an incredibly divisive action for him to take.\n\u2028Gray said the timing of the veto decision was curious, too.\n\u2028\u201cThe fact that he waited until the end of the day on Friday to veto shows the obvious desire to draw as little public awareness as possible,\u201d he said.\n\u2028Kent Ostrander, the executive director of the Family Foundation, agreed about the timing of the veto.\n\u2028\u201cIt is ironic because the announcement apparently came out while he was doing his 5 p.m. \u2018Team Kentucky\u2019 program about compassion for the vulnerable,\u201d Ostrander said. \u201cHe simply doesn\u2019t see; he just has his own agenda.\u201d\n\u2028Ostrander said the decision causes him to recommit his efforts.\n\u2028The decision will be a divisive one for Kentucky Baptists, who were hoping the governor would sign the bill into law or do nothing which would make it law.\nThousands sent emails and messages to the governor\u2019s office asking him to allow the bill into law.\n\u2028The measure was overwhelmingly approved in both the Kentucky House and Senate.\n\u2028\u201cIt is a miracle for an infant to survive an abortion and to not render assistance is unthinkable,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cState and federal laws are insufficient in addressing this and, unfortunately, we learned all too well the cruelty that these infants endure when Virginia Governor Ralph Northam publicly defended, and New York political activists celebrated, the heinous practice.\n\u2028\u201cThis is not the end of this issue. The House Majority Caucus has been called the most pro-life in the history of our Commonwealth, and we will continue to fight for human life.\u201d\n\u2028Planned Parenthood praised Beshear for the veto in a statement.\n\u2028\u201cNot only is this bill unnecessary, it is a blatant display of anti-abortion politics by extremists in the Kentucky General Assembly,\u201d said Tamarra Weider, the Kentucky director Planned Parenthood Advocates of Indiana and Kentucky. \u201cA global pandemic is not the time to play political games with people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\u2028The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky also stood behind Beshear\u2019s decision to veto the bill, saying in a statement it was \u201ca politically motivated bill that was passed in the final hours of the legislative session.\u201d\n \n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\nMore Americans opt out of COVID-19 vaccinations; survey show choice can be based on political views\n\n\t\t03/16/2024 \u00b7 0 Comment \n\n\n\nBeshear releases \u2018Collaborative Blueprint,\u2019 to help economic developers across state navigate the future\n\n\t\t02/28/2024 \u00b7 0 Comment \n\n\n\nNew study finds e-liquids in vapes increases susceptibility to virus that spreads COVID\n\n\t\t02/28/2024 \u00b7 0 Comment \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBlake says: \nMarch 12, 2021 at 7:57 am / Reply\n\nThere is no explanation of why this is unnecessary \u2013 the vast majority of abortions happen long before the fetus is viable outside of the womb. In the rare cases where a late abortion happens, it is highly likely to be because the baby will not survive for very long after birth and the decision is made that risks to the mother of continuing pregnancy outweigh the benefit of continuing it. Finally, in the very rare case that a viable fetus is delivered and alive I don\u2019t think there is any medical center that would not at that point start life sustaining measures.\nThis bill was unnecessary and passed as a political maneuver not because there was a need or benefit. Unfortunately the reporter briefly mentions that there were opposed parties without going into any detail why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg says: \nSeptember 7, 2021 at 8:01 am / Reply\n\n\u201cHighly unlikely\u201d is purely opinion and is not supported by evidence.  Ever heard the name Kermit Gosnell?  And he is not just a one off case. There are numerous credible accounts of babies left on a table or in a garage can to die alone.  And even if it is rare , where is the professed compassion of our governor who is willing to pull out all the stops to fight Covid because \u201cit\u2019s worth it \u201cif it saves just one life\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyName * \nEmail * \nWebsite \n \n\n\u0394 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n December 2023 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n August 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n November 2022 \n October 2022 \n September 2022 \n August 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n December 2021 \n November 2021 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n August 2021 \n July 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n December 2020 \n November 2020 \n October 2020 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n June 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n December 2019 \n November 2019 \n October 2019 \n September 2019 \n August 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n September 2018 \n August 2018 \n July 2018 \n June 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n August 2017 \n July 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n November 2016 \n October 2016 \n September 2016 \n August 2016 \n July 2016 \n June 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n December 2015 \n November 2015 \n October 2015 \n September 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n June 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n December 2014 \n November 2014 \n January 2014 \n\n\nAffiliations \u2022 Institute for Nonprofit News\r\n\u2022 Online News Association\r\n\u2022 N.
