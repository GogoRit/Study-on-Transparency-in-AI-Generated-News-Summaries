(photo: Courtesy photo / Tomasz Duklanowski/Radio Szczecin)\n\n\nKatie Yoder/CNA\nWorld\nMarch 29, 2022\n\n\nA pro-life bell blessed by Pope Francis arrived in Lviv, Ukraine, in recognition of the beauty of human life amid Russia\u2019s invasion of the country.\u00a0\n\u201cIt reminds us that everyone has the right to be born and to live,\u201d Father Tomasz Kancelarczyk, who delivered the bell on March 24, said. \u201cIt is also a voice of warning.\u201d\nCredit: Tomasz Duklanowski/Radio Szczecin\nFather Kancelarczyk of the Little Feet Foundation in Szczecin, Poland, brought the \u201cVoice of the Unborn\u201d bell to the St. John Paul II Shrine in Lviv. The bell\u2019s journey does not end there: It will continue to travel among Ukrainian parishes in order to promote \u2014 or ring in \u2014 a culture of life.\n\u201cThe Voice of the Unborn Bell is on the one hand a voice of warning, but also a call to the sanctity of life,\u201d the priest said at the bell\u2019s arrival ceremony. \u201cIt is supposed to stimulate us to adore life and that its enormous value should always be in the heart not only of the Church, but also of every human being.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou cannot ask for peace while waging war against the weakest,\u201d he stressed.\nPope Francis blessed the bell for Ukraine, along with a bell for Ecuador, in St. Peter\u2019s Square at the Vatican last October. The Voice of the Unborn bells are part of an initiative by the Polish Yes to Life foundation, which advocates for human life from conception until natural death.\u00a0\nPope Francis rings one of the \u2018Voice of the Unborn\u2019 bells on Oct. 27, 2021. | Courtesy of the Yes to Life foundation\n\u201cMay their sound announce the \u2018gospel of life\u2019 to the world, awaken the consciences of men, and be a reminder of the unborn,\u201d the Pope said at the time. \u201cI entrust to your prayer every conceived child whose life is sacred and inviolable.\u201d\nThe giant bells, like the original in Poland, come from the bell-making workshop of Jan Felczy\u0144ski, located in Przemy\u015bl. Each one weighs more than 2,000 pounds and reaches nearly four feet in diameter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bells\u2019 decoration speaks to their purpose. Among other images, they illustrate a DNA chain, the ultrasound of an unborn child and the Ten Commandments tablets. The bells are inscribed with the text of the Fifth Commandment \u2014 \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d\nThe bells also cite Jeremiah 1:5 (\u201cBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born, I dedicated you\u201d) and quote Pope St. John Paul II's encyclical Evangelium Vitae: \u201crespect, protect, love and serve life, every human life!\u201d\nBefore departing for Lviv, Father Kancelarczyk wrote that the bell\u2019s arrival the day before the Solemnity of the Annunciation on March 25 was not an accident.\n\u201cIt is not a coincidence for me to place under such a call, nor is it a coincidence for me and this day of experiencing the mystery of the conception of the Son of God in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary is not a coincidence, because it was deliberately and deliberately chosen by the organizers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is also not a coincidence that it will happen on the day that the Ukrainian Bishops\u2019 Conference announced as the day of penance for the sin of abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe priest said that an appreciation for the beginning of Christ's life should lead to an appreciation for all human life.\u00a0\n\u201cThis admiration leads to adoration of life in its practical dimension: helping pregnant women; it is expressed in respect for them and readiness to help and care,\u201d Father Kancelarczyk said.\nHe included human life threatened by war, saying that the war in Ukraine is waged in parallel with the spiritual war.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Voice of the Unborn Bell sounded in Lviv as a voice of respect for the dignity of life,\u201d he said.\nAfter the bell ceremony at the Lviv shrine, the parish celebrated a Mass for peace.\nIn addition to the bell, the citizens of Lviv were given medical supplies, medicines and food from Poland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese people need not only material things, but also something immaterial: fortitude, love of the homeland, courage, and this cannot be bought with any money,\u201d said Father Kancelarczyk. \u201cI have a feeling that we have done a good job by handing over this bell, but also many necessary articles.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \npro-life\npro-choice\npro-life
