Columnist Sanchita Teeka provides five counter arguments when it comes to pro-life claims. By Sanchita Teeka, Columnist June 28, 2022As of Friday, a group of unelected officials made a decision ripping away a person\u2019s right to choose \u2014 the right to an abortion. Albeit the fact that up to 61% of Americans support abortion in most cases, there is still around 39% of Americans who are opposed to the freedom of choice to have an abortion.\u00a0\nAbortion is often misunderstood and this confusion can be reason why some call themselves \u201cpro-life.\u201d Pro-life people often think that they are genuinely holding the correct beliefs and that abortion is literally murder. Nonetheless, every pro-life argument has a stronger counterargument.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1. \u201cAbortion is plain murder.\u201d\nFirst, understand this is a stance that is incredibly hard to change in itself because pro-lifers\u00a0 believe it to be fact. Pro-lifers fully believe that abortion is murder, so no argument about control over uterus-holding people will work to change this belief.\u00a0\n\n\nGet The Daily Illini in your inbox!\n\n\nEnter your email\n\nSelect a newsletter\n\n\nHeadline News \ud83d\udd14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadline News \ud83d\udd14\nCatch the latest on University of Illinois news, sports, and more.

Most people understand that a person has the right to decide whether or not they want their organs to be donated, and this isn\u2019t a controversial opinion. Even if someone\u2019s organs could have been used to save another person\u2019s life, we don\u2019t consider that to be murder if the person has chosen not to donate organs. In a similar sense, it doesn\u2019t make sense to force a person with a uterus to give their organs and body to a fetus.\u00a0\n2. \u201cLife is life.\u201d\nWhile many pro-lifers believe this, their actions don\u2019t show it. For one, if they eat meat or kill bugs, they\u2019re literally ending life on a daily basis. These actions show that they understand the complexity of life and that it is not all the same.\u00a0\nA common counterargument is the idea of \u201cpotential.\u201d Pro-lifers might say that human fetuses are intelligent and have potential but animals don\u2019t, which unlocks a new set of inconsistencies in their reasoning.\u00a0\nFor one, studies have shown that pigs and other animals have intelligence levels comparable to young children, so in that case they shouldn\u2019t be eating animals if \u201clife is life.\u201d\u00a0\nAdditionally, they\u2019re likely not advocating against the death penalty, guns or actively trying to prevent suicide. However, mentioning this would probably elicit a defensive response because nobody likes being called out on their blatant hypocrisy.\u00a0\n3. \u201cWhat if the baby grew up to cure cancer, or was the next president?\u201d\nWhile this is definitely possible, the same can be said of the person forced to carry to term. What if the 12 year old forced to have a baby would have grown up to do those things herself but couldn\u2019t because they were carrying a baby? Or what if the middle-aged person was in the midst of doing these things but was halted by having a baby? Alternatively, what if that baby grew up to be the exact opposite and committed horrible crimes?\nThese \u201cwhat ifs\u201d can be applied to literally anything because this line of argument rides on a logical fallacy. \n4. \u201cThere are so many people who want a child.\u201d\nYes, but there are already hundreds of thousands of kids in foster care. If this statement was true, this number would be zero. The people who do want to adopt overwhelmingly want an infant. They also want one that is white, seen by the fact that most adoptions are of white kids while children of color make up the most in foster care. The foster care system is entirely unsatisfactory and the last thing needed now is more children in the system.\n5. \u201cWhat if your parents aborted you?\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be alive so I wouldn\u2019t care and I wouldn\u2019t be having another \u201cwhat if\u201d argument based on a logical fallacy.\u00a0\n\nEven after using all of these arguments and more, a \u201cpro-lifer\u201d may still not be convinced and might maintain their beliefs. Yet, having the argument or conversation means that all sides of the argument have been made clear. Only with arguments and conversation are we able to see the entire picture, and maybe in the process have one review their beliefs.\n\u00a0\nSanchita is a sophomore in LAS.\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTrending Stories\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nUrbana, Champaign to invest in Willard Airport expansionBy Meghna Sarkar, Staff WriterReview | \u2018Kung Fu Panda 4\u2019 plays it safe with disappointing sequel\u00a0By Nicolas Roacho, Staff WriterNo. 2 Illinois rolls past No. 3 Nebraska in uncanny second-half comebackBy Jack Larson, Assistant buzz Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nContact Us / Submit a Tip\nPrint Edition\nNewsletter\nSports Newsletter\nApply\n\n\nABOUT\n\nStaff\nEthics Code\nCorrections Policy\nArchives\nTerms of Use\n\n\nTHE ILLINI MEDIA COMPANY\n\nDonate\nAdvertise\nIllio Yearbook\nWPGU 107.1\nAlumni\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            31\u00b0\n            \n                \n\n                Champaign, IL                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            31\u00b0\n            \n                \n\n                Urbana, IL                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nTiktok\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            31\u00b0\n            \n                \n\n                Champaign, IL                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            31\u00b0\n            \n                \n\n                Urbana, IL                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nTiktok\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Illini \u2022 \u00a9 2024 Illini Media Company \u2022 Privacy Policy \u2022  FLEX Pro WordPress Theme by SNO \u2022 Log in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\nCloseClose Modal WindowClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
