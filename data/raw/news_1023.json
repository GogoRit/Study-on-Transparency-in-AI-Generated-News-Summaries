Wade, the landmark case that found Americans have the right to an abortion. Missouri doctors worry the state\u2019s new abortion ban could put women with high-risk pregnancies in danger. (Robin Bravender/States Newsroom).\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Missouri medical providers are fearful that patients with high-risk pregnancies will face delayed care in life-threatening situations because doctors fear prosecution under Missouri\u2019s newly-enacted abortion ban.\n\u201cI\u2019m following the rules that are made by people that have no understanding of medicine and science, and that\u2019s extremely, extremely dangerous,\u201d said Iman Alsaden, a doctor and medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\nUnder the new law, which went into effect last week after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortions are now illegal in Missouri. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\nThe procedure is only permitted in a medical emergency, which state law defines as necessary to save the patient\u2019s life or \u201cfor which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\u201d\nHealth care providers who violate the ban can be guilty of a class B felony, which can result in five to 15 years in prison, and suspension or revocation of their medical license.\nBut physicians and experts say the statute is so vague that doctors aren\u2019t sure what they can do in the case of some potentially deadly pregnancy complications. Jeannie Kelly, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Washington University in St. Louis and the medical director of labor and delivery, said there\u2019s concerns physicians will be left feeling \u201cparalyzed\u201d out of fear.\n\u201cI am worried that people will sit on very sick, pregnant patients longer than they should, in fear of being prosecuted,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just our licenses, this isn\u2019t malpractice. This is a criminal felony charge with jail time.\u201d\nKelly said doctors may need to terminate a pregnancy in cases of uterine infection, hemorrhaging, ectopic pregnancies or severe preeclampsia \u2014 all conditions that can result in death or irreversible harm.\nDuring a virtual town hall with U.S. Congresswoman Cori Bush Thursday night, Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said the exceptions to Missouri\u2019s abortion ban will inevitably lead to dangerous delays in care and \u201cput providers in impossible situations.\u201d\n\u201cIn order for doctors to avoid prison time, instead of treating a patient before their health condition becomes life threatening, doctors are now contemplating how sick is sick enough before I can provide life-saving care,\u201d McNicholas said. \u201cCare will be delayed and people will suffer unnecessary harm as doctors wait for permission from hospital lawyers to tell them that they can proceed.\u201d\nLisa Larson-Bunnell, \u200b\u200ba healthcare regulatory attorney with a Missouri hospital, said the confusing statute may cause doctors to delay life-saving care if they don\u2019t think a patient is near enough to disaster.\u00a0\n\u201cIt absolutely could mean that there\u2019s going to be delays of care until somebody has essentially gotten worse, gotten much worse,\u201d Larson-Bunnell said.\u00a0\n Physicians\u2019 fear\u00a0\n\n The Planned Parenthood in St. Louis on June 24, 2022 (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).\nMedical practitioners say the law is too vague and doesn\u2019t account for the myriad issues that can arise during pregnancy and the speed with which a healthy pregnancy can turn dangerous.\u00a0\n\u201cThough someone may seem fine one minute, if you wait long enough, you know, they\u2019ll really tank,\u201d Alsaden said.\nNot only that, lawyers who have analyzed Missouri\u2019s new abortion ban disagree over what the abortion ban prohibits.\nLarson-Bunnell said the law lacks a definition of pregnancy. Does it begin at conception? Implantation? Is it measured the same way as gestational age?\u00a0\n\u201cAnd it might seem to you, and I think a normal person, as, \u2018Well duh, a pregnancy, is a pregnancy,\u201d Bunnell said.\u00a0\nBut how pregnancy is defined weighs heavily on whether an abortion is legal in an ectopic pregnancy or other emergency situations.\u00a0\nLarson-Bunnell said a woman can have an incomplete miscarriage where a fetus is dying and cannot be saved but might still have heart tones. At the same time, a pregnant woman can be bleeding severely.\nShe said even a layperson would likely think that\u2019s an emergency. But the statute is narrow and unclear because abortions are only allowed to avert immediate death or serious injury.\nOne law firm, Spencer Fane, interpreted the law to be so strict as to outlaw Plan B and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Attorney General Eric Schmitt\u2019s office clarified Wednesday that \u201cMissouri law does not prohibit the use or provision of Plan B or contraception.\u201d\n\u201cI think that (Spencer Fane is) trying to show that this is so vague, that there are all of these consequences that can come from it and here is one really extreme way that you can interpret the statute,\u201d Larson-Bunnell said.\u00a0\nSaint Luke\u2019s Health System in Kansas City released a statement expressing the gravity of the situation.\u00a0\n\u201cThe ambiguity of the law and the uncertainty even among state officials about what this law prohibits continues to cause grave concern and will require careful monitoring,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is especially true because the penalty for violation of the statute includes the criminal prosecution of health care providers whose sole focus is to provide medically necessary care for their patients.\u201d\nMissouri\u2019s abortion ban will not alter the way providers treat an ectopic pregnancy, said Leslie Carto, a spokeswoman for University Health, Kansas City\u2019s safety net hospital and the teaching hospital associated with the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\nMaureen Phipps, CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told reporters last week that overturning Roe v. Wade \u201cwill leave physicians looking over our shoulders wondering if a patient is in enough of a crisis to permit an exception to a law.\u201d\nThere are very few situations where a true black-and-white line exists in medicine, said Kelly, at Washington University in St. Louis.\u00a0\n\u201cPotentially per one physician or one lawyer, they fall under that exemption,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cbut potentially by someone else\u2019s opinion, they don\u2019t.\u201d\nAs a high-risk obstetrician, Kelly said she often treats patients with conditions in which the fetus would not survive to term or would lead a short and difficult life after birth. In those instances, some families choose to continue with the pregnancy, whereas others prefer to seek an induction abortion that allows them to deliver and hold their child.\n\u201cThis is just part of their grieving process,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd unfortunately because of this ban, this is no longer an option for any patient in the state of Missouri.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI worry a lot about people that do have those pre-existing conditions and whether they are going to be able to find abortive care. \n\n\n\u2013 Lisa Larson-Bunnell,  a healthcare regulatory attorney with a Missouri hospital\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Katy Liu, a family medicine doctor in St. Louis, isn\u2019t as worried about the complexity.\u00a0\nLiu belongs to the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She does not support elective abortions when both pregnant woman and fetus are healthy. But she has performed abortions or administered drugs to patients with ectopic pregnancies and other complications.\nShe believes ectopic pregnancies, infections and miscarriages fall under the exemption and are \u201cclear cut\u201d cases of when a physician could induce labor or terminate the pregnancy based on the gestational age of the fetus.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine people saying we have to delay it to the point of life or death before we intervene,\u201d she said, adding that she understands the concerns about specificity in the law.\u00a0\nTreatment for an ectopic pregnancy, she said, is terminating it soon after it\u2019s discovered.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not the same as elective abortion where the goal is to end the baby\u2019s life,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThe goal is to save the mom in a situation where if nothing is done, both lives would be lost.\u201d\nLiu said some additional clarity could be helpful.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether a woman diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy could have an abortion in order to receive chemotherapy or radiation.\u00a0\nLarson-Bunnell said she couldn\u2019t give advice on what the statute means in that situation, but she said it\u2019s a question experts are wondering about. She also worries about children who are raped given the abortion ban doesn\u2019t include an exemption for rape victims. Pregnancy, she said, is very difficult on young bodies.\u00a0\n\u201cI worry,\u201d she said. \u201cI worry a lot about situations like that. I worry a lot about people that do have those pre-existing conditions and whether they are going to be able to find abortive care.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\u00a0\nLiu said a former teacher of hers found out during her pregnancy that she had a brain tumor. The teacher postponed treatment and delivered the baby early. The baby survived and she went into remission.\u00a0\nIf a woman found out she had a more aggressive cancer and was early in pregnancy, Liu said it wouldn\u2019t run afoul of her beliefs for the woman to have an abortion. While it\u2019s not an immediate medical emergency, Liu said she thought it would be permissible under Missouri\u2019s abortion ban.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s true.\u00a0\nBesides medical complications, Alsaden said the law ignores mental health. For example, a person with bipolar disorder may take lithium to treat it. But the medication can cause birth defects.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd so should that person come off their lithium to continue this pregnancy and risk their mental health?\u201d Alsaden said, adding that discontinuing medication can be \u201clife-threatening and dangerous\u201d for people with mental health issues.\n Life and death stakes\n\nOver a dozen states have abortion bans in effect or set to soon go into effect, and the increasing restrictions come at a time when the number of maternal deaths in the U.S. have been on the rise.\nOver 500 public health and reproductive health experts in an amicus brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court wrote that: \u201cPut simply, women living in states with the most restrictive abortion policies \u2014 and thus the least abortion access \u2014 were found to be more likely to die while pregnant or shortly thereafter than women living in states with less restrictive abortion policies,\u00a0 regardless of state-to-state differences in poverty, race/ethnicity, and education.\u201d\nIffath Hoskins, president of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a maternal fetal medicine specialist, said during a press briefing last week that a woman can develop complications early in pregnancy that may worsen if she is forced to carry the fetus until the pregnancy becomes life-threatening enough for an abortion to be permitted. That may increase the patient\u2019s risk of dying.\nMissouri\u2019s maternal mortality rate ranks 44th nationwide, and Black women and women on Medicaid are both four times more likely to die within one year of pregnancy.\nKelly said she\u2019s concerned Missouri\u2019s ban will only worsen those disparities, and McNicholas warned against what\u2019s to come.\n\u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to adapt to this new normal,\u201d McNicholas said. \u201cAllowing people to slip into avoidable near-death situations is not normal.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXMissouri doctors fear vague emergency exception to abortion ban puts patients at risk\nby Tessa Weinberg, Missouri Independent July 2, 2022\nMissouri doctors fear vague emergency exception to abortion ban puts patients at risk\nby Tessa Weinberg, Missouri Independent July 2, 2022\n Some Missouri medical providers are fearful that patients with high-risk pregnancies will face delayed care in life-threatening situations because doctors fear prosecution under Missouri\u2019s newly-enacted abortion ban.\n\u201cI\u2019m following the rules that are made by people that have no understanding of medicine and science, and that\u2019s extremely, extremely dangerous,\u201d said Iman Alsaden, a doctor and medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\nUnder the new law, which went into effect last week after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
