The bill is likely to reach Gov. Kevin Stitt\u2019s desk early next week, and the first-term Republican running for reelection has already said he would sign any anti-abortion bill the Legislature sends to him. It would take effect immediately after he signs it.\n\n\u201cThis bill could go into effect at any time, and once it does, any person can sue the clinic, the doctors, anyone else who is involved in providing an abortion in Oklahoma,\u201d said Rabia Muqaddam, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Oklahoma clinics in legal challenges against several proposed new anti-abortion laws.\nThe bills are part of an aggressive push in Republican-led states across the country to scale back abortion rights. It comes on the heels of a leaked draft opinion from the nation\u2019s high court that suggests justices are considering weakening or overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nearly 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill by Collinsville Republican Rep. Wendi Stearman would prohibit all abortions, except to save the life of a pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cIs our goal to defend the right to life or isn\u2019t it?\u201d Stearman asked her colleagues before the bill passed on a 73-16 vote, mostly along party lines.The bill specifically authorizes doctors to remove a \u201cdead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion,\u201d or miscarriage, or to remove an ectopic pregnancy, a potentially life-threatening emergency that occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube and early in pregnancy. With all of the state\u2019s abortion clinics expected to stop offering services, it\u2019s not clear where a woman who qualified under one of these exemptions would go to get an abortion because providers say many doctors would be afraid of running afoul of the law. The bill also does not apply to the use of Plan B, other morning-after pills or any type of contraception.Because the bill defines an \u201cunborn child\u201d as a human fetus or embryo in any stage of gestation from fertilization until birth, it is not expected to apply to in vitro fertilization, which is when eggs are fertilized in a lab before being transferred into a woman\u2019s uterus, said Dr. Eli Reshef, an Oklahoma City fertility specialist.\n\n\u201c(The bill) does not criminalize what we do,\u201d Reshef said. \u201cNo matter one\u2019s position on abortion, we are not concerned about the bill harming our particular profession.\u201dThe bill is one of at least three anti-abortion bills sent this year to Stitt. Another abortion bill similar to a Texas bill passed last year that prohibits the procedure after cardiac activity can be detected in the embryo, which experts say is about six weeks, already has taken effect and has already dramatically curtailed the practice in Oklahoma. Another bill set to take effect this summer would make it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. That bill contains no exceptions for rape or incest.\u201cAt this point, we are preparing for the most restrictive environment politicians can create: a complete ban on abortion with likely no exceptions,\u201d said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which stopped providing abortions at two of its Oklahoma clinics after the six-week ban took effect earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst-case scenario for abortion care in the state of Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nLike the Texas law, the Oklahoma bill would allow private citizens to sue abortion providers or anyone who helps a woman obtain an abortion. After the U.S. Supreme Court allowed that mechanism to remain in place, other Republican-led states sought to copy Texas\u2019 ban. Idaho\u2019s governor signed the first copycat measure in March, although it has been temporarily blocked by the state\u2019s Supreme Court.After Texas passed its bill last year, there was a dramatic reduction in the number of abortions performed in that state, with many women going to Oklahoma and other surrounding states for the procedure.\n\nThere are legal challenges pending in Oklahoma to both the bill to criminalize abortion and the six-week Texas ban, both of which could still be halted, but the courts have so far failed to do so.The number of abortions performed each year in Oklahoma has declined steadily over the last two decades, from more than 6,200 in 2002 to 3,737 in 2020, the fewest in more than 20 years, according to data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health. In 2020, before the Texas law was passed, about 9% of the abortions performed in Oklahoma were women from Texas.In the first four months after Texas\u2019 law took effect last September, abortions at clinics in the state dropped an average of 46% compared to the same span the year prior. But studies also found a sharp increase in the number of Texas women who were ordering abortion pills by mail and traveling out of state for abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEAN MURPHY\n\n\n                Murphy is the statehouse reporter for The Associated Press in Oklahoma City.
