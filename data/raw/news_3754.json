And I was, and I did! I loved to read, I loved to write, and Hamilton was a place I knew I could find ample opportunities to do both, particularly given the major I chose.\u00a0\nAlmost before I knew it, three years had passed and\u00a0 suddenly I found myself as a senior, needing to make a plan for what came next. My dad (also a Hamilton alum), is a lawyer, and I grew up watching him fulfilled and engaged by a career path that he felt truly enabled him to positively contribute to society. So I chose to pursue a law degree, before really knowing what kind of law I wanted to practice\u2014which I would not necessarily recommend! But I knew a law\u00a0 degree would allow me to find ways to meaningfully improve lives, so I went on to law school, figuring I\u2019d sort the rest out once I got there.\nWhen you\u2019re young and plotting out a potential career path, people talk to you a lot about what you want to do. For me, figuring out what I didn\u2019t want to do turned out to be just as important. I started law school torn between environmental law and reproductive rights law. Being in D.C. meant I could use both summer and school-year externships to help me choose between the two. A summer spent doing environmental law research showed me that I couldn\u2019t ever do that long-term\u2014it was like watching paint dry! But when I interned at the Center for Reproductive Rights, I loved every second of it, and I devoted the remainder of my time in law school to classes and externships to help me learn and grow in the reproductive rights space.\u00a0\nToday, I am still in the sexual and reproductive health/rights/justice field, working as Counsel at the National Abortion Federation, a nonprofit based in D.C. The current administration is a perpetual challenge for my field, and \u201cproductively channeling outrage\u201d is a skill I\u2019m required to use more frequently these days than I\u2019d ever imagined I might while at Hamilton.\u00a0\nAs a teenager, I thought for a time I would become a doctor\u2014I knew I wanted to help people after all, and I loved biology, so medicine seemed like it was a great fit. Eventually, I remembered how squeamish I was (and still am), and determined that maybe dealing directly with patients and their various\u2026fluids\u2026wasn\u2019t for me. Yet again, something I didn\u2019t want to do! That realization, though, helped set me on the track to my current job, where I get to support and advocate for abortion providers in policy conversations at the local, state, and federal levels. Like any career path, nonprofit life has its challenges, but I am extremely grateful to do work in support of patients who need care, as well as the incredible health care providers who work so hard to make sure they get it.\u00a0\nWhen I came to the Hill, my advisor Pat O\u2019Neill told me to make sure that every semester I took one course that was totally unrelated to my major--that was the whole point of attending a liberal arts institution. I took her suggestion to heart, and as a result, my transcript reflects a bit of dabbling in everything from religious film studies to ceramics (bless Rebecca Murtaugh and her endless kindness and patience with my utter lack of artistic talent). I knew I didn\u2019t want to work in these areas for my career, but I\u2019m so glad I took those courses. I learned how to be flexible and adaptive when dealing with subject areas and media that were foreign to me, and I learned that the skills I was picking up as an English major were transferrable and could be applied to anything.\u00a0\nMy work in abortion policy calls on both those lessons all the time. In law school, you spend your entire first year learning how to write like a lawyer. Which is, of course, immensely helpful if you\u2019re going on to write legal briefs. hen I\u2019m drafting testimony against a bill that seeks to inhibit access to abortion care, it\u2019s not the writing skills I learned in law school on which I draw, but rather, the skills I picked up at Hamilton. Legislators are not often swayed by dry arguments about the legality (or lack thereof) of the policy they\u2019re trying to pass. Typically, they know full well when a bill is unconstitutional, and\u00a0 that won\u2019t stop them if they\u2019re determined to make a political point. But if you can paint a picture with your words that makes them feel something, you might get somewhere.\u00a0\nThose are skills that Hamilton gave me. And in the current administration, the adaptability that a liberal arts education provides is most definitely a boon\u2014you never know what drastic new policy may come at you next, so you always have to be ready to apply your skills to something you\u2019ve never seen before! Dealing with a ceaseless barrage of attacks on abortion access certainly goes on the list of things I don\u2019t want to do, but I\u2019m really glad I\u2019m doing it.\u00a0\nI\u2019m grateful that Professor O\u2019Neill encouraged me to use my time at Hamilton to explore as many subject areas as I could\u2014it set me up to recognize the difference between the wrong course and the right course once I got to law school, and to keep figuring out what I don\u2019t want as my career develops further.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to News\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp us provide an accessible education, offer innovative resources and programs, and foster intellectual exploration.\n\n\nMake a Gift\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton College\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n198 College Hill Road,\n\nClinton,\nNY\n13323\n\n\n\n\n315-859-4011\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hamilton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaps & Directions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffices & Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary & IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton College\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n198 College Hill Rd,\n\nClinton,\nNY\n13323\n\n\n\n\n315-859-4011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 \n2024\n\nHamilton College. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow Thyself\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory & Traditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmission & Aid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Aid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Our Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Curriculum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Faculty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALEX: Advise, Learn, Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenters & Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Live\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Eat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Do\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership, Activism, & Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareers & Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowships & Scholarships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Alumni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming Arts & Museum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan a Visit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Virtual Tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hamilton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni News\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hamilton Connect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername/Password Assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hamilton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho To Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary & IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hamilton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenters & Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrar Forms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDining Hours & Menus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHill Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary & IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParents & Families\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParents Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Hamilton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHill Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebcam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you looking for?\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n          \n\n\n\n\n"
