(AP) \u2014 Abortion rights advocates in Alabama \u2014 where abortion is almost entirely illegal \u2014 filed lawsuits Monday against the state\u2019s attorney general seeking to prevent him from prosecuting people who help patients travel outside the state to end pregnancies. The groups say Attorney General Steve Marshall has made statements suggesting that anti-conspiracy laws could be used to prosecute those who assist with appointments or finances. The two lawsuits seek a legal ruling clarifying that the state can\u2019t use the statute for these prosecutions.One lawsuit was filed by the Yellowhammer Fund, a group that stopped providing financial assistance to low-income abortions patients because of the prosecution concerns. The other was filed by an obstetrician and two former abortion clinics that continue to provide contraception and other health services. \n\n\u201cWhat the attorney general has tried to do via these threats is to effectively extend Alabama\u2019s abortion ban outside of its borders for Alabama residents,\u201d said Meagan Burrows, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the providers in the lawsuit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlabama gives DeBoer 8-year, $87 million deal; AD Greg Byrne, hoops coach Nate Oats get raises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longest-serving member of the Alabama House resigns after pleading guilty to federal charges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina earns the top seed in the West Region after missing NCAA Tournament last year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a separate case, advocacy groups and an attorney sued Idaho earlier this month over a law that makes it illegal to help minors travel to another state to get an abortion without their parents\u2019 consent. Marshall has not prosecuted anyone for providing abortion assistance, but he has made statements saying that his office would \u201clook at\u201d groups that provide help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAttorney General Marshall will continue to vigorously enforce Alabama laws protecting unborn life which include the Human Life Protection Act. That includes abortion providers conspiring to violate the Act,\u201d Marshall\u2019s office said in an emailed response to the lawsuit. His office did not respond to an email asking to clarify if actions such as providing financial assistance could be prosecuted.\n\nThe comments have had a \u201cdisturbing chilling effect\u201d on abortion rights advocates and providers, who already feel like they live with a legal target on their back, said Kelsea McLain, deputy director of Yellowhammer. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s our right and our freedom to support people in leaving the state if they need to because the state no longer takes care of their needs,\u201d she said. The provider suit was filed by the West Alabama Women\u2019s Center in Tuscaloosa, the Alabama Women\u2019s Center in Huntsville, and Dr. Yashica Robinson, an obstetrician. Robinson said she once made referrals for patients seeking abortions, coordinating medically complex health histories, but no longer does so because of the fear of prosecution. \u201cTragically, banning abortion in Alabama seems to not have been enough,\u201d Robinson said in a statement. \u201cThose in power want to muzzle providers like me to prevent us from sharing information with our pregnant patients about the options they have.\u201dThe phone rings at least once a day at the former clinic in Tuscaloosa as women \u2014 sometimes crying and often desperate \u2014 try to find where they can go in other states to end an unwanted pregnancy, the clinic director said. \n\n\u201cWe get a lot of the anger \u2014 and we know that it\u2019s not us that they are angry at,\u201d said Robin Marty, operations director for the West Alabama Women\u2019s Center. \u201cIt\u2019s the situation, but it is very, very hard for my staff. They want to be able to help them.\u201dAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states, the Deep South quickly became an area of limited abortion access. Alabama bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape and incest. The only exemption is if it\u2019s needed because pregnancy seriously threatens the pregnant patient\u2019s health. Nineteen states have enacted restrictions and many southern states have near complete bans. Marty said that means women often have to travel long distances to receive care, which can bring financial and logistical hardship. Marty said most people who reach out to the clinic know \u201cthere is no abortion in Alabama. What they aren\u2019t aware of is how far that extends.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
