Therefore, it\u2019s not even slightly surprising that many people were left furious after the Republicans of Alabama passed the Alabama Human Life Protection Act last year that makes abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony that\u2019s punishable by up to 99 years in prison. But Rep. Rolanda Hollis thought she could turn the tables and show how it feels to have your reproductive rights restricted by introducing a bill that would require men to be vasectomized after turning 50 or after having their third child (whichever comes first).  More info: Rep.Rolanda HollisReacting to Alabama\u2019s abortion restriction laws, Rep. Rolanda Hollis proposed a bill last week that would require men to have vasectomies after turning 50 or having their 3rd childShare iconThe Alabama Human Life Protection Act states that the only exceptions when abortion can be performed are when there is a serious threat to the health of the expecting mother or when the fetus has serious health problems and the child would die shortly after birth. However, there aren\u2019t any exceptions for rape and incest which infuriated a lot of women in the state including Rep. Rolanda Hollis who had the brilliant idea of introducing a symbolic bill that would allow men to put themselves into women\u2019s shoes and actually feel what it\u2019s like to have others governing your body.It was done as an attempt to show how outrageous it is to have laws controlling someone\u2019s body and their reproductive healthShare iconA federal judge blocked the law in October saying that it violates the Constitution. US district judge Myron Thompson explained that \u201cAlabama\u2019s abortion ban contravenes clear Supreme Case Court precedent. It violates the right of an individual to privacy, to make choices central to personal dignity and autonomy. It diminishes the capacity of women to act in society and to make reproductive decisions. It defies the United States Constitution.\u201d But since Rolanda Hollis saw that there are no laws being made to restrict male reproduction, she made a point by issuing House Bill 238 that would require men to undergo mandatory vasectomies at their own cost \u201cwithin one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.\u201dADVERTISEMENTShe wanted to underline that this bill is symbolic and is introduced to highlight and remind everyone of the inextricable role men play in producing unwanted pregnanciesShare iconImage credits: RepHollisEven though Hollis herself thinks it\u2019s outrageous to have laws that restrict people\u2019s reproductive choices, her point is to \u201cneutralize last year\u2019s abortion ban bill, and sends the message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies\u201d is still being overlooked and is given a hard time online. Hollis responded to the criticism saying: \u201cMany have seen HB238 as an outrageous overstep; yet, year after year, the majority party continues to introduce new legislation that tries to dictate a woman\u2019s body and her reproductive rights. We should view this as the same outrageous overstep in authority. Just as I would turn to my doctor over my state legislator to make recommendations when deciding whether or not to have a surgery, or whether or not to take a certain type of medicine, it is my doctor with whom I \u2014 or any of my loved ones \u2014 should consult when it comes to making the incredibly difficult decisions related to my personal reproductive rights.\u201dEven though there were people who started calling her a communist, many women appreciated her symbolic gesture     Share iconADVERTISEMENTShare iconShare iconShare iconADVERTISEMENTShare iconShare icon Anyone can write on Bored Panda.

Who the hell do people think they are deciding on what's best for a total stranger? I saw a news article about a 16 year old girl who was raped and got pregnant. There were complications that meant the child would not live long after birth but the physical trauma from giving birth would kill her. Because of stupid laws made by idiots who know nothing about a persons civil rights, she was forced to give birth. She died, unnecessarily. The baby suffered for 30 minutes before dying and the rapist was never caught. Do you really want to decide what's best? Can you handle that sort of guilt. If it's not your body, leave it alone! Maybe this will make the men in charge pay attention to what is being said.
