Then what do you say to the people out there who say, \u201cWell, you know what? God killed everybody on earth. He killed everybody except for Noah and a bunch of farm animals. That\u2019s not very pro-life.\u201d Because I\u2019ve had people make the argument that there were probably some pregnant women there, and when the flood happened that God sent, he kind of aborted those babies. If a fetus is considered a baby, shouldn\u2019t he have saved every pregnant woman?\nTim: Would you say the Bible is a pro-life book? Well, that depends entirely on what is meant by a \u201cpro-life book.\u201d Sometimes, we need more information before we can answer a question. In this case, it\u2019s not immediately clear to me what is meant by a \u201cpro-life book,\u201d and so we need to ask a clarifying question: What do you mean by a \u201cpro-life book\u201d?\nMost people associate \u201cpro-life\u201d with the abortion debate. The phrase \u201cpro-life\u201d is shorthand for the belief that elective abortion is wrong. So, someone could take a \u201cpro-life book\u201d to mean a book against elective abortion, and that\u2019s probably what the priest took the question to mean, but that\u2019s not what the questioner meant. Instead, he\u2019s asking something like, \u201cDo you think the Bible is against all killing?\u201d Well, that\u2019s a different question with a different answer. After all, the Bible is full of examples of God killing people through acts of judgment. The flood is a prime example.\nNotice we have two different questions with two different answers. Is the Bible pro-life? Well, that depends. God gives commands against murder\u2014unjustified killing\u2014and I think this includes taking the life of an unborn human, but God is also justified in taking life, especially in judgment. Unlike humans, God can legitimately take life that he gives. In other words, God has prerogatives regarding humans as their Creator that humans just don\u2019t have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcast\nA Biblical Answer to Abortion\nBioethics\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWANT TO BE A STRONGER AMBASSADOR FOR CHRIST?\n\t\t  Let us equip you through our signature publications, videos, articles, and other mentoring tools.
