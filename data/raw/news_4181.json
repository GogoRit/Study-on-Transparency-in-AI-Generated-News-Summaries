Argentinians, like many in Latin America, call the phenomenon femicidio, highlighting the female victim whose murder is often, though not exclusively, perpetrated by an intimate partner.\u00a0As #NiUnaMenos grew into a movement, Argentinian feminists expanded their initial calls to end abuse and violence to include other women\u2019s rights issues, like the legalization of abortion. The country\u2019s\u00a0growing economic crisis\u00a0is also disproportionately harming women. In Argentina, women are overrepresented among\u00a0the poorest 20 percent\u00a0of the population. Due in part to higher unemployment rates,\u00a0large gender pay gaps, and other economic disadvantages, women are facing higher barriers to resiliency and survival. (Indeed, the\u00a0movement has also linked\u00a0increased anxiety and stress to a higher probability of being abused\u2014as well as a lower probability of feeling able to leave an abusive environment.)Not only is the movement calling for policies that support the care work that women need to perform, so as to reduce women\u2019s time poverty; it also hopes that public and private investment in the care sector will expand employment opportunities. Researchers have suggested that stronger investment in the care economy\u00a0could create 600,000 jobs\u00a0and increase the wages of those who perform care services. An integrated federal care system, therefore, could counter the economic downturn by boosting domestic demand. That means that building a care economy offers possibilities for strengthening women\u2019s economic autonomy\u00a0and\u00a0enhancing the nation\u2019s economic performance.The new administration of President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez is signaling that it wants to meet the movement\u2019s expectations. Fern\u00e1ndez already established a new Ministry of Women, Gender, and Diversity, which includes an Office for Care Policies that will coordinate government efforts in this area. Elizabeth G\u00f3mez Alcorta, a well-known feminist human rights lawyer, currently runs the ministry. Alcorta and her team will be working with their colleagues in the Ministry of Social Development, led by Daniel Arroyo, who has also been looking at various aspects of an integrated care system.Argentina is set to chart a path that few countries have taken and the women\u2019s movement demands this change. The initial steps the government is likely to begin with are low-cost approaches, but they can have a large impact on women\u2019s time and could enhance the value of their work. Among the policies under discussion, according to Natalia Gherardi of Equipo Latinoamericano de Justicia y G\u00e9nero, are equal pay measures, expanded parental leaves, the legalization of abortion, education to prevent gender-based violence, and comprehensive sexuality education.\u00a0While most economists will be more satisfied with a promise of higher productivity, many Argentinian women are aiming for gender equality.\u00a0\u201cIn order to talk about autonomy over our bodies, we need to have economic autonomy,\u201d\u00a0said Mercedes D\u2019Alessandro, the newly appointed national director for gender and economics, who has close ties with the Argentinian feminists.\u00a0Without a doubt, the Argentinian women\u2019s movement will continue to mobilize to ensure that government officials are held accountable to their political commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarina Durano\n\n      Until November 2021, Marina Durano was a senior program officer with the Open Society Women\u2019s Rights Program.\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Topics\n  \n\n\nWomen\u2019s Rights \n\n\n\n\n    Share\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gender Justice Now\n\n        \n        \n                    \n        \n      \n\nWomen Will Not Be Silent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        By now, the link between authoritarianism and the repression of women and gender nonconforming people is clear.
