I wanted to be a fellow because I am so passionately pro-life and truly admire the work that SFLA does which made me want to be part of that. \u00a0\nDuring a Respect Life\u00a0Week\u00a0I organized for this fellowship, I witnessed my school\u00a0stepping\u00a0up when it came to helping women in need.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur group at our school is fairly big and to get the year started we wanted to host a Respect Life Week at our school. This would bring more awareness to the school about the pro-life movement. Throughout the whole week, we had various events that we had that members of the group and the school could participate in. \nThese events consisted of decorating the school in red, 40 days for Life, Divine Mercy Chaplet during lunch, pro-life chalk outside of the school, attending a Respect Life Dinner in our town, and even a screening of the movie Unplanned the weekend before the kick-off. It was a very full week of many different events that required our board to be very hands-on.\u00a0\n\nBut\u00a0when I look back at that week, the most successful part of it all was raising $1,300 for our local pregnancy resource center.\u00a0\nSince I go to a Catholic high\u00a0school,\u00a0we have to wear school uniforms every day. One day during the week we told the school, with permission from the administration, that with a donation of at least a dollar you could get out of school uniform for one day.\u00a0It\u00a0was so exciting to see so many people willing to donate money that they knew was going to help women that go to the local\u00a0pregnancy help center.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Thaddeus Stevens Fellowship gave me the opportunity to collaborate with many amazing pro-life leaders.\u00a0\nThis year, more than any other, I felt like I had people to turn to when I needed help. In the Stevens Fellowship,\u00a0we all became\u00a0really good\u00a0friends. When I had a\u00a0question or a situation came up in our pro-life group, I knew a network of people that I could turn to for advice. \u00a0\nThese fellows have become more than just people I met in June. They have become life-long friends and contacts I can always talk to. This past year I spent in the fellowship has solidified my desire be a pro-life activist for the rest of my life.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,178\n\nShare this postMary Briganti\nBlogBlogrollFeaturedhigh schoolleadershipSupportersSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
