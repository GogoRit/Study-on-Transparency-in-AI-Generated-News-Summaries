(Farah Yousry/Side Effects Public Media)\n\n\n\n\nOn a Monday morning, a group of obstetrics and gynecology residents, dressed in blue scrubs and white coats, gathered in an auditorium at Indiana University School of Medicine. After the usual updates and announcements, Dr. Nicole Scott, the residency program director, addressed the elephant in the room. \u201cAny more abortion care questions?\u201d she asked the trainees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis story is part of a partnership that includes\u00a0Side Effects Public Media,\u00a0NPR\u00a0and KHN. It can be republished for free. \n\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, one resident asked: \u201cHow\u2019s Dr. Bernard doing?\u201d\n\u201cBernard is actually in really good spirits \u2014 I mean, relatively,\u201d Scott answered. \u201cShe has 24/7 security, has her own lawyer.\u201d\nThey were talking about Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indiana OB-GYN who provides abortions and trains residents at the university hospital. Bernard was recently caught in a political whirlwind after she spoke about an abortion she provided to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio. Bernard was the target of false accusations made on national television by pundits and political leaders, including Indiana\u2019s attorney general.\nThe doctors interviewed for this article said that they are not speaking on behalf of their school of medicine but rather about their personal experiences during a tumultuous moment that they worry will affect the way they care for their patients.\nThe vitriol directed at Bernard hit home for this group of residents. She has mentored most of them for years. Many of the young doctors were certain they wanted to practice in Indiana after their training. But lately, some have been ambivalent about that prospect.\nDr. Beatrice Soderholm, a fourth-year OB-GYN resident, said watching what Bernard went through was \u201cscary.\u201d \u201cI think that was part of the point for those who were putting her through that,\u201d Soderholm said. They were trying \u201cto scare other people out of doing the work that she does.\u201d\nIn early August, Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, signed a near-total abortion ban into law, making Indiana the first state to adopt new restrictions on abortion access since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June. When the ban takes effect Sept. 15, medical providers who violate the law risk losing their licenses or serving up to six years in prison.\nDr. Beatrice Soderholm, a fourth-year OB-GYN resident who is originally from Minnesota, will complete her training in a few months. She had planned to continue to practice in Indiana but has agonized over that decision.(Farah Yousry/Side Effects Public Media)\nThese days, Scott, the residency program director, uses some meeting time with residents to fill them in on political updates and available mental health services. She also reminds them that legal counsel is on call round-the-clock to help if they\u2019re ever unsure about the care they should provide a patient.\n\u201cOur residents are devastated,\u201d Scott said, holding back tears. \u201cThey signed up to provide comprehensive health care to women, and they are being told that they can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nShe expects this will \u201cdeeply impact\u201d how Indiana hospitals recruit and retain medical professionals.\nA 2018 report from the March of Dimes found that 27% of Indiana counties are considered maternity care deserts, with no or limited access to maternal care. The state has one of the nation\u2019s highest maternal mortality rates.\nScott said new laws restricting abortion will only worsen those statistics.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEmail Sign-Up\t\t\n\n\n\t\tSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\tYour Email Address\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tSign Up\t\n\n\nScott shared results from a recent survey of nearly 1,400 residents and fellows across all specialties at the IU School of Medicine, nearly 80% of the trainees said they were less likely to stay and practice in Indiana after the abortion ban.\nDr. Wendy Tian, a third-year resident, said she is worried about her safety. Tian grew up and went to medical school in Chicago and chose to do her residency in Indiana because the program has a strong family-planning focus. She was open to practicing in Indiana when she completed her training.\nBut that\u2019s changed.\n\u201cI, for sure, don\u2019t know if I would be able to stay in Indiana postgraduation with what\u2019s going on,\u201d Tian said.\nStill, she feels guilty for \u201cgiving up\u201d on Indiana\u2019s most vulnerable patients.\nEven before Roe fell, Tian said, the climate in Indiana could be hostile and frustrating for OB-GYNs. Indiana, like other states with abortion restrictions, allows nearly all health care providers to opt out of providing care to patients having an abortion.\n\u201cWe encounter other people who we work with on a daily basis who are opposed to what we do,\u201d Tian said. Tian said she and her colleagues have had to cancel scheduled procedures because the nurses on call were not comfortable assisting during an abortion.\nScott said the OB-GYN program at the IU School of Medicine has provided residents with comprehensive training, including on abortion care and family planning. Since miscarriages are managed the same way as first-trimester abortions, she said, the training gives residents lots of hands-on experience. \u201cWhat termination procedures allow you to do is that kind of repetition and that understanding of the female anatomy and how to manage complications that may happen with miscarriages,\u201d she said.\nThe ban on abortions dramatically reduces the hands-on opportunities for OB-GYN residents, and that\u2019s a huge concern, she said.\nThe program is exploring ways to offer training. One option is to send residents to learn in states without abortion restrictions, but Scott said that would be a logistical nightmare. \u201cThis is not as simple as just showing up to an office and saying, \u2018Can I observe?\u2019 This includes getting a medical license for out-of-state trainees. This includes funding for travel and lodging,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt adds a lot to what we already do to educate future OB-GYNs.\u201d\nDr. Nicole Scott(Farah Yousry/Side Effects Public Media)\nFour in 10 of all OB-GYN residents in the U.S. are in states where abortion is banned or likely to be banned, so there could be a surge of residents looking to go out of state to make up for lost training opportunities. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the body that accredits residency programs, proposed modifications to the graduation requirements for OB-GYN residents to account for the changing landscape.\nFor some of the Indiana OB-GYN residents \u2014 including Dr. Veronica Santana, a first-year resident \u2014 these political hurdles are a challenge they\u2019re more than willing to take on. Santana is Latina, grew up in Seattle, and has been involved in community organizing since she was a teenager. One reason she chose obstetrics and gynecology was because of how the field intersects with social justice. \u201cIt\u2019s political. It always has been, and it continues to be,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd, obviously, especially now.\u201d\nAfter Roe was overturned, Santana, alongside other residents and mentors, took to the streets of Indianapolis to participate in rallies in support of abortion rights.\nIndiana could be the perfect battleground for Santana\u2019s advocacy and social activism. But lately, she said, she is \u201cvery unsure\u201d whether staying in Indiana to practice after residency makes sense, since she wants to provide the entire range of OB-GYN services.\nSoderholm, who grew up in Minnesota, has felt a strong connection to patients at the county hospital in Indianapolis. She had been certain she wanted to practice in Indiana. But her family in Minnesota \u2014 where abortion remains largely protected \u2014 has recently questioned why she would stay in a state with such a hostile climate for OB-GYNs. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of hesitation,\u201d she said. But the patients make leaving difficult. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, starting to cry.\nIt\u2019s for those patients that Soderholm decided she\u2019ll likely stay. Other young doctors may make a different decision.\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes\u00a0Side Effects Public Media,\u00a0NPR,\u00a0and KHN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelated Topics\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStates\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoctors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen's Health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\t\t\n\n\t\t\tSubmit a Story Tip\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This Story:\nTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailPrint\n\nRepublish This Story\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you: Contact Us\n\n\n\nRepublish This Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nCopy And Paste To Republish This Story\n\n\nIndiana\u2019s New Abortion Ban May Drive Some Young OB-GYNs to Leave a State Where They\u2019re Needed \n\n\t\tBy Farah Yousry, Side Effects Public Media \n\n\t\t\tAugust 19, 2022\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArticle HTML\t\t\t\t\nIndiana\u2019s New Abortion Ban May Drive Some Young OB-GYNs to Leave a State Where They\u2019re Needed\n\tFarah Yousry, Side Effects Public Media\n\nOn a Monday morning, a group of obstetrics and gynecology residents, dressed in blue scrubs and white coats, gathered in an auditorium at Indiana University School of Medicine.
