(Logan Lockner/WABE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia could see more battles over its abortion restrictions in 2023. The state Supreme Court is expected to take up a lawsuit challenging House Bill 481, which bans abortion after around six weeks of pregnancy, when cardiac activity can be detected in the womb and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\nThe lawsuit brought by the ACLU on behalf of Georgia advocacy groups and abortion providers was initially heard this fall in Fulton County Superior Court.\u00a0\nAfter a two-day trial in Atlanta, Judge Robert McBurney ruled H.B. 481 was unenforceable because it was unconstitutional when it was originally passed and signed into law \u2014 in 2019, well before the United States Supreme Court decision this summer that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe Georgia Supreme Court then granted a request from the Attorney General\u2019s office to stay the block and allow the law to go back into effect while the state\u2019s official appeal of the decision moves through the courts.\nAnd the six-week ban took effect just before Thanksgiving.\nSince then, abortion providers have again been turning away patients whose pregnancies are beyond the six-week cutoff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of emotional at times, especially when you have to tell a patient the news that you\u2019re not able to be seen here in Georgia. And sometimes patients aren\u2019t aware of the law, most people have not been aware of it being back to what it is. So it\u2019s just very disheartening,\u201d said Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center front office supervisor and patient coordinator Antoinette.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s keeping her last name private out of fear for her safety. The independent clinic is a regular target of anti-abortion activists.\u00a0\nStaff turn away roughly seven patients a day after ultrasound exams reveal their pregnancies are beyond the legal gestational limit, clinic officials said. \u00a0\nFeminist Women\u2019s Health Center and other Georgia abortion providers refer patients in this situation to abortion providers in other states where the procedure is accessible until later in pregnancy.\nThe closest one to Atlanta is located about two-and-a-half hours away in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\u201cFor the patients here, they will go through counseling and we provide them with information for the Greenville Women\u2019s Clinic in Greenville. Then there are three or four clinics in North Carolina, and then I think it\u2019s one or two in Florida,\u201d Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center Operations Manager Tracii Wesley said.\u00a0\nPatients who need financial assistance to help cover their travel costs are also referred to organizations that offer it, such as the National Abortion Federation.\nAbortion providers around the state are also watching for any abortion-related legislation that could be introduced during the upcoming 2023 legislative session.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn the campaign trail, Gov. Brian Kemp promised no new abortion restrictions for the state.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s unclear when judges at the Georgia Supreme Court will hear the ACLU lawsuit challenging H.B. 481.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion\n\nDec 20, 2022\nFewer abortions, more vasectomies: Why the procedure may be getting more popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta Artists\n\nDec 19, 2022\nArtist Erin Nicole Henry\u2019s solo exhibit \u2018Open Window Kisses\u2019 evokes reflection and awareness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Disparities\n\nDec 2, 2022\nReport: More direct aid, tax credits to poor moms could improve Georgia\u2019s maternal, infant health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid\n\nDems press Kemp on handling of Medicaid \u2018unwinding\u2019 after thousands of Georgia kids lose health coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Legislature\n\nGeorgia lawmakers advance bills to give those convicted of minor crimes easier path to work, housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFani Willis\n\nTrump seeks to appeal decision not to disqualify district attorney from Georgia election case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection\n\nFormer Georgia Lt.
