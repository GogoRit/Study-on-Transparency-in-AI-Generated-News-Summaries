(@libsoftiktok / Twitter.com)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 4, 2022): The University of Kentucky tells FIRE it \u201cis not investigating and has no plans to investigate the incident. To do so would betray the very purpose of the institution.\u201d\nThe university says its tweets saying an investigation was underway were \u201cinartfully worded.\u201d\nFIRE thanks UK for the timely response.\nStudent to demonstrator: \u2018Sorry! First Amendment, man.\u201d\nFIRE in letter to UK: \u201cYeah. What she said.\u201d\nThe viral video spans just 22 seconds.\nBut the stain on the University of Kentucky\u2019s reputation for threatening a lawful student protest on its public campus may last far longer.\u00a0\nFIRE wrote to UK this afternoon urging it to immediately reverse course after it tweeted yesterday that it will investigate a group of four students who displayed \u201cmocking behavior\u201d toward a pro-life demonstrator.\nOr as we here at FIRE like to call it: Fully protected, core political speech.\n\n\n\nIn the video \u2014 which was apparently taken last fall but went viral just yesterday \u2014 the students are seen standing in front of a pro-life demonstrator\u2019s sign \u2014 which depicts an aborted fetus \u2014 doing a roughly choreographed dance, and then grabbing their bags to leave. One of the women turns to the man and says, \u201cSorry. No uterus, no opinion.\u201d She momentarily extends her middle finger and walks away, before turning back a final time to add: \u201cActually, I promise I\u2019d kill my baby if I got pregnant.\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the other students chimes in: \u201cI literally would! Are you kidding me? No uterus, no opinion.\u201d\nAt one point, another student shouts \u2014 in feigned remorse \u2014 to the demonstrator: \u201cSorry. First Amendment, man.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the essence of FIRE\u2019s letter to UK, reminding the public, land-grant institution that not only does the First Amendment protect this kind of basic, political counter-protest, but so does Kentucky state law, which mandates that UK maintain policies that uphold \u201cthe broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, learn, and discuss any issue,\u201d and \u201ca marketplace of ideas where the free exchange of ideas is not suppressed because an idea put forth is considered by some or even most of the members of the institution\u2019s community to be offensive, unwise, disagreeable, conservative, liberal, traditional, or radical.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Kentucky law also bans \u201c[unreasonable] restrictions on the time, place, and manner of student speech that occurs in the outdoor areas of campus or is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d\nAs we explain:\nThe students\u2019 expressive conduct here is wholly protected by the First Amendment, does not constitute unlawful fighting words or harassment, and cannot be investigated or restricted on the basis that some may find it offensive. The First Amendment protects the display of the middle finger. (Indeed, the display of the middle finger is so plainly protected by the First Amendment that officials who penalize such expressive activity have been held personally liable for violating clearly established constitutional rights.\n(Citations omitted.)\n(Read more about the expressive qualities of middle fingers here.)\nWe also note that even \u201cmere\u201d investigations, without additional punishment, violate the First Amendment when \u201can official\u2019s act would chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment activities.\u201d\u00a0\nEven critics of the students\u2019 expression have recognized it is plainly protected. \n\u201cSorry. First Amendment, man.\u201d\nMark Harrington, president of the pro-life group Created Equal, told local media today that it was his group that the students were confronting \u2014 and that he flatly opposes UK investigating them.\n\u201cFree speech is a cornerstone of our republic, and we oppose universities investigating students for their free expression,\u201d Harrington told WTVQ. \u201c[T]he university can play a role in teaching students to have respectful dialogue with those they disagree with.\u201d\u00a0\nThe university\u2019s Twitter account responded to the video yesterday within roughly an hour, so we know they\u2019re ready to spring into action when a policy violation occurs. We\u2019ve given the university until close-of-business tomorrow to confirm that it will publicly rescind its investigation threat and take steps to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\nAnd if UK won\u2019t listen to FIRE, it should at least listen to its own students:\u00a0\n\u201cSorry.
