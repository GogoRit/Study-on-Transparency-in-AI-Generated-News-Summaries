Well, those days are looong gone. These days, the supermarket has practically half an aisle dedicated to all of the different nut butter options. But in this brave new world of nut butters, how\u2019s a girl to know which protein-packed staple to slather on her snack? Is there really a best nut butter?\u201cRanking nut butters is like ranking veggies,\u201d says dietitian Keri Glassman, RD. \u201cThey\u2019re all good!\u201d In addition to supporting weight loss (as long as you exercise portion control), nuts can also help you ward off diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, she says. Generally, nut butters provide a nice balance of healthy fats, protein, and fiber, as well as vitamins (like vitamin A, vitamin E, and B vitamins) and minerals (like  iron, zinc, magnesium, and potassium), Glassman says. Wondering about PB and sunflower seed butter? Butters made from seeds or legumes also offer legitimate benefits. (Just keep that added sugar as low as possible, of course.)However, just as with veggies, certain nut (or seed or legume) butters might be better suited to your personal nutritional needs and fitness goals. That's why I asked dietitians to rank the best nut butters in order of their nutritional one-two punch. Consider your next stroll through the grocery store as smooth as Skippy.  1. Almond ButterFrom a nutritional perspective, almond butter just barely edges out your old pal PB. \u201cAlmond butter is the highest in healthy fats, with about three grams more of heart-healthy monounsaturated fat per serving compared to peanut butter,\" says Glassman. (It's also slightly higher in nutrients like the antioxidant vitamin E.)Find out how almonds can help you lose weight:\u200b\u200bAlmond butter is perfect slathered onto apple slices or celery and, thanks to its combo of protein, fiber, and healthy fats, makes an ideal post-workout snack.However, since almond butter is significantly more expensive than peanut butter (and almonds require a lot of water to produce), feel free to mix up your nut butter game, Glassman says. Per serving (2 tbsp): 196 calories, 17.8 g fat, 6 g carbs, 3.3 g fiber, 2 g sugar, 73 mg sodium, 7 g protein2. Peanut ButterThere\u2019s a reason this OG stands strong. Though not as high in healthy fats and vitamin E as almond butter, peanut butter is higher in protein, says Glassman. It\u2019s also got ample amounts of iron and folate to help prevent anemia, potassium for your muscles, magnesium for your bones and to help you sleep, and vitamin B6 and zinc for your immune system, she says.Being around a long time also gives peanut butter the advantage of being the most-studied, and research has shown that eating peanut butter regularly can help decrease your risk of heart disease and diabetes. Another perk: good ol' PB is cheap. Per serving (2 tbsp): 191 calories, 16.4 g fat, 7.1 g carbs, 1.6 g fiber, 3.4 g sugar, 136 mg sodium, 7.1 g protein3. Pistachio Buttersubjug//Getty Images Of all of the new nut butter options out there, pistachio butter is definitely one worth checking out\u2014especially if you\u2019re looking to up your protein intake.\u201cProtein is important since it helps build and repair muscle, and aids in mealtime satiety,\u201d says Keri Gans, RD, dietitian and author of The Small Change Diet.Related Story20 Vegan Protein Bars Dietitians LovePistachio butter is also \u201cloaded with B vitamins that can help you turn calories into energy,\u201d adds Scott Keatley, RD, dietitian and founder of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy.It also just tastes really, really good. \u201cIt may be the tastiest of the nut butters, if you were to ask me,\u201d Keatley says.Per serving (2 tbsp): 180 calories, 13 g fat,  9 g carbs, 3 g fiber, 2 g sugar, 0 mg sodium, 6 g protein4. Walnut Butter serezniy//Getty ImagesIn addition to a solid serving of protein, walnut butter also offers alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the omega-3 fatty acid found in plants. According to Keatley, ALA can help lower your risk of heart disease, lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, and reverse hardening of your blood vessels, so there\u2019s that.  Walnut butter also offers nut butters' usual heart-boosting properties. \u201cIt also provides heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and vitamin E, which both have anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d Gans says. Per serving (2 tbsp): 170 calories, 14 g fat, 11 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 7 g sugar, 0 mg sodium, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein5. Sunflower Seed Butter (a.k.a. SunButter)Up to 1.5 percent of Americans are allergic to peanuts and tree nuts (a number that has tripled since the 1990s), so alternative spreads for bananas and toast are a must these days. \u201cSunflower seed butter is an excellent choice for anyone with a nut allergy or sensitivity,\u201d Glassman says. Sunflower seed butter is also high in vitamins E and A, which are awesome for glowing skin and bright eyes, she adds. Plus, it boasts more magnesium per serving than any other butter on the list, making it a powerful inflammation regulator and beauty-sleep supporter. However, SunButter is higher in calories and slightly lower in protein than the other spreads on this list, so don't go overboard when eating it.Per serving (2 tbsp): 197 calories, 17.7 g fat, 7.5 g carbs, 8 g fiber, 3.4 g sugar, 106 mg sodium,  5.5 g protein 6. Hazelnut ButterMariia Kozub//Getty Images\"For those with a peanut allergy, hazelnut butter can also be a good alternative,\u201d says Gans. Hazelnut butter is rich in oleic acid, a form of monounsaturated fat that may help lower your risk risk of heart disease and stroke.This unusual pick is also completely free of natural sugars and is another great source of vitamin E, Keatley adds. Just make sure you\u2019re reaching for true hazelnut butter\u2014not chocolate hazelnut spread. (Let's be real, Nutella is much more chocolate and sugar than actual hazelnuts.)Per serving (2 tbsp): 160 calories, 14 g fat, 8 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 0 g sugar, 0 mg sodium, 5 g protein7. TahiniNikiLitov//Getty ImagesMade from sesame seeds, tahini is technically a seed butter\u2014and it\u2019s become a more and more popular pick in recent years. Like many other butters on this list, tahini is a good source of the antioxidant vitamin E, Gans says. Related StoryThe 13 Best Non-Dairy MilksPlus, according to Keatley, tahini contains \u201ca ton\u201d of copper, which helps play a role in making red blood cells. (If you really want to get the most out of tahini's copper, though, don't eat it with high-zinc foods\u2014like meat or shellfish\u2014since zinc and copper compete for absorption in the body.)   Per serving (2 tbsp): 70 calories, 6 g fat, 3 g carbs, 0 g fiber, 0 g sugar, 140 mg sodium, 2 g protein8. Cashew Butter\u201cCashew butter is naturally sweeter than many other nut butters,\u201d says Glassman. If you\u2019re working on lowering your added sugar intake without sacrificing your sweet tooth, it's a good choice. Thing is, it's also lower in protein than most other nut, seed, and legume butters, she says. (Cashews are technically legumes.) Plus, cashew butter is typically on the pricier side, so consider it an occasional sweet treat instead of your go-to for smoothies, cooking, or protein-packed snacks.  Per serving (2 tbsp): 195 calories, 17 g fat, 9.7 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 3 g sugar, 94 mg sodium, 3.9 g protein9. Coconut ButterMartyna87//Getty ImagesOkay, coconut butter is technically a fruit butter\u2014but still totally counts. \u201cCompared to other butters, coconut butter is one of the highest in fiber,\u201d Gans says. (As you probably know by now, fiber is important for healthy blood sugar, a healthy heart, and a smoothly-running digestive tract.Coconut butter also provides some protein, potassium, magnesium, and iron, Keatley says. It is, however, high in saturated fats, which may or may not be so great for you. (The jury is still out there.) While you many not want to dive into coconut butter as often as almond or peanut butter, it still can be part of a healthy, balance diet. \u201cJust go easy with your serving sizes,\u201d Keatley says.
