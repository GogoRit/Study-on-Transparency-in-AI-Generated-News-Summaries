These include laws that limit women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights, criminalize people for their gender identity or sexual orientation, or for transmitting HIV.\nUNAIDS has outlined several societal changes that need to take place, to end discrimination and help in the fight against AIDS.\nThese include ensuring equal participation of women in political life, upholding human rights for women, and guaranteeing them economic justice, which involves ending the ongoing gender pay gap.\nViolence against women must end, and laws that protect women from violence must be put in place and respected, with policies to support and protect survivors of violence.\n\n\n\nIn the center of Chad, 19-year-old Achta holds up condoms during an HIV awareness-raising session in her Moussoro community. (March 2019), by \u00a9 UNICEF/Frank Dejong\nHealth care must be available, without any stigma, discrimination or barriers, and care for women must respect their autonomy, with guaranteed sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nAny age of consent for health services should be lifted, and married women should not need the permission of their spouse to access care.\nUNAIDS also calls for free education for all, and an end to the large gender gap which still exists in access to education, and a response to climate change that takes into account the fact that women are disproportionately affected, and are particularly vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence during climate-related emergencies.\nThis is personal\nMs. Byanyima, who has lost family members to AIDS, said that it can only be beaten if the international community takes on social and economic injustices faced by women and girls, and spurs scientific innovation to help those living with the disease.\n\u201cBoth my own family experience, and our collective experience at the United Nations, have highlighted the same key lesson: the struggle to beat AIDS is inseparable from the struggle for women\u2019s rights and from the struggle against all forms of discrimination\u201d.\nAIDS is the biggest killer of women aged 15-49. For UNAIDS, gender-based violence, inequality and insecurity must end, and women and girls must have equal access to education, health and employment, if AIDS is to be beaten by 2030.\nIn addition, society must be transformed so that there are no second-class citizens, and everyone\u2019s human rights are respected, said the UNAIDS chief.\n\u201cAIDS cannot be beaten while marginalized communities (such as the LGBTQI community, people who inject drugs and sex workers) live in fear of the state or of socially sanctioned violence and abuse\u201d, said Ms. Byanyima. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero Discrimination DayUNAIDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nRepealing laws targeting people living with HIV/AIDS saves lives\n\n\nLaws must protect, \u2018not reject\u2019 says UNAIDS chief on Zero Discrimination Day\n\n\nWomen and girls still vulnerable to HIV due to gender inequality: UNAIDS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
