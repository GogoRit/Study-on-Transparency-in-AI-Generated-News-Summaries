An event at the start of the new school year to showcase the university\u2019s many clubs and opportunities for students to engage in turned into slurs, harassment, and stolen pro-life literature. \u00a0\n\n\n\nMeekins\u2019 reported:\u00a0\u00a0\nYesterday, while my club was tabling, we had an individual approach us who said he was going to block our table because, \u201cOur club is stupid, and no one should be able to see our display.\u201d\u00a0\nNaturally, I let him know that we have a right to be on campus just as much as any other club. He then began accusing us and falsely stated, \u201cYou took rights away from women, so I don\u2019t care about your right to freedom of speech.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClearly upset about the Dobbs ruling that rightfully restored the issue of abortion to the states, the student began to badger me about recent abortion news until we told him he would have to leave if he didn\u2019t want to have respectful dialogue.\u00a0\nHard conversations come with being a pro-life activist, we have them all the time, but when individuals become hostile and disrespectful, we don\u2019t engage. After being asked to leave, the student proceeded to take all our informational cards on the table and walk away with them.\u00a0\nThese cards let people know about life-affirming resources and are oftentimes the very piece of information that gets into the hands of a pregnant woman who didn\u2019t know about all the choices the pro-life movement offers that she won\u2019t find at an abortion vendor.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of my club members and I began filming and caught him throwing all our cards in a garbage can, but luckily, we were able to retrieve them undamaged. To protect ourselves on campus, we wear body cameras to record incidents such as this.\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life of America (SFLA) Regional Coordinator, Gavin Oxley, followed the man to retrieve the cards and engaged in a conversation with him about what had just happened while a police officer stood nearby.\u00a0\nThe officer assured the pro-abortion man that our rights were considered protected free speech, despite the pro-abortion student\u2019s behavior. The pro-abortion vandal came back to our table not even 10 minutes later and began to harass our club more.\u00a0\nHe insulted several members of my organization, calling us Nazis and white supremacists, while attempting to grab and block our body cameras. While the student eventually left, we will be taking extra measures to protect our club members throughout the rest of the school year.\u00a0\n\n\n(CLICK HERE to read about a recent attack against a pro-life doorknocker.)\u00a0\u00a0\nThe pro-life movement is about peace and civil discourse. While it\u2019s clear those in favor of abortion also support harassment, silencing protected speech, and other first amendment violations, we will continue to speak up about the abortion lobby\u2019s attempt to destroy our culture by harming women and children.\u00a0\nOur work is clearly cut out for us this semester, but we won\u2019t be silenced \u2013 too many preborn babies count on us.\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: The Bill for Free Speech? $25,000\u2026And Counting\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,288\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
