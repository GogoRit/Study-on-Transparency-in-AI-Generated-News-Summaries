Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Respect New Mexico Women and Families Act into law, after years of efforts by abortion rights supporters. SB 10 repeals the 1969 statute that criminalized abortion by banning it with very few exceptions.\u00a0 Lujan Grisham said \u201ca woman has the [\u2026]\nSusan Dunlap  \nCalled historic, New Mexico decriminalized abortion on Friday when Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Respect New Mexico Women and Families Act into law, after years of efforts by abortion rights supporters.\nSB 10 repeals the 1969 statute that criminalized abortion by banning it with very few exceptions.\u00a0\nLujan Grisham said \u201ca woman has the right to make decisions about her own body.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone who seeks to violate bodily integrity, or to criminalize womanhood, is in the business of dehumanization,\u201d Lujan Grisham said in a statement. \u201cNew Mexico is not in that business \u2013 not any more. Our state statutes now reflect this inviolable recognition of humanity and dignity. I am incredibly grateful to the tireless advocates and legislators who fought through relentless misinformation and fear-mongering to make this day a reality. Equality for all, equal justice and equal treatment \u2013 that\u2019s the standard. And I\u2019m proud to lead a state that today moved one step closer to that standard.\u201d\nMany in the reproduction rights community said the passage of this law is long overdue and that it is a historic moment. Adriann Barboa, field director for the nonprofit Forward Together/Strong Families New Mexico, called New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado the progressive belt for abortion care.\n\u201cNow we can move forward with the real reproductive needs of our communities and break away from the shame and stigma that impacts people\u2019s everyday reproductive healthcare,\u201d Barboa said.\nProviding an abortion was a fourth-degree felony under the previous law.\nRepealing the law should have been done in the 1975 legislature, House Rep. Moe Maestas, D-Albuquerque, said during the House of Representatives debate last week. Once the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, the New Mexico law became unconstitutional, he said.\nRelated: Historic abortion ban repeal one signature away from becoming law after it passes House\nBut, though unenforceable, the law remained on the books for decades. Barboa, said the reproductive rights community has been working on a bill to decriminalize abortion and repeal the 1969 statute since 2017.\nIn 2019 the bill stalled in the state Senate when eight conservative Democrats voted, along with Republicans, against a largely identical bill. One of those state Senators later died while in office. Of the seven that ran for reelection in 2020, five lost their primary bid to progressive candidates who ran on abortion care and other progressive policies. Three of those progressives went on to win the general election. Democrats also picked up three seats in the Albuquerque area in 2020 that had previously been held by Republicans.\nRelated: State Senate shifts left with progressive wins\nThis provided enough votes for the bill to pass in the state Senate during this legislative session. Only two Democrats, state Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz of Gallup and Sen. Pete Campos of Las Vegas opposed it. All Republicans voted against it.\nSB 10 then went to the House of Representatives, where it passed on a 40 to 30 vote. Six House Democrats voted against it and all Republicans did. Rep. Phelps Anderson, of Roswell, changed his affiliation from Republican to Decline to State after criticism of his vote on the issue in the committee process and voted in favor.\nThe only difference between SB 10 and the 2019 bill is that the Senate Judiciary Committee amended the bill in 2019 to preserve the section of the statute that said doctors could refuse to provide a medically necessary abortion.\nReproductive rights experts have said that no part of the statute should remain in the criminal code and that there are ample protections for medical workers who refuse to provide abortion due to personal conviction. Rep. Daniel Ivey-Soto, D-Albuquerque, said during the Senate Judiciary Committee for SB 10 that he amended the 2019 bill in an effort to compromise but that he would not offer an amendment to SB10.\nSenate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said during the Senate floor debate earlier this month that amending the bill to keep the criminal statute that would allow providers to refuse a medically necessary abortion did not help the bill to pass in 2019 and that the issue has been \u201cfront and center\u201d ever since.\nRelated: In historic turn, state Senate passes abortion ban repeal\nAlthough one Republican argument during the bill debate was that medical workers would leave the state or leave their profession if the bill passed, nothing changes now that the bill has become law. Barboa said the passage of the bill does not change abortion care but \u201cit allows that we don\u2019t have that unending threat and that we have some of the greatest access.\u201d\n\u201cWe can lift up abortion funds without worry,\u201d Barboa said.\nThe main impetus for passing the law at this juncture is the threat that Roe v. Wade could be overturned after the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The 6-3 conservative bloc on the Supreme Court puts the landmark decision that legalized abortion in 1973 in jeopardy.\nThe passage of the bill has other intrinsic, positive effects, according to advocates. Krystal Curley, who is Din\u00e9 (a member of the Navajo Nation) and director of Indigenous Life Ways and a legislative fellow with Forward Together, said bodily autonomy \u201cis something that is sacred\u201d for her community.\nShe said colonization took away Indigenous people\u2019s bodily autonomy through assimilation policies intended to eradicate Native Americans through forced child separation into boarding schools that began as early as the 1800s, a policy that continued well into the twentieth century. The U.S. government also forced sterilization on Native American women.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an historic bill that finally gives us the chance to have that bodily autonomy. For us, we\u2019ve always had that choice in the natural world to have an abortion. For ourselves and our daughters and for the generations to come, it\u2019s a very monumental, historic moment,\u201d Curley said.\nCurley, who gave public testimony during committee hearings, said it was \u201can honor and a blessing to dispel all these myths about Indigenous people.\u201d\n\u201cThey (anti-abortion legislators) have these stereotypes about us. Finally, we have a chance to tell our stories to be part of the decision-making power to push legislation through that is meaningful not just for Indigenous people but for all New Mexico women and pregnant people,\u201d Curley said.\nMarshall Martinez, executive director of Equality New Mexico, called passage of the Respect New Mexico Women and Families Act a \u201cculture shift\u201d and historic for the LGBTQ community.\nAbortion care is not just a \u201cwoman\u2019s\u201d issue, Martinez said.\n\u201cThe gentle reminder there is that transgender people can get pregnant and they need access to the full range of health care and that includes abortion. It\u2019s a good reminder to folks that the spectrum of gender is vast,\u201d Martinez said.\n\u00a0Martinez said that \u201cat the heart of this bill\u201d is bodily autonomy, which makes a bill about decriminalizing abortion an LGBTQ issue.\n\u201cThe fight is always centered on \u2018we know who we are, we should be treated with respect and dignity and we should have the autonomy to make decisions,\u2019\u201d Martinez said.\nHe said the passage of SB 10 into law also gives him hope.\n\u201cIt opens the door for better LGBTQ policies in the long term because we have taken one really big step to really respect autonomy in policy,\u201d Martinez said.\nState Sen. Linda Lopez, D-Albuquerque, who was the lead sponsor on SB 10, said through a statement that \u201cthe time has finally come to get this outdated abortion law off the books.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion is a personal healthcare decision. We can hold our own moral values on abortion and still trust individuals to make their own reproductive health care decisions,\u201d Lopez wrote.\nFor Socorro Linden, whose mother had an abortion in the 1970s after having had ten children, telling her mother\u2019s story during public testimony was important because she would like to see the shame and stigma end, she said. Linden\u2019s mother suffered complications because of the poor care she received.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to convey with her story, there are many situations. Every individual has a very unique decision they have to make for themselves,\u201d Linden said.\n We're ad freeThat means that we rely on support from readers like you.
