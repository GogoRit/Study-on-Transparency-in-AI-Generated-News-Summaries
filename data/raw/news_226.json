Russo effectively upholds a case from just four years ago. In 2016, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, a 5-3 majority struck down portions of a controversial Texas law, including not only the admitting privileges requirement but also a requirement for abortion clinics to meet the same standards as surgical centers that perform more advanced procedures.\nThe deciding vote was cast by Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted in the past case to uphold the Texas law.

Justices had numerous questions about how doctors at each of the clinics tried and failed to obtain the required privileges. That was not because the doctors were not qualified, but because most hospitals do not extend privileges to doctors who do not admit patients, and outpatient abortions rarely result in hospital admissions.\n\u201cTo say we\u2019re elated doesn\u2019t even come close to saying what we\u2019re feeling,\u201d said Kathaleen Pittman, administrator of Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, one of the clinics in the case. \u201cToday\u2019s win allows all three clinics to remain open to continue to provide care.\u201d\nThe decision is likely to touch off a major backlash by conservatives who had hoped to see progress rolling back abortion rights since Anthony Kennedy \u2014 who often sided with the court\u2019s liberals to uphold abortion rights \u2014 retired and was replaced by Brett Kavanaugh.\nConservative and anti-abortion groups wasted no time venting their fury, particularly at Roberts. \u201cToday, the Supreme Court betrayed the rule of law and the dignity of the bench,\u201d said a statement from Heritage Action for America. \u201cThis is the latest in a series of judicial power grabs from the Chief Justice and the liberal wing of the court.\u201d\nReactions also signaled that abortion is likely to be a galvanizing issue in the fall presidential and congressional campaigns.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health legislation, 15 states either already have admitting privileges laws on the books, or would have been likely to enact them because they have anti-abortion governors and legislative majorities.\nStill, abortion rights at the high court are far from secured.
