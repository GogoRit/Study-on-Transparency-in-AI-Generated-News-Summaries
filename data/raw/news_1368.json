The Mayday Health organization ran the ads in Moscow after the university released a memo to staff and employees reminding them of an Idaho law that UI says prohibits state employees from promoting birth control and abortion to prevent pregnancy. (Courtesy of Mayday Health)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal law prohibiting sex discrimination also bars colleges and universities from denying counseling and other services to abortion patients and contraception to all students \u2014 even in states where abortion is now severely restricted, the U.S. Education Department said Tuesday.\u00a0\nThe guidance, which clarifies the longstanding rules for federal Title IX funding that virtually all colleges and universities receive, comes as several states have moved to ban or greatly limit abortion. The federal insistence on compliance with the Title IX regulations appears to be in conflict with some state policies.\nThe University of Idaho, for example, issued a memo last month telling its employees not to provide reproductive health counseling or contraception to students to comply with a state law.\u00a0\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris singled out the University of Idaho during a public meeting of the White House Reproductive Rights Task Force on Tuesday.\u00a0\n\u201cThey told university staff they could get in trouble just for talking or telling students about birth control,\u201d Biden said, referencing the memo. \u201cFolks, what century are we in?\u201d\nIdaho is among the 13 states where nearly all abortions are illegal following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June that removed the nationwide right to an abortion, according to the reproductive rights policy research organization Guttmacher Institute.\u00a0\nThe Idaho Supreme Court convenes on Thursday to hear oral arguments on the merits of three Idaho abortion laws.\nThe federal high court ruling \u201chas sown fear and confusion on our college campuses,\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said at the task force meeting.\u00a0\nTuesday\u2019s guidance was intended \u201cto remind schools of their obligations under Title IX,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nThe department\u2019s civil rights office determined in June that a Utah community college violated Title IX by not making accommodations for a pregnant student and encouraging the student to drop a course because she was pregnant.\nThe University of Idaho memo said university employees could not provide patients with birth control or emergency contraception. The document referenced a 2021 law that bans public funding to \u201cprocure, counsel in favor, refer to or perform an abortion.\u201d\nStandard birth control can still be dispensed at student health facilities, whose workers are not employed by the university, according to the memo.\nA spokeswoman for the university did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the Education Department guidance and Biden and Harris\u2019 remarks.\nAbortion bans have affected other health services, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday. Women have been denied prescriptions to treat miscarriage or conditions like arthritis and there are \u201cthreats to contraception,\u201d including for college students, Jean-Pierre said.\u00a0\nHarris noted that 19th-century laws banning abortion in Arizona and Wisconsin have recently gone into effect.\n Doctors testify before White House task force\n\nThe White House task force outlined some dire consequences of state abortion bans.\nIn Wisconsin, the abortion ban is sending some patients to Minnesota and Illinois and leaving many who need care without access, Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a Green Bay OB-GYN, said.\nAnd it\u2019s had a chilling effect on abortion providers, who can now only perform an abortion when the mother\u2019s life is at risk. But even the judgment required in that decision could scare doctors from performing a medically necessary procedure, she said.\n\u201cPregnant people don\u2019t have a warning light that comes on when they\u2019ve crossed that threshold,\u201d she said. \u201cIn places like Sheboygan County, where the district attorney has specifically said that he will prosecute physicians, can I count on him to trust my clinical judgment?\u201d\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nGeorgia OB-GYN Dr. Nisha Verma told the task force that she\u2019s had to turn away patients with high-risk pregnancies or fetal abnormalities since that state\u2019s six-week ban went into effect.\n\u201cImagine looking someone in the eye and saying, \u2018I have all the skills and the tools to help you. But our state\u2019s politicians have told me I can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0\n Biden, Harris urge Congress to pass law codifying right to abortion\n\nBiden, Harris and Jean-Pierre all urged Congress to pass a law codifying a nationwide right to abortion.\n\u201cIf there were a national law that was passed in the United States Congress to protect reproductive care, so-called (state) leaders could not ban abortion,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey could not criminalize providers. They could not limit access to contraception.\u201d\nBiden added that congressional Republicans would seek a nationwide abortion ban, alluding to South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s bill introduced last month to enact such a ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\u2018What century are we in?\u2019 Biden asks of University of Idaho ban on abortion counseling\nby Jacob Fischler, Idaho Capital Sun October 4, 2022\n\u2018What century are we in?\u2019 Biden asks of University of Idaho ban on abortion counseling\nby Jacob Fischler, Idaho Capital Sun October 4, 2022\n \nThe federal law prohibiting sex discrimination also bars colleges and universities from denying counseling and other services to abortion patients and contraception to all students \u2014 even in states where abortion is now severely restricted, the U.S. Education Department said Tuesday.\u00a0\nThe guidance, which clarifies the longstanding rules for federal Title IX funding that virtually all colleges and universities receive, comes as several states have moved to ban or greatly limit abortion.
