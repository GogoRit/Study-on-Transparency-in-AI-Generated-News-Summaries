For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children. As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden in Public Law 117-103,\u201d the senators write.The letter continues, \u201cOn February 5, 2021, we wrote to you that \u2018[w]e are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.\u2019 We firmly renew this commitment for FY 2023.\u201d\u201cWe urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in Public Law 117-103, and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry,\u201d the letter concludes.Read the full letter here.This letter is endorsed by Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, March for Life, Catholic Vote, National Right to Life, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, and Alliance Defending Freedom.Senators James Lankford (R-OK), John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Richard Burr (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), James Inhofe (R-OK), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Kennedy (R-LA), Mike Lee (R-UT), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Rob Portman (R-OH), James Risch (R-ID), Michael Rounds (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN) signed on to the letter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPrevious \n\nNextNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter \n\n\n\nPlease complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney\u2019s email newsletter. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Name\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast Name\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Mitt \n\n\n\n\nBiography\nCommittee Assignments\nLegislation\nOfficial Photo\n \n\nBiography\nCommittee Assignments\nLegislation\nOfficial Photo\n \n\n\n\n\nServices \n\n\n\n\nAcademy Nominations\nFlag Requests\nHelp with a Federal Agency\nScheduling Requests\nVeterans\u2019 Resources\nFinancial Aid\nGrant Requests\nInternships\nVisiting Washington, DC\n \n\nAcademy Nominations\nFlag Requests\nHelp with a Federal Agency\nScheduling Requests\nVeterans\u2019 Resources\nFinancial Aid\nGrant Requests\nInternships\nVisiting Washington, DC\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues \n\n\n\n\nAgriculture\nBudget & Debt\nClean Air, Energy & Water\nDrought & Wildfires\nEducation\nImmigration\nForeign Policy & National Security\nHealth Care\nInfrastructure\nLife, Family & Religion\nPublic Lands\nRural Utah\nSecond Amendment\nTaxes\nTrade\nWorking Families\n \n\nAgriculture\nBudget & Debt\nClean Air, Energy & Water\nDrought & Wildfires\nEducation\nImmigration\nForeign Policy & National Security\nHealth Care\nInfrastructure\nLife, Family & Religion\nPublic Lands\nRural Utah\nSecond Amendment\nTaxes\nTrade\nWorking Families\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\nOp-Eds\nSpeeches\nNewsletters\n \n\nPress Releases\nOp-Eds\nSpeeches\nNewsletters\n \n\n\n\n\nContact \n\n\n\n\nContact Senator Romney\nOffice Locations\n \n\nContact Senator Romney\nOffice Locations\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\nAccessibility\nPrivacy\nCopyright\n \n\nTools\nAccessibility\nPrivacy\nCopyright\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
