Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTed Cruz has unwittingly made himself pro-choice by expressing his outrage over Alabama's vasectomy bill. The Texas senator shared his thoughts about the new bill in a tweet on Saturday, writing: \"Yikes. A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything...literally! Alabama Democrat proposes bill mandating all men have vasectomy at age 50 or after third child.\" While Mr Cruz was attempting to criticise the invasive new bill, introduced by Alabama Democratic representative Rolanda Hollis last week, he instead played into what pro-choice advocates have been arguing for years. Introducing the bill was a long shot by Ms Hollis, but her main priority was to demonstrate the \"outrageous overstep in authority\" exhibited by Republicans who want to legislate the female body. She did this by creating her own legislative overstep targeting the male body. \"Year after year the majority party continues to introduce new legislation that tries to dictate a woman's body and her reproductive rights,\" Ms Hollis said. \"We should view this as the same outrageous overstep in authority.\"       Protests across US after abortion laws enforced      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 20show all       Protests across US after abortion laws enforced   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       1/20Missouri\u00a0 AFP/Getty    2/20Alabama\u00a0 Getty    3/20New York\u00a0 AFP/Getty    4/20Georgia\u00a0 Getty    5/20Atlanta\u00a0 Getty    6/20Alabama\u00a0 AFP/Getty    7/20Missouri\u00a0 Getty    8/20Alabama\u00a0 AFP/Getty    9/20Georgia\u00a0 Getty    10/20Georgia\u00a0 Getty    11/20Missouri\u00a0 AFP/Getty    12/20Washington, DC\u00a0 Getty    13/20Louisiana\u00a0 AFP/Getty    14/20Louisiana\u00a0 AFP/Getty    15/20Missouri\u00a0 AFP/Getty    16/20Missouri\u00a0 AFP/Getty    17/20Missouri\u00a0 AFP/Getty    18/20Washington, DC\u00a0 AFP/Getty    19/20Georgia\u00a0 Getty    20/20Alabama\u00a0 AFP/Getty   \u00a0     \u00a0 She said the vasectomy bill was also created to \"neutralise\" the abortion bill passed last year in Alabama. \"Men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies,\" Ms Hollis said. Besides wanting women to have autonomy in their reproductive choices, Ms Hollis was also concerned about the amount of money Alabama taxpayers were forced to pay organisations like the ACLU to fight abortion bills.

Commenters noticed his tweet only helped to push the pro-choice narrative. \"Wow how awful that the government is trying to interfere with bodily autonomy! What's that feel like?\" wrote one commenter questioning the politician's tweet. Another wrote: \"A bill involving a medical procedure which only applies to one gender? Governmental overreach!\"Alabama's abortion bill was passed by state legislators last year and involved a near total ban of the reproductive procedure. Doctors could face up to 99 years in prison if they perform the procedure on a woman at any stage of her pregnancy. Two weeks before the bill was intended to take effect, it was stopped by a federal judge. But the restrictive bill comes at another attempt by the pro-life movement to challenge Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v Wade ruling \u2014 the landmark court decision giving pregnant women the choice to an abortion. With a conservative majority sitting on the Supreme Court, the pro-life movement believes it has a shot to overturn the decades-old ruling.
