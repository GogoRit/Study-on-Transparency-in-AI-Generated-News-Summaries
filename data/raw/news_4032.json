This follows a record year for abortion legislation, including prohibitive state abortion bans which were all blocked by federal judges.\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood announced Thursday that it will spend $45 million to support presidential, congressional and state-level candidates in the 2020 elections who support abortion rights. The next day, anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List launched a $52 million effort to support Donald Trump\u2019s reelection bid and select Senate candidates. The multi-million dollar amounts are the largest election spending for each organization respectively.\n\nPlanned Parenthood said that the money from the \u201cWe Decide 2020\u201d campaign will fund grassroots programs and canvassing, digital, television and radio and mail programs. It will focus on nine battleground states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The \u201cWe Decide 2020\u201d site provides information on each presidential candidate\u2019s views on reproductive health as well as the views of candidates in key races across the country. It also includes a full list of endorsements for congressional races.\u00a0\n\n\nSusan B. Anthony List and its partner political action committee Women Speak Out\u2019s \u201c2020 Campaign\u201d will use the money to canvass in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Similarly, the funding will support voter contact mail, phone calls and digital ads. In a statement, Susan B. Anthony List said that it has already visited 460,000 homes across battleground states throughout this election cycle and that it plans to make 4 million visits to voters before Election Day.\n\n\u201cFor years, politicians have worked to undermine our rights and our access to health care: stacking the federal courts, passing unconstitutional legislation, spreading deceptions, imposing arbitrary restrictions, and waging one legal battle after another,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in the \u201cWe Decide 2020\u201d site. \u201cBut in 2018 and 2019, voters elected reproductive health champions, and rejected false and debunked attacks from anti-abortion politicians \u2014 and in 2020, we\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\nMORE FOR YOU 300 Billion Crypto Price Crash Suddenly Accelerates As Bitcoin  Ethereum And XRP Traders Brace For A Fed ShockApple\u2019s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like SamsungNew Gmail Security Rules You Have 14 Days To Comply  Google Says\n\u201cThe stakes of this election could not be higher,\u201d Susan B. Anthony List spokesperson Mallory Quigley said in a statement. \u201cOur focused, battle-tested voter outreach method will ensure we reach the voters who can provide President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates the winning margin on Election Day.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers introduced more than 300 anti-abortion laws last year, according to data from the research organization Guttmacher Institute, a record number. By the end of the year, 25 abortion bans in 12 states were enacted, but all have been blocked by federal judges. Some of the legislation does not ban abortion completely, it creates limitations based on the duration of the pregnancy or reason for seeking an abortion or bans certain methods.\n\n\nIn response, state legislatures, primarily in the Northwest and West, introduced legislation that protects reproductive healthcare. As of December 2019, 36 measures to protect abortion, 13 to increase access to contraceptive coverage and 17 to improve sex education were enacted, according to the data. Additionally, governors in five states vetoed abortion restrictions. More abortion protections were enacted in 2019 than in the entire previous decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the significant funding from each organization indicates, the 2020 presidential, congressional and state-level election decisions will make an impact on nation-wide abortion legislation.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0some of my other work\u00a0here.\u00a0Elana Lyn GrossEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
