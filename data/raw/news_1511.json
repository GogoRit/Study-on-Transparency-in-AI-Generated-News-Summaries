State of Texas in Austin on July 19.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Joe Timmerman/The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\n\nA Texas judge on Friday issued a temporary exemption to the state\u2019s abortion ban that would allow women with complicated pregnancies to obtain the procedure and keep doctors free from prosecution if they determined the fetus would not survive after birth.\nBut hours later, the attorney general\u2019s office filed an appeal with the Texas Supreme Court, blocking the judge\u2019s order from taking effect.\nState District Court Judge Jessica Mangrum of Austin wrote that the attorney general cannot prosecute doctors who, in their \u201cgood faith judgment,\u201d terminate a complicated pregnancy. Mangrum outlined those conditions as a pregnancy that presents a risk of infection; a fetal condition in which the fetus will not survive after birth; or when the pregnant person has a condition that requires regular, invasive treatment.\nLast month, the court heard from three women who testified against Texas\u2019 abortion ban, describing how delayed medical care impacted their pregnancies. The women are suing the state over the law, seeking to clarify when a medical emergency justifies an abortion. Currently, the law allows termination of a pregnancy if the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her ruling, Mangrum wrote that Senate Bill 8, the law restricting abortion access, was unconstitutional. She said that enforcement of the abortion ban was beyond the legal powers of Texas officials tasked with prosecuting physicians under this law.\nIn a statement celebrating the injunction, the legal group representing the plaintiffs, the Center for Reproductive Rights, said that the ruling gives clarity to doctors as to when they can provide abortions, allowing them to use their own medical judgment.\n\u201cNow people don\u2019t have to be pregnant and scared in Texas anymore. We\u2019re back to relying on doctors and not politicians to help us make the best medical decisions for our bodies and our lives,\" Amanda Zurawski, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a statement Friday prior to learning of the state's appeal.\nBut her celebration of the judge\u2019s ruling was short-lived. In a statement late Friday, First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster said the office had appealed, calling the injunction \u201can activist Austin judge\u2019s attempt to override Texas abortion laws.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA trial to determine the issue, clarifying when a medical emergency justifies an abortion, has been scheduled for March 25.\n\nMore than 200 speakers are now confirmed for the 2023 Texas Tribune Festival in downtown Austin from Sept. 21-23. Each year, the Festival engages, challenges and surprises attendees with unexpected talent mashups, must-see interviews and more, curated by the award-winning journalists at The Texas Tribune. See the lineup and get tickets today.\n\n\nCorrection, Aug. 6, 2023 at 4:29 p.m.:\n\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the judge\u2019s injunction would remain in effect even if the state appealed the decision. The state\u2019s appeal to the Texas Supreme Court blocked the injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
