Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, and 13 other Texas House Republicans have laid out their legislative priorities in a letter to the Lyft CEO.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Jordan Vonderhaar for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nWith Texas poised to automatically ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, some Republicans are already setting their sights on the next target to fight the procedure: businesses that say they\u2019ll help employees get abortions outside the state.\nFourteen Republican members of the state House of Representatives have pledged to introduce bills in the coming legislative session that would bar corporations from doing business in Texas if they pay for abortions in states where the procedure is legal.\nThis would explicitly prevent firms from offering employees access to abortion-related care through health insurance benefits. It would also expose executives to criminal prosecution under pre-Roe anti-abortion laws the Legislature never repealed, the legislators say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir proposal highlights how the end of abortion would lead to a new phase in \u2014 not the end of \u2014 the fight in Texas over the procedure. The lawmakers pushing for the business rules have signaled that they plan to act aggressively in the next legislative session. But it remains to be seen if they\u2019ll be able to get a majority on their side.\nThe members, led by Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, laid out their plans in a letter to Lyft CEO Logan Green that became public on Wednesday.\nGreen drew the lawmakers\u2019 attention on April 29, when he said on Twitter that the ride-share company would help pregnant residents of Oklahoma and Texas seek abortion care in other states. Green also pledged to cover the legal costs of any Lyft driver sued under Senate Bill 8, the Texas law that empowers private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who assists in the procurement of an abortion.\n\u201cThe state of Texas will take swift and decisive action if you do not immediately rescind your recently announced policy to pay for the travel expenses of women who abort their unborn children,\u201d the letter states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter also lays out other legislative priorities, including allowing Texas shareholders of publicly traded companies to sue executives for paying for abortion care, as well as empowering district attorneys to prosecute abortion-related crimes outside of their home counties.\nSix of the 14 signers, including Cain, are members of the far-right Texas Freedom Caucus. How much political support these proposals have in the Republican caucus is unclear. House Speaker Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, declined to comment. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Gov. Greg Abbott did not respond.\nSince the legislative session is more than seven months away, Cain said in an email that \u201ca quickly drafted and sent letter can hardly be said to reflect the pulse of my Republican colleagues.\u201d He was confident, however, that his ideas would find some support in the Senate.\n\u201cKnowing that chamber and its leadership, I\u2019m willing to bet legislation targeting this issue will be promptly filed in January,\u201d Cain said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut doing so would likely mean targeting companies that the state has wooed as potential job creators. Tesla, for instance, announced this month that it would pay for employees\u2019 travel costs when they leave the state to get an abortion. Abbott celebrated the electric car company\u2019s move to Austin last year and this year urged its CEO, Elon Musk, to move Twitter\u2019s headquarters to Texas, too, if he completes his purchase of the social media firm.\nRepublican politicians have to tread much more carefully on abortion politics if Roe v. Wade falls, said Florida State University professor Mary Ziegler, who wrote a book on abortion law in the United States. Whereas in the past, lawmakers could pass any number of abortion restrictions that were bound to be struck down by courts, that backstop would no longer exist.\nZiegler said while a broad conservative coalition wants to ban abortions in Texas, there is disagreement over how aggressively to enforce related criminal laws or to attempt to prevent pregnant residents from leaving the state for the procedure. Republican politicians, therefore, have an incentive to remain quiet on the issue until they can determine which course of action is the most politically prudent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be a Republican anymore,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cBefore, everyone was like, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s get rid of Roe v. Wade.\u2019 Now, if you can do whatever you want, what is it that you want to do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyft did not respond to a request for comment. Several other large companies, including Amazon, Uber and Starbucks, have also said they would help employees or customers seek abortion care outside of Texas. None responded to requests for comment.\nConcerns from the business community helped derail a push by Republican lawmakers to enact the so-called bathroom bill in the 2017 session, which would have required people to use the facilities that corresponded with their sex assigned at or near birth. Moderate Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, rebuffed requests from Patrick to make the bill a priority.\nState Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, said that although Straus has since retired, she hoped a coalition of Democrats and centrist Republicans would form to block abortion-related laws that place new restrictions on businesses.\n\u201cThere were opportunities for business-minded Republicans and business-minded Democrats to come together and prevent these kinds of extreme policies,\u201d Howard said of Straus\u2019 tenure. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that will happen again. \u2026 We\u2019re at a pivotal point here of doing severe damage that\u2019s going to be hard to undo.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas Association of Businesses, Texas Chamber of Commerce Executives and Greater Houston Partnership either declined to comment or did not respond to questions about the abortion-restriction proposals in the Republicans\u2019 letter.\nDisclosure: The Greater Houston Partnership, Lyft and the Texas Association of Business have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
