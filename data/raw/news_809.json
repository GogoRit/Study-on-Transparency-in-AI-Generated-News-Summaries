But Berg Raunick, who is Jewish, said those views go against her beliefs. To her, a pregnant woman\u2019s health and life is paramount, and she disagreed with legislators\u2019 assertions that life begins at conception, calling that a \u201cChristian definition.\u201d\u201cThat is a religious and values-based comment,\u201d said Berg Raunick. \u201cA fetus is potential life, and that is worthy of great respect and is not to be taken lightly, but it does not supersede the life and health of the mother, period.\u201d\n\nArguments like this were central to an Indiana lawsuit filed in September against the state\u2019s abortion ban, which is on hold amid multiple legal challenges. On Dec. 2, a judge ruled the ban violates the state\u2019s religious freedom law, signed by then-Republican Gov. Mike Pence in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Gov.

But following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade in June, religious abortion-rights supporters are using these laws to protect access to abortion and defend their beliefs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson ruling left abortion rights up to the states. As a result, lower courts in at least five states, including Indiana, have issued rulings in abortion-related religious freedom lawsuits.There is a \u201chuge diversity of the kinds of claims being made\u201d in these cases, said Elizabeth Reiner Platt, who studies religion and abortion rights as director of Columbia University\u2019s Law, Rights and Religion Project. The religious freedom complaints are among 34 post-Roe lawsuits filed against 19 states\u2019 abortion bans, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nFor some, abortion access can be a way to exercise one\u2019s religion, Platt said. Other lawsuits challenge the bans under constitutional clauses that say the government is \u201cestablishing\u201d a religion, imposing a law on residents who do not share that belief.In the Indiana case, lawyers for five anonymous women \u2014 who are Jewish, Muslim and spiritual \u2014 and advocacy group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued the state\u2019s ban infringes on their beliefs. Their lawsuit specifically highlights the Jewish teaching that a fetus becomes a living person at birth and that Jewish law prioritizes the mother\u2019s life and health.The Indiana attorney general\u2019s office this month appealed a ruling siding with the women and asked the state Supreme Court to consider the case. In January, the Indiana justices are already scheduled to hear another abortion ban challenge on the grounds it violates the state constitution\u2019s individual rights protections.Meanwhile, in Kentucky, three Jewish women are arguing the state\u2019s ban violates their religious rights under the state\u2019s constitution and religious freedom law. They say in a lawsuit, which has been removed to federal court, that Kentucky\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature \u201cimposed sectarian theology\u201d by prohibiting nearly all abortions. The ban remains in effect while the Kentucky Supreme Court considers a separate case challenging the law.\n\nFor those wanting to end abortion bans, lawsuits arguing state governments are establishing a religion via the bans could be more effective than ones arguing for the free exercise of religion, said Elizabeth Sepper, a University of Texas at Austin law professor. The former would apply to more people, she said. \u201cIf an abortion ban violates either a state establishment clause or the federal establishment clause, then the entirety of the statute comes down,\u201d Sepper said.Some state lawsuits use both arguments, such as a case filed by Planned Parenthood that in July successfully blocked Utah\u2019s ban. The law is on hold pending a decision from its state Supreme Court. \n\nThat same month, a lawsuit partly based on Wyoming\u2019s religious-liberty clause blocked the state\u2019s abortion ban. The Wyoming high court said Dec. 21 it would not weigh in on the state\u2019s new abortion ban for now.Elsewhere, Florida religious leaders in June cited the state\u2019s religious rights law and state constitution\u2019s privacy protections in multiple lawsuits against their state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban. A request to hear an appeal of the ban, which remains in effect, rests before the Florida Supreme Court.Amid the legal machinations, abortion access remains a divisive issue among the nation\u2019s faithful. In June, clergy across the U.S. reflected that divide and its nuances as they rearranged worship plans to provide religious context \u2014 and competing messages \u2014 after Roe was overturned. \n\nAcross the U.S., few voters in religious groups say abortion should always be illegal, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the midterm electorate. But religious groups differ in their level of support for abortion. While Protestants in general are closely divided over whether abortion should generally be legal, most white evangelical Protestants \u2014 about 7 in 10 \u2014 say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Similarly, about 7 in 10 Mormon voters say abortion should be generally be illegal. By comparison, 6 in 10 Catholic voters, about 8 in 10 Jewish voters and close to 9 in 10 religious unaffiliated voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.An array of religious beliefs were on display during Indiana\u2019s summer legislative debate, which ultimately resulted in the state becoming the first in the U.S. to enact tighter abortion restrictions after Dobbs. The state law displeased both abortion-rights advocates, who say it goes too far, and anti-abortion activists, who said it didn\u2019t go far enough.State Rep. Ann Vermilion, who opposed the ban, condemned her fellow Republicans that called women \u201cmurderers\u201d for getting an abortion. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s promise is for grace and kindness,\u201d Vermilion said. \u201cHe would not be jumping to condemn these women.\u201dDr. Kay Eigenbrod, an Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist who attended Indiana Right to Life\u2019s \u201cLove them Both\u201d rally during the debate, said in a July interview that, because of her Catholic upbringing, she supports a complete abortion ban without exceptions.\u201cWomen just don\u2019t have to turn to abortion for any reason,\u201d she said. \u201cWe as a society just need to be better about supporting them both.\u201dMonths later, Berg Raunick, a member of Hoosier Jews for Choice but not involved in the lawsuit, hopes lawmakers will continue to value religious freedom. \u201cThat has to mean protecting all religions, not just Christianity, and not just the majority,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we sort of wait and see how how true that is.\u201d___AP writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.
