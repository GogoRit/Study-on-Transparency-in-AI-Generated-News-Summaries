Thousands gathered to defend life and show their support for Initiative 120, a ballot proposal that seeks to ban abortions after 22 weeks in Colorado. (Photo by Brandon Young)\nMarch 25 marked the 25th anniversary of St. John Paul II\u2019s papal encyclical, Evangelium Vitae, \u201cThe Gospel of Life,\u201d which promoted the sanctity of human life and addressed the issues of abortion, euthanasia and capital punishment. Recently, Lynn Grandon, director of the Archdiocese of Denver\u2019s Respect Life Office at Catholic Charities, spoke to the Denver Catholic about how the faithful can be defenders of life today.\nDenver Catholic: What impact has \u201cThe Gospel of Life\u201d had on the Church\u2019s efforts to uphold the sanctity of human life?\nGrandon: It\u2019s been a definitive document. St. John Paul II gave \u2026 practical examples in all areas of life on how to uphold that dignity. It\u2019s very clear, specific teaching that\u2019s helpful to everybody in every area of life.\nDC: How does your office promote the sanctity of human life?\nGrandon: We are the educational and resource arm of the archdiocese for all life issues, mainly centering on medicine and science. We\u2019ve also had to get a little more engaged in legislative processes happening in Colorado with different bills that have come forward challenging the sanctity of life. We work with the different parishes and their Respect Life leaders to educate them. Last year we created a 200-plus page manual on how parishes can implement respect for life throughout their parish with a committee charged to do that. Respect Life leaders were thrilled to have that guidance.\nDC: Other archdiocesan entities also defend the sanctity of life by aiding pregnant women, and women with children. Can you speak to those efforts? \nGrandon: When I first arrived here (from Illinois in 2011) I was charged by Archbishop Chaput with opening a pro-life pregnancy center directly across from Planned Parenthood\u2019s Rocky Mountain headquarters. That center evolved into two centers (now called Marisol Health), which led to Bella Natural Women\u2019s Care agreeing to be the medical providers for them. Then we linked up with Gabriel House (offers material supplies and social service referrals) and what is now known as Marisol Homes for the housing of women with unexpected pregnancies and single women with children. All of those medical and social service efforts are what we at Catholic Charities call our \u2018continuum of care\u2019 for women in need. We realized there\u2019s numerous levels of care for women in crisis, so we linked arms to do that effectively and it\u2019s working out beautifully.- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nDC: Besides supporting those organizations, what are some other concrete ways the faithful can defend the sanctity of human life?\nGrandon: First, become educated. That\u2019s where our office can help. We go into parishes at no cost and give substantial presentations on all those issues so people can dialogue effectively with friends, relatives, associates and neighbors. That\u2019s key. As children of God we have to understand this element of our faith.\nThey can get involved with the Respect Life Committee at their parish and be the hands and feet to build a vibrant culture of life in their parish.\nThey can participate in the public efforts we have: Prayer in the Square (rosary and Divine Mercy chaplet) is held every first Saturday of the month (visit prayerinthesquare.com for locations). Our two annual events are 40 Days for Life, where we pray outside abortion centers (Feb. 26-April 5, visit 40DaysForLife.com), and our Celebrate Life march and rally held in January at the Colorado Capitol. This year we had 8,000 people show up \u2014 it\u2019s grown every year. As believers we have to show Colorado that we are unafraid to stand for these issues.\nFinally, I would make a simple appeal to people to use their creativity. In the Old Testament the Hebrew midwives were told by their government officials to kill the Hebrew male children. They refused. They went to pharaoh and said, \u201cThese Hebrew women have their children before we can get to them!\u201d As sons and daughters of God we are the ones called to protect all human life. We have to be creative in our vocations, as the Hebrew midwives were, to transform the culture.\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinPinterestEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n\n\n\nPrevious article\u2018Better than planned\u2019: Newly-married couple Mr. & Mrs. Bradshaw on their COVID-19 weddingNext articleArchdiocese of Denver extends suspension of\u00a0public Masses\u00a0through May 8\u00a0\n\nRoxanne KingRoxanne King is the former editor of the Denver Catholic Register and a freelance writer in the Denver area.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\nJared Staudt  \n\nA Biblical Path for Lent: Brant Pitre\u2019s Introduction to the Spiritual Life\u00a0\n\n\nMarch 14, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic News Agency  \n\nPHOTOS | A timeline of Pope Francis\u2019 11 years as pope\n\n\nMarch 13, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic News Agency  \n\nMeet the young Catholic pilgrims who will walk thousands of miles with the Eucharist this summer\n\n\nMarch 13, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n \n\nFilm Review: Cabrini honors life and legacy of ironclad immigrant saint\n\n\nMarch 8, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLook back in time with the new Archdiocese of Denver digital historical archives\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEucharist and Education: Communicating Excellence\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nFacebookInstagramTwitter\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nLea nuestra publicaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol \n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGeorge Weigel\nThe good news is that the bad news isn\u2019t all the news there is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAround the Archdiocese\nPrepare your hearts for Easter joy at a Lenten Penance Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLocal\nLook back in time with the new Archdiocese of Denver digital historical archives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAround the Archdiocese\nDivine Mercy Choir tour comes to Colorado March 25 and Holy Saturday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMagazine\nWhy get married in a church?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Catholic Faith\nAll Saints\u2019 Day not a Holy Day of Obligation in 2021, but go to Mass anyways!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSaints\nWhy is devotion to Mary important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFeatures\nOur Lady Of Guadalupe: The miracle that changed history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEucharist\nThe Eucharist throughout history: A timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJared Staudt\nArs Moriendi: The art of dying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\nContact\nPast Issues\nEvents\nAdvertising\nObituaries\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1999-2023 Archdiocese of Denver.
