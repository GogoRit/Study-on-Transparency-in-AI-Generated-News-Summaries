If passed, the ordinance could have effectively banned doctors from practicing abortion in the city of Pueblo.\"It was terrifying just even thinking what (passing the ordinance) could have possibly done. The amount of money in lawsuits and dragging the name of our beautiful city through the mud in a bad way,\" Kat Matthews said. \"By tabling it, by keeping abortion legal and safe here in Pueblo ... we're going to be a beacon of hope.\"Monica Hughes also was among the crowd excited to see council table the anti-abortion ordinance. Hughes is the Pueblo organizer for the Cobalt Abortion Fund, a nonprofit organization that advocates for reproductive rights, as well as the administrator of the Pueblo Pro-Choice Facebook page.Council decision:Pueblo city council indefinitely tables anti-abortion ordinance\"I am really proud of how Pueblo has rallied around us and our support ... We have done a lot of activity in Pueblo trying to make sure that everyone in Pueblo is educated about the ordinance and what's going on,\" Hughes said. \"I knew that it was important to show up so that we have equal representation.\"Even if the anti-abortion ordinance were to pass, abortion rights in Colorado are protected under the 2022 Reproductive Health Equity Act, Hughes said. Local public entities are prohibited from restricting abortions in Colorado, according to RHEA.\"Colorado consistently votes to be pro-choice and we are going to continue to vote that way,\" Hughes said.Council voted 4-3 to table the anti-abortion ordinance Friday night. Councilors Regina Maestri, Lori Winner and Larry Atencio\u00a0voted against tabling the ordinance.While abortion rights advocates sided with the council majority, anti-abortion activists who attended their meeting said they felt their voices were unheard.Anti-abortion activists huddled about 50 feet away from the entrance to city hall, looked toward council chambers and chanted \"Vote them out\" in protest. Mark Lee Dickson, a Texas pastor and anti-abortion activist, joined dozens of Puebloans in the chants.\"This is far from over,\" Dickson said. \"The problem is not going away ... It's not going away in Pueblo, it's not going away in Colorado. There will be sanctuary cities for the unborn in Colorado, mark my words.\"Dickson has assisted local governments in New Mexico and Texas in drafting \"sanctuary city for the unborn\" ordinances. The tabled Pueblo ordinance was his first involvement with a municipality in Colorado. Dickson attended his second Pueblo City Council regular meeting Monday night.\"I believe that Pueblo is pro-life,\" he said. \"You can look at every single meeting that has been here and those in the pro-life community have far out numbered those in the pro-choice community. This has just begun.\"Anti-abortion activists packed council chambers during regular meetings on Nov. 14 and Nov. 28. The Dec. 12 meeting brought even more activists, both inside and outside council chambers, including Puebloans Luciano and Elizabeth Lucero.Pueblo abortion clinic:Abortion clinic coming to Pueblo expects high volume of local and out-of-state patients\"As soon as I heard last week that they were doing this, we wanted to stand up and stand for the unborn,\" Luciano said.More than 100 people were scheduled to speak during a public hearing on the anti-abortion ordinance prior to its tabling. Those speakers included people both in favor of and opposed to the ordinance, Pueblo City Clerk Marisa Stoller said.Pueblo Chieftain\u00a0reporter James Bartolo can be reached by email at JBartolo@gannett.com.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.chieftain.com.
