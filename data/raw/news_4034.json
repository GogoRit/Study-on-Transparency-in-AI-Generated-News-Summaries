But few have created as much media frenzy and social media uproar as that of the Women's March, which hit the National Mall for the first time in 2016 with record attendance \n\nThe March is back and ready to take action for its fourth year, this time with a twist: a pre-week program jammed pack with themed discussions and group events. Participants can look forward to everything from drag brunch to poster making, community art builds and lectures on a variety of topics like climate change and reproductive rights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: AP\nDemonstrators hold signs on Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women's March in Washington on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2019.
