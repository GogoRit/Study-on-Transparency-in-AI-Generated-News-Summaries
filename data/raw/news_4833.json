CSby Carter ShermanMarch 3, 2020, 6:41pmShareTweetSnapWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.As the Utah state Senate advanced a law last week that could one day ban almost all abortions, one female legislator tried to slow its passage with an eleventh-hour amendment: outlawing \u201ca male from causing an ejaculation to occur outside of a vagina.\u201dUnder the bill, most abortions would become illegal if Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, were ever overturned. But the amendment would also ban men from carelessly tossing away sperm during \u201c(A) masturbation; (B) coitus interruptus; or (C) any other method used to cause an ejaculation.\u201dAdvertisementThe amendment failed. But that\u2019s kind of the point.Over the last few years, lawmakers who support abortion rights have adopted an off-the-wall tactic to strike back at extreme abortion restrictions: introducing bills that would limit men\u2019s reproductive rights. By exposing the apparent absurdity of regulating masturbation \u2014 and even vasectomies and Viagra \u2014 these legislators are hoping to make the conservatives who back near-total abortion bans look like hypocrites.\u201cIt always takes two to tango.\u201dIn 2019, they upped their game in response to a deluge of efforts to ban abortion early in pregnancy. Seven states ultimately passed legislation to eliminate legal abortion at eight weeks of pregnancy or earlier, a trend that would have once been unthinkable even among anti-abortion activists. Alabama\u2019s law, in particular, would outlaw nearly all abortions.\u201cIt always takes two to tango,\u201d said Alabama Democratic Rep. Rolanda Hollis, who recently proposed a bill to force men to have vasectomies once they hit 50 or have three children, whichever comes first. The men would be forced to pay for the vasectomies.That bill is meant to \u201cneutralize\u201d Alabama\u2019s ban, which would also prohibit abortions in the case of rape and incest, Hollis told AL.com. Her bill notes, \u201cUnder existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men.\u201dSen. Ted Cruz, noted abortion opponent, didn\u2019t quite get the double-standard reference.Advertisement\u201cYikes!\u201d the Texas Republican tweeted in response to the bill. \u201cA government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything \u2026 literally!\u201dAfter the Georgia state House passed a bill to ban abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy, Democratic state Rep. Dar'shun Kendrick announced in March that she would be authoring a bill to ban vasectomies. She called the legislation a \u201ctesticular bill of rights.\u201dUnder Kendrick\u2019s proposal, having sex without a condom would be considered \u201caggravated assault\u201d and men who want to purchase porn or sex toys in Georgia would be required to wait 24 hours. (Georgia requires abortion patients to wait 24 hours between receiving counseling on the procedure and actually undergoing it. Twenty-six other states have similar waiting periods, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion restrictions.)\u201cI\u2019m dead serious,\u201d Kendrick told Rolling Stone. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to legislate our bodies, then we have every right to propose legislation to regulate yours.\u201dREAD: What happens when abortion providers are forced to lie to their patientsThat same week, five Georgia legislators \u2014 including Kendrick \u2014 filed a bill that also aimed to regulate men\u2019s bodies. It had a very simple, two-line suggestion: \u201cAny male 55 years of age or older shall immediately report to the county sheriff or local law enforcement agency when such male releases sperm from his testicles.\u201dAdvertisementThe idea of using satirical legislation to highlight government control over women\u2019s bodies goes back at least as far as 2012, when then-state Sen. Constance Johnson, an Oklahoma Democrat, introduced a handwritten amendment to a failed bill that defined human life as beginning at conception.\u201cAny action in which a man ejaculates or otherwise deposits semen anywhere but in a woman's vagina shall be interpreted and construed as an action against an unborn child,\u201d the amendment read.Some of the tactic\u2019s biggest hits also include former Texas state Rep. Jessica Farrar\u2019s \u201cMen\u2019s Right to Know Act,\u201d a riff on the \u201cA Woman\u2019s Right to Know\u201d pamphlet that Texas requires abortion providers to offer patients. In addition to charging men $100 per \u201cmasturbatory emission\u201d \u2014 which Farrar, a Democrat, described as \u201can act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life\u201d \u2014 the 2017 bill also suggested creating a \u201chospital masturbatory assistance registry\u201d to help men stay abstinent and store semen.Under the bill, men who want vasectomies, colonoscopies, or Viagra would also have to undergo what the bill freely admitted is a \u201cmedically-unnecessary digital rectal exam.\u201d In Texas, abortion providers are legally required to show and narrate an ultrasound of the fetus, regardless of whether a patient wants to see or listen to it. But because women often get abortions too early for \u201cjelly on the belly\u201d ultrasounds, doctors must use a transvaginal ultrasound \u2014 meaning, they have to stick a wand up a woman\u2019s vagina.AdvertisementThen there\u2019s the bill Kentucky Democratic state Rep. Mary Lou Marzian proposed in 2016, which would require a man who wants erectile dysfunction drugs to visit his doctor twice, on separate days, before getting a prescription. Today, 14 states, including Kentucky, mandate that women who want abortions visit the clinic twice, according to Guttmacher.Under the bill, only married men could receive these drugs and their spouses would have to provide written permission for the prescription. The man would also be required to \u201cmake a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse,\u201d according to the bill.\"This is about family values,\u201d Marzian told the Courier Journal at the time.Cover image: Nenad Cavoski/iStock / Getty Images PlusTagged:UtahMASTURBATIONviagraSexfetusultrasoundMichiganGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
