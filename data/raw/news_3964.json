The 35-year-old mother of two is a public health official who works long hours at a women's health clinic in central Missouri and had to cram in a call with me over her lunch break. She still picked up on the second ring \u2014 voice muffled, a little, by the sounds of a busy doctor\u2019s office. Some hurried footsteps, the swishing of scrubs, a phone ringing politely in the background.Lily\u2019s area of Missouri is a patch of rural land that, like many others around the country, has very few available resources and providers for reproductive health care. The last abortion clinic in the state, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, is fighting tooth and nail to stay open. State budget cuts and legislative restrictions have made family planning, sexual wellness, and maternity care almost as scarce. Many of the patients who visit Lily\u2019s clinic have to drive hours just to see an OB-GYN. Those in the Southeast corner of the state, nicknamed the Missouri \u201cBootheel,\u201d live miles from a single birthing hospital.\u201cWomen don\u2019t have access to the care they need,\u201d she said.Lily doesn\u2019t get a lot of free time. Still, some nights, after she throws her scrubs in the laundry and puts her kids to bed, she logs onto Reddit \u2014 username \u201cLove4Mizzou\u201d\u2014 and carries on helping strangers navigate the infuriatingly complex world of gynecological health care.She\u2019s the moderator of r/obgyn, a buzzing home for redditors seeking guidance about their bodies and health concerns at a moment when funding blocks have led to staggeringly few sexual wellness resources, and anti-abortion legislation in many states swings from ultra-strict to medically impossible (like a recent Ohio bill requiring doctors to \u201creimplant\u201d ectopic pregnancies, a procedure that can\u2019t actually be done).\n\n\n\n\n\n      The internet is a logical landing place for questions about our bodies (Who hasn\u2019t manically consulted WebMD in the dead of night?). But not all answers are created equal.\n    \n\n\n\n\nThere are all sorts of subreddits dedicated to navigating this space \u2014 r/Healthyhooha, r/WomensHealth \u2014 and they\u2019re flooded with all sorts of people, most of them women: Young women feeling their first period cramps; middle-aged women going through menopause. Women who are experiencing pelvic pain, or some other foreign sensation, and don\u2019t know what the threshold for \u201cnormal\u201d is. Women with questions about contraception, and STDs. Women who are grieving a miscarriage. Women who are trying to conceive. Women who want to know what a breast lump feels like. Women who are up at 2 a.m. because they\u2019re too scared to sleep and know that, if their worst suspicions are true, they won\u2019t be able to afford treatment.The internet is a logical landing place for questions about our bodies (Who hasn\u2019t manically consulted WebMD in the dead of night?). But not all answers are created equal, and that can create a complicated dynamic in online spaces like Reddit. It\u2019s easy to get caught up online, especially when you don\u2019t feel heard in real life. Just look at the increasing numbers of anti-vax parents \u2014 a trend researchers have linked in part to mistrust in medical institutions and the growing spread of disinformation on internet forums and social media.There are inklings of this on reproductive health subreddits, where easily discredited rumors sometimes appear; those range from largely innocuous facepalms (i.e., \u201cyou can get chlamydia from a toilet seat\u201d) to some that might post a legitimate health risk \u2014 like fatalistic hot takes on the inefficacy of various medical procedures, which could discourage some people from getting treatment they need.That\u2019s one reason Redditors like Lily \u2014 doctors, nurses, and others in the medical community \u2014 have formed a sort of online vigilante group to dish out informed advice (due to privacy concerns, and the personal safety issues that come with aligning yourself with reproductive rights, some of the people cited in this story chose to remain anonymous). These makeshift virtual clinics are no substitute for a real doctor\u2019s visit (often the advice is \u201cgo see a gynecologist\u201d). But for the medical professionals who staff them, and the scared, vulnerable people who need reliable answers, they're a lifeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Reddit / Via reddit.com\n\n\n\nCommenters chimed in to agree with this user's post on r/WomensHealth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRebekah Bliss made her first Reddit post shortly before Christmas. She\u2019d just gotten out of surgery the day before. After months of pelvic pain, frequent urination, and the wildly unpleasant suspicion that her \u201centire uterus and everything below it was on fire,\u201d an OB-GYN diagnosed Bliss with an ovarian cyst and scheduled an outpatient procedure to remove it.Afterward, Bliss learned this was a misdiagnosis. It wasn\u2019t a cyst, but an issue with her fallopian tubes \u2014 scar tissue from an appendix removal 20 years ago had blocked one tube, apparently, and it had swollen so severely that the surgeon had to remove it.Bliss\u2019s boyfriend told her all this as she came out of anesthesia \u2014 the doctor, she said, didn\u2019t stick around to explain what any of it meant. So then, lying in bed, hopped up on painkillers and wondering WTF was happening to her body, she went on Reddit. What Bliss found was a bunch of people who were just as confused and scared as she was. \u201cA lot of them were women like me, who\u2019d been having symptoms for months, or years, and still couldn't find answers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was comforting.\u201d So she joined in.\u201cThis shit storm started in August 2019 ...\u201d she wrote in a post on r/WomensHealth, and described everything that led up to her surgery. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing so I would like to hear if anyone has had any similar situations.\u201d As it turned out, many had, and some weighed in to express their sympathy. \u201cIt sounds just like what I get,\u201d one commenter wrote; another, username \u201cmediwitch,\u201d told Bliss what to expect during recovery.Bliss\u2019s experience is not uncommon. The truth is many doctors still know much less than they should about how the female body works, and modern medicine has a pretty awful track record for trusting patients, specifically women, to know about their own. Research shows that women wait longer in emergency rooms and are less likely to be given effective painkillers than men. The US also has one of the highest maternal mortality rates among developed countries, despite having the largest GDP in the world. Racial disparities are even more jarring: Black women are three to four times more likely than white women to die from a pregnancy complication.Anti-abortion discourse muddies things even further. In recent years, watchdog groups have reported cases of Catholic hospitals denying female patients everything from birth control to life-saving procedures. One woman who visited a Michigan hospital with a severe infection was allegedly given Tylenol and sent home to miscarry by herself on a toilet. Another woman with an infected uterus was released from a Washington state ER three times, even after passing a blood clot \u201cthe size of a jawbreaker,\u201d while medical staff hid the option of terminating her life-threatening pregnancy.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of sexism in medicine,\u201d said \u201cEric,\u201d a 27-year-old medical resident in Memphis who frequents subreddits like r/obgyn \u2014 username \u201cNapkinZhangy\u201d \u2014 to give blunt, no-nonsense advice about irregular bleeding, pregnancy hormones, and other concerns that mirror what he sees in practice every day. \u201cSome physicians, especially older physicians, just don\u2019t take women seriously.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n      \"It might take me a few minutes to answer, but it could save them hours of anxiety.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\nEric has seen this play out firsthand. A male patient will come into Eric\u2019s emergency room with back pain, for instance, and a doctor will run a slew of diagnostic tests to find the cause \u2014 hernia, kidney stones, etc. But when a woman has the same symptoms, she\u2019s told something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s probably just cramps\u201d and is quickly sent home. That bothers him.Eric spoke to me right after a 24-hour ER shift \u2014 lying in bed, waiting for his adrenaline to settle so he could finally knock out. Often, at times like this, Eric logs into Reddit, a site he\u2019s been using for years to chat about med school and Magic: The Gathering. Now he\u2019s finishing up his residency in gynecology and peruses subreddits like r/obgyn to see what questions he can answer.Like every medical professional quoted in this story, Eric is adamant about not making online diagnoses. But he\u2019s also aware of how frustrating it is for people to suffer from chronic pain and to have a doctor shrug off their symptoms as a normal part of being a woman. So he uses the small amount of downtime he has to try and fix that.\u201cIf someone has a quick question about their health, it might take me a few minutes to answer, but it could save them hours of anxiety,\u201d he said.Reddit is anonymous, so it\u2019s hard to tell exactly who\u2019s logging on. But the bulk of the posts seem to come from young women who are uncomfortable talking to their doctors or parents about sexual health. Many live in the large swaths of rural America where having a female reproductive system is basically an inherent medical liability. Providers are so scarce that nearly half of US counties don\u2019t have a single board-certified OB-GYN, according to research from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. For many people living in these areas, making it to a gynecological specialist or abortion doctor means buying a plane ticket and missing several days of work.These disparities echo on Reddit, where one of the most common themes is questions from people who suspect they have a chronic reproductive health condition, like endometriosis, but have been repeatedly shrugged off by a primary care physician. Some upload photos of X-rays, sonograms, and test results to get the internet\u2019s opinion of what they suspect is a misdiagnosis. Others just want to vent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Reddit / Via reddit.com\n\n\n\nEric, a medical resident in Memphis, responded to a question on r/obgyn from Allison Eigenbrod, who lives in rural Illinois.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison Eigenbrod, a 25-year-old in rural Illinois, posted on r/obgyn earlier this year. Eigenbrod said she was diagnosed with HPV last year, underwent cryosurgery to rid her body of any precancerous cells, and was told to come back for a follow-up appointment six months later. But her OB-GYN retired before that time came and never referred her to a new doctor. Eigenbrod lives in a sleepy farm town with fewer than 1,000 residents and couldn\u2019t find an OB-GYN within 50 miles who was taking new patients.Soon after, Eigenbrod\u2019s period started getting really heavy and painful. Then she started passing blood clots \u2014 first the size of a quarter, then a ping-pong ball. She went to the ER twice, she said, but was dismissed immediately, and told to go home and \u201ctake some Tylenol and Motrin.\u201dIn January, Eigenbrod uploaded a photo of one of her blood-soaked pads to Reddit and a short explainer on what she\u2019d been through. Dozens of people responded with consolatory words and recommendations for how to go about finding a new doctor. The free advice she got from both medical professionals like Eric and regular people (many of whom DM\u2019d to share their own experiences) was better than anything Eigenbrod was ever sent a bill for, she told me.Those doctors \u201cdidn\u2019t care to explain things,\u201d Eigenbrod said. \u201cWhen I would ask questions, they would look at me like I was stupid. So I got on Reddit.\u201dLike anyone with a lingering health problem, those who visit pages like r/obgyn exist in a limbo of doctor-prescribed trial and error. The internet can\u2019t solve their problems, but it can help them tolerate and navigate the unknown in the meantime. And sometimes, there are concrete steps forward. Eigenbrod recently found an OB-GYN about an hour away who\u2019s taking new patients. At the time of this writing, she was scheduled for her first appointment.Rebekah Bliss has also made some progress. Now fully recovered from surgery, she finally got to talk to her doctor (on the phone, while he was at a restaurant) and was preparing a list of questions to take to a follow-up appointment when I spoke to her. Some of those questions \u2014 Is there any chance that she has pelvic inflammatory disease? Did losing a fallopian tube affect her ability to conceive? \u2014 came straight from suggestions she got on Reddit.\u201cBeing misdiagnosed kind of makes you question everything,\u201d Bliss said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of medical subreddits not limited to women\u2019s health or reproductive health. Some, like r/AskDocs and r/DiagnoseMe, skew toward the bizarre (\u201cI somehow got a hair tourniquet inside my anus and I desperately need advice\u201d) and sensational (\u201cI swear to god I hear [sic] radio stations faintly in my ears every night for the last 15 years.\u201d). And some, like r/STD, are self-explanatory.Spaces on Reddit dedicated to women\u2019s health tend to be more earnest. The questions are personal, but they\u2019re not uncommon. And while some come from throwaway accounts, many users stick around for months or longer to post updates on their progress, and to lift up others who are struggling.Natalie Vargas, a 23-year-old student who lives in Chicago, created an account last summer to get some advice on a yeast infection from hell. She\u2019d been to multiple doctors, and through multiple rounds of prescription drugs, but the nasty motherfucker wouldn\u2019t quit. Vargas doesn\u2019t have health insurance, and she\u2019d already run up a bill of about $700 from doctor visits, medication, and lab fees. She was panicking.\u201cI was terrified,\u201d she said. \u201cI was taking summer classes, and some days I couldn\u2019t even sit through class, so my grades dropped. Some nights I\u2019d go to sleep crying. I felt like I was in a nightmare or something.\u201dOn Reddit, Vargas connected with people who\u2019d been through the exact same rigmarole. She chatted with a few, privately messaged a few more, and tried some homeopathic remedies they recommended, like probiotic pills and boric acid suppositories. And they worked, she said.Now, Vargas posts on r/Healthyhooha frequently, mostly to make regular people like herself \u201cfeel less helpless\u201d about what\u2019s going on in their own bodies, she told me. Like a lot of redditors who\u2019ve had a doctor throw up his hands at their gynecological problems, she\u2019s become an amateur expert on How to Deal (Vargas, it\u2019s worth noting, is going to school for nursing, so she\u2019s more informed than most).\n\n\n\n\n\n      R/obgyn is a noninvasive, nonjudgmental means of getting your questions answered \u2014 no matter how old you are, how many times you\u2019ve had sex, or how conservative your state, town, or family is.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI am so glad I found this community where I could express not only what I was going through but how I was feeling emotionally,\u201d she wrote in a recent post. \u201cThese ladies got me through some rough nights.\u201dVargas and her peers play an important but complicated role in Reddit\u2019s health-advice spaces. On one hand, their crowdsourced medical advice and positive affirmations make these forums powerful places to be for those without real-life advocates. Compared to the discomfort inherent in your typical OB-GYN trip, r/obgyn is a noninvasive, nonjudgmental means of getting your questions answered \u2014 no matter how old you are, how many times you\u2019ve had sex, or how conservative your state, town, or family is. On the other hand: This is still the internet. Reddit is self-policing, after all, and crowdsourced advice isn\u2019t infallible.\u201cIt\u2019s all very anecdotal,\u201d said Tania Aftandilians, a 33-year-old California-based OB-GYN. (She goes by \u201cDolmaSmuggler\u201d on Reddit, a college nickname that comes from a time she got pulled out of an airport security line and put through an extra TSA search for bringing \u201can awkward amount\u201d of stuffed grape leaves onto a flight.) \u201cI see a lot of people saying, \u2018Don\u2019t have that surgery \u2014 my aunt had all these complications,\u2019 on surgeries with complication rates of like 1%. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation online.\u201dAftandilians works in a low-income Los Angeles suburb, where the hours are long, the commute is brutal, and the turnover among colleagues is high. Gynecological resources are few and far between, she said, and financial pressures force patients to put off checkups, pap smears, and cancer screenings. Tragically, some of the people she treats for life-threatening conditions like cervical cancer \u2014 which has a high survival rate when caught early \u2014 don\u2019t know they\u2019re sick until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it.Having medical laypeople constantly chiming in on forums like r/obgyn means professionals like Aftandilians have to do a lot of the grunt work \u2014 breaking the news that a user-uploaded photo \u201clooks like genital warts\u201d or calming down a stranger who\u2019s worried about an abnormal pap smear.But she doesn\u2019t mind. She\u2019s seen the huge gaps left by the lack of public funding for health education and services; she knows what happens when patients don\u2019t have access to any advice at all. So have \u201cLily,\u201d \u201cEric,\u201d and the rest of OB-GYN Reddit. So whenever Aftandilians gets some (scant, precious) free time, she throws her scrubs in the laundry, gets online, and carries on doing the work. \u25cf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKristen Bahler is a freelance reporter based in Brooklyn.\nTopics in this articleRedditPeopleSkip to footerSectionsArts & EntertainmentBooksCelebrityCulture & CriticismHealthInternet CultureInvestigationsJPGLGBTQOpinionPoliticsTechCompanySupport UsBuzzFeed.comPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementFollow UsFacebook FacebookTwitter TwitterInstagram InstagramBuzzFeed News Homea BuzzFeed brand."
