Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA Republican state official who vocally opposes abortion has admitted he once paid for the procedure himself.Mark Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, made the confession on his Facebook page in 2012. After another Facebook user challenged an anti-abortion message Mr Robinson had posted, the Republican fired back with a startling piece of his personal history.\u201cI\u2019m not saying abortion is wrong cause [sic] I said so it\u2019s wrong cause God says so,\u201d Mr Robinson wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when others do it and it was wrong when I paid for it to be done to my unborn child in 1989.\u201d\u201cOk I\u2019m sorry,\u201d replied the apparently rattled Facebook user.Since then, Mr Robinson has been an outspoken opponent of abortion. On his campaign website when he was running for lieutenant governor, the first item on his list of promises was to \u201cfight for the life of the unborn.\u201dRecommendedNC lieutenant gov explains abortion decision decades agoMarjorie Taylor Greene branded \u2018insurrectionist\u2019 in lawsuit trying to stop her running for reelectionArizona election equipment wasn\u2019t tainted, another GOP-backed review findsTrump sues Hillary Clinton and Democrats claiming they tried to rig 2016 election by tying his campaign to RussiaLauren Boebert under fire for bizarre tweet comparing allergies to Covid: \u2018You know allergies aren\u2019t contagious, right?\u2019On Monday, Mr Robinson\u2019s decade-old confession came back to haunt him. Under a tweet quoting one of his anti-abortion speeches, one Twitter user brought up the old Facebook post.\u201cHe fully admits that he paid for an abortion back in the 80\u2019s that was his child,\u201d @amye166 commented. \u201cSo, it\u2019s good for me but not for thee (as usual).\u201d\u201cWait, really?\u201d another reader asked.@amye166 then posted a screenshot of the Facebook exchange, which several users retweeted, sparking multiple news reports.On Thursday, Mr Robinson confirmed that the confession was true. Sitting next to his wife, Yolanda Hill, the lieutenant governor addressed his supporters in a Twitter video message.\u201cOver 33 years ago, before we were married and before we had kids, we had an abortion,\u201d Mr Robinson said. \u201cIt was the hardest decision we have ever made, and sadly, we made the wrong one.\u201dMr Robinson said the experience only strengthened his opposition to abortion.\u201cThis decision has been with us ever since,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of this experience in our spiritual journey that we are so adamantly pro-life. We know what it\u2019s like to be in that situation, and we know the pain that an abortion causes.\u201dMr Robinson has said he is \u201c95 per cent sure\u201d he will run for governor in 2024, and has raised an impressive $1.5m for a potential campaign, WRAL has reported.The Republican is no stranger to controversy. In October last year, Mr Robinson faced calls to resign after a video resurfaced of him calling homosexuality \u201cfilth.\u201d He refused to apologize for the remarks.More aboutMark RobinsonNorth CarolinaFacebookRepublicanJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Pro-life Republican admitted to paying for wife\u2019s abortionPro-life Republican admitted to paying for wife\u2019s abortionMark Robinson, North Carolina\u2019s lieutenant governor, has admitted he and his wife had an abortion in 1989 Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.
