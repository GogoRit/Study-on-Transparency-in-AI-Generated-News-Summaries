Ron DeSantis\u2019 signing of a six-week ban on the procedure a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201dSpeaking Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump repeatedly declined to say whether he would support a federal ban on abortion. He said he could \u201clive with\u201d the procedure being banned by individual states or nationwide through federal action, though he said \u201cfrom a legal standpoint, I think it\u2019s probably better\u201d to be handled at the state level.Regarding the bill signed by DeSantis, which bans abortions before many women know they are pregnant, Trump said, \u201cI think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.\u201d So far, the former president has dominated the 2024 field while at times spurning the anti-abortion groups that traditionally have huge influence in Republican primaries. But Trump\u2019s direct attack on DeSantis, whom he\u2019s long treated as his chief rival, could give the Florida governor new fodder as he tries to regain momentum in his campaign and solidify his second-place standing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    More politics news\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump refuses to say in a TV interview how he watched the Jan. 6 attack unfold at the US Capitol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana\u2019s attorney general faces misconduct complaint over remarks about abortion doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood resumes offering abortions in Wisconsin after more than a year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to an Iowa radio station on Monday, DeSantis said he was proud to have signed the Florida legislation, which he called \u201cnoble and just.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can even make the claim that you\u2019re somehow pro-life if you\u2019re criticizing states for enacting pro-life protections for babies,\u201d DeSantis told Radio Iowa. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also criticized Trump\u2019s statement that he would work with both sides regarding abortion policy, warning, \u201cI think all pro-lifers should know that he\u2019s preparing to sell you out.\u201dAt a campaign stop in Mason City, Iowa, on Monday, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina mentioned other candidates who oppose a national abortion ban but specifically accused Trump of retreating on the issue.\u201cFrankly, those pro-life folks that we really want to stand with us are not standing,\u201d he told more than 80 people in a church meeting room. \u201cPresident Trump said he would negotiate with Democrats and walked back away from where I believe we need to be, which is a 15-week limit on the federal level.\u201d\n\nFollowing Sunday\u2019s interview, the country\u2019s largest anti-abortion organization, which backs a national ban on abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy, quickly released a statement saying anything less restrictive \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re at a moment where we need a human rights advocate, someone who is dedicated to saving the lives of children and serving mothers in need. Every single candidate should be clear on how they plan to do that,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.The Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade left the decision of whether and how to restrict abortion to the states, creating a patchwork of laws across the country, with most Republican-led states imposing new restrictions and states led by Democrats passing protections. Twenty-five million women of childbearing age now live in states where abortions are more difficult to get than before the ruling. \n\nTrump has approached abortion from a political stance, saying that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision gave conservatives room to negotiate new restrictions. He has argued Republicans\u2019 push for abortion restrictions hurt the GOP in the 2022 midterm elections and that GOP candidates need to do a better job of explaining the issue. Banning abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, as Florida enacted earlier this year, is unpopular with the U.S. public, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted in June. The poll found that 73% of all U.S. adults believe abortion should be allowed up to six weeks of pregnancy, which is when cardiac activity in a fetus may be detected and before women often know they\u2019re pregnant. About half of Americans say abortions should be permitted up to 15 weeks.In that poll, 56% of Republicans said abortion should be allowed in their state up to 6 weeks and 29% supported making the procedure legal up to 15 weeks.\n\nBut in Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation Republican caucuses, evangelicals and other social conservatives who strongly oppose abortion make up the majority of those who participate and decide the winner. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds this summer signed an abortion ban similar to Florida\u2019s. Reynolds has not endorsed a candidate.Trump has called himself the \u201cthe most pro-life president in American history\u201d and noted that three of his Supreme Court picks formed part of the conservative majority that overturned Roe. He has so far declined to go along with some of his rivals, including his onetime vice president, Mike Pence, who is pushing for national bans that would take effect relatively early in a pregnancy. Interviews with GOP voters and activists over the past several months suggest a split between people satisfied with Trump\u2019s record during his term and others who want Trump to endorse a national abortion ban.\n\nSome Republicans in some key states, including those backing his rivals, expressed displeasure after the interview. Among them was South Carolina state Rep. John McCravy, who sponsored the most recent, restrictive abortion measure, which bans the practice in his state after around six weeks of pregnancy. South Carolina will be among the early states to choose a nominee. McCravy described himself in an interview as \u201ccertainly disappointed.\u201d\u201cIt sounded completely out of step with his staunch support for life while he was president,\u201d he said.Kristen Waggoner, CEO of the conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, also took issue.\u201cLaws protecting the unborn are not a \u2018terrible mistake.\u2019 They are the hallmark of a just and moral society,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cGovernors who protect life should be applauded, not attacked.\u201d Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, called the interview \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d and sent a letter to Trump asking him to clarify his statements. The organization, one of the largest anti-abortion groups in the U.S., said it plans a $5 million door-knocking campaign in 2024 but noted its members were discouraged by Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cThe pro-life vote is up for grabs,\u201d Hawkins stated. \u201cWe need clarity on your vision even as we celebrate your pro-life record.\u201d___Burnett reported from Chicago.
