The country\u2019s total abortion ban, in effect since 1884, threatens women\u2019s health and lives and is incompatible with its international human rights obligations.Abortion is illegal in the Dominican Republic even when a pregnancy is life-threatening, unviable, or the result of rape or incest. A proposal being debated by Congress would decriminalize abortion in these cases.\n\u201cThe Dominican Republic\u2019s legislators have an opportunity to reform the country\u2019s archaic criminal code and decriminalize abortion in three circumstances,\u201d said Ximena Casas, women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWomen and girls in the Dominican Republic have had a long wait for the authorities to defend their lives and their sexual and reproductive rights.\u201d\nThe country\u2019s criminal code imposes prison sentences of up to 2 years on women and girls who have abortions and up to 20 years for medical professionals who provide them.\nOver the past 15 years, Human Rights Watch has published several reports on the impact of the criminalization of abortion, 8 of them on countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In all cases, Human Rights Watch concluded that legal frameworks that criminalize abortion create an environment in which women and girls resort to unsafe procedures that endanger their health and lives.\nHuman Rights Watch published a report and video in 2018 documenting the harmful consequences of the Dominican Republic\u2019s abortion ban based on interviews with dozens of women and girls who faced unwanted pregnancies and turned to unsafe abortion methods, often at great risk to their health and lives. The research showed that the country\u2019s abortion ban contributed to preventable health complications and maternal death and disproportionately harmed women and girls from low-income and rural areas, who are less likely to be able to access safer abortion methods or travel to another country where abortion is legal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Luis Abinader has proposed holding a national referendum to allow the public to decide. Where access to safe and legal abortion services are unreasonably restricted, as in the Dominican Republic, the government has an obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights related to sexual and reproductive health and autonomy, and these rights should not be subject to a referendum, Human Rights Watch said.\nThe Chamber of Deputies was scheduled to begin debate on the bill on April 21, 2021, but there was no quorum. The debate began on April 22 and may continue for several days. If the bill is adopted in the Chamber of Deputies, it will move to the Senate for debate and a vote. If passed it would ultimately be sent to President Abinader for his signature.\nA decision to partially decriminalize abortion in\u00a0Chile\u00a0in 2017 is an example of global progress toward eliminating legal barriers to accessing abortion. Between 2000 and 2017, 27 countries\u00a0expanded legal access to abortion. The Dominican Republic should join the countries that have brought their laws on accessing abortion closer in line with their human rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said.\n\u201cForcing women and girls to continue a pregnancy or turn to unsafe abortion when their life is in danger, or when a pregnancy is unviable or caused by rape or incest, is dangerous and cruel and violates human rights,\u201d Casas said. \u201cThe Dominican Republic should end the total abortion ban without delay and affirm women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights and dignity by allowing them to make decisions about their health care.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Dominican Republic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion Sexual and Reproductive Health \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2019\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nDominican Republic: Policies Fuel Teen Pregnancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 19, 2018\n\n          Interview\n        \n\n\nInterview: Defying the Dominican Republic\u2019s Abortion Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Felt Like the World Was Falling Down on Me\u201d \n\n\nAdolescent Girls\u2019 Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in the Dominican Republic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 19, 2018\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Your Decision, It\u2019s Your Life\u201d\n\n\nThe Total Criminalization of Abortion in the Dominican Republic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2019\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nDominican Republic: Policies Fuel Teen Pregnancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 19, 2018\n\n          Interview\n        \n\n\nInterview: Defying the Dominican Republic\u2019s Abortion Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
