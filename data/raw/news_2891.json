Don't get one.' Saving babies doesn't equal killing moms.Letters to the Editor'JoAnns' of the future threatened\u00a0I am 74 years old.\u00a0I came of age shortly before the Roe v. Wade decision, and was ever so relieved. Now I hear\u00a0anti-choice people referring to themselves as pro-life. One of the things this misnomer can lead to\u00a0clearly is anti-life.Way before Roe v. Wade, my father\u2019s secretary, a wonderful woman named JoAnn, suffered horrible pain for a few weeks until she finally went to the emergency room.She was told that had she not gone to the ER that night, she would not have seen the light of the following day. \u00a0More:Overturning Roe v Wade would take away equal protection for womenThe diagnosis?\u00a0Ectopic pregnancy, which can never be carried to term.Either the pregnancy is ended\u00a0or the mother dies; the fetus dies either way. Back then, no one gave a second thought to saving JoAnn\u2019s life, and she lived to old age.Today, some states are passing laws against even this, since it is technically an abortion.Is this what\u00a0anti-choice people really want?\u00a0You are going down the road of killing the JoAnns of the future even when there is no way to save the babies. Please\u00a0stop this insanity. \u00a0Opinion:If abortion is banned in Ohio, seekers would have to drive 157 to 269 milesJoAnn\u2019s story is only one of the multitude of ways that potential mothers die\u00a0(and take their fetuses with them) when Draconian laws prevent them from ending ectopic pregnancies or lead them to back-alley abortions for other reasons. If you think killing mothers equals saving babies, please think again.Don\u2019t like abortions? Don\u2019t get one. Offer help to women who would like to carry their babies to term but can\u2019t see their way clear to do it. But please, stop pushing for and passing laws that get them killed.Susan H.
