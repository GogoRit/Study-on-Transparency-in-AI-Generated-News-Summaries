Stars like\u00a0Elizabeth Banks\u00a0and\u00a0Busy Philipps\u00a0have repeatedly glorified \u201cabortion rights,\u201d and predatory figures like\u00a0Harvey Weinstein\u00a0supported the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider,\u00a0Planned Parenthood. However, not all famous people use their platform to laud \u201creproductive freedom.\u201d Some stars have rejected the politically correct opinion to courageously stand for life.\nEduardo Verastegui\nEduardo Verastegui\u00a0was a well-known actor in his home country of Mexico before he became known in the United States for his part in Bella. Deciding to go to an abortion center to learn more about what women go through when faced with an unexpected pregnancy, Verastegui\u2019s life was changed.\u00a0\nAfter encountering a Hispanic couple considering abortion outside the clinic, Verastegui spoke with them in their native Spanish for 45 minutes. He spoke gently with them, and he even provided the couple with his personal phone number. Months later, he received a phone call from the man who had been with the pregnant woman and thinking about abortion.\nThe couple had chosen life for their child because of Verastegui\u2019s encouraging words. Verastegui found he could not even speak after the man told him that he planned to name his baby after Verastegui. Meeting the new parents at the hospital, Verastegui held their child in his arms.\u00a0\nVerastegui\u2019s video,\u00a0Dura Realidad, has been used to help change women\u2019s minds about abortion. The actor is also the creator behind the\u00a0IAmViable\u00a0website, which advocates for the lives of disabled children.\u00a0Crescendo, a pro-life film produced by Verastegui, was based on the diaries of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s mother. It won 15 international film festival awards.\u00a0\nJustin Bieber\u00a0\nIn 2011, pop star\u00a0Justin Bieber\u00a0said in an interview with Rolling Stone, \u201cI really don\u2019t believe in abortion. I think [an embryo] is a human. It\u2019s like killing a baby.\u201d\u00a0\nIt seems Bieber\u2019s pro-life views stem from his mother\u2019s influence.\u00a0\nBieber\u2019s mother,\u00a0Pattie Mallette, has shared her story of how she became pregnant with Bieber at 17. She was advised by her friends and family to abort, but she refused. Mallette was kicked out of her parents\u2019 house because of the pregnancy, but despite challenges, she was determined to carry Bieber to term.\u00a0\nIn 2013, Mallette took part in a fundraiser for crisis pregnancy centers, revealing that she had turned to one when she was pregnant with Bieber. Mallette said she hoped her efforts would \u201cencourage young women all over the world, just like me, to let them know that there is a place to go, people who will take care of you and a safe home to live in if you are pregnant and think you have nowhere else to turn.\u201d\nHowever, it is sad to note that Hailey Baldwin Bieber (Justin Bieber\u2019s wife) has come out as pro-abortion following the Dobbs decision, ignoring the fact that her own husband was almost aborted.\nCeline Dion\u00a0\nCanadian music star\u00a0Celine Dion\u00a0has talked openly about how she is grateful for the parish priest who saved her life. Dion\u2019s mother was overwhelmed when she learned she was pregnant with Dion, her 14th child. The story of Dion\u2019s mother shows how sometimes\u00a0abortion-minded women\u00a0just need a little time to come to terms with a new situation.\u00a0\nWhen Dion\u2019s mother consulted a priest about having an abortion, the spiritual leader advised her not to do it, saying abortion \u201cgo against nature.\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cOnce she got over her disappointment, my mother didn\u2019t waste any time on self-pity, and loved me as passionately as she\u2019d loved the last little one,\u201d Dion said of her mother.\u00a0\nHer experience of having her life in the womb spared has driven Dion\u2019s commitment to her family. In an interview with People Magazine in 2001,\u00a0Dion\u00a0stated,\u201d My success is my family. My life is to be a mom. It is what I enjoy the most. It is my most amazing reward. I will take a chance with my music. I don\u2019t take risks with my family.\u201d\nJack Nicholson\u00a0\nThe star of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest has spoken out against abortion.\u00a0Jack Nicholson\u2019s\u00a0mother found herself unexpectedly pregnant and was being pressured to abort, but she refused. Nicholson explained the reasoning for his pro-life view: \u201cI\u2019m very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I\u2019m positively against it. I don\u2019t have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life.\u201d\nAndrea Bocelli\u00a0\nThe world-renowned Italian singer has publicly told the story of how his mother ignored doctors\u2019 advice to have an abortion after being told her son would be born disabled. In a\u00a0video\u00a0he released in 2011,\u00a0Andrea Bocelli\u00a0praised his mother for making \u201cthe right choice,\u201d and he hopes others can find hope from his story. Bocelli has congenital glaucoma, and by the time he turned 12, his vision was completely gone.\u00a0\nBocelli\u2019s blindness has not interfered with his love for music. His disability has not stopped him from possessing a beautiful tenor range, and throughout his career, he has recorded albums with singers like Sarah Brightman and Christina Aguilera. In defiance of the doctors\u2019 advice, Bocelli has gone on to touch many people\u2019s lives through his music.\u00a0\n\u00a0The singer has stated he hopes that his powerful testimony will be seen as more than just an anti-abortion stance.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause of my personal convictions as a devout Catholic, I am not only fighting against something, I am fighting for something \u2013 and I am for life,\u201d Bocelli said.\u00a0\nChuck Norris\u00a0\nThe action movie star published an essay back in 2008 that defended the right to life, and he criticized then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s radical stance on abortion. Writing for WorldNetDaily,\u00a0Chuck Norris\u00a0argued that abortion is not an \u201cold\u201d issue. He stated that the country must be \u201cconcerned about America\u2019s future and those who will occupy it.\u201d\u00a0\nNorris went on to say that abortion is a \u201cviolation of government\u2019s purpose: to protect innocent life.\u201d He then pointed to Obama\u2019s opposition to\u00a0legislation\u00a0requiring medical care for abortion survivors, laws banning partial-birth abortion, as well as parental notification laws. Citing the Founding Fathers, Norris urged everyone to try and \u201c\u2026get back to a view of humanity that emphasizes the immortal worth of every human being.\u201d\nIn 2021, Norris published another pro-life article at WorldNetDaily entitled \u201cTwice As Many People Condemn Plastic Straws Than Abortion.\u201d Presenting several polls, he stated just how twisted our society has become in what we value most, saying: \u201cWhether in the U.S. Capital or in cities across every state of our union, we shouldn\u2019t justify violence to humans outside the womb or inside the womb. Instead, we should esteem all human life from conception to the grave.\u201d\u00a0\nKelsey Grammer\u00a0\nWhile he\u2019s probably remembered best for his role as Dr. Frasier Crane on the hit sitcom Cheers,\u00a0Kelsey Grammer\u00a0has repeatedly been a bold advocate for life. Despite the heated backlash he sometimes receives from pro-choice activists,\u00a0Grammer\u00a0frequently posts pictures of himself wearing pro-life t-shirts or posting various pro-life statements on his social media. As one of the few Hollywood celebrities who is not afraid to stand against abortion, Grammer has also attended the March for Life in Washington.\u00a0\n\n\nKelsey Grammer Sports Pro-Life Shirt on Abortion: \u201cWould It Bother Us More if They Used Guns?\u201d https://t.co/jEv0l9v11Z pic.twitter.com/7T28KC3WtY\n\u2014 LifeNews.com (@LifeNewsHQ) November 2, 2019\n\nIn a 2016 interview with the\u00a0Times of UK, Grammer was not afraid to express his views on abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cIt gets a bit dishonest to call something reproductive rights when you clearly have a choice well before a baby is conceived,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone has to die as a result of rape, then we should kill the rapist \u2014 not the unborn child. \u201c\nJanine Turner\u00a0\nActress\u00a0Janine Turner\u00a0went from starring in productions like\u201d Friday Night Lights\u201d and \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d to conservative political commentary. Turner has spoken on behalf of unborn children in the womb, and she has discouraged Americans from making a \u201ctruce\u201d on important social issues like abortion.\u00a0\nTurner\u00a0has criticized federal funds being directed toward the abortion provider\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u2014an organization Turner noted has been caught victimizing young girls\u2014while\u00a0pro-life groups\u00a0do not receive nearly the same support.\n\u201cIf the federal government is going to fund an entity that is pro-abortion, then it should equally fund an entity that is pro-life,\u201d Turner said. \u201c\u2026Where is the justice for the unborn child?\u201d\nBen Stein\u00a0\nHis iconic role in Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off is likely what most people think of when they hear the name\u00a0Ben Stein\u00a0(\u201cBueller? Bueller?\u201d). But the actor has an impressive political career. Stein was a former law professor at multiple universities, and he even worked as a speechwriter for Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. In addition to writing about politics and economics, Stein has been an outspoken champion for unborn lives.\u00a0\nAccording to\u00a0Stein, he was ostracized in Hollywood after it became known that he was pro-life. While he might have faced scorn from the residents of Tinsel Town, Stein has been honored at events like the Tenth Annual Proudly Pro-life Awards Dinner in 2003. He was also named as the \u201cPro-Life Celebrity\u201d of 2009 by Bound4Life.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to standing for life, Stein does not see abortion as just a \u201csingle issue.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI would not be on any other side than the side I\u2019m on,\u201d Stein said about his pro-life views.\nKathy Ireland\u00a0\nKathy Ireland\u00a0became famous after she appeared on the cover of magazines like Vogue and Cosmopolitan. Around the time her modeling career began, Ireland thought of herself as pro-choice. It wasn\u2019t until she began to look closer at the science of when life begins that Ireland\u2019s mind changed.\n\u201cWhat I learned is at the moment of conception, a new life comes into being,\u201d\u00a0Ireland\u00a0said in a 2010 interview with Mike Huckabee. \u201cThe DNA, the genetic blueprint is there, the sex is determined, the blood type is determined, the unique set of fingerprints is there.\u201d\nFor\u00a0Ireland, the pro-life argument had presented her with a truth she could not deny. Ever since she shifted her stance, Ireland has dedicated her career to speaking at pro-life events, such as the\u00a0Council for Life Luncheon, and calling for Planned Parenthood to be defunded.\nThough her decision to publicly come out against abortion cost her a few scheduled television appearances, Ireland has not been deterred in her belief that unborn lives deserve protection.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t want to hear about it\u2026however, I\u2019ll never be ashamed of it; it\u2019s my foundation; it\u2019s who I am.\u201d\n\n Post Views: 19,890\n\nShare this postSFLA Staff\nBlogSupportersUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsUSD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024Olivia Rodrigo Wants to Kill Her Future Fan Base, Passes Out Plan B and Donates to Abortion Fund\u00a014 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
