We need this more than ever to protect and promote the rights of women and girls especially those in the most vulnerable sector,\u201d Oxfam Pilipinas\u2019 Sexual Health and Empowerment (SHE) Project Officer Rina Fulo said.\nThe groups are particularly calling for the inclusion of reproductive health commodities, such as menstrual health items and contraceptives, in relief packages and dignity kits distributed during and immediately after the enhanced community quarantine.\nThey are also calling for the availability of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services such as the continuity of post and pre-natal care, and information to reduce unsafe and unhealthy sexual practices.\nEven before COVID-19, the state of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of women and girls was already a grave public health challenge in the Philippines.\nApproximately 196,000 girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year, which led the Commission on Population and Development to declare a \u201cnational social emergency\u201d in 2019.\nData from the 2017 National Democratic Health Survey showed that one in five girls is a mother by age 19, and two thirds of women are not using any form of birth control. It added that 24 percent of women with little or no education have unmet need for family planning, leading to a lot of unplanned and even forced pregnancies\n\"The pandemic does not have to put our women population at risk twice over with the virus and unplanned pregnancies, destroying their aspirations for their families' health and well-being. Family planning reminders, counselling, needed supplies and quality services cannot and must not be left behind in the time of COVID-19,\u201d FriendlyCare Foundation Chief Executive Officer Teresita Panganiban said.\nThe groups also expressed concern over the possible rise in sexual and physical violence, and child abuse cases as mandatory home isolation reinforces the conditions that force sexual abuse perpetrators and survivors to stay in a confined space.\n\u201cThe impacts of asymmetrical gender relations are alarmingly magnified during periods of humanitarian crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The urgency of immediately responding to women\u2019s gender-specific vulnerabilities is not only a matter of upholding dignity and rights, or reducing risk, loss, harm, and suffering - it is about survival,\u201d University of the Philippines\u2019 Center for Women and Gender Studies Director Nathalie Lourdes Verceles said.\nThus, the groups cited the need to strengthen referral pathyways, including hotlines, social protection, and community care services, to enable the timely reporting of gender-based violence and the availability of safe houses.\n\u201cToday, more than ever, in spite of the physical distance, we work in solidarity and continue our collective effort to oppose systemic violations to sexual and reproductive health and rights,\" Women\u2019s Global Network for Reproductive Rights Executive Director Marevic Parcon said.\nThe groups are also calling for psychosocial support to all affected individuals, including women who represent 70 percent of the health and social workforce combatting COVID-19.\nThe women\u2019s groups are currently working on a five-year project called Sexual Health and Empowerment (SHE) funded by Global Affairs Canada, which aims to improve the access to sexual and reproductive health and rights information and services of 85,000 people across 13 provinces in the country.\nThe project is being implemented by Oxfam Pilipinas with  eleven partners, namely: Al-Mujadillah Development Foundation, United Youth of the Philippines Women, Mayon Integrated Development Alternatives and Services, Family Planning Organization of the Philippines, Pambansang Koalisyon ng Kababaihan sa Kanayunan, Sibog Katawhan Alang sa Paglambo, University of the Philippines Women and Gender Studies, Women\u2019s Global Network for Reproductive Rights, Davao Medical School Foundation-Institute of Primary Health Care, FriendlyCare Foundation, and Jhpiego.\n###\nFor further inquiry, please contact:\nApril Bulanadi |Senior Officer for Media and Digital Influencing | Oxfam Pilipinas\nMobile: 09062822562 | Email: abulanadi@oxfam.org.uk\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nPhilippines\n\nSources\n\nJhpiegoOxfam\n\nFormat\n\nNews and Press Release\n\nTheme\n\nHealth\n\nDisaster type\n\nEpidemic\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nPhilippines\n\nDSWD DROMIC Report #4 on the Armed Conflict in Del Gallego, Camarines Sur as of 15 March 2024, 6PM\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nGovt.
