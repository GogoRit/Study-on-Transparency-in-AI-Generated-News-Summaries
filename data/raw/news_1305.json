The clinic must stop providing abortions after a judge refused to block the state\u2019s trigger law from taking effect. Credit: Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today\n\n\n\n\nA Jackson-based conservative think-tank filed a lawsuit Monday that aims to clear up a bizarre legal conundrum in Mississippi: that abortion is technically both legal and illegal at the same time.\nThe Mississippi Center for Public Policy filed a lawsuit Monday in an attempt to get the state Supreme Court to reverse its 1998 ruling that said the Mississippi Constitution provides a right to an abortion.\nThat decades-old ruling \u2014 Pro Choice Mississippi v. Fordice \u2014 has been in conflict with two new state laws that took effect this summer after the U.S. Supreme overturned Roe v. Wade, which had previously established a national right to an abortion.\n \n \n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court decision in late June overturning Roe v. Wade, two Mississippi laws went into effect. One banned all abortions except in cases of rape and when the life of the mother was in jeopardy. A second law banned all abortions except for cases of medical emergency.\nBut officials at Mississippi Center for Public Policy say those two laws are in conflict with the state Supreme Court ruling that said the state constitution provides a right to an abortion. The center\u2019s lawsuit attempts to ensure the two new laws that restrict abortion are not negated by the 1998 Pro Choice Mississippi v. Fordice ruling. \n\n\u201cThis legal uncertainty has placed Mississippi physicians in an impossible \u2018Catch-22,\u2019\u201d said the center\u2019s news release. \u201c\u2026Whether elective abortions are \u2018lawful\u2019 in Mississippi depends on whether the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Fordice is still valid.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Mississippi, where abortion is technically both legal and illegal at the same time\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade came in a case brought by Mississippi and argued by the office of state Attorney General Lynn Fitch. The landmark case \u2014 Dobbs v. Jackson Women Health Organization \u2014 resulted in the state\u2019s only abortion clinic closing.\n\u201cIn the Dobbs case, Mississippi secured a major victory for human rights and the rule of law,\u201d said Aaron Rice, director of the Mississippi Justice Institute, which is the legal arm of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to finish the job and protect the right to life in the state that took Roe down.\u201d\n \n \n\nThe case was filed in Hinds County Chancery Court. The press release said it will be up to the state Supreme Court to ultimately rule on whether to reverse the ruling providing a right to an abortion in the Mississippi Constitution.\nRight after the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, then providing abortion services in Jackson, took legal action in Hinds County Chancery Court trying to block the enactment of the laws banning abortion in Mississippi. The Mississippi Center for Justice, arguing on behalf of the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, said that the state laws banning abortions would not trump the Mississippi Supreme Court ruling saying that the Constitution provided a right to an abortion.\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court rejects plea for quick ruling on effort to stop abortion ban\nIn an unusual ruling in early July, Chancery Judge Debbra Halford of Meadville, appointed to hear the case by the state Supreme Court, refused to block the laws banning abortions. One of her primary reasons for not blocking the laws is because she predicted the current state Supreme Court would reverse the ruling providing a right to abortion in the Mississippi Constitution.\nThe Mississippi Center for Justice appealed to the Supreme Court. But the state\u2019s highest court refused to take up the case on an expedited schedule. During the uncertainty, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization closed and the Mississippi Center for Justice dropped the appeal.\nNow the conservative leaning Mississippi Center for Public Policy is trying to renew the case.\n\n\u201cWe will review this lawsuit and consider whether we should intervene,\u201d said Rob McDuff, an attorney with the Mississippi Center for Justice that represented the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nThe Mississippi Justice Institute has brought the lawsuit on behalf of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, according to the news release.\n \n\nYou deserve answers.
