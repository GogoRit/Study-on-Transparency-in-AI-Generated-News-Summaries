The six-point list includes a commitment to block access to the right to abortion and euthanasia, and to repeal regional laws protecting people against discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientationVox candidate Roc\u00edo Monasterio \u2013 who has a close relationship with Hazte O\u00edr \u2013 has backed the agenda, which already closely mirrors that of the far-right party. The first point on the list is \u201cto advance the protection of the right to life of all human beings (from conception to natural death)\u201d \u2013 in other words, to make it more difficult to access the right to abortion and euthanasia. The Catholic lobby also wants women seeking an abortion in Madrid to be asked if they want to hear the fetus\u2019s heartbeat \u2013 a controversial practice Vox deputy G\u00e1dor Joya has already been offering outside of abortion clinics in the region.Hazte O\u00edr also calls for the repeal of all regional laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. This would end the ban on so-called \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d which treats homosexuality as a disease that can be cured. These practices were banned by the very laws that Hazte O\u00edr wants repealed.The list also calls for the introduction of the so-called \u201cparental veto,\u201d a policy that gives parents the right to stop their children from attending complimentary workshops organized during school hours. This measure \u2013 which was first proposed by Vox \u2013 means that schools need to ask for parents\u2019 permission to give talks on workshops such as safe sex and LGBTQ+ rights.Another point calls for the protection of \u201cChristian symbols\u201d against the supposed threat of the central government\u2019s Democracy Memory bill, which addresses the legacy of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) and the Francisco Franco dictatorship. This point may refer to the large cross at the Valley of the Fallen, the controversial memorial to victims of the Civil War, where Franco was buried before his body was exhumed in 2019.Hazte O\u00edr campaign poster against Unidas Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias. Message reads: \u201cIt\u2018s time.\u201dHAZTE O\u00cdR  (Europa Press)Hazte O\u00edr also wants all travel restrictions aimed at controlling the coronavirus pandemic to be lifted and for regional taxes to be frozen or lowered to compensate for a hypothetical rise in state levies. Some of the measures proposed by the Catholic lobby are already protected under Spanish law, such as the right of doctors to conscientiously object to abortions and euthanasia.Although Monasterio has a long history with Hazte O\u00edr \u2013 having been involved personally with several of their campaigns \u2013 she has avoided speaking on moral issues during her election campaign. When asked about the right to abortion and euthanasia, Monasterio said that Vox wants to repeal both laws, but added that the Madrid regional government does not have authority over these issues, so it was not the time to address them.But while abortion legislation falls to the central government, how the law is carried out in practice is controlled by the regions, which is why in eight Spanish provinces \u2013 Teruel, \u00c1vila, Palencia, Segovia, Zamora, Cuenca, Toledo and C\u00e1ceres \u2013 no abortion has been performed in three decades. In these provinces, women are sent to other territories, which delays the procedure.It is a similar case for Spain\u2019s newly approved euthanasia law. Under this legislation, the final decision on whether to approve a patient\u2019s request for euthanasia or assisted suicide is made by a commission, whose members are determined by each region. \u201cIf you fill this commission with members of [ultraconservative Catholic group] Opus Dei, the entire process will turn into a trial, making it unviable,\u201d warned a medical expert on the subject. \u201cAlmost any right that is recognized on a state level can be blocked until it is annulled on a regional level,\u201d they added.While Monasterio has been avoiding moral issues, Vox spokesperson Jorge Buxad\u00e9 has not. Buxad\u00e9, who defends the so-called \u201cnatural family\u201d between a man and a woman, said on Monday that freedom in Madrid will not be possible \u201cwhile man continues to be a slave to his vices and passions.\u201dPressure on Madrid premierHazte O\u00edr has also been pushing for Madrid premier Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, of the conservative Popular Party (PP), to back the agenda. The ultraconservative Catholic organization sent a letter to D\u00edaz Ayuso\u2019s campaign manager, Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez, warning that if the Madrid premier did not commit to its demands, it would vote for someone who would \u2013 in other words, Vox candidate Roc\u00edo Monasterio. It has also plastered signs on trucks featuring a photo of D\u00edaz Ayuso with the phrase: \u201cI defend women making and taking each decision freely,\u201d which she made during the television show Espejo P\u00fablico in May 2019.Hazte O\u00edr president Ignacio Arsuga in front of signs aimed at pressuring D\u00edaz Ayuso to take a stronger stand on abortion.David Fernandez (EFE)But before D\u00edaz Ayuso was named premier, she also told EL PA\u00cdS in January 2019 that \u201cabortion is not the right of a woman.\u201d Her other statements included: \u201cI\u2019m worried that the father is never considered and it is almost used as a contraceptive method\u201d and \u201cI am not criminalizing anybody, but a very high percentage [of women who have abortions] are immigrants or women without resources who are doing it for the second or third time.\u201dAlthough D\u00edaz Ayuso is currently leading in the polls, it is likely she will need the support of Vox to secure an absolute majority. If the PP were to form a coalition government with Vox, Hazte O\u00edr has made it clear that it wants the latter to set the agenda. \u201cIf Vox is strong in the Madrid Assembly, Ayuso will be more courageous and her values better represented,\u201d the organization says on its website. \u201cWe hope that Roc\u00edo Monasterio will push Ayuso to do the right thing if the groups are able to form a government together.\u201dWith just days to go before the Madrid vote, Hazte O\u00edr has also put up posters against Unidas Podemos candidate Pablo Iglesias, who resigned as one of Spain\u2019s deputy prime ministers to contest the election. The posters show a worker painting over Iglesias\u2019s face with the message: \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201dHazte O\u00edrHazte O\u00edr was set up in 2001 by lawyer Ignacio Arsuaga and has campaigned noisily against abortion rights, as well as attacking LGBT groups and women\u2019s associations, using terms such as \u201cthe gay inquisition\u201d and \u201cthe dictatorship of gender.\u201d In 2019, the Spanish Interior Ministry withdrew Hazte O\u00edr\u2019s status as a not-for-profit association over its controversial campaign against transgender people.In 2017, the ultraconservative Catholic organization organized a bus emblazoned with the message: \u201cIt\u2019s what biology says: boys have a penis. Girls have a vulva. Say no to gender indoctrination.\u201d The vehicle was driven across Spain and sparked fierce backlash from activists.The bus from Hazte O\u00edr campaigning for the repeal of the gender violence law.EUROPA PRESS (Europa Press)In 2019, Hazte O\u00edr launched another bus, this time against \u201cfeminazis\u201d and Spain\u2019s gender violence law. The main message read: \u201cIt\u2019s not gender violence, it\u2019s domestic violence.\u201d The bus also featured an image of Adolf Hitler wearing makeup and the symbol of feminism on his military cap, above the hashtag \u201c#StopFeminazis.\u201dWith reporting by Natalia Junquera.English version by Melissa Kitson.More informationFormer PM Zapatero becomes latest Spanish politician to be sent threatening letter containing bullets\u00d3scar L\u00f3pez-Fonseca | MadridMadrid premier receives death threat letter amid tense campaignCarlos E.
