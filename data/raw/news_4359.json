So, what was the problem?\nThe reason goes beyond Ware\u2019s case, and it goes beyond health care. Black women in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by myriad health issues and disparities. (See sidebar.) What underlies all of them is the country\u2019s long history of structural and systemic racism\u2014the processes within social, commercial, and government systems that disadvantage Black Americans. They can be seen through inequities in socioeconomic status, segregated communities, and even how Black women\u2019s pain and conditions are disbelieved and dismissed by the medical community.\n\u201cRacism is deeply ingrained in our country,\u201d says Charvonne Holliday, PhD, MPH, an assistant professor in Population, Family and Reproductive Health. \u201cAnd, as we talk more about police brutality through increasing media attention, hopefully, we can draw more light to the impact of racism on health.\u201d\nConsider an astonishing example from two Baltimore neighborhoods. The difference in average life expectancy between Upton/Druid Heights, a mostly impoverished, Black neighborhood, and Roland Park, a mostly wealthy, white neighborhood, is 20 years. In Upton/Druid Heights, 54.7% of 10,071 residents are women, 93.3% of which are Black women compared to Roland Park that has a similar percentage of women (50.3%), but only 6.9% are Black women. The two neighborhoods are fewer than five miles apart.\nHistoric racism and the real estate practice of \u201credlining\u201d is a significant underlying cause. A now-illegal practice that started in the 1930s and was once backed by the U.S. government, redlining was the denial of mortgages to people of color in urban areas by banks so they couldn\u2019t afford homes in \u201cnicer neighborhoods\u201d or even renovate the homes they were living in. The practice often trapped Black people in deteriorating neighborhoods marked by limited economic, social, and educational resources, and has contributed to persistent food insecurity, poor health outcomes, lack of green spaces, and concentrated poverty, says Chidinma Ibe, PhD \u201911, an assistant professor in Health, Behavior and Society and the School of Medicine\u2019s Department of General Internal Medicine.\u00a0\nRedlining led to a generations-long ripple effect of disproportionate negative health outcomes. Black women, for example, are 60% more likely than non-Hispanic white women to have high blood pressure, according to the Office of Minority Health in the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThat\u2019s a prime example of the legacy of redlining and how structural racism affects not just their lived experiences but their actual mortality and health outcomes,\u201d says Ibe.\nFor many Black women, the disparities don\u2019t stop once they retreat into their homes. More than 40% of Black women experience intimate partner violence compared to 31.5% of all women, according to the 2017 report \u201cThe Status of Black Women in the United States.\u201d Beyond the direct repercussions of physical violence, IPV is associated with a higher risk of HIV, unintended pregnancy, poor mental health, substance use, and other health issues, says Holliday. (Her IPV research focuses mostly on racial and ethnic disparities in women\u2019s health.)\nSocioeconomic status enforced by structural racism plays a role in IPV. Black women earn 62 cents per every dollar their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts earn, putting them at a lower level of financial security, especially if they are the top earners of their households. So, Black women often become trapped in these relationships because they don\u2019t have the financial means to leave.\u00a0\nThe U.S. health system is hardly immune from racism, especially within a medical community that disbelieves Black women\u2019s pain and dismisses their experiences with their own bodies. This is tragically true in the case of Black mothers who die at a higher rate from pregnancy-related complications than any other racial/ethnic group at 40.8 deaths per 100,000 births\u2014the next highest being non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women at 29.7 deaths.\u00a0\nU.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, MSN/MPH \u201909, recalls the tragedy of her MPH classmate, Shalon Irving. \u201cAfter we graduated [she] went on to work at the CDC. She became an expectant mom at 36, she was so excited. She did everything right,\u201d says Underwood, who represents Illinois\u2019 14th congressional district. \u201cBut three weeks after giving birth, she died from complications due to high blood pressure.\u201d And although Irving had repeatedly reported pain and identifiable dramatic swelling to her physicians prior to her death, she was sent home with a prescription and no further follow-up.\nUnderwood is joining affected communities, medical groups, and others to push back against structural and systemic racism. She, along with Congresswoman Alma Adams, has introduced, for example, the MOMNIBUS Bill that \u201cwill fill gaps in existing legislation to comprehensively address every dimension of the Black maternal health crisis.\u201d Some of those fillings include funding for community-based organizations aimed at improving Black women\u2019s maternal health outcomes, improving processes for data collection and quality measures for a better understanding of the causes of the maternal health crisis, and improved care and support for expectant mothers who are incarcerated. Other innovative solutions have emerged, including community health workers\u2019 efforts to help fellow residents navigate the health care system.\n\u201c[But] the greatest solution to surmount obstacles that contribute to disparities in Black women\u2019s health,\u201d says Holliday, \u201cis for our country to acknowledge the impact of historic and present-day injustices. Until we collectively denounce racism and understand its entrenched implications on health, inequalities will persist, and our pursuit of liberation will be stifled.\u201d\nFor her part, Ware struggles on nearly six years after her SLE diagnosis. She often wonders how her life would\u2019ve changed had she and her family been respected and listened to the first time.\n\u201cI lost all of those developmental years [where] I could\u2019ve learned how to cope,\u201d she says. All of the \u201cnot-knowing\u201d what was happening to her could have been prevented.\u00a0\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n40.8 / 12.7\nPregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births for Black/white women, 2007\u201316\nCDC MMWR\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n40% / 31.5%\nExperience of intimate partner violence for Black/all women, 2017\nThe Status of Black Women in the United States Report\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n109 / 53\nPer 100,000 Black/White women of all ages incarcerated in state and federal prisons, 2014\nThe Status of Black Women in the United States Report\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n166.3 / 131.9\nDeath rate from heart disease per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Black/Non-Hispanic White women, 2017\nCDC DHHS\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n42.9 / 27.0\nPersons 20 years of age and over with high blood pressure for Black/White women, 2013-16\nCDC DHHS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Story\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Structural Racism Harms Black Americans\u2019 Health\n\n\n\n                        Data on systemic inequities reveal the barriers that lead to harder, shorter lives\n      \n      \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Story\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Black Men in America Have Worse Health than White Men\u2014and What Needs to Change\n\n\n\n                        Multiple factors including socioeconomic status and access to health care have combined to erode Black men\u2019s health.\n      \n      \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Story\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridging Cancer\u2019s Great Divide\n\n\n\n                        Six epidemiologists seek to eliminate disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes.\n      \n      \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u201cBlack Women\u2019s Biggest Health Issue Is the System\u201d\n was published\n      November 13, 2020.\n    \n\nThis article appeared in the \n  Fall 2020\n issue of Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health magazine.\n\n\n\n\nShare your thoughts\nContact the Editors\n\n\n\n\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\nMessage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohns Hopkins School of Public Health\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\nAbout the Magazine\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArchives\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nMake a Gift\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92001-2024, Johns Hopkins University.
