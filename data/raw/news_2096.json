Or maybe to even fulfill bloodthirsty tendencies? A new documentary titled Inwood Drive\u00a0was recently released on\u00a0Vimeo, created by filmmakers Mark and Amber Archer.\u00a0Inwood Drive\u00a0tells the horrific story of abortionist Ulrich \u201cGeorge\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Klopfer.\u00a0\nKlopfer, who passed away in September of 2019, made headlines as over\u00a02,000 fetal remains\u00a0were discovered in his basement and his vehicle after his death. The Archers had finished the film in July of 2019 prior to Klopfer\u2019s death, but reproduced it after the remains were discovered. This discovery occurred after the suspension of Klopfer\u2019s medical license in 2016 due to\u00a0mishandling of abortion\u00a0cases for minors.\u00a0\n\nA bloody wake of destruction followed abortionist Ulrich Klopfer. He committed abortions in both Illinois and Indiana during his licensure. According to Mark and Amber Archer, things got bad when he opened a facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Patients with complications from Klopfer\u2019s abortions were repeatedly ending up in the emergency room and that is where one emergency room doctor became increasingly concerned.\u00a0\nDr. Geoffrey Cly, a Fort Wayne OB-GYN, teamed up with some pro-life advocates at Indiana Right to Life to try to implement some safety legislation to protect the women that he was seeing coming into the emergency room due to Klopfer\u2019s failure to provide safe care. One such patient that Dr. Cly shared about in the documentary ended up needing to have a hysterectomy because of the abortion done by Klopfer.\u00a0\nAnother major oversight that Klopfer committed was not reporting the abortions he was committing on minors, the documentary shares. He was also failing to report the sexual abuse of minors to the proper authorities as was required by Indiana state law. These discoveries, made by local Fort Wayne pro-life advocates, ultimately led to the suspension of Dr. Klopfer\u2019s medical license.\nThis film also features a shocking interview with Ulrich Klopfer himself. This interview further exposes the abortionist\u2019s gross callousness when it came to his patients and the lives he was taking day in and day out.\u00a0\nInwood Drive\u00a0seeks to point out that Klopfer, much like abortionists Kermit Gosnell and Michael Roth, is not an outlier. This type of apathetic regard for human life is not uncommon among abortionists. Maybe this film can be a battle cry, the beginning of the end of these horrific practices that have been brought to light once again.\n\n Post Views: 2,051\n\nShare this postHayley Tschetter\nBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeFeaturedhigh schoolIn the NewsMed & LawSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
