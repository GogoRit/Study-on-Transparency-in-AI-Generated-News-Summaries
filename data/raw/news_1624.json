Joni Albrecht\nCurrent Nebraska law prohibits abortions at 20 weeks post fertilization.\nLB626, introduced by Thurston Sen. Joni Albrecht, would create the Nebraska Heartbeat Act. Under the bill, physicians would be required to test for \u201csteady and repetitive contractions\u201d within the gestational sac that would be used to estimate gestational age before inducing an abortion. If such activity is detected, a physician would be prohibited from performing an abortion except in cases of sexual assault, incest or medical emergency.\nA physician who knowingly violates the bill\u2019s provisions would be subject to removal of their license to practice medicine. No one who undergoes an abortion would be considered to be in violation of LB626.\nThe following would be excluded from the definition of an abortion under the bill:\n\u2022 removal of an ectopic pregnancy;\n\u2022 removal of the remains of an unborn child who has already died;\n\u2022 an act done with the intention of saving the life or preserving the health of the unborn child; and\n\u2022 termination or loss of life to an unborn child who is not being carried inside an individual\u2019s body during the practice of in vitro fertilization or other assisted reproductive technology.\nAlbrecht said protecting the \u201cunborn\u201d \u2014 the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens \u2014 is the single most important issue the Legislature will address. Every woman and every child deserves love, she said, and Nebraska will be at its best when every life counts.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start here, in a place where we should all be able to agree,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cWomen deserve support and babies with beating hearts should be protected.\u201d\nSandy Danek, executive director of Nebraska Right to Life, testified in support of LB626. Danek highlighted a recent study conducted on behalf of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which indicated that 58 percent of registered voters in Nebraska would support a bill protecting \u201cpreborn babies\u201d after a heartbeat is detected.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recurring theme within our state that people want preborn life to be protected,\u201d she said. \u201cAdvancing policies like the Nebraska Heartbeat Act is consistent with Nebraska values.\u201d\nNebraska Catholic Conference representative Marion Miner also testified in support of the bill. From the first moment of a child\u2019s existence, they must be recognized as a human being, he said.\n\u201cHuman beings have rights, not to be asserted over and against other human beings, but to be recognized equally before the law as persons deserving of love and protection,\u201d Miner said.\nSherry Jones, testifying in favor of LB626, said the bill exhibits both common sense and compassion.\n\u201cA heartbeat is a universal sign of life, the most basic indicator of the existence of life,\u201d she said.\nSeveral physicians testified in support of LB626, stating that the bill would not interfere with their ability to provide emergency care to their patients and noting the long-term effects a woman may experience after having an abortion.\nRobert Bonebrake, a board certified OBGYN and maternal fetal specialist, said physicians already care for patients with a wide range of pregnancy complications outlined in the bill. The paramount concern is the health and safety of the mother, he said, but there always should be care and consideration for the human dignity of babies, as well.\n\u201cLB626 lays out the clear standard for protecting a woman\u2019s life and health,\u201d Bonebrake said. \u201cAny physician providing best medical practice is safe under this framework.\u201d\nCourtney Miller, a licensed psychologist with the Immaculate Heart of Mary Counseling Center, also supported the bill. Women can experience a multitude of physical, emotional and spiritual effects following an abortion, she said, including infertility, depression, substance abuse and subsequent childbearing complications.\n\u201c[LB626] recognizes the human nature of a beating heart and protects both baby and mother from the undeniable traumatic effects of an abortion,\u201d Miller said.\nOpponents of LB626 argued that many women do not find out they\u2019re pregnant until they are past six weeks gestation, which is roughly when the bill\u2019s provisions would apply, and outlined additional concerns.\nMeghan Oakes, an infertility specialist, stated that women with irregular menstrual cycles do not always consider pregnancy as a possibility right away, a situation which could impact more than 37,000 women in Nebraska.\n\u201cAll of these women will be slower to consider a pregnancy if their menstrual cycle is late \u2014 increasing the chance that termination is no longer an option,\u201d Oakes said.\nReproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist Abigail Delaney also testified in opposition to the bill. She stressed the importance of keeping personal and religious beliefs out of medical practices.\n\u201cI do not need you to believe abortion is okay \u2014 what I need from you all is to allow me to be a doctor,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cI need you to get out of our exam room. I need you to allow me to shoulder the ethical burdens of the profession I chose.\u201d\nTestifying against the bill on behalf of the Nebraska chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was Abigail Drucker. Recent data indicates that states with the most restrictive abortion laws have experienced increased rates of maternal and infant mortality when compared to states with less restrictive abortion access, she said.\n\u201cWomen with chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, kidney disease, blood clotting disorders or even cancer would be forced to remain pregnant while we, their physicians, watch and wait for them to get sicker or even die,\u201d Drucker said.\nChriston MacTaggart, executive director of the Nebraska Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, opposed the bill based on the unintended consequences it could have on survivors of sexual and domestic violence.\nA 2020 Nebraska Statewide Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that over 50 percent of women in Nebraska have experienced sexual assault in their life, she said, and nearly 50,000 experienced an unwanted pregnancy as a result.\n\u201cIf a survivor of any form of domestic or sexual violence decided they cannot go through with a pregnancy resulting from this, they deserve access to care that is not conditioned on their willingness to share the traumatic details of their victimization,\u201d MacTaggart said.\nThe committee took no immediate action on LB626.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Array of criminal justice reform programs proposed\nProposal would cut income tax rates to 3.99 percent by 2027 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost readDACA provision removed from law enforcement measure, bill advancedBudget advances with minor adjustments, more changes likelyFarmer, restaurateur earns seat at the tableAgriculture proposal amended, advancedDark fiber licensing authorizedResources\n\nLegislative interim hearing schedule\nLive video of Legislature via NPM\nLegislative publications\nCivic education resources\nLegislative calendar\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n October 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n October 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n July 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n October 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n October 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n May 2014 \n April 2014 \n March 2014 \n February 2014 \n January 2014 \n December 2013 \n October 2013 \n July 2013 \n June 2013 \n May 2013 \n April 2013 \n March 2013 \n February 2013 \n January 2013 \n October 2012 \n June 2012 \n May 2012 \n April 2012 \n March 2012 \n February 2012 \n January 2012 \n December 2011 \n November 2011 \n October 2011 \n June 2011 \n May 2011 \n April 2011 \n March 2011 \n February 2011 \n January 2011 \n December 2010 \n November 2010 \n October 2010 \n April 2010 \n November 2009 \n May 2009 \n April 2009 \n March 2009 \n February 2009 \n January 2009 \n January 2008 \n January 2007 \n January 2005 \n January 2003 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Unicameral Update.
