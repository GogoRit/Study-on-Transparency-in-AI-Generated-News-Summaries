The policy has been blamed for contributing to thousands of maternal deaths in the developing world over the past four years.The gag rule prevents overseas organisations that receive American aid from using their own money to provide information about abortion, or carry out abortions. First adopted by the Reagan administration in 1984, it has been repealed by every Democratic administration and reinstated by every Republican one in the years since.In a short appearance in the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Biden said he ended the policy as part of an effort to \u201cprotect women\u2019s health at home and abroad\u201d.But Donald Trump went further than previous Republican presidents. The policy usually applies to family planning organisations. But the Trump administration expanded the policy to include all global health programmes, including programmes that address HIV, nutrition, malaria and cholera.Widening the rule increased the pool of aid funds it affected from roughly $600m to about $12bn (\u00a38.7bn), according to the Guttmacher Institute, a health policy research group.'We're going to save lives': aid groups look to end of Trump's 'global gag rule'Read more\u201cWe can breathe,\u201d said Serra Sippel, the president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, of Biden\u2019s plans to repeal the policy. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much hope and optimism in Washington DC right now. We have a lot of work to do, but it\u2019s so much better.\u201dThe consequences of Thursday\u2019s memorandum will ripple out from Washington into more than 70 countries including some of the poorest places in the world, where essential women\u2019s health operations were abruptly halted or scaled down after Trump reinstated the rule in January 2017.In Zimbabwe, a women\u2019s health team run by Abebe Shibru, from the organisation MSI Reproductive Choices, cut its operations by 60%. \u201cWe reduced our outreach from 700,000 women to about 300,000,\u201d Shibru, who now heads the organisation\u2019s Ethiopian operations, told the Guardian.\u201cWomen missed out on information, they had no access to family planning, and in return they were exposed to unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion, which contributed to higher maternal mortality.\u201dZimbabwe\u2019s teenage pregnancy rate increased by 2% over the past four years, according to Unicef data, a trend Shibru said was exacerbated by cuts as a result of the gag rule.\u201cWe were not providing services to rural women, so they had no choice but to get pregnant against their wish,\u201d he said.Pledging conferences attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in donations from governments and private groups to try to bridge the gap in American funding, but could not meet the total shortfall.An assessment of the rule\u2019s impact released last year, surveying health organisations in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Nepal, found a sector in \u201ccrisis\u201d with confusion over what was banned and permitted using US aid, a growing stigma around reproductive health services and widespread closures and scaling downs of programmes.Trump\u2019s ban also spawned a new wave of activism, including a new grassroots movement, SheDecides, which is pressuring policymakers around the world to commit to upholding reproductive and sexual health rights.Zara Ahmed, the associate director of federal issues at the Guttmacher Institute, said repealing the gag rule \u201cis just the first step in undoing [the US\u2019s] current status as the greatest global hindrance to reproductive health\u201d.\u201cWe are glad that the Biden-Harris administration is addressing the global gag rule \u2026 But let\u2019s be clear, repealing the global gag rule is the bare minimum this administration can do to address the harm caused by the previous administration\u2019s coercive and spiteful approach to foreign policy,\u201d she said.\u201cThe Biden-Harris administration can, and must, take a comprehensive approach to unravelling the dangerous, punitive and coercive policies the outgoing administration has woven into our foreign policy, and it must take action to address longstanding harmful policies like the Helms amendment.\u201dThe Helms amendment has been widely misinterpreted as a total ban on US funding used for abortion overseas, when in fact it can be used to support abortion in cases of rape, incest or a woman\u2019s life being in danger. A bill to permanently repeal it was introduced last year.On Thursday, the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights Act (Global Her Act) to permanently repeal the global gag rule will be introduced for the third time in Congress. The bill, co-sponsored by the new vice-president, Kamala Harris, has received cross-party support, and hopes are high it will pass.\u201cIt\u2019s not automatic and it\u2019s not going to be easy but we\u2019re starting in a very strong place to get the act passed,\u201d said Sippel. \u201cIf not the bill itself, but the language of the bill incorporated into another bill. Getting rid of the GGR, that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for.\u201dSippel also called on the Biden administration to disavow the \u201cGeneva consensus declaration\u201d \u2013 an anti-abortion policy Trump promoted last year \u2013 to \u201csignal to the world that abortion and LGBTQ rights and sexual and reproductive rights are important, and to state that loudly to the world\u201d.She added that some activists wanted the Biden administration to issue a formal apology for US policies on sexual and reproductive health and rights over the past four years.Biden also ordered funding restored to the UN population fund, UNFPA, which Trump stopped.The agency\u2019s executive director, Natalia Kanem, hailed the \u201cenormous\u201d impact of the decision.\u201cEnding funding to UNFPA has become a political football, far removed from the tragic reality it leads to on the ground. Women\u2019s bodies are not political bargaining chips, and their right to plan their pregnancies, give birth safely and live free from violence should be something we can all agree on,\u201d she said.Explore more on these topics'Global gag rule'Reproductive rights (Global development)Joe BidenReproductive rights (Society)HealthContraception and family planningUS politicsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
