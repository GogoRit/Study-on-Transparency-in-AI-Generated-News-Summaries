Ravens also have Bishop Cozzens\u2019 mom to thank.When he became Auxiliary Bishop of Saint Paul in Minneapolis in 2013, Cozzens became the seventh 21st century \u201cRaven Bishop\u201d to have graduated from Benedictine.Growing up, Bishop Cozzens mother would tell him, \u201cGod saved your life because he has a plan for you and your job is to find out what that plan is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true of everyone,\u201d said Bishop Cozzens, \u201cbut this story impressed that on me in a deeper way.\u201dCozzens helped found Ravens Respect Life at Benedictine College, the student group that elevated the trips students had been taking to D.C. since 1980.\u201cWe were the first group to organize trips to the March for Life to Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Bishop Cozzens. \u201cWe took a couple of buses back then.\u201dBut he almost wasn\u2019t there to start it.\u201cWhen my mom was 20 weeks pregnant with me, her water broke and she went immediately to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cShe and my father spent a night in prayer that they would not lose the baby. The next morning, the doctor came in after running some tests.\u201dThe doctor said, \u201cI need to tell you that your child is severely deformed.\u201d He recommended ending the pregnancy.Mrs. Cozzens said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d the doctor answered, \u201cthis child is a freak.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she answered.A second doctor said she could have the baby, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to lie in bed for the rest of this pregnancy.\u201dThe Cozzens agreed but worried about one thing: how would they pay for a months-long hospital stay not covered by insurance?The new doctor said not to worry. He had made a bet with the first doctor that she would deliver a healthy and normal child; whichever doctor lost the bet would pay.\u201cWhen the second doctor delivered me, he told the nurse to go get the other doctor and tell him to see his \u2018little freak,\u2019\u201d laughed Bishop Cozzens.The \u201cfreak\u201d would later help start the March for Life, and another student a few years behind him would take over: James Albers, who is now Abbot James of St. Benedict\u2019s Abbey on Benedictine\u2019s Atchison campus.Ravens for LifeThe first trips to the March began when the school\u2019s Knights of Columbus chapter brought a handful of students in cars, but the numbers began to grow.\u00a0 In 1989, Cozzens and other students at Benedictine College formed the Ravens Respect Life organization. They organized an official student trip to the next March in 1990.Heidi Klingele Gerst, class of 1993, remembered the red felt banner the college used to carry. \u201cWe made that banner in my parent\u2019s living room in 1990,\u201d she said.The students who led Ravens Respect Life then are leaders in the Church today, including St. Benedict Abbey\u2019s Abbot James Albers, \u201994, St. Benedict Parish Pastor Father Jeremy Hepler, \u201900, and Father Brendan Rolling, \u201999, who served for many years as chaplain of Benedictine College.Bishop Andrew Cozzens, \u201991, of Minnesota and Father Joseph Taphorn, \u201993, who helps lead the Archdiocese of Omaha, were also Ravens Respect Life Leaders.Raven alum Patti Peters said she was glad to see the torch passed. \u201cThank you for your next generation leadership,\u201d she wrote on the college\u2019s Facebook. \u201cAs a wise one once told me, \u2018If we don\u2019t have our right to life, do any of the other rights really matter?\u2019\u201dThis year, Ravens Respect Life Banners were spotted at marches from coast to coast as \u201cRavens for Life\u201d represent the college in local pro-life rallies, too.Bishop for Life\u201cThe pro-life issue has been in a certain way the key issue in the cultural battles that we are deeply immersed in in the United States,\u201d said Bishop Cozzens. \u201cBeing involved in the pro-life movement is a key to those who support the founding dream of the United States.\u201d\u201cCollege students need to be involved in that, if they will be involved in building a culture of life, which is one of the great tasks of this generation,\u201d he said.Thanks to him, Benedictine College students are.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1020 N. 2nd StreetAtchison, KS 66002\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n800-467-5340 \n\n \n\n\n\n\nContact \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Mail & Packages\nAt a Glance\nEvents Calendar\nVisit Campus\n\n\nJobs & Employment\nAlumni & Friends\nCollege News\nThe Raven Store\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\nEmployee Email\nStudent Email\nRavenZone\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nAccreditation\nConsumer Information\nResources\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a9\u00a02023 Benedictine\u00a0College\n  Campus \n\n\n\n\n Map \n\n Translation loading or unavailable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
