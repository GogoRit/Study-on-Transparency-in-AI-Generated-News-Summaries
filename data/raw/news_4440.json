That\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d Clemons told the crowd.\n\u201cWe are here in honour of all the people who have fought for this right, like Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg.\u201d\nIn confirmation hearings this week, Barrett side-stepped questions about presidential powers, abortion, climate change, voting rights and Obamacare, saying she could not answer because cases involving these matters could come before the court.\nIf Barrett takes a seat on the Supreme Court, conservatives would have a 6-3 majority.\nThe crowd chanted, \u2018Vote him out!\u2019 during Saturday\u2019s march in Washington, DC [Michael A McCoy/Reuters]\nIn Washington, DC, the protesters marched through the city\u2019s downtown area to the Supreme Court steps. Most wore protective masks, with some dressed as Ginsburg in black robes with white lace collars.\n\u201cVote for your daughter\u2019s future,\u201d read one message in the sea of signs carried by demonstrators. \u201cFight like a girl,\u201d said another.\nIn the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the latest women\u2019s rallies were considerably smaller, and organisers urged people worried about in-person participation to join in a \u201csocially distant text-banking telethon\u201d aimed at sending five million messages encouraging people to vote.\nA socially distanced march was held at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, outside the dormitory where Bader Ginsburg lived as an undergraduate student.\nIn New York City, a demonstrator wearing a Donald Trump mask stood next to a statue of George Washington at Federal Hall during the women\u2019s march outside the New York Stock Exchange.\n\u201cWe Dissent,\u201d said a cardboard sign carried by a young woman wearing a red mask with small portraits of Bader Ginsburg.\nPeople wearing masks gathered peacefully under sunny skies on the City Hall steps in Portland, Oregon to sing and listen to speakers. One speaker called for racial justice and an end to police brutality.\nMeanwhile, a conservative women\u2019s group, the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, said it was organising a counterprotest in the US capital on Saturday under the slogan, \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d, to show support for Barrett.\n\u201cThe Women\u2019s March flies under the banner of feminism, but it really isn\u2019t promoting equality or opportunity for women. That\u2019s why these so-called \u2018feminists\u2019 are fighting a highly qualified Supreme Court nominee,\u201d the group said on its website.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
