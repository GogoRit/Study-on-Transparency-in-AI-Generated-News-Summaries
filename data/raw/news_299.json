A university lecturer in the Argentine province of Neuqu\u00e9n, Zurbriggen spends her spare time helping other women get abortions in a country where the procedure is only legal in a few circumstances. Stuck at home because of a nationwide quarantine order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, women often need to speak at night, when their families or partners are asleep and can\u2019t hear them talking about their decision.Zurbriggen, 54, is a founding member of the Socorristas en Red (literally, Network of Lifeguards), a group of 504 activists spread across Argentina\u2019s territory. The socorristas help women navigate the country\u2019s health system, which, by law is meant to provide abortion in cases of rape or where the pregnancy is a risk to the health of the mother. Health ministry protocol uses the WHO\u2019s definition of health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well being, and not just an absence of illness.\u201d In practice, though, many doctors in the majority-Catholic country refuse to grant abortions without proof of a physical risk. It\u2019s impossible to get reliable data on either legal or clandestine abortions, but the Foundation for the Study and Research for Women (FEIM), estimates that legal abortions account for only about 20-25% of the 350,000 \u2013 450,000 terminations that take place in Argentina each year. Since 2012, the socorristas have been working to grow the proportion of abortions that take place in the legal system, building a list of sympathetic doctors, and connecting women with them, as well as providing emotional support throughout the abortion process. In 2019 they accompanied 12,575 women\u2014up from 1,116 five years ago.The pandemic has made their work a lot harder. Some of the doctors the socorristas rely on have been drafted into the COVID-19 effort and are no longer available to perform abortions. A strict lockdown since March 20, with Argentines only able to leave their homes to buy food or medicine, means all coordination and counselling must be done virtually, without meeting in person. The restriction on movement is also likely disrupting clandestine abortion services, making it difficult to justify or disguise trips for illicit activities. Advocates fear that women, desperate and uncertain of what is available, will resort in increasing numbers to unsafe homemade methods to obtain abortions during the pandemic. Such obstacles will be familiar to women across Latin America and the Caribbean, a region where 30 of 34 countries either ban abortion outright, or allow it only on restricted grounds. In Argentina, though, it\u2019s a particularly frustrating time for campaginers. A bill to legalize abortion\u2014the first ever with presidential backing\u2014was due to be presented to congress in mid-March, just as the nationwide lockdown began. It is now delayed till later this year.For now, Argentines are left to navigate an uneven and uncertain system \u2013 in isolation.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing really high levels of anxiety among the women we accompany. They have a psychological sense that there\u2019s no way out, no escape,\u201d says Zurbriggen, who has helped 16 women terminate their pregnancy since the lockdown began. \u201dThey think, if they don\u2019t even have the right to go out for exercise right now, how are they going to go out to get an abortion? We have to work hard to convince them that this is their right.\u201dCOVID-19 has created a perfect storm for both abortion demand and provision in countries where abortion is not fully legal, says physician Mabel Bianco, director of FEIM, the research institute, who has spent decades working to expand reproductive rights in Argentina. \u201cFirst, there will be more unwanted pregnancies,\u201d the 79-year-old says over Skype from her home in Buenos Aires. \u201cPutting the whole family in an enforced lockdown means that a lot of young girls are exposed to more sexual abuse. And women will have less ready access to contraception.\u201d The U.N. warned April 28 that lockdowns to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus could lead to 7 million additional unwanted pregnancies in low and middle income countries if they continue for 6 months. When women do go to seek abortions, they usually have to navigate a health system thrown into chaos by the pandemic. During the first few weeks of Argentina\u2019s lockdown measures, Bianco says, security agents were turning women away from hospitals because of a directive to only allow access for emergencies or COVID-19 cases. \u201cFor some people, abortion is not considered an emergency,\u201d she says. Since early March, doctors in some parts of the country, including the northern city of Cordoba, have been reporting shortages of misoprostol, the medication used in many early-term abortions, which imeant to be provided by provincial authorities.On April 13, Argentina\u2019s health ministry issued a directive clarifying that abortions on the two legal grounds\u2014known as a Legal Interruption of Pregnancy or ILE\u2014are an essential service. The national government said it would work with leaders of Argentina\u2019s 23 provinces to make sure access is guaranteed. But getting some provinces to guarantee abortion access is tough at the best of times, let alone during a lockdown, Bianco says. \u201cWe have a protocol on abortion written by the ministry of health that guarantees abortions on the grounds of rape, and mental, social and physical health. But eight provinces, mostly in the north, still refuse to apply it,\u201d she says. While \u201cconscientious objectors\u201d exist in other areas, Bianco says, it is particularly hard to access abortions in these northern provinces.  FEIM is advising women who are denied legal abortions to take legal action and lodge cases against hospitals with Argentina\u2019s National Institute Against Discrimination.When women can\u2019t access a legal abortion, advocates say, they rarely continue with an unwanted pregnancy. Instead, they seek out clandestine abortion providers. These services are sometimes safe. Those who can afford it pay for a clandestine abortion by a skilled doctor in a clinic, or to obtain medication. Poorer women, though, resort to inexperienced providers working in unsanitary conditions, or dangerous homemade methods, such as introducing parsley or a probe into the vagina. In 2016, the last year for which official data is available, 47,100 were hospitalized because of complications related to an abortion (that figure includes legal abortions) and 43 women died.Under lockdown, Bianco says, safe clandestine abortions will be harder to come by. With many non-emergency surgeries suspended during the pandemic, it will likely be difficult for doctors to admit women to perform these safe covert abortions. Instead, she says, more women will feel forced to take matters into their own hands. On April 28, Argentina\u2019s National Campaign for Abortion Rights said that a 22-year-old woman had died in Formosa province after attempting an unsafe abortion at home. \u201cThe pandemic is a risk to life,\u201d Bianco says. \u201cNot only from the virus, but also the consequences of being locked up for women and girls.\u201dA woman wears a green handkerchief, symbolic of Argentina's abortion rights movement, (pro-abortion) as she walks past people lined up to enter to a supermarket during the COVID-19 outbreak in Buenos Aires, on March 19, 2020.JUAN MABROMATA/AFP via Getty ImagesThe socorristas are working overtime, Zurbriggen says, to make sure women don\u2019t need to use dangerous improvised methods to terminate pregnancies during lockdown. \u201cWith fewer sympathetic doctors available, we have to do much more painstaking work to make sure women are connected with one.\u201d Women in need call one of the 54 collectives of socorristas spread out across the country. The socorristas then set up a video chat with an \u201caccompanier\u201d like Zurbriggen, who advises the woman on where they can seek out a doctor who will prescribe misoprostol, or otherwise help with the abortion. The activists advise on how to take the medication, as well as offering emotional support. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard not to be able to meet these women in person.\u201dThe socorristas are also using social media to share information on the risks of homemade abortion methods. One of the best things about the so-called green wave, as Argentina\u2019s abortion campaign is dubbed for its symbolic green handkerchief \u201cis that it\u2019s meant people are talking a lot more about their reproductive rights,\u201d Zurbriggen says. That education is crucial to ensuring more women can have safe abortions. That pattern is seen in other Latin American countries, says Mariangela Urbina, 26, co-host of Las Igualadas, a YouTube channel that covers gender issues in Colombia. Like Argentina, the country allows abortion on the grounds of rape and physical and mental health risks, as well as in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. \u201cBut it\u2019s a really taboo issue,\u201d she says. \u201cMany schools still don\u2019t teach about sexuality or contraception. That means you get a lot of disinformation.\u201dOn April 14, three weeks into Colombia\u2019s lockdown to fight COVID-19, Las Igualadas published a video titled simply \u201cHow do I have an abortion at home?\u201d, (\u201ca question a lot of women are asking themselves right now,\u201d Urbina says) offering information about how to arrange a video consultation with a doctor to obtain a prescription for misoprostol. The video provoked swift backlash from conservative media and anti-abortion groups, including people calling Urbina a murderer and wishing for her to contract the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that it caused a particular controversy, because the law has not changed under coronavirus. I think that shows that people don\u2019t understand what abortion is. They think of it as some big, terrifying thing, but actually it\u2019s [often] just a case of taking medication.\u201dIn Argentina, Zurbriggen hopes that lawmakers will soon remove the obstacles that have been intensified under lockdown. When congress comes back in session, she expects the legalization bill to pass. In 2018, a similar bill passed the lower house but was narrowly defeated in the senate. This time is likely to be equally tight: feminist data project Economia Feminista counts 32 votes in favor, 36 against, and four undecided. \u201cPersonally I believe that [President Alberto] Fernandez wouldn\u2019t have made such a public commitment to it unless he had certain assurances in the senate that it would be successful,\u201d Zurbriggen says. In the meantime, she says, the socorristas will continue their work. \u201cQuarantine or no quarantine, we\u2019ve got each other.\u201dMore Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
