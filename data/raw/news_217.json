She chided Marija, who was seven weeks along, for not starting her vitamins sooner and sent her home.\u00a0But Marija (not her real name) was devastated. Six days earlier, she had tried to terminate the pregnancy with abortion pills she ordered online. But she had experienced terrible morning sickness throughout her pregnancy, and had thrown up after taking the first of the two pills. She was worried the medication had not had time to work before she vomited. After taking the second pill and bleeding for a few days, she went to the hospital to find out if she had miscarried.Marija could not tell the nurse about the pills. Abortion is illegal in all circumstances in Malta, the only EU country that has a total ban on the procedure with no exceptions for rape, incest, foetal abnormality or the health of the mother. It is also highly taboo in the staunchly Catholic island nation. So Marija listened to the advice about the pregnancy the nurse thought was wanted, went home and booked a flight to the UK.In mid-February, Marjia flew to London to have a surgical abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in Ealing. She travelled alone, staying two nights in a hotel before flying home. The pills had cost \u20ac100. Overall, the trip cost \u20ac1,500, equivalent to a month\u2019s salary for the 34-year-old accountant. She split the fee with her boyfriend.\u00a0A month later, Marija\u2019s journey would have been all but impossible. Malta officially closed its borders as part of its coronavirus lockdown on 11 March, in effect also shutting any legal route to abortion. Currently, ordering pills online is the only way to terminate a pregnancy on the island, and it is a criminal offence.\u00a0If Marija had not been able to get out before the borders closed, \u201cI think I would be dead by now\u201d she says \u2013 rendered suicidal by the idea of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.\u201cWhen I saw that positive test, I was so scared and trapped. You don\u2019t think properly, you don\u2019t have anywhere to go. You\u2019re stuck here.\u201dThe Abortion Support Network, a charity that helps people travel from Malta, Gibraltar and Poland to access abortions in countries with more liberal laws, saw a dramatic increase in calls to its hotline when borders closed in March. \u201cThe contacts we are getting are a lot more frantic,\u201d says the network\u2019s founder, Mara Clarke.At the moment, the charity is advising women who are under the 12-week cut-off point for a medical abortion to order abortion pills online from Women on Web and Women Help Women, which distribute the medication worldwide, usually for a donated fee.\u00a0There are indications that a very small number have been able to leave the island for an abortion during the pandemic, but the overwhelming majority are turning to abortion pills. Women Help Women told the Guardian demand from Malta had tripled since the pandemic began.\u00a0Malta\u2019s abortion law dates to the British colonial period. Under the criminal code, anyone who seeks or assists with a termination can be sentenced to up to three years in prison. But prosecutions are rare.\u00a0\u201cThis pandemic has cemented how dire the situation is, how desperate women are, how absolutely ugly it is to have a total ban,\u201d says Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer and founder of the Women\u2019s Rights Foundation.\u00a0But Dimitrijevic and many other activists point out that the travel ban has merely accentuated an existing problem, where legal abortion is only available to those who can afford a flight out of the country.\u201cThe women who would generally travel now have to resort to a situation where they have to purchase pills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to become criminals.\u201dClarke puts it more bluntly: \u201cNow almost everybody knows what it\u2019s like to be a poor woman living in a country with a bad abortion law.\u201dThe Women\u2019s Rights Foundation is part of the first wave of abortion activism ever to take place in Malta and has been joined by a handful of advocates for change, grouped under the collective Voice for Choice which organised Malta\u2019s first ever demonstration against the abortion ban in September last year.Isabel Stabile, the only openly pro-choice gynaecologist in Malta, and a member of Doctors for Choice, says she has seen an increase in patients seeking advice about unwanted pregnancies.\u00a0\u201cThe vast majority of them have had terrible stories, stories on the lines of, \u2018I\u2019ve got a diagnosis of a serious congenital anomaly and the [Maltese] National Health Service won\u2019t do anything about it, because the law is what it is \u2013 can you help me?\u2019\u201dThe well-travelled route from Valletta to London for those needing abortions mirrors the journeys of thousands who had to leave Ireland and Northern Ireland to end unwanted pregnancies before liberalisation in those countries.\u00a0Charmaine (not her real name), who travelled to the UK from Malta to end a pregnancy in 2011, describes her country as \u201clike Ireland on steroids\u201d when it comes to abortion \u2013 \u201cin terms of how small we are, how tight-knit we are, how difficult it is to to leave the country\u201d.Many in the Maltese pro-choice movement point to the case of Savita Halappanavar, who died of septicaemia after doctors in an Irish hospital refused her a termination while she was miscarrying in 2012. There have been close calls in Malta too \u2013\u00a0in 2014, Canadian holidaymaker Marion Mifsud Mora was refused a termination after her waters broke at 17 weeks\u2019 gestation, and she had to be flown out of the country to end the pregnancy and fight off the ensuing infection.\u00a0Marija has not told anyone except her boyfriend about her abortion. \u201cHere, even if you say the word that you agree with abortion, they look at you sideways,\u201d she says.\u00a0No one interviewed for this article who had had an abortion wanted their real name used, mainly because family support would not be available. \u201cIf my father knew I had an abortion \u2026 I\u2019m sure he would disown me,\u201d Charmaine says.Anti-abortion sentiment cuts across Maltese social and economic lines. Even university students are mostly opposed to it. Children are still shown the notorious 1984 anti-abortion film, The Silent Scream, as part of sex education.\u00a0View image in fullscreenAnti-abortion demonstrators in Malta\u2019s capital, Valletta, protesting at the legalising of over-the-counter emergency contraception. Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/ReutersDimitrijevic says she has had bullets left at her home for her pro-choice stance, and had her car tyres slashed. Mina Tolu, who ran unsuccessfully on a Green party ticket during the 2019 European parliament elections, was hit with a wave of online vitriol after releasing a video which challenged Maltese politicians to discuss abortion. One of the party\u2019s co-founders quit in protest.\u201cYou cannot prepare yourself for those comments. I regret not having had a strong enough support network to help me get over the barrage,\u201d Tolu says.But the fault lines have changed over time. Alfred Sant, who served as Malta\u2019s prime minister in the 1990s and is now an MEP, has seen it firsthand.\u201cWhen the government started stocking contraceptive pills in state clinics in the late 70s or early 80s, all hell broke loose,\u201d the veteran politician recalls. \u201cThen a few years ago, the controversy focused on legalising the morning-after pill.\u201dSant, 72, describes himself as \u201cleaning towards pro-choice\u201d but qualifies that by saying that the issue is \u201cnot a cut and dried one\u201d. He was the only one of Malta\u2019s six MEPs to vote in favour of a resolution in March which called on EU member states not to use the pandemic as an excuse to restrict reproductive health services.\u201cIn private, people admit that there\u2019s a hypocrisy to our stance. Politicians, too,\u201d Sant says. \u201cThey know that Maltese are going abroad to get abortions and that there are local doctors who recommend abortions. They admit that there are scenarios when abortion is justified. But they won\u2019t say so publicly.\u201dHe believes the public mood is gradually shifting and says it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that abortion will eventually be legalised.But that looks unlikely during this political term. Former prime minister Joseph Muscat, who resigned in January after the scandal surrounding the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, hinted that he would push for a national debate on abortion in his resignation speech. But his successor, Robert Abela, poured cold water on that notion, affirming his anti-abortion stance immediately afterwards. President George Vella, a former doctor, vehemently opposes legalisation, and has spoken at anti-abortion rallies.Malta is due to reopen its borders on 1 July. But that does not mean accessing abortion overseas will suddenly be easy. Currently, the list of 17 countries to which travel will be permitted does not include the main destinations for abortions \u2013 the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. The headline on this article was amended on 15 June 2020 to remove a reference to Ireland, where abortion is now legal, as stated in the article.Explore more on these topicsMaltaThis is EuropeAbortionCoronavirusEuropeHealthWomenWomen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
