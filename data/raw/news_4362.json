It will include a Q&A period, monitored by the league.Baird was central to three U.S. Supreme Court cases that helped legalize birth control and abortion. In spite of all he has done, he\u00a0has not been embraced by some major groups fighting for the same cause. It may be that he has not been able to convince them that he is sincerely interested in helping women, and some feminists have derided him as an outcast and a self-promoter.Anti-choice activists have shot at him, bombed his clinic - and even offered to pray for him. He was jailed eight times in five states in the 1960s for merely lecturing on abortion and birth control.I asked Baird how he came to the attention of our local League of Women Voters. He tells Snyder's Stoughton, \"I have known Steve Fradkin for many years. He's a good guy. I have talked to him and his wife, Sharon, throughout the years. I had worked for legalizing abortion and birth control for people at any age.\"I had no patience with the opposition from the Church. It was not a popular stance in Catholic Boston. But I always felt don't make other people believe what you believe by law, and make criminals out of them, if they don't believe.\"I ran a free clinic for years. Some of my patients were nuns. So, I knew priests were having sex with nuns. Then,\u00a0 the Cardinal sent me letters denigrating me. He ended up fleeing to the Vatican and died there, after the child sex abuse scandal.\"We have separation of Church & State. I said the Church was a multi-billion dollar corporation. I always wondered who should make a decision on an unwanted pregnancy? Should it be the government or you? Anyways, when Sharon reached out, I couldn't say no!\"Baird told me, \"I have no fight if you want to believe in anything. I just don't want to be sent to jail for disagreeing with you. I tested the law, using the law's own verbiage. April 6, 1967 Time Magazine's cover pictured birth control pills. I pasted real birth control pills and St. Joseph Aspirin and asked if they wanted to arrest me.\"I went after Cardinal Cushing's Rhythm Method booklet, which was selling for 10 cents. Why was that allowed, but not talks or writing on birth control? I carried the Bible, and illustrated the \"withdrawal method\" of birth control, which was portrayed in it ('spilling the seed.').\"If you were under 21, you were a minor. I gave a 19-year-old some contraceptive foam and a condom. Half a dozen police handcuffed me. I took out my Zayre's receipt for the foam. The attorney general was collecting a tax on it!\"My goal was to implicate these multi-million dollar businesses. It would have made it easier for me. I called for the arrest of the AG. Yet, I was convicted. Eight-hundred BU students signed a petition asking me to come and talk about birth control.\u00a0 I told them no, originally.\u00a0 I had four little kids and a wife in NYC. I was told the Boston ACLU was there, and would have my back. James Hamilton, their director, went to the police station with me.\u00a0 Hamilton three weeks later, tells me your case has no constitutional value!\u00a0\"I was from New York. \u00a0I had good faith in the local people in Massachusetts. I called F. Lee Bailey. He had a murder case. Joe Balliro, a criminal attorney, took the case. I wanted to lose, because then I'd have a criminal case I could bring to the Supreme Court. Even though the chances are slim of getting there, but if they decided it, it would help so many young girls. I was mentioned five times in the Roe vs. Wade decision.\" \u00a0He continued, \"My biggest ally, on paper, was Planned Parenthood. But they told me there is nothing to be gained by the Baird case. He's an embarrassment. The National Organization of Women (NOW) wouldn't back me, even though I was fighting for women.\u00a0 The Boston newspaper and the Catholic Church called me the Devil. I came from NY to help the people of MA and the USA.\"I lost my first wife and my four children when I was arrested on a morals charge. A 14-month-old baby was at my talk. They charged the mother, who allowed her baby in, and me. I faced three years in jail. We won the case. I got letters from all over the country threatening to kill my children. So, I had to leave NY - and them. We haven't spoken since. I cannot and will not reconcile with them. They knew what I went through at Charles Street jail. I had a very difficult time there.\" (Baird's lockup in Charles Street Jail in Boston featured rats in his cell, bugs in his food, lice on his prison mattress and humiliating body searches by guards.)He continued, \"Their goal was to break me. The Supreme Court rejected me the first time.\u00a0 But, you have to write an appeal in a certain way, on certain paper, and it took several grand to write it, as they required. Playboy assisted me. I had no money. I was happy to take their funding. The feminists rejected me, and I was fighting for them. I'm not the sexual pied piper. I was just a guy who grew up in the Great Depression, and I lost my sister and a brother because we had no money for a doctor. This enabled me to become tough enough to have the courage to fight back.\"\u00a0Added Baird, \"Planned Parenthood sued me. Their literature in the 1960s opposed abortion. Money makes history. They rewrote their history. They take credit for legalizing birth control, but their case was for legally married couples in CT. I argued that anyone deserved that right.\u00a0 I fight for gays, women and Blacks. I'm not one of any of those groups.\"\u00a0\u00a0So, why did he dedicate his life - and give up so much - to the cause of birth control and abortion rights? It's well documented that he was a medical school dropout who was working as clinical director at a pharmaceutical contraceptive company in 1963 when he was making a routine call to Harlem Hospital and witnessed the death of a woman from a self-attempted coat hanger abortion. The woman, a mother of nine, died in his arms.\u201cI vowed then to help my fellow poor gain access to the same rights and care that the wealthy were able to get back, when only women of means could get birth control and family planning services,\u201d he said.He went from bystander to activist, at that moment.His 1967 case (Eisenstadt v. Baird)\u00a0 led to the Supreme Court striking down a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people for the purpose of preventing pregnancy, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.Baird's three Supreme Court victories gave all teens and single women complete reproductive and birth control rights. He will share his story and view for the future of reproductive rights in his Zoom call.In my thirty minutes with him, he was nonstop. At 88, he's 100% cognitive, and still as motivated and passionate as ever about his cause. He spent quite a few years with death threats over his life, and his family's lives. His wife, Joni Baird, reached out to Father Pavone of Priests For Life, and both agreed to stop the hateful rhetoric aimed at each side. That helped ease the situation.Baird has devoted all of his adult life fighting for this cause, and still continues to speak publicly about his experiences, in particular, and the issue in general. The Sharon-Stoughton League, along with the LWV of MA and the LWV of US have studied reproductive rights issues over the years and have taken a position in support of these rights. This presentation brings a top-notch national speaker to our region.The Sharon-Stoughton League of Women Voters is more than 50 years old in both towns and has been a joint league for more than 25 years.
