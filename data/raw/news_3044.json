Since 1993, Pavone has been the national director of the pro-life movement Priests for Life, which claims to be the \"biggest ministry in the Catholic Church devoted on ending abortion\".\u00a0\nPavone, a steadfast Trump supporter and whose Twitter handle still has a picture of the former president, earlier had been admonished by Bishop Patrick Zurek of Amarillo for his partisan activism as former advisory board member of the group \"Catholics for Trump\" in 2016 and a co-chair of Trump\u2019s 2020 pro-life coalition. Canon law forbids clerics from having an active role in political parties without permission from their bishop.\u00a0\n\n    \"Father\u00a0Pavone\u00a0had no reasonable justification for his actions\"\n\nIn 2016,\u00a0Pavone was reprimanded for placing an aborted fetus on an altar and sharing a video of it on two social media platforms. The post that accompanied the video said Trump and the Republican Party sought to protect unborn children while Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party would enable abortion to continue. Bishop Zurek had already placed limitations on Pavone\u2019s ministry since 2011 but the priest managed to appeal those sanctions.\u00a0\nNow, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, apostolic nuncio to the United States, told the US Catholic bishops in a letter that\u00a0there was no chance for Pavone to appeal the decision taken by the Vatican on November 9.\u00a0\u201cFather Pavone was given ample opportunity to defend himself in the canonical proceedings, and he was also given multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop. It was determined that Father\u00a0Pavone\u00a0had no reasonable justification for his actions,\u201d explains a statement attached to the nuncio's letter.\nThe statement also said that since Priests for Life \u201cis not a Catholic organization\u201d, Pavone\u2019s continuing role in it as a lay person would be entirely up to the leadership of that organization. Originally based in Staten Island, New York, Priests for Life is now headquartered in Titusville, Florida. The organization has also been embroiled in management and financial scandals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his dismissal from the clerical state,\u00a0Pavone has in a social media video promised to continue the anti-abortion \"battle\" and decried the \"cancel culture\" of the church, which he claimed had harassed him for decades. Also, in a statement on his Priest for Life website,\u00a0Pavone claimed that his laicization, whereby he can no longer present himself as a Catholic priest, was \"the product of an oppressive process\" and that he was thinking about taking unspecified legal action against unnamed U.S. bishops.\u00a0\nPavone was also in the forefront of putting abortion above all other issues, joining in the insistence that it's okay for Catholics to favor the death penalty. \"Regarding the death penalty, if there is a growing consensus that we should not kill the guilty, let's get everyone on board that we should not kill the innocent! (This is for you, Democrat Party!)\", he had tweeted.\u00a0\nThis year Pavone\u00a0celebrated the 35th anniversary of his regular television show, \"Defending Life,\" on EWTN (Eternal Word Television Network), a U.S. cable television network that presents around-the-clock Catholic-themed programming known its for its partisan political focus and anti-Pope Francis coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Priest\n                                \n\n                                    Life\n                                \n\n                                    Church\n                                \n\n                                    Bishop\n                                \n\n                                    Donald Trump\n                                \n\n                                    Hillary Clinton\n                                \n\n                                    US\n                                \n\n                                    Catholic Church\n                                \n\n                                    New\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\nTerms of sale\nTerms and conditions\nContact Us\nCookie settings\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bayard - All rights reserved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
