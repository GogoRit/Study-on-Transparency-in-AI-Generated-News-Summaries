Elise Stefanik (R-NY) speaks during a town hall event hosted by House Republicans ahead of President Joe Bidens first State of the Union address tonight on March 1, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThis Saturday marks one year since the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade, ushering in an absolutely disastrous period for abortion rights. In the 12 months since 49 years of precedent was wiped out, abortion has been banned or restricted in 20 states. In Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, near-total bans are in effect. In Georgia and North Dakota, the medical procedure is prohibited after six weeks, a period when many people do not even know they\u2019re pregnant. (Florida governor Ron DeSantis has also signed a six-week ban that is pending court ruling.) In Oklahoma, a woman with a nonviable pregnancy putting her life at risk was told to sit in a parking lot until her situation got worse. In Tennessee, a woman required a lifesaving hysterectomy after she was denied a medically necessary abortion. According to the Associated Press, \u201cMore than 25 million women ages 15 to 44, or about 2 in 5 nationally, now live in states where there are more restrictions on abortion access than there were before Dobbs.\u201d In two states, obtaining an abortion can result in prison time.Not surprisingly, a majority of the voters in the country are deeply unhappy about all of this, with a majority of Americans saying abortion laws are too strict. Six in 10 say the Supreme Court was wrong to overturn Roe.The response from Republicans willing to discuss the matter? A push to further gut reproductive rights. Per The New Republic:.\u2026on Tuesday, Representative Elise Stefanik indicated that she and her colleagues will introduce a bill banning abortion nationwide after 15 weeks. \u201cThe people are the most important voices\u201d on abortion, Stefanik\u00a0said, apparently not seeing the irony of her words. Speaking at an event to mark the\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0ruling, hosted by the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Stefanik argued that the federal government does have a role in abortion legislation, particularly in \u201cbuilding consensus\u201d nationally on the topic. \u201cWe should embrace this debate,\u201d Stefanik said.Stefanik\u2019s announcement takes Republicans\u2019 war on abortion rights to the next level. Last year, when Senator Lindsey Graham\u00a0introduced\u00a0a federal 15-week abortion ban just before the midterms, many of his colleagues slammed the move. The bill never made it to the Senate floor. But Stefanik is signaling that more Republicans are ready to embrace a national ban.As TNR notes, \u201cthere is already a national consensus on abortion rights,\u201d and it\u2019s that abortion should be legal in \u201call or most cases.\u201d Republicans, though, have a long history of not caring about the will of the people, and one person who definitely doesn\u2019t care about what Americans want when it comes to abortion is 2024 presidential candidate Mike Pence, who on Friday insisted every GOP candidate must support a national abortion ban.https://twitter.com/DNCWarRoom/status/1672249691172659200Last month, Donald Trump\u2014who, unlike Pence, actually has a chance of winning the GOP nomination\u2014bragged that he\u2019d managed to kill the national right to an abortion, saying: \u201cAfter 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill\u00a0Roe v. Wade,\u00a0much to the \u2018shock\u2019 of everyone, and for the first time put the Pro Life movement in a strong negotiating position over the Radicals that are willing to kill babies even into their 9th month,* and beyond.** Without me there would be no 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to. Without me the pro Life movement would have just kept losing. Thank you President TRUMP!!!\u201d Then he claimed that in a second term, he\u2019s going to \u201cmake a really great deal\u201d on abortion.*This is obviously not true.**This would mean after the baby is born, so also not true.If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.Lindsey Graham: I\u2019m for federalism except for when I\u2019m notX contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Fact-check: Republicans absolutely started this culture warX contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Most PopularPhotos From Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee the Glam in Motion on the Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2024 Glam CamBy Kase WickmanBarry Keoghan, Charles Melton, and Hunter Schafer Kick Off Oscar Week in Style at Vanity Fair and Instagram\u2019s Vanities PartyBy Kara WarnerChecking in on the world\u2019s most cringeworthy feudX contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Elsewhere!Boebert Fails to Impeach Biden, Succeeds in Embarrassing GOPIntelligencer \u2022\u00a0Read MoreKamala Harris\u2019s 2024 Role Crystallizes Around Abortion RightsVanity Fair \u2022\u00a0Read MoreSpecial counsel trades immunity for fake elector testimony as Jan 6 probe heats upCNN \u2022\u00a0Read MoreNew video undercuts claim Twitter censored pro-Trump views before Jan. 6The Washington Post \u2022\u00a0Read MoreHouse Freedom Caucus faces an internal purge pushPolitico \u2022\u00a0Read MoreThe Super Connector Who Built Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Celebrity WorldThe New York Times \u2022\u00a0Read MoreDeSantis ponders what it would be like to chill with JesusNBC News \u2022\u00a0Read MoreMystery llama on the loose in ScotlandUPI \u2022\u00a0Read MoreThe Ultimate Guide to the 2024 OscarsThe Biggest Moments From the Oscars 2024Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee Every Look From the Oscars Red CarpetFrom Emma Stone to LeBron James, Stars Collided at the 2024 VF Oscar PartyOppenheimer\u2019s Golden Night at the OscarsBillie Eilish, Lily Gladstone, and More Stars of Mark Seliger\u2019s 2024 Oscar Party PortraitsAll the Glam From the Oscar Party Red Carpet11 Spectacular Stars Unite for the 30th Annual Hollywood IssueStay in the know and subscribe to Vanity Fair for just $2.50 $1 per month.Bess LevinPolitics CorrespondentBess Levin is a politics correspondent at Vanity Fair.
