The law, however, is rarely enforced, with the last known case of someone being jailed dating from 1980.The ruling Labour Party bill introduces a new clause into the country\u2019s criminal code allowing for the termination of a pregnancy if the mother\u2019s life is at risk or if her health is in serious jeopardy. Performing an abortion in such cases would no longer be considered a crime.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the spirit of this law is that no part of the law should preclude or hinder medical professionals from saving lives,\u201d Health Minister Chris Fearne told The Associated Press after the bill was presented in Parliament. \nThe Labour Party-led government enjoys a comfortable majority in Parliament, suggesting passage of the bill in some form was likely. The opposition Nationalist Party didn\u2019t immediately comment on the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalta is one of the few Western states that has a total ban on abortion, after the republic of San Marino decriminalized the procedure last year and other overwhelmingly Catholic countries such as Ireland and Italy have legalized it. Poland last year introduced a near-total ban on abortion, except when a woman\u2019s life or health is endangered or if the pregnancy results from rape or incest. The Maltese proposed legislation doesn\u2019t provide an exception for rape or incest.\n\nMalta\u2019s strict laws were thrust into the spotlight last summer when an American tourist vacationing on the island, Andrea Prudente, experienced heavy bleeding followed by a premature rupture of the amniotic sac and the separation of the placenta. Her partner, Jay Weeldreyer, said at the time that she was at risk of a life-threatening infection if the fetal tissue wasn\u2019t promptly removed. While the hospital in Malta carefully monitored her for any signs of infection, it couldn\u2019t perform the surgery to complete the miscarriage. Prudente was then airlifted to a hospital on the Spanish island of Mallorca.Prudente subsequently filed a case in the Maltese courts arguing that the country\u2019s ban breached international laws. The case is in the initial stages of evidence, according to her lawyer, Dr. Lara Dimitrijevic.Separately, at least two judicial protests were filed in Maltese courts demanding the legalization of abortion, including one by Women\u2019s Rights Foundation, which asserted that the country\u2019s absolute ban violated the fundamental human rights of Maltese women of child-bearing age. Another was filed in response to the Prudente case by Doctors for Choice, a non-profit organization of medical professionals advocating for safe and legal access to reproductive services including abortion. \n\n\u201cWe are very pleased that the government has heeded our pleas, and those of 135 doctors who signed a judicial protest last June, to stop the dangerous situation that pregnant women in Malta are finding themselves in,\u201d said Doctors for Choice co-founder, Dr. Natalie Psaila. But she said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cAbortion needs to be decriminalized completely, as well as be available for other health reasons such as in cases of pregnancies in children, rape or fatal fetal abnormalities.\u201dThe group has estimated that at least 300 women in Malta have abortions every year, either by traveling to countries where abortion is legal or by obtaining abortion pills.Malta had been criticized by the Council of Europe\u2019s human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, over its abortion policy. In a February report, Mijatovi\u0107 said that \u201cunimpeded access to sexual and reproductive health care\u201d was critical to preserving a woman\u2019s rights to health and to be free from discrimination.\u201cMalta\u2019s blanket ban on abortions puts these rights at significant risk,\u201d she said.She \u201cstrongly urged\u201d Maltese authorities to repeal provisions criminalizing abortion and to develop women\u2019s access to legal and safe abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
