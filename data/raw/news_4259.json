reproductive health, including abortions, from the UN\u2019s humanitarian response plan to the coronavirus pandemic to \u201cavoid creating controversy.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThe United States stands with nations that have pledged to protect the unborn,\u201d acting Administrator of USAID John Barsa wrote in a letter to UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Monday. \u201cTo achieve global unity toward this goal, it is essential that the UN\u2019s response to the pandemic avoid creating controversy. Therefore, I ask that you remove references to \u2018sexual and reproductive health,\u2019 and its derivatives from the Global HRP, and drop the provision of abortion as an essential component of the UN\u2019s priorities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n    \n\n            Though the US blocked a UN Security Council resolution that called for a global ceasefire aimed at collectively addressing the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the globe earlier this month, Barsa said the references risked undermining a united response to the crisis.\n    \n\n            \u201cNow is not the time to add unnecessary discord to the Covid-19 response,\u201d Barsa wrote.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nAllies despair as Trump abandons America's leadership role at a time of global crisis\n\n\n\n\n            The UN \u201cshould not use this crisis as an opportunity to advance access to abortion as an \u2018essential service,\u2019 \u201d Barsa said. He also said it is \u201cmost egregious\u201d that the UN\u2019s Global Humanitarian Response plan \u201ccalls for the widespread distribution of abortion-inducing drugs and abortion supplies, and for the promotion of abortion in local country settings.\u201d\n    \n\n            Barsa says the US has given $45.3 million to UN agencies to combat the coronavirus pandemic though the Trump administration has frozen funding for the World Health Organization, which is a UN health agency.  \n    \n\n            Barsa\u2019s letter is receiving criticism from human rights groups.\n    \n\n            \u201cUSAID should be ashamed for its outlandish attempt to use coronavirus as a means of dismantling a long-standing sexual and reproductive health rights framework from the UN\u2019s pandemic response,\u201d said Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE). \u201cWhen the United States steps away from an internationally agreed upon SRHR framework, it steps away from protecting women\u2019s right to life.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019re watching you and we will hold you accountable every step of the way throughout this response,\u201d Sippel said.  \n    \n\n            UN health documents often refer to sexual and reproductive health and say it is central to the international agency\u2019s broader goal of accelerating development, particularly efforts to improve mother and child mortality and health care. Global health experts say now is not the time to launch an attack on sexual and reproductive services.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 14: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the daily briefing of the White House Coronavirus Task Force in the Rose Garden at the White House April 14, 2020 in Washington, DC.

In fact, they increase,\u201d Michelle Nunn, president and CEO of CARE USA, wrote on Twitter.\n    \n\n            The letter marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to try and impose their policy of not spending US taxpayer dollars to fund abortions on the United Nations. \n    \n\n            The \u201cMexico City Policy\u201d \u2013 which has been implemented on and off since 1985 \u2013 conditions US funding for global family planning on a commitment from NGOs that they won\u2019t promote or perform abortions using funds from any source.\n    \n\n            The Trump administration has expanded the rule to apply not just to funding for family planning, but all global health assistance, including funding for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, nutrition and other programs.\n    \n\n            Last year the administration pushed the UN to drop mentions of reproductive health from official documents \u2013 arguing that such references could promote the use of abortions.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights in UN documents, because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices, like abortion, in circumstances that do not enjoy international consensus and which can be misinterpreted by UN agencies,\u201d US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at the United Nations general assembly.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
