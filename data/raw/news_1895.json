It also cited a decreasing number of deliveries and a loss of doctors among other factors in its decision.Those pregnant in the city of about 9,000 \u2014 with an average annual snowfall of about 60 inches (150 centimeters) \u2014 will most likely have to travel about 45 miles (70 kilometers) to Coeur d\u2019Alene for care, or to hospitals farther away in Idaho, Washington and Montana.The decision to discontinue providing obstetrical services was emotional and difficult, hospital officials said in a news release.\n\n\u201cWe have made every effort to avoid eliminating these services,\u201d Ford Elsaesser, Bonner General Health\u2019s Board president, said in the release. \u201cWe hoped to be the exception, but our challenges are impossible to overcome now.\u201d The numbers of deliveries had been declining for years with 265 births recorded at the hospital in 2022, the statement said. Births also have been decreasing nationally and older people have been moving into the Sandpoint area, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho considers a ban on using public funds or facilities for gender-affirming care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to know about developments impacting LGBTQ+ rights across the US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers expressed concern over bowed beams, structural issues before Idaho hangar collapse killed 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital officials said Idaho\u2019s legal and political climate was partly to blame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the United States Supreme Court stripped away constitutional protections for abortion last year, Idaho banned nearly all abortions in measures that subject physicians to prosecution for providing any abortions, even if needed to protect the health of a pregnant patient. \u201cThe Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care,\u201d the hospital statement said. \u201cConsequences for Idaho physicians providing the standard of care may include civil litigation and criminal prosecution, leading to jail time or fines.\u201d\n\nPhysicians could face felony charges and a medical license revocation for violating the law, which the Idaho Supreme Court determined earlier this year is constitutional. A federal judge has stopped Idaho from enforcing the ban in medical emergencies at Medicare-funded facilities.Highly respected, talented physicians are leaving, according to Bonner hospital officials, who said recruiting replacements would be extraordinarily difficult.Dr. Amelia Huntsberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Bonner General Hospital, moved to Sandpoint in 2012 to work in the area, according to a court filing last year supporting an effort to halt the abortion ban.She told the Idaho Capital Sun in Boise by email that she will leave the hospital and the state because of the abortion laws and because of the Idaho Legislature\u2019s decision to discontinue the state\u2019s maternal mortality review committee. \u201cFor rural patients in particular, delaying medical care until we can say an abortion is necessary to prevent death is dangerous,\u201d she said in her court filing. \u201cPatients will suffer pain, complications, and could die if physicians comply with Idaho law as written.\u201d\n\nHuntsberger could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press and messages left for her with a hospital spokeswoman were not returned.Leandra Wright told KREM-TV that after having a baby at Bonner General Health in 2020 she had been looking forward to the birth of her son there in August.Wright, who lives in the nearby town of Sagle, said she learned about the hospital\u2019s decision from a Facebook post.\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-wracking and stressful and my stomach just kind of drops,\u201d Wright said. \u201cNow I have to reestablish with another place and I have to drive to have my baby.\u201dOfficials at Kootenai Health in Coeur d\u2019Alene said in a Facebook post that anyone who would have given birth at Bonner General Health can go to Kootenai Health\u2019s Family Birth Center, where about 2,200 babies are born each year.\u201cLeadership from both hospitals are working together to identify any barriers to care for the patient population affected by this closure and are creating solutions to ensure a quality birth experience,\u201d the post said.___Associated Press writer Claire Rush in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
