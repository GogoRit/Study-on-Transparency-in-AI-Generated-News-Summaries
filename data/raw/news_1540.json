Sign up for our daily newsletter.\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has allowed the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban to take effect, which will further erode abortion access in the South.\nThe ban, which Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in May, will take effect immediately. Until now, abortion has been legal up to 22 weeks of pregnancy in South Carolina \u2014 the latest of any state in the South \u2014 and the state\u2019s three abortion clinics provided care up to 14 weeks.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision marks a reversal from a ruling issued this past January, in which the court struck down a similar six-week ban. Lawyers for Planned Parenthood, which operates two of the state\u2019s three abortion clinics, argued that the January ruling made clear that South Carolina\u2019s state constitution protected the right to an abortion and that a ban at six weeks made the procedure functionally unobtainable. (Many people do not know they are pregnant at six weeks.)\nBut the court\u2019s makeup is different than it was in January, with its sole woman justice, who wrote that opinion, retiring in February. South Carolina Republican lawmakers, who largely back the six-week ban, had hoped that change would help them secure a favorable ruling this time around. Four justices voted to uphold the ban, with one dissenting.\nThe ban will significantly curb access to abortion.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Previous Coverage:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Coverage:\n\n                        South Carolina House passes six-week abortion ban\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nState data from between 2019 and 2021 suggests that most abortions in South Carolina took place after six weeks of pregnancy. People seeking an abortion in the state will now have to detect their pregnancy incredibly early \u2014 the first sign of pregnancy is often a late menstrual period, at which point the person is already past four weeks pregnant \u2014 and will need to schedule an appointment and secure the money to pay for an abortion, which can cost hundreds of dollars. The window also leaves little time for people to decide if they would like to keep an unintended pregnancy or terminate it.\nThe implications will also be felt across the region. A preliminary state analysis found that South Carolina reported 1,000 more abortions in 2022 compared to the year prior, likely the result of people traveling there from states with tighter abortion limits. Abortion is almost completely banned in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee, and is only allowed up to six weeks in Georgia. Now, people traveling from those states for care could turn to Florida or North Carolina \u2014 but new restrictions in both of those states mean they are more likely to travel to states like Virginia and Illinois.\u00a0\nIn Florida, abortion is only allowed up to 15 weeks, and pending a state court ruling, the state is likely to soon enforce a six-week ban as well. North Carolina, which previously allowed abortion up to 20 weeks, began to enforce a 12-week ban on the procedure earlier this summer.\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina House passes six-week abortion ban\n\n\n\n\nThree GOP-led states are set to vote on new abortion bans today\n\n\n\n\nA proposed six-week abortion ban in Florida could threaten access for the entire South\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: Abortion in Florida and what\u2019s at stake in the state Supreme Court\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
