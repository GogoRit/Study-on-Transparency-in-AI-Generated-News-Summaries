Exceptions would be allowed in cases of rape and incest, but a patient seeking an abortion for either reason would have to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to the attack.Indiana is one of the first Republican-controlled states to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned the precedent establishing a national right to an abortion.\n\nBut the GOP splintered after the rape and incest exceptions remained in the bill Thursday when an amendment failed that would have stripped out those exceptions.Ten Republican senators voted against the legislation Saturday, including a handful who support abortion rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of them, Republican Sen. Vaneta Becker of Evansville, said the measure will interfere with women\u2019s medical choices, their lives and free will by setting strict limits on abortion access in Indiana.\u201cWomen deserve to have us protect their lives and free will. Senate Bill 1 destroys both. Shame on us for doing this,\u201d she said, noting that only eight of Senate\u2019s 50 members are women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are considering dictating medical decisions with blinders and ignorant of the astounding, unintended consequences we are creating,\u201d Becker warned, saying the Senate is \u201cjust making a mess.\u201dRepublican Sen. Mike Young, whose amendment calling for no exceptions except for the life of the mother previously failed, said he voted against the bill not because he agrees with its opponents but because he has qualms with some aspects of the legislation he hopes are addressed.\n\nYoung said one provision that concerns him states that a doctor can perform an abortion if he believes a woman\u2019s life is in danger but it doesn\u2019t require the doctor to inform that woman that her life is in danger.\u201cShe may never know the reasons why. I just think it\u2019s important when a person makes the most important decision of their life they ought to know if their life is in danger, and what are the reasons why it\u2019s in danger,\u201d he said.GOP Sen. Sue Glick of LaGrange, who authored the abortion bill, said during the debate she doesn\u2019t expect the legislation approved by the Senate to be the final version the legislature passes. She called the Senate bill \u201can expression of where we believe the state of Indiana is right now.\u201dThe legislation\u2019s passage \u201cis a huge step forward in protecting the life of the unborn children in our state,\u201d Glick said in a statement after the bill\u2019s approval.\u201cWe have put together a bill that would not criminalize women and would protect the unborn whose voices have been silenced for the past 50 years under Roe v Wade,\u201d she added.\n\nTen of the Senate\u2019s 11 Democrats voted against the bill, with the 11th member absent for Saturday\u2019s debate. Democratic Sen. Tim Lanane of Anderson condemned the bill as a product of a male-dominated Legislature that\u2019s poised to take away the control that pregnant women should have over their own bodies.\u201cThis is the government, the male-dominated government of the state of Indiana, saying to the women of this state, you lose your choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve told you \u2014 papa state, big state government \u2014 is going to tell you what you will do with your body. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that.\u201dThe bill now heads to the House, where proposed changes could come as soon as next week \u2014 the second week of lawmakers\u2019 three-week special session. Lawmakers must adjourn their session by Aug. 14.House Speaker Todd Huston on Friday declined to discuss specifics of the Senate bill. But he said he supports the rape and incest exceptions.\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb said earlier this summer that he had no \u201cred lines\u201d on what anti-abortion measures lawmakers might consider. But on July 12 Holcomb sidestepped taking a stance on how far the Republican-dominated Legislature should go in restricting abortions in its special session.A national poll this month found an overwhelming majority of Americans believe their state should generally allow abortion in specific cases, including if a woman\u2019s life is endangered or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Few think abortion should always be illegal, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.___Arleigh Rodgers is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
