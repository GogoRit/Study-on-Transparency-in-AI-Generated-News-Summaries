She thought that breasts on women were a curse.\nShe decided to join the SGO behavior change club and read a SRH pupils book for answers on the women\u2019s sex cycle.\n\u201cThis prepared me to an extent when I saw my breast growing and bums bursting out I wasn\u2019t scared as before, because I knew it meant thst I was growing up and my body was sexually active,\u201d Umuhire said.\nShe further said that with guidance in the handbook, she knows what to do and how to behave when she is, for example, in her monthly menstrual periods.\n\u201cFor instance, while in my periods, I have to stay clean, carry two underwear and avoid any direct sexual activity to prevent pregnancy,\u201d Umuhire said.\nThrough the behavior change club discussions, Umuhire, who is the best student in her class says she has been empowered to know what she wants in life and go for it.\nFor example, she dreams of becoming a tour guide, but first, she will earn money and get married at 29 years.\n\u201cEven if a boy told me that he is in love with me, I will agree to the idea, but won\u2019t let him change my life goals,\u201d she said.\nDaniella Akimpaye, 18, a Senior 6 student at GS Ndera and a member of the SGO behavior change club, had her sexual life mindset changed since joining the group.\nBefore joining the club, Akimpaye says she almost felt victim of sexual abuse as a result of concocted lies on sexual life, where she was told that to have sex is a cure for pimples.\n\u201cI only came to know it was a lie after joining the club, where they shed light on my inquest to what I was going through,\u201d Akimpaye said.\n\nPupils share information on reproductive health at GS NderaTo help parents and teachers, SGO has formed parent\u2019s group SRHR education groups who also get their own handbooks, which has helped some like Pastor Jean Paul Birasa, a parent, who was scared to engage his children in a straight sex talk.\n\u201cAs men we knew and considered this as devilish and a taboo until we attended these sessions,\u201d Pastor Birasa said.\nBirasa says the challenge is that they need to get more skills to disseminate their knowledge to other parents, which will require resources, training and funding.\nThis project is implemented in 8 schools from 2 districts of Gasabo and Kamonyi reaching about 240 adolescents and youth between 10 \u2013 19 years old. Beneficiaries were trained on SRHR and child rights as agents of change and champions to train their peers in the school clubs.\nThe SGO Executive Director, Yvette Nyinawumuntu said that after three-year project timeline which has benefited many teens among its beneficiaries, the activities will be expanded to two more districts and schools in Nyagatare and Rwamagana district.\nNyinawumuntu also revealed that the project will be extended for two more years with a new focus on Training of Trainers (ToT) where each beneficiary will be required to reach one person (each one, reach one) and the baseline of educating others is uprooting false information in reproductive health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDaniel Sabiiti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious post\n\n\n\nGospel Singer Gabby Kamanzi Outs A New Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext post\n\n\n\nGov\u2019t Eases Teacher Recruitment Requirements to fill Gap, 18, 000 More Needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n\nRwanda Eyes 100% Vaccine Dissemination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Kagame Unveils IRCAD Africa Centre of Excellence...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulators Seek Ratification of Continental Medicine Agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIIO To Introduce Screening For Diabetic Retinopathy On...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Family Conspired To Infect My Wife\u2019 \u2013Ills...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabel Boosts Access To Maternal And Infant Health...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Editing: New Treatment For Cancer Brings Christmas...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinistry Of Health Explains Sweeping Flu Strain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDubai: A Rapidly Growing Destination For Medical Tourism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Nsanzimana New Health Minister\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n Rwanda-China Pledge Strong Development Cooperation\n\n\n\n\n Amavubi In Madagascar For Friendly Games Ahead Of FIFA World Cup Qualifiers\n\n\n\n\n Rwandan Community In South Africa Celebrate the Int\u2019l Women\u2019s Day\n\n\n\n\n Rwanda\u2019s GDP Growth Figures Are UP And It Matters To Everyone\n\n\n\n\n Japanese Embassy, Jordan Foundation Sign Grant to Educate Visually Impaired Children\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisment \n\n \n\n\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n December 2023 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n August 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n November 2022 \n October 2022 \n September 2022 \n August 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n December 2021 \n November 2021 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n August 2021 \n July 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n December 2020 \n November 2020 \n October 2020 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n June 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n December 2019 \n November 2019 \n October 2019 \n September 2019 \n August 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n September 2018 \n August 2018 \n July 2018 \n June 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n August 2017 \n July 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n November 2016 \n October 2016 \n September 2016 \n August 2016 \n July 2016 \n June 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n December 2015 \n November 2015 \n October 2015 \n September 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n June 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n December 2014 \n November 2014 \n October 2014 \n September 2014 \n August 2014 \n July 2014 \n June 2014 \n March 2014 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n Twitter\n\n Instagram\n\n Flickr\n\n Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n@ KT PRESS 2014 - 2023 .
