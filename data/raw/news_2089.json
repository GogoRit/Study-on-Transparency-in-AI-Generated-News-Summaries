When she became the director of the Pregnancy Center of Greater Toledo in 2016, she was frustrated by a suspicion that the community had no idea it existed. So she set up her office with trendy furniture and prints of hand-scripted Bible verses, then promptly left it.\n\u201cWe can only show up and serve to the level that we understand the people that are walking through our doors,\u201d Marten said. She took a roll of quarters to the local laundromat, started conversations with patrons, learned about the families in the neighborhood, and spread the word about the center.\nShe started church-hopping nearby. She networked with local organizations, connecting over shared concerns for Lucas County and offering to partner with them or serve on their boards. She worked with hospital systems to get the center direct scheduling access with more than a dozen ob-gyns, so pregnant clients could see obstetricians earlier in their pregnancies\u2014a proven factor in combating infant mortality.\nIt\u2019s been a few years, but Marten estimates she still spends about half of her working hours outside the center. Though she wasn\u2019t new to pro-life advocacy or the pregnancy center movement when she took the director job, she was willing to listen to her community and try new strategies. That approach has been a crucial part of the center\u2019s success\u2014leading to a 22 percent jump in clients last year alone\u2014and could be the key to making pregnancy centers more effective for a new generation.\nThe Pregnancy Center of Greater Toledo opened in 1984 as part of a wave of centers popping up all over the country in the decade or so following the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. After the landmark abortion ruling, \u201cWe started getting attacked by the pro-choice side saying, \u2018You don\u2019t care about women,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Roland Warren, current CEO of CareNet, one of the largest pregnancy center networks in the US. In response to the pushback, pro-life Christians shifted from protests and reaction to ministries and action.\nPregnancy centers\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d or \u201cpregnancy resource centers\u201d\u2014became a big part of that response. Their original mission was profound but uncomplicated: to save babies. Philosophies differed back in the \u201980s, and they still do. Some centers front evangelism, while some keep their faith affiliations in the background. Some offer certain medical services, but most rely on a volunteer-led counseling model.Article continues below\n\nFree NewslettersGet the best from CT editors, delivered straight to your inbox!\n\n\n\n More Newsletters\nOver the decades, these pregnancy centers\u2014now numbering over 2,000 in the US, far more than abortion clinics\u2014have served hundreds of thousands of women and babies despite outside scrutiny and legal challenges. Critics have accused them of being misleading (because they do not provide abortion referrals), coercive, or proselytizing. They\u2019ve also borne the brunt of the criticism lobbied at the pro-life movement as a whole of having a singular focus on saving life in the womb rather than addressing the factors that lead to unplanned pregnancy in the first place.\nThe narrow focus was something that frustrated Angie Weszely and Denise Stein when they led a center in Chicago. The expectations resulted in too much baggage between the counselors and their clients. They saw well-meaning Christian volunteers stuck in the fog of their pro-life checklists: Is she going to keep the baby? Did we share the Four Spiritual Laws?\nA wave of new leaders is realizing that some of the tried-and-true strategies for pregnancy centers\u2014opening a gospel tract or printing a sonogram\u2014might not be as effective as they or their predecessors assumed. As many directors in the founding generation retire, younger Christians have begun to test new methods to care for women and reduce the demand for abortion.\nThis shift could be partly out of necessity. Last year, a New Yorker investigation into rural pregnancy centers reported that as few as 4 percent of women who visited came for direction on whether to have their baby or abort. A majority, the magazine found, wanted social services and pregnancy testing, which are required to sign up for Medicaid.\nSome centers are adapting their offerings, providing pregnancy testing, screenings for sexually transmitted diseases, and even contraceptives. Others are sticking to pregnancy counseling but are adjusting their language and setup to cater to a different clientele.\nThe landscape has challenged the pregnancy center movement to take a closer look at its mission, at whether to prioritize spiritual salvation or abortion prevention, and at the lengths to which it should go to achieve either. On the abortion end, many Christians are looking upstream at factors that can throw a pregnancy into crisis: poverty, social isolation, insufficient medical care, and the lack of a committed partner.\nWeszely and Stein cofounded a ministry, ProGrace, to separate abortion from politics\u2014particularly the pro-life and pro-choice labels\u2014and equip churches to support women in crisis pregnancies before they make their way to a clinic. Other Christian organizations, inspired by their convictions around life and family, are stepping in with resources beyond what a pregnancy center could offer.Article continues below\n\nOverall, the church\u2019s response is becoming more strategic, holistic, and comprehensive\u2014a community endeavor that extends far beyond a center itself.\n\nNeighborhood Culture\nIn Toledo, it started with paint color.\nWhen \u201ca bunch of white, middle-aged women who don\u2019t live in the neighborhoods\u201d were making all the decisions, \u201cit looked like Joanna Gaines had set up the center,\u201d said Marten. \u201cBut what we were hearing from our clients was that it felt like a hospital.\u201d\nA stylish, fast-talking 30-something with a pixie cut and a wide smile, Marten wasn\u2019t going to let culture clash keep the center from reaching women in need. She enlisted leaders from Toledo\u2019s African American and Latina communities to serve on a cultural competency advisory committee.\n\nImage: Eli Lindauer\nSavannah Marten at the Pregnancy Center of Greater Toledo\n\n\n\nMembers agreed to a two-year term, during which they\u2019d advise the center on everything from the decor to the paperwork. The advisers didn\u2019t have to be Christian or even pro-life; they just had to understand that the center was both of those and be willing to help.\nAt their recommendation, the center now takes its design cues from the colorful murals in the neighborhood, and hardly two walls are the same color. The lobby is a peaceful forest green. One of the client rooms contains a giant, multicolored floral mural painted by students at Toledo School for the Arts. Others have neon modular furniture and inspirational prints on the walls (\u201cYou are an awesome woman!\u201d).\nThe committee also advised the center to space out the chairs in its cozy lobby\u2014women coming in who have lived in poverty often need to protect their personal space and could feel uneasy sitting so close to someone else. The center transitioned intake paperwork to mobile-friendly online forms and shifted the questions based on adviser feedback.\n\u201cWe realized we were asking about the father of the baby before we were asking about rape and sexual abuse,\u201d Marten said. The center\u2019s intake paperwork now asks about abuse first. Marten said it helps counselors discern whether bringing up partner support or marriage is even appropriate or whether a counselor might instead encourage a woman to speak to police.Article continues below\n\nThe small changes are making a big difference. In 2019, the center saw a 22 percent jump in appointments, performed 200 additional ultrasounds, and increased attendance at parenting classes by 8 percent. A greater portion of its clientele came back for multiple visits, allowing the staff to foster deeper relationships\u2014and providing more chances to show them the love of the gospel.\nOver 500 women who came through the doors had a baby last year, and staff know of only 8 who went ahead with an abortion.\nMarten is bringing what she has learned in Ohio to a national CareNet conference for the second time this year, urging fellow directors to consider adding their own cultural competency advisers.\nRacial Biases in Health Care\nDown in Dallas, Cessilye R. Smith began Abide Women\u2019s Health Services with fellow women of color in mind. In an area south of downtown that some call South Dallas, some call Fair Park, and some, like Smith, call \u201cthe hood,\u201d she has set out to extend the work of the pro-life pregnancy center movement by addressing infant and maternal mortality among women of color.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black babies in the US are nearly twice as likely to die before their first birthday as white babies, and African American and Native American women are nearly three times more likely to die than white mothers during pregnancy or after giving birth.\nCombating racial biases in health care is Abide\u2019s first priority, and Smith believes it needs to be a bigger part of the pregnancy center movement as a whole. She said when black women turn up at hospitals to deliver after not being able to see an obstetrician regularly throughout their pregnancies, doctors may make assumptions that affect their standard of care. For example, they may think that black moms aren\u2019t as interested in nursing and not offer robust breastfeeding support, or that they suffer from addiction and reduce their pain meds.\n\nImage: Brianna Davila / Courtesy of Cessilye R. Smith\nCessilye R. Smith at Abide Women\u2019s Health Services in Dallas\n\n\n\nSince Abide opened its doors in 2017, providing free childbirth classes, support groups for new moms, and breastfeeding education, 90 percent of its clients have been black or Hispanic. Most of the staff members are also women of color, and the 25 women who volunteered last year began with training in implicit bias and cultural humility and diversity.Article continues below\n\nSmith has shifted her own approach to pro-life activism. No longer does she repeat the statistics about black abortion rates. Instead, she points to the factors behind them and the racial disparities in care, advocating for maternal justice through Christian outlets like the And Campaign.\n\u201cWhen the public eye sees the pro-life movement fighting to end abortion without looking at the root, then you will always get the side-eye from the black community,\u201d she explained to Catholic theologian and ethicist Charles Camosy.\nAbide\u2019s goal is to open a free maternal health clinic next year, then eventually a birthing center designed for women of color. In the meantime, Smith\u2014whose home birth inspired her to become a doula\u2014offers scholarships covering books, classes, and even bills to black students who want to become licensed midwives. The involvement of midwives and doulas (non-medical labor assistants) correlates with better birth outcomes, but women of color are far less likely to access such support. Black and Hispanic women currently make up less than 5 percent of licensed midwives in the United States.\nCare Past Nine Months\nTammy Abernathy also has a personal connection to the women she sets out to serve at Hope Women\u2019s Center in Phoenix. After raising her own children as a single mom, she got involved in the ministry to offer better support to women in similar situations.\nIn 2013, she took the helm of a network of four regional centers as they moved away from the medical offerings emphasized by others in the movement (think ultrasound techs and doctor referrals) to provide a broader range of counseling support instead.\n\u201cWomen were coming with so many other coexisting things they were dealing with,\u201d Abernathy said.\nHer team is trained in trauma-informed care and works with women and teen girls who are dealing with poverty, domestic abuse, and unintended pregnancy\u2014often all at once. Hope\u2019s broader scope means Abernathy sees a higher percentage of clients return for ongoing support than she did in her previous work at a more traditional pregnancy center, she said.\n\nImage: Steve Craft\nTammy Abernathy at Hope Women\u2019s Center in Phoenix\n\n\n\nHope is part of the ProGrace network, which focuses on long-term outreach, so that women have a place to go both during and after a pregnancy.\nProGrace founders Weszely and Stein partner eager churches with pregnancy centers. They are clear about their convictions: While the organization does not advocate for abortion, stating that \u201cGod\u2019s design for pregnancy was to intertwine a woman and a child,\u201d they believe that \u201cfor the church to be a safe place, Christians need a way to respond that is outside of the debate,\u201d Weszely said.Article continues below\n\nFor churches, that means pastors must acknowledge that women within their congregations are intimately familiar with abortion\u2014it\u2019s not just something that happens \u201coutside\u201d the church\u2014and that Christians who oppose abortion not look to politics as the only fix. For centers affiliated with ProGrace, that means no \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice\u201d talk, no marches, no endorsing candidates. For Abernathy, the ProGrace paradigm allows her to focus on the women in her centers rather than on the surrounding politics, she said.\nThe Evangelism Question\nEvangelicalism has historically dominated the pregnancy center landscape, and the vast majority of today\u2019s centers are affiliated with Protestant networks and churches. But even among Christian centers that share core beliefs, networks can have different approaches to when and how to incorporate the gospel.\nCareNet, with its network of more than 1,130 Christian pregnancy centers, uses the mantra of being not just pro-life but \u201cpro-abundant life.\u201d Its leaders want to see families transformed through their relationship with God and the church. Yet affiliates are not required to share the gospel with each client. The hope is that it would come up organically.\nThere are no Christian symbols or Bible verses in the public spaces of Marten\u2019s center in Toledo. But her office is full of them (\u201cBe Still and Know That I Am God,\u201d a print above her desk proclaims). Her conversations are peppered with Scripture in a way that sounds less like a script and more like wisdom she received from a friend.\n\u201cThe gospel is so ingrained into everything we do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for us, the form is just as important as the message.\u201d Marten shares CareNet\u2019s philosophy: Don\u2019t start by opening a tract. Start by meeting the women.\nThe same goes for another network, Heartbeat International. Its 2,500 affiliates list relationship building as a prerequisite for sharing the gospel, training volunteers to first \u201clisten and learn.\u201d\nOn the other side of the debate is Hope National, an association started by National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) cofounders Jim and Pat Dundas. The Hope National manual reads: \u201cIt has been the instruction in some pregnancy center volunteer training programs to make the gospel of secondary importance and/or practice in counseling the client. This is in direct opposition to the teaching of Christ.\u201dArticle continues below\n\nIn certain circumstances, focusing on evangelism can cost pregnancy centers federal funding through the Title X Family Planning Program at a time when more are looking to partner with state programs for maternal health. Some Title X centers violate the Dundases\u2019 approach in order to comply with federal guidelines: They wait until after a client\u2019s intake visit to ask permission to share the gospel.\nFaith in the Background\nWhether centers prioritize evangelism informs other aspects of their operation, including offering contraception. Christian pregnancy center networks have traditionally avoided doing so, worrying that it implicitly endorses sex outside of marriage. But some, stepping in as alternatives to Planned Parenthood, believe it allows them to reach more women.\nThe Source, a network of eight Christian pregnancy centers in Texas, made headlines late last year when it announced it would offer hormonal and other birth controls at its centers.\nThe Source CEO Andy Schoonover said the strategy is meant to reduce unplanned pregnancies (and thereby reduce the demand for abortion). \u201cWomen who are sexually active and not using contraceptives are approximately eight times more likely to have an abortion than those who are using contraceptives,\u201d he said, citing CDC data.\nThe network also sees offering contraceptives as a way to establish relationships with women in their local communities.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t get it from us, they will go somewhere else to get it,\u201d Schoonover said. \u201cDo we want to develop and maintain that relationship with the patient or would we prefer a different organization, which is more than likely not ideologically aligned, develop that relationship?\u201d\nIn New York City, where the abortion is rate is double the average of the rest of the country, a pregnancy center called Avail strategically distances itself from evangelical pressures and expectations. Avail calls itself a nonprofit \u201cwith a Christian orientation\u201d but says its goal is to offer a supportive place for women to take a breath and make a decision\u2014not be swayed toward or away from a certain outcome.\n\u201cIf you are facing an unexpected pregnancy, you may fear being judged or pressured,\u201d Avail\u2019s website reads. \u201cAt Avail, you will find the opposite. Our staff and volunteers strive to treat others the way they would want to be treated and are non-judgmental, respectful, and supportive.\u201d The strategy is meant to make women in what could be the most progressive, pro-choice city in the country feel welcome walking in. (The ProGrace team gave an in-person training session at Avail last year.)Article continues below\n\nAt its Times Square office space, Avail also invites men to participate in the decision-making process around unintended pregnancies, with male counselors to meet with one on one as well as options for support after an abortion. It\u2019s an approach also being used nationwide through CareNet, which now offers outreach for men at 65 percent of its centers. After its research found that the biggest influence on a woman\u2019s decision about abortion is often the man who got her pregnant, CareNet\u2019s Joseph Project partnered with the National Fatherhood Initiative to engage more men in parenting classes and mentoring.\nAbortions Next Door\nThe Pregnancy Center of Greater Toledo also runs an after-abortion counseling center called the Haven House. Like the center, the Haven is eager to work with its neighbors\u2014even though it\u2019s next door to Toledo\u2019s only remaining abortion clinic, with just a narrow parking strip between them.\nOthers may not have the same situation with location, but it\u2019s easy for Christians in pro-life ministries to feel surrounded by the abortion-rights movement. Abortion clinics are closing at record rates, but Americans are becoming more vocal in their support of abortion itself.\nSome pro-life activists have concentrated their efforts on the legal space or on protesting around the remaining clinics. But like those who launched their movement in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade, pregnancy center leaders today feel a deep calling to make a difference in the lives of women who could find themselves facing unintended pregnancies and desperate for assistance.\nThey want to do more than bring a woman in and show her an ultrasound or offer a gospel tract. (Most clients, Marten points out, are moms already and know the reality of the beating heart inside them.) Ministries are asking these women bigger questions like \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d and are stepping in to help.\nThe pregnancy center movement increasingly isn\u2019t only about the baby, or even the baby and the mom, but about the whole family, neighborhood, and community.Article continues below\n\nEvery once in a while in Toledo, an unwitting woman comes into the Haven to check in for her abortion appointment next door. In the interest of honesty and maintaining a positive relationship with the abortion clinic, Haven staff reluctantly redirect these women to the building across the parking lot.\n\u201cBut we also tell them we don\u2019t believe they walked through our doors by accident,\u201d said Marten, who has made some inroads in pro-choice circles and was given a woman of the month award last year by a feminist group in Toledo.\nBefore the mistaken woman leaves the Haven for her appointment, she is asked if she wants to talk about anything and is invited back.\nMarten and her team pray earnestly to meet her again. They pray they\u2019ve done enough to earn her trust. And, like pregnancy center workers past and present, they grieve over every lost baby and every forever-changed woman.\nMaria Baer is a contributing writer for CT and is based in Columbus, Ohio.\nHave something else to say about the pregnancy center movement?
