(04-27-22) \u2013\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA) President Kristan Hawkins called on Tik Tok to open the process for getting pro-life speech back on the heavily abortion content-oriented app and condemned the social media platform for censoring pro-life speech by banning SFLA\u2019s account on April 25th, 2022, for \u201cviolating Community Guideline standards\u201d without notice or opportunity for appeal.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe last video SFLA posted on their Tik Tok account before being banned was a\u00a0viral clip\u00a0from SFLA President\u00a0Kristan\u00a0Hawkins\u2019 speaking tour, which garnered more than 2 million views on YouTube. The video, called\u00a0\u201cthe most epic beatdown\u201d\u00a0of abortion logic, was a discussion between a pro-abortion student and Hawkins on when life begins. No other social media found it necessary to boot either this video or SFLA off their platform.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs reported at\u00a0the Students for Life of America blog:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Snowflake Coalition seems to be in full control of Tik Tok as they seemed to melt in consternation faced with a woke student\u2019s inability to sell the illogic of abortion to national pro-life leader\u00a0Kristan\u00a0Hawkins, famed for her ability to debate in college campuses.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn April 25, 2022, Students for Life of America (SFLA) was banned from TikTok for \u201cmultiple\u00a0Community Guideline\u00a0violations\u201d according to the short-form video application. More than 35,000 followers were stripped away from SFLA when the app blocked account managers from appealing the futile ban.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPerhaps they were afraid to have a real conversation \u2026 Unlike SFLA President\u00a0Kristan\u00a0Hawkins whose answers to the flustered questions\u00a0from a University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) student during Hawkins\u2019 recent campus stop on her\u00a0tour entitled\u00a0The Future is Anti-Abortion\u00a0has been a viral sensation. Watching the student refer to handmade signs as \u201cfacts\u201d in a debate didn\u2019t make her case. It\u2019s a scientific fact\u00a0that it\u2019s a baby \u2013 a human being \u2013 getting aborted \u2026\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nMore than 35,000 followers were stripped away from SFLA when the app blocked account managers from appealing the futile ban. This is\u00a0Big Tech\u2019s latest attempt to\u00a0life and\u00a0free speech\u2014censorship of conservatives is\u00a0not fake news. This is also not the first time the left has used corporations to try to silence one of the nation\u2019s most active pro-life organizations and the largest youth pro-life organization.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile this is\u00a0not the first attempt at censorship of SFLA on TikTok,\u00a0the platform has only previously barred the organization from posting for a limited amount of time before reinstating the account. Tik Tok has removed pro-life videos from SFLA in the past, but account managers now note the recent removal came without warning.\u00a0\u00a0\nMEDIA NOTE:\u00a0Students for Life of America has frequently battled violations of pro-life free speech in different forms. On\u00a0college\u00a0and\u00a0high school\u00a0campuses, SFLA\u00a0groups are discriminated\u00a0against, and SFLA President\u00a0Kristan\u00a0Hawkins\u2019\u00a0speaking tours\u00a0are protested. SFLA also took the\u00a0District of Columbia to court\u00a0earlier this year after D.C. encroached upon their freedom of speech.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs SFLAction has previously noted: \u201cLimiting abortion policy choices to the few desired by those in power is not popular with Millennials and Gen Z, now\u202fabout one-third\u00a0of the electorate. Recent polling by Students for Life of America\u2019s\u202fDemetree Institute for Pro-Life Advancement\u00a0indicates that \u2018an astonishing\u202f8 in 10\u202fwant to vote on abortion policy in their states \u2013 UP from 66% last year.\u2019 In addition, \u2018(w)hen considering how devalued people have been treated historically by those in power,\u202f65% of Millennials and Gen Z did not support allowing people in power\u202fto decide who is fully human and deserving of legal rights.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRead more about the culture of death on Tik Tok\u00a0HERE\u00a0\nEngage with Students for Life of America on\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Facebook, and\u00a0Instagram\u00a0\nFor interviews, contact\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\n\u201330\u2013\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages. Together they work to end abortion \u2014 the human rights issue of our day \u2014 and provide political, legal, and community support for women and their children, born and preborn. Headquartered in Fredericksburg, VA, SFLA has more\u00a0than 1,250\u00a0groups on middle,\u00a0high school, college, university, medical, and law school campuses in all 50 states.

SFLA and SFLAction\u00a0have more conversations with those most targeted by the abortion industry than any other pro-life outreach in the world, reaching more than 2 million people across social media platforms each week and engaging in approximately 100,000 digital conversations per month.\u00a0Over the last 16 years, President\u00a0Kristan\u00a0Hawkins has grown SFLAction/SFLA into an $18 million organization preparing for a Post-Roe America.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,415\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
