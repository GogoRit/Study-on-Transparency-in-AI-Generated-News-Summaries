(Photo courtesy of Red Rose Rescue Facebook)\nWith the goal of preventing patients from receiving access to medical care, particularly abortion-related services, the three remained at the office for two hours, despite being told to leave numerous times by staff and dispatched White Plains police officers.\n\u201cThe District Attorney\u2019s Office will vigorously prosecute any criminal acts that interfere with an individual\u2019s constitutional right to freely access healthcare,\u201d Westchester County District Attorney Miriam E. Rocah said in a press release following the trial. \u201cThere are no insignificant cases when it comes to the protection of reproductive rights.\u201d\nThrough police body camera and security footage \u2014 as well as witness testimony from two police officers who responded to the incident and Constance Considine, chief administrator at All Women\u2019s Health and Medical Services \u2014 it was confirmed that the individuals gained entry into the medical office through deception, using a female accomplice who made a fake appointment to gather information.\u00a0\nDue to the pandemic, All Women\u2019s Health and Medical Services does not let any individuals accompany patients who have an appointment, which was communicated to the female accomplice when she first buzzed in. However, Goodman and Moscinski accompanied the female accomplice, who first walked into the office\u2019s reception area upstairs before the two followed soon after.\nDespite an employee communicating to the two that they could not enter the office and attempting to block them using her body, Goodman and Moscinski chose to not listen, went upstairs and sat in the waiting room instead. There, they remained for two hours before being escorted out by the police.\u00a0\nWhile Goodman and Moscinski remained upstairs, Connolly held the door to the facility open downstairs, where a small group of men and women were gathered singing and praying.\u00a0\nAn employee at All Women\u2019s Health and Medical Services attempting to prevent Matthew Connolly from entering the facility on Nov. 27 (Photo courtesy of Red Rose Rescue Facebook)\nPolice officers told the three men countless times that they were trespassing on private property and, if they did not leave, they would be arrested.\u00a0\nGoodman, the only defendant who took to the stand during the trial, said they communicated to the officers that they would leave only on the condition that medical operations at the office be stopped. On body camera footage, Moscinski could be heard saying once we leave, business will continue \u2014 alluding to their ultimate goal of disrupting operations.\nGoodman said he gave the staff an opportunity to choose to stop their operations, which, the prosecution underscored, was a refusal to cooperate with the officers\u2019 request. Because none of the three individuals would leave, police officers ultimately had to arrest the men, handcuffing them and carrying them out.\nChristopher Moscinski being carried out by White Plains police officers after refusing to leave the waiting room and resisting arrest. (Photo courtesy of Red Rose Rescue Facebook)\nThroughout the trial, Assistant District Attorney Celia Curtis remained steadfast that Goodman, Moscinski and Connolly knowingly and unlawfully trespassed and remained on private property with the goal of preventing medical operations from continuing that day.\u00a0\nHowever, the three defendants\u2019 attorney, Steve Anduze, attempted to justify the criminal trespass based on the moral conscience and religious mission that guided his defendants\u2019 actions.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnduze said the defendants were carrying out \u201ctheir duty\u201d to protect mothers and the unborn, advocating pro-life options to patients by giving them roses and pamphlets. In cross-examining the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, Anduze asked if the defendants acted violently, threatened staff and patients or damaged property, which the witnesses said they did not.\u00a0\nHowever, Curtis highlighted that the defendants were not charged with harassment, criminal mischief or petit larceny \u2014 pulling the focus back to their sole charge: criminal trespass.\u00a0\nAdditionally, Curtis reiterated the emotional distress the three defendants caused to staff and patients on Nov. 27. For the two hours that Goodman and Moscinski remained in the waiting room and Connolly held the door open downstairs, staff escorted incoming patients away from them and into the medical office for their safety.\nAt multiple junctures throughout the trial, Anduze attempted to contend that All Women\u2019s Health and Medical Services was operating illegally by offering abortion after 24 weeks.\u00a0\nJudge John Collins, who presided over the trial, underscored that New York passed the Reproductive Health Act in 2019, which codified Roe v. Wade protections into state law and legalized abortion after 24 weeks if a pregnant individual\u2019s health or life is at risk. As a result, Collins said Anduze\u2019s argument was not cogent.\u00a0\nThroughout the trial and while the verdict was read out, pro-life supporters from RRR and another group called Catholic Renegades were in attendance, praying on rosary beads during court proceedings. Trial updates were regularly posted to RRR\u2019s Facebook page.\nPro-life supporters gathered outside of the All Women\u2019s Health and Medical Services on Nov. 27 (Photo courtesy of Red Rose Rescue Facebook)\nOn March 9, Moscinski and Goodman were also found guilty of trespassing at Capitol Women\u2019s Services in Washington, D.C. on May 14, 2020. Moscinski is also facing felony charges following another clinic trespass in Pennsylvania.\n\u201cThis verdict allows us, in some small way, to be more closely aligned to our poor sisters and brothers in the womb who are being wantonly ignored by the courts and rejected by so many people in our nation,\u201d Goodman said in a Facebook post following the verdict in White Plains. \u200b\u200b\u201dIn response to the jury\u2019s condemnation, we offer them only forgiveness.\u201d\nAnduze declined a request to comment on the verdict.\nAlso in attendance for the entirety of the trial were staff members from WCLA \u2013 Choice Matters, a pro-choice advocacy organization.\u00a0\n\u201cIn this time of unprecedented court attacks on abortion rights, it is essential to remember these assaults impact people right here in Westchester County,\u201d Catherine Lederer-Plaskett, president of WCLA \u2014 Choice Matters, said. \u201cThese terrorists forced their way into a reproductive healthcare facility, frightening patients and putting needed medical care at risk.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe six-woman jury spoke loud and clear when it rendered the guilty verdict in under 30 minutes,\u201d Lederer-Plaskett continued. \u201cNow the real work begins. We must make sure these criminals get more than a slap on the wrist.\u201d\u00a0\nThe defendants are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Collins on June 20.\u00a0\nIf convicted, they could serve up to 3 months in jail and pay a fine of up to $500. In lieu of jail time, the court may order the defendants up to one year of probation.\nBailey HosfeltBailey has journalism experience covering local news in Westchester and Putnam counties and New York City on topics related to LGBTQ+ issues, women\u2019s rights, climate change, the environment, and local politics.
