(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho in 2022 was a flood of newsworthy events, laws and people. The most popular reads on idahocapitalsun.com included coverage of the Idaho Legislature\u2019s shifting priorities \u2014 one of which was to propose or approve bans on what Idahoans can do.\nThe bills and laws that made headlines in 2022 included bans on abortion, library books and materials, and drag performances with children in attendance.\n\u00a0\n 1. No exception for life of mother included in Idaho GOP\u2019s abortion platform language\n\n  (Kelcie Moseley-Morris/Idaho Capital Sun)\nBy a nearly four-to-one margin, Idaho Republicans at the state party\u2019s convention in Twin Falls rejected endorsing an exception to abortion bans in cases where it would save the mother\u2019s life.\nScott Herndon, who takes office as a state senator in January, proposed adding language to the party platform to support the criminalization of all abortions within the state\u2019s jurisdiction and that Idaho\u2019s Constitution should be amended to include a \u201cdeclaration of the right to life for preborn children.\u201d\nThe platform already said the Idaho Republican Party classifies abortion as murder from the moment of fertilization.\nRead the rest of the story\n\n\u00a0\n 2.

There was no cancer.\nThey were misdiagnosed by Dr. Ryan Cole \u2014 while he claimed to see a spike in cancers at his laboratory and attributed that spike to immune damage from the COVID-19 vaccine.\nCole has not publicly produced evidence to support that claim, while experts who refute his claim have shared their evidence and directly debunked his mischaracterizations of their research.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a 20 times increase of endometrial cancers over what I see on an annual basis \u2014 a 20 times increase, not exaggerating at all,\u201d Cole said in a video produced by anti-vaccination group Health Freedom Idaho in August 2021.\nRead the rest of the story\n\n\u00a0\n 5.

University of Idaho releases memo warning employees that promoting abortion is against state law\n\n  (Courtesy of the University of Idaho)\nThe University of Idaho has warned its employees not to provide reproductive health counseling, including abortion, to their students or they may risk losing their jobs or criminal prosecution.\nAccording to a memo the university\u2019s general counsel sent to all employees Friday, Idaho law prohibits university employees from promoting, counseling or referring someone for an abortion, and prohibits the institution from dispensing drugs classified as emergency contraception except in cases of rape.\nThe memo primarily focused on a law passed in the 2021 session of the Idaho Legislature prohibiting public funds from being used to \u201cprocure, counsel in favor, refer to or perform an abortion.\u201d\nThe University of Idaho and other public schools across Idaho are subject to the law since they are state-funded institutions.\nRead the rest of the story\n\n\u00a0\n 7. Idaho attorney general says abortion ban likely to take effect in late August after SCOTUS decision\n\n  (Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)\nIn a statement, Idaho Gov. Brad Little said he joined many in Idaho and across the country in welcoming the court\u2019s long-awaited decision that he said upholds state sovereignty and protects lives.\n\u201cThis is now clear \u2014 the \u2018right\u2019 to an abortion was a judicial creation. Abortion is not a right expressed in the U.S. Constitution, and abortion will be entrusted to the states and their people to regulate,\u201d Little wrote.\n\u201cHowever, we fully acknowledge this monumental moment in our country\u2019s history means we must confront what now will be growing needs for women and families in the months and years ahead,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe absolutely must come together like never before to support women and teens facing unexpected or unwanted pregnancies. Families, churches, charities, and local and state government must stand ready to lift them up and help them and their families with access to adoption services, health care, financial and food assistance, counseling and treatment and family planning. We are being called to support women and our fellow community members in extraordinary new ways, and I\u2019m confident Idahoans are ready to meet this responsibility with love and compassion.\u201d\nRead the rest of the story\n\n\u00a0\n 8.

Greg Chaney, R-Caldwell, said he was initially concerned about the bill but believed it was appropriate when viewed in the context of other state laws and U.S. Supreme Court decisions that protect books and art with literary, artistic, political and scientific value.\n\u201cWhen you look at it in its totality, it is a little less scary,\u201d Chaney said, adding the bill could \u201cstem the tide\u201d of dangerous material kids could get ahold of.\nRead the rest of the story\n\n\u00a0\n 9.
