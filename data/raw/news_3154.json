In Virginia, the House of Delegates and Senate have passed a bill allowing tax-funded abortion for any reason in Virginia's health exchange. In a joint statement Jan. 26, 2021, the state's Catholic bishops decried passage of the measure. (CNS photo/Tyler Orsburn)Pro-life supporters prepare to march for life in Washington and Annapolis\n January 5, 2022By Priscila Gonz\u00e1lez de Doran Catholic Review\n\nFiled Under: Archbishop's Ministry, Feature, Local News, News, Respect Life\n\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court considers Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a case that could overturn Roe v. Wade, Maryland\u2019s pro-life supporters are ready to show their support for the sanctity of life at the Jan. 21 March for Life in Washington, D.C., and the Feb. 3 Maryland March for Life in Annapolis.\n\u201cI am very optimistic Roe v. Wade is going to be overturned,\u201d said Erin Younkins, director of the Office of Life, Justice and Peace with the Archdiocese of Baltimore\u2019s Institute for Evangelization. \u201cJustices had great questions at the Dec. 1 hearing and their points really leaned toward the holes in Roe v. Wade.\u201d\nYounkins added that it\u2019s important for Catholics of the Archdiocese of Baltimore to participate in marches for life to raise awareness.\nThe thought of a nation without Roe v. Wade has \u201creinvigorated both sides of the abortion debate in Maryland,\u201d said Therese McGucken Hessler, president of the Maryland March for Life\u2019s Board and Steering Committee.\nMaryland legislators who support the legal right to abortion are expected to push for a state constitutional \u201cright for abortion\u201d during the next session of the Maryland General Assembly, which opens Jan. 12\u00a0 and runs to April 11 in Annapolis.\n\u201cUnited for life,\u201d is the theme of the Maryland March for Life 2022. The event includes a rally and candlelight vigil. Among the featured speakers will be Laura Bogley, director of legislation at Maryland Right to Life; Terrisa Bukovinac, founder and executive director of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising; and Toni McFadden, a pro-life activist.\nDue to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, the traditional Respect Life Mass at St. Mary in Annapolis will not be celebrated prior to the march this year.\nMaryland is one of the most permissive states when it comes to abortion laws and, according to Hessler, many Maryland residents are unaware of the state\u2019s permission for abortions through all nine months.\nIn Washington, this year\u2019s March for Life theme is \u201cEquality begins at the womb.\u201d In addition to the Jan. 21 march to the Supreme Court, the event will include an expo, seminar, rally, concert and dinner gala.\nBaltimore Archbishop William E. Lori, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities, has urged all people of goodwill from all faiths to pray and fast for this important case.\n\u201cWe pray that the court will do the right thing and allow states to once again limit or prohibit abortion, and in doing so protect millions of unborn children and their mothers from this painful, life-destroying act,\u201d he said in a written statement.\nThe archbishop will be the main celebrant and homilist of the Vigil for Life Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., Jan. 20.\nJennifer Kraska, executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference, said that even if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned and abortion rights are returned to the states, Maryland would not see any immediate change.\n\u201cWe will be on to our next fight when it comes back down to the state level,\u201d Hessler said. \u201cAbortion activists are trying to enshrine the right to abortion within the Maryland Constitution and now more than ever it is more important to come to the march and stand for life.\u201d\nThe Maryland March for Life is an opportunity for different organizations to come together and unite efforts to meet men, women and their babies in their time of need, so \u201cthey don\u2019t feel backed into a corner\u201d with abortion as their only solution, she said.\n\u201cWhen we are addressing all the fears that will ever get them to think why abortion is a choice, then abortion becomes unthinkable,\u201d Hessler said.\nThe Maryland Catholic Conference, public-policy arm of the state\u2019s Catholic bishops, will continue to provide respect-for-life resources through its website with webinars, facts and updates in English and Spanish as the legislative session progresses.\nYounkins said the Archdiocese of Baltimore is providing support to babies and their mothers with the \u201cWalking with Moms in Need\u201d program. The initiative commits Catholics at the parish level to assisting all women in crisis pregnancies. Rather than just handing them materials, the initiative welcomes them into the parishes as a community to rely on in whatever help they might need through pregnancy up until the first year of the baby\u2019s life.\nA third of the archdiocese\u2019s parishes are involved at some stage of the project. Younkins said her goal is to get up to 50 percent of the archdiocese\u2019s parishes by the end of 2022.\n\u201cThe reason we march for life and spend tireless hours trying to get volunteers to testify is because we believe one day it (Roe v. Wade) will be overturned,\u201d Hessler said. \u201cIf it is not today, it will be one day soon.\u201d\nFind more about the March for Life at marchforlife.org.
