For an abortion to occur after 20 weeks, it could only be approved if deemed necessary to save the woman's life or prevent serious injury.\nEarlier in the day, an attempt to put the issue to a public referendum failed in a conscience vote during the bill's committee stage by 100 votes to 19 votes.\nNZ First had supported the bill, introduced by Justice Minister Andrew Little, on the understanding it would go to a referendum.\nThe Green Party also failed in its attempt to reverse a blunder that resulted in \"safe zones\" being excluded from the legislation.\nThe bill originally proposed 150m safe zones be placed around abortion clinics to prevent protesters harassing people coming and going.\nLast week, a voting mix-up resulted in that provision being axed.\nGreens' co-leader Marama Davidson on Wednesday requested Parliament go back and reinsert safe zones, but MPs voted 77 to 43 against it.\nUnder the bill the decision to have an abortion will be made by the woman in consultation with a qualified health practitioner.\nAbortions later than 20 weeks will need to meet a statutory test.\nNational MP Agnes Loheni strongly opposed that provision in her speech to the House.\n\"Section 11 of this bill by every reading of it states it will allow abortions up to the moment of birth and no amount of the minister blocking his ears and saying 'no it doesn't' changes this,\" she said.\nAmy Adams rejected the arguments against abortion after 20 weeks.\n\"Women do not wake up late in their pregnancy and have just changed their minds for no reason. Women do not callously throw away a much wanted pregnancy because of a difficult diagnosis,\" she said.\nAdams said she has held the hand and sat with women she knows and loves, who have had to make the incredibly difficult decision to have an abortion.\n\"I have seen the delays, the difficulties, the struggles, the judgement, the abuse frankly and feel marginalised and criminalised because of our law and that is not okay,\" she said.\nAdams said she was very proud in her last months in the House to put that right.\nThere was uncertainty about how New Zealand First would vote as their bid to make the bill subject to a referendum was voted down.\nIn the end it was a female-male split; the two women MPs voted for the bill and the seven men voted against.\nUltimately the ayes won, though with a much narrower margin than at the second reading.\nAndrew Little said it was an historic moment.\n\"The changes to abortion law have been sought for a long time, many governments on both sides of the House have thought about it, no one has done it and with the support of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern we've done it,\" he said.\nLittle said women in New Zealand have campaigned for decades to have abortion treated as a health issue instead of a crime and that change has finally come.\n\n\n\nTags:\n\nhealth\nlaw\nlife and society\n\n\n\n\nShare this\n\n\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nShare via email\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Linked In\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, Radio New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView latest newsletter\n\n\n\n\nNext story in Politics\nCoronavirus: Government offers $900m loan for Air New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nLabour shrugs after abortion clinic safe-zones vote misfire\n\n11 Mar 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nMPs were caught out in a verbal vote against abortion clinic safe zones last night, but Labour's Jacinda Ardern and Andrew Little seem to want to just put it behind them.\n\n\nLabour shrugs after abortion clinic safe-zones vote misfire\n\n\n\nMPs vote to remove abortion clinic safe zones from Bill\n\n11 Mar 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nConfusion reigns as MPs do away with sections of the Abortion Legislation Bill that would have made legally protected 'safe areas' possible outside clinics.\n\n\nMPs vote to remove abortion clinic safe zones from Bill\n\n\n\nSelect committee delivers report on abortion Bill\n\n14 Feb 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Abortion Legislation Committee has delivered its much anticipated report on the Abortion Legislation Bill.\n\n\nSelect committee delivers report on abortion Bill\n\n\n\nOpinion: 'Nobody gets abortions on purpose'\n\n6 Aug 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is a medical necessity and the government should be applauded for recognising this fact, writes a woman who was denied an abortion in NZ.\n\n\nOpinion: Abortion is a medical necessity, reform is needed\n\n\n\nAbortion law reform: Govt announces Bill for 20-week medical test\n\n5 Aug 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion would not be a crime and would only require a medical test for women more than 20 weeks pregnant, in proposed changes announced by the government.\n\n\nAbortion law reform: Government announces Bill for 20-week medical test\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\nImpossible decisions and the job he never got to do - Grant Robertson on his time in politics\nDeputy PM Winston Peters attacks media over speech reporting\n'Nobody should live like this' - K\u0101inga Ora tenants hope changes make a difference\n\n\n\n\nGet the RNZ app\nfor ad-free news and current affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Top News stories\n    \n\nImpossible decisions and the job he never got to do - Grant Robertson on his time in politics\nNellie and me: Unravelling the story of a life inside an asylum\nDeputy PM Winston Peters attacks media over speech reporting\nWorld Rugby reveal plans to speed up the game\nBlenheim cold case: Police offer $100k reward\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView latest newsletter\n\n\n\nPolitics RSS\nFollow RNZ News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ stations\n\nNational\nConcert\nRNZ Pacific\nParliament - live stream\n\n\n\nLatest & popular\n\nLatest audio\nPopular audio\nLatest video\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to watch & listen\n\nAudio help\nRadio\nFollow our podcasts\nSky, Freeview & Satellite\nYouTube\nRNZ apps for iPhone and Android\nRNZ Flash Briefing for Amazon Alexa\nRNZ News for Google Assistant\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout RNZ\n\nAbout\nContact\nAudience Feedback and Complaints\nMedia Releases\nAwards\nJobs\nRNZ Your Media Matters\nLocal Democracy Reporting\nRNZ Commissioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin & Follow RNZ\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\nRNZ on Instagram\n\n\n\nSign up to RNZ Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Radio New Zealand 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
