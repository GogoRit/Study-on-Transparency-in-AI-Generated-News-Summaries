Now let\u2019s discuss violence against women and fetuses that talk.\u00a0By Carey PurcellSeptember 30, 2022Courtesy of Netflix.Save this storySaveSave this storySaveJoyce Carol Oates has described Blonde, the film based on her novel of the same name, as \u201csurprisingly feminist.\u201d The author of 58 novels, Oates devoted more than 700 pages to her prodigious fictionalization of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s life, beginning with the young girl Norma Jeane and ending as the tragic Hollywood icon. A finalist for the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize, Blonde is widely viewed as the prolific writer\u2019s masterpiece.Drawn from the widely known facts of Monroe\u2019s life\u2014her famous film roles, her infamous relationships, and her mysterious death\u2014Oates\u2019s novel is a shocking, horrifying, and engrossing portrait of the woman behind the glossy red-lipped smile. The film by writer-director Andrew Dominik is equally shocking and horrifying, but in different and wildly unexpected ways. It is surprising, but it is not feminist. By adapting Oates\u2019s novel to the screen, he has produced an exploitative film with an underlying anti-choice agenda. Rather than honor the victim of patriarchy, the patriarchy of the film has overwhelmed and almost erased her.Oates has said the novel was inspired after she saw a photograph of Marilyn Monroe when she was 15 years old and still known as Norma Jeane Baker. Recalling the triumphant beauty queen\u2019s youth and innocence, Oates told her own biographer, Greg Johnson, \u201cI felt an immediate sense of something like recognition; this young, hopefully smiling girl, so very American, reminded me powerfully of girls of my childhood, some of them from broken homes.\u201dThe loss of that innocence infuses the novel, which chronicles Norma Jeane\u2019s rise to fame through a studio system in which she was mistreated and molded to please the male gaze. Oates narrates a lifetime tormented by parental neglect, sexual assault, and domestic violence in an unforgiving portrait of the damage it wrought on the hopeful young woman. It\u2019s not an easy read\u2014chaotic stream-of-consciousness monologues, lacking punctuation, fill pages at a time, and Oates composes fictional diary entries that list the horrors Monroe endured and the destructive ways in which she coped with them. The book is engrossing and enlightening\u2014and absolutely terrifying.The feminist credentials of Blonde, the novel, are questionable. Oates does offer a brutal look at the male-dominated establishment of Hollywood and its inhumane treatment of women, presenting Monroe as an intellectual reduced to a dumb blonde by the men around her. Her Monroe writes poetry, reads Stanislavski\u00a0and Freud, and attends night classes in disguise. But Oates also ignores the real Monroe\u2019s accomplishments. Instead, she is a victim, with little agency or authority. Whether Oates honors the actor by depicting her as one is subject to interpretation.Following a ponderously faithful made-for-TV adaptation in 2001, some questioned whether Blonde could ever be successfully translated to the screen. Twenty-one years later, we appear to have our answer. Despite a moving performance by Ana de Armas as Marilyn, Dominik\u2019s film proves that what established the book as simultaneously shocking and thrilling is instead vulgar and exploitative on film.The word abortion is never spoken in Blonde, but it hovers over almost every scene of the film\u2019s two hours and 46 minutes, adding even more weight to a movie already burdened with brutal illustrations of painful subjects. Mental illness, addiction, and suicide are just a few tragedies the film plunges into, but its portrayal of abortions is especially heavy-handed and painful to witness following the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade.Monroe has been rumored to have had several abortions in real life, but only two are included in the film, their depictions offering a strong argument to categorize Blonde as a horror movie. Subtlety is hardly a strength of Dominik\u2019s. Blonde includes several close-up shots of a fetus as it develops in Marilyn\u2019s stomach, one of which is pointedly shown while she calls the studio to arrange her abortion. On the way to the procedure, Marilyn, somberly clad in a black dress, begs her driver (in a car strongly resembling a funeral hearse) to turn around after seeing a stop sign. Her pleas continue on the operating table but are ignored by the doctors until an injection lulls her into a \u201ctwilight sleep.\u201d What follows is a close-up of her cervix before she dreams of fleeing from the doctors and saving a baby from danger as the sweetly crooning song \u201cBye, Bye, Baby\u201d plays.Most PopularPhotos From Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartyBarry Keoghan, Charles Melton, and Hunter Schafer Kick Off Oscar Week in Style at Vanity Fair and Instagram\u2019s Vanities PartyBy Kara WarnerAn Exclusive Early Look at the 2024 Oscars SetBy Kara WarnerThat the Marilyn of the movie regrets this decision is undeniable. She is shown as haunted by her abortion, paralyzed in her dressing room and unable to perform. While surrounded by thunderous applause at the premiere of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, she wipes tears from her eyes and whispers to herself, \u201cFor this you killed your baby.\u201dBlonde\u2019s Marilyn is seen as desperately longing to lose herself in the identity of a mother, elated when she becomes pregnant in her third marriage and responding to her husband\u2019s jokes about food cravings with, \u201cBaby makes his wishes known. Norma\u2019s just the vessel!\u201d While discussing his wife, The Playwright (Oates\u2019s name for Arthur Miller) remarks, \u201cPregnancy agrees with her\u2026. She says, \u2018This is how it\u2019s supposed to be, I guess.\u2019\u201d Dominik\u2019s most shocking choice, however, is seen when Marilyn hears the fetus (again, shown developing in her body) plaintively asking her, \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me this time, will you?\u201d After she protests that she didn\u2019t mean to end her first pregnancy, the fetus tells her, \u201cYes, you meant to. It was your decision.\u201d Presented as its own being, with its own voice, the fetus is clearly shown to be a life, independent of its mother, before it is born.The hell that Blonde\u2019s Marilyn puts herself through is painful to watch, due to de Armas\u2019s remarkably raw performance. She tortures herself after she miscarries, losing herself in drugs and alcohol. While performing a scene from Some Like It Hot, her character is accused of being \u201ccareless,\u201d and the screen is filled with images of her fetus dying when she miscarried. De Armas plays Marilyn as a scared girl, tremulously quivering in fear as she seeks approval from every (male) figure in her life. Her breathy voice and wide eyes only enhance her youthful appearance. During scenes in which everyone is clothed in dark colors, she is dressed in shimmering white.Oates created a character desperate to be a mother and tormented by her inability. Dominik and de Armas\u2019s Marilyn is a faithful adaptation of Oates\u2019s, but that devotion does not translate into a successfully entertaining film. Instead, the horrifying images that illustrate the abortions\u2014close-up shots of the procedure and its ongoing effects on Marilyn\u2019s mental health\u2014come across as promotion of an anti-choice agenda associating abortion with horrific violence and declaring it murder. Fetal personhood, the idea that life begins at conception, is an excuse for the onslaught of anti-choice legislature in America, and Dominik has directed a film in which a fetus begs the woman carrying it, \u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026do what you did the last time?\u201d The theme of violence is even more heavy-handed when, the morning after Marilyn is forced into another abortion, presumably by The President, she stumbles out of bed confused and discovers the lower of half of her body soaked in blood.It\u2019s undeniable that Marilyn is a victim. She is remarkably sympathetic, which inspires the question of why Dominik chose to shoot the movie as he did. Why torture this Marilyn, and by way of de Armas\u2019s compelling presence, the audience? The pain of Marilyn\u2019s childhood and the horrors of her adulthood have been examined in countless books, movies, and podcasts. Blonde\u2019s portrayal of her pregnancies and losses does set it apart from other content, but that status comes with a cost.\u201cThe last few days of her life were brutal,\u201d Oates said of Marilyn. \u201cThe real things that happened to Marilyn Monroe are much worse than anything in the movie.\u201d Why should that be experienced again? Oates has praised Dominik and the film on Twitter, writing, \u201c\u2026not sure that any male director has ever achieved anything [like] this.\u201d That may be true, but there may also be reasons why.Blonde\u2019s Marilyn is open and exposed. She leaves everything she has onscreen, keeping nothing for herself. The patriarchal structure of Hollywood defines her life while simultaneously violating and disrespecting it, and she is unable to fight for herself. The lack of choice in Marilyn\u2019s life is appalling, but equally shocking is the decision to present it so bluntly to an audience still reeling from their own rights being taken away.\u00a0One of the film\u2019s most horrifying moments depicts Marilyn, having fallen on the beach and experiencing a miscarriage, screaming for her husband to help. As he races toward her, he\u2019s surrounded by members of the press, their cameras flashing while they photograph her pain. As Dominik condemns their exploitation of her tragedies for entertainment and profit, he should have included himself in the shot.The Ultimate Guide to the 2024 OscarsThe Biggest Moments From the Oscars 2024Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee Every Look From the Oscars Red CarpetFrom Emma Stone to LeBron James, Stars Collided at the 2024 VF Oscar PartyOppenheimer\u2019s Golden Night at the OscarsBillie Eilish, Lily Gladstone, and More Stars of Mark Seliger\u2019s 2024 Oscar Party PortraitsAll the Glam From the Oscar Party Red Carpet11 Spectacular Stars Unite for the 30th Annual Hollywood IssueStay in the know and subscribe to Vanity Fair for just $2.50 $1 per month.Carey PurcellSee More By Carey Purcell \u00bbRead MorePoliticsMark Cuban: Biden Could Be on His Deathbed and I\u2019d Still Vote for Him Over \u201cSnake Oil Salesperson\u201d\u00a0TrumpHe could be taking his last breath\u2014and still then!By Bess LevinHollywoodOppenheimer Awards Speech Crashed by Mysterious BAFTAs PranksterThe British Academy refuses to name the man, and said it is taking the security breach \u201cvery seriously.\u201dBy Eve BateyAward SeasonHow The Holdovers Pulled Off Paul Giamatti\u2019s Lazy EyeCristina Patterson\u2019s custom contact lenses have transformed actors into all manners of monsters and zombies\u2014but the curmudgeonly professor at the center of The Holdovers was a new kind of challenge.By Katey RichHollywoodDwayne Johnson Is Looking for the \u201cIdiot\u201d Who \u201cScreamed\u201d at Rebecca FergusonFerguson, who starred with Johnson in 2014\u2019s Hercules, recently shared an anecdote about an unnamed difficult coworker\u2014but has already confirmed that Tom Cruise and Hugh Jackman were not involved.By Savannah WalshRoyalsMeghan Markle Hits the Slopes With Friends During \u201cPerfect Trip\u201dThe Duchess of Sussex chilled with her pals and their families for a bit of winter fun.By Kase WickmanNewsTrump Accuses Biden of \u201cConspiracy To Overthrow the United States of America\u201d\u201cHe talks about democracy,\u201d the GOP frontrunner said of the president. \u201cHe is a danger to democracy.\u201dBy Jack McCordickStyleKing Harald V of Norway has Emergency Pacemaker Implanted in MalaysiaThe 87-year-old monarch fell ill this week during his resort island vacation.
