Newsroom, Sep 23, 2022 / 17:56 pm\nA Catholic speaker and author who regularly prays the rosary outside an abortion clinic in Philadelphia was arrested by at least 20 SWAT team members on Friday for an alleged physical assault of a Planned Parenthood clinic escort last year.\nMark Houck, 48, of Kintnersville, Pennsylvania, who disputes the allegations, is the co-founder and president of the Catholic ministry The King\u2019s Men, which aims to give spiritual formation to Catholic men.\u00a0\nNews of Houck\u2019s arrest on Friday morning was widely shared on social media after well-known Catholic speaker Chris Stefanick posted about it online. Houck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie Houck, told CNA about the arrest Friday.\n\u201cA SWAT team of about 25 came to my house with about 15 vehicles and started pounding on our door,\u201d Ryan-Marie Houck said. \u201cThey said they were going to break in if he didn\u2019t open it. And then they had about five guns pointed at my husband, myself, and basically at my kids,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that multiple agencies were present at the arrest and that she was handed a warrant after she requested to see it.\nStefanick called the arrest \u201cgovernment sponsored bullying & intimidation.\u201d\nThe FBI confirmed to CNA Friday that Houck was arrested outside his residence Friday morning \u201cwithout incident.\u201d In a press release, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said that Houck is being charged with a violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, more commonly referred to as the FACE Act.\nThe federal indictment says that Houck twice assaulted a 72-year-old man who was a patient escort at a Planned Parenthood clinic at 1144 Locust St. in Philadelphia on Oct. 13, 2021. \nAccording to the indictment, Houck shoved the escort, identified only with the initials B.L., to the ground as B.L was attempting to escort two patients. Houck also \u201cverbally confronted\u201d and \u201cforcefully shoved\u201d B.L. to the ground in front of Planned Parenthood the same day, the indictment says. The indictment says that B.L. was injured and needed medical attention.\nBrian Middleton, the Houck family spokesman, maintains the injury was minor, only requiring \u201ca Band-Aid on his finger.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Father James Hutchins, who serves as the chaplain of Houck\u2019s organization, the case against Houck may have been deliberately exaggerated. \nA statement from Joe and Ashley Garecht on a recently created fundraising page for Houck described a very different scenario \u2014 one of defense of Houck\u2019s child. \n\u201cLast year, Mark and his son were praying in front of the PP at 12th and Locust. When one of the escorts began harassing Mark\u2019s son they walked down the street away from the entrance to the building. The escort followed them, and when he continued yelling at Mark\u2019s son, Mark pushed him away,\u201d the couple said, noting that the incident is on video. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Garechts, \u201cthat hasn\u2019t stopped Planned Parenthood and the Biden administration. With no prior warning, and in spite of the fact that Mark is represented by an attorney, Biden\u2019s Justice Department sent a fully armed SWAT team into a home full of young children at daybreak to arrest a father for protecting his son.\u201d\nIf he is convicted, Houck could face up to 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $350,000, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\u00a0\nThe FACE Act \u201cprohibits violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain or provide reproductive health services,\u201d according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\u00a0\nViolating the FACE Act is a federal crime and protects \u201call patients, providers, and facilities that provide reproductive health services, including pro-life pregnancy counseling services and any other pregnancy support facility providing reproductive health care,\u201d according to the DOJ.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan-Marie Houck told CNA that her husband prays the rosary outside one of two different Planned Parenthoods every Wednesday and hands out literature to anyone who wants it. She said that praying outside the clinic is part of The King\u2019s Men ministry.\u00a0\n\u201cThis was a gross over-reach from the \u2018justice\u2019 department with excessive use of force and trumped up allegations and our story needs to be told truthfully,\u201d Ryan-Marie Houck said in a text. \u201cThese are false allegations.\u201d\nShe said that he had his first appearance before a judge and was subsequently released on Friday. As of Sunday night, an\u00a0online fund drive\u00a0had raised more than $126,000 to help the family with legal costs. \n\u201cPlanned Parenthood and its pro-abortion allies want to send a message of fear to the pro-life community of Pennsylvania,\u201d said the fundraising page. \n\u201cBut we have a different message to share: We will not back down, we will not stop fighting to protect the lives of Pennsylvania\u2019s unborn children, and we WILL NOT TOLERATE the harassment of our leaders by a corrupt and politicized justice system.\u201d\nThis story was updated on Sept. 25, 2022, with new facts provided by several sources.\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPlanned Parenthood, \nPro-life advocacy, \nPhiladelphia, \nAbortion in the United States, \nFACE Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Catholic News Agency (CNA) Staff are a team of journalists dedicated to reporting news concerning the Catholic Church around the world.
