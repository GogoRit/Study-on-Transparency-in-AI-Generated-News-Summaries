She previously worked at Business Insider covering the military and global conflicts.\n      \n\n\n\n\nA Texas state court on Friday sided with a group of women and doctors suing the state, saying that exceptions to Texas\u2019s stringent abortion restrictions are too vague and prevented or delayed people from getting abortion care when their lives or health were at risk.\nTexas\u2019s SB 8, which passed before Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, bans abortions past six weeks with some exceptions and deputizes citizens to enforce the law by suing people who aid or abet abortion, putting health care providers at legal risk. Under the law, doctors can provide abortion care if the health or life of the pregnant person is at risk; but the lack of clarity around what those conditions meant had a chilling effect on doctors in the state \u2014 and had serious effects on patients\u2019 health.\nJudge Jessica Mangrum of the Travis County District Court ruled Friday in Zurawski v. State of Texas that physicians could use their \u201cgood faith judgment\u201d to perform an abortion for a patient who has \u201ca physical medical condition or complication of pregnancy that poses a risk of infection, or otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe for the pregnant person; a physical medical condition that is exacerbated by pregnancy, cannot be effectively treated during pregnancy, or requires recurrent invasive intervention; and/or a fetal condition where the fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy and sustain life after birth,\u201d according to the ruling. \nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office filed an appeal in the case on Friday night, staying the injunction while the case is on appeal, according to the New York Times, and accusing Mangrum of trying \u201cto override Texas abortion laws.\u201d\nMangrum\u2019s injunction would block SB 8\u2019s vigilante enforcement mechanism from being enacted against any patients seeking abortions for medical reasons or against the physicians who perform those procedures \u2014 and furthermore states that doing so would violate pregnant people\u2019s rights under Texas\u2019s constitution. \nThough Mangrum\u2019s injunction is presently on hold, it\u2019s important for two main reasons that are not exclusive to Texas: It forces clarity around abortion exceptions and protects doctors and patients; and it establishes that punishing people who seek or provide abortions under those circumstances is unconstitutional. \nThough the eventual, final ruling will apply only to Texas, it\u2019s not the only state where unclear legislation is limiting access to medically necessary abortion. And it\u2019s not the only state where reproductive health advocates are grappling with the right to abortion under the state\u2019s constitution. \nThe vagueness and chilling effect are the point\nAs anti-abortion state legislators have enacted bans throughout the country, they\u2019ve had to grapple with the complexities of abortion care and reproductive health. Most pregnancies are safe and healthy, but some cause severe complications or are not viable. Overturning Roe v. Wade didn\u2019t change those conditions or provide better prenatal health care, it just made pregnancy more dangerous in many states.\n\u201c[Anti-choice legislators] could make whatever political points they wanted to because they had a backstop,\u201d with Roe v. Wade in place, South Carolina Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto told Vox in September. \u201cThey knew nothing they passed was ever going to go into effect. They could pass all they wanted to, and it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 and it allowed them to let their rhetoric just soar to the red meat of their party because they could gin up the party knowing that nothing they said was ever going to be enacted into law. Then, all of a sudden [...] it\u2019s like the dog that caught the bus.\u201d\nWith SB 8, Texas legislators not only passed a restrictive abortion ban but they empowered ordinary Texans to interpret and prosecute the ban. That compounds the risk for physicians who provide abortion care, in some sense, because they don\u2019t know the conditions under which they can do so \u2014 or who might bring a $10,000 lawsuit against them for doing their jobs. \nMeanwhile, the state argued in court that the law was clear enough \u2014 and if anyone who should have had an abortion was denied one, it was the physician\u2019s fault, not the law\u2019s or the state\u2019s.\n\u201cPhysicians have been begging for guidance [...] since SB 8 went into effect,\u201d Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox in an interview. \u201cNo one from the state has provided any guidance, and in fact the only thing the attorney general\u2019s office has done is file their own lawsuit challenging some guidance from Health and Human Services \u2014 the federal department that oversees the practice of medicine \u2014 saying that a federal statute called EMTALA which allows abortion care and any other care in an emergency, that that shouldn\u2019t apply in Texas.\u201d\nLike in Texas, Indiana\u2019s legislature passed a near-total abortion ban that went into effect on August 1. It\u2019s a hostile state for people who need abortions; medication abortion is illegal, and Attorney General Todd Rokita in June signed a letter opposing an amendment to HIPAA, the federal medical privacy law, which would prevent state officials from accessing information about patients who traveled out of state to get an abortion. \nRebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky, told Vox in an interview that the lack of clarity in these laws is the point. \u201cThese laws, and this new law, are incredibly confusing,\u201d she said. \u201dExtreme lawmakers are writing these laws intentionally to cause harm, to create chaos and confusion both for providers and for patients.\u201d \nGibron\u2019s organization filed suit in the state Supreme Court to block the law from going into effect pending a case in trial court which would provide clarity specifically around the health exceptions to Indiana\u2019s abortion ban. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the ban from going into effect, it simply is asking the court to clarify the health exception and to block the section of the ban that limits health care providers\u2019 ability to offer abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant person is threatened,\u201d she said. \nWithout that clarity, not only are patients risking their lives with a pregnancy and doctors risking their practices, but it could cause a brain drain for reproductive health care providers who feel they can\u2019t safely practice in the states where they live. That\u2019s especially grave in a place like Indiana which has the third-highest maternal mortality rate in the country \u2014 and it\u2019s increased 58 percent in the past three years.\nHow pregnant people can be protected under state constitutions\nZurawski v. State of Texas hinged on the testimony of 13 women and two physicians, who told the court about their life- or health-threatening pregnancies, and how difficult it was to get abortion care when they needed it. \nTheir argument was that although Texas doesn\u2019t have enshrined in the constitution a right to abortion, the plaintiffs and people like them \u2014 those who need an abortion for medical reasons \u2014 are protected under the state\u2019s constitution.\n\u201cTexas\u2019s constitution has a right to life and liberty, plus they have an equal rights amendment \u2014 so, that guarantees equal treatment to women and men, something that does not exist in the federal Constitution,\u201d Duane said. \u201cWe brought these life, liberty, and equality claims to the Texas state court because that is the source of the rights, is Texas law and the Texas constitution.\u201d\nDuane and her team argued for clarification of the law, but they were also arguing, she told Vox, that \u201cthe bare minimum that we believe that pregnant people in Texas are entitled to is protection of their life and health, even while they\u2019re pregnant.\u201d\nThe case will now go to Texas\u2019s appellate court, and then to the state Supreme Court \u2014 which, Duane noted, is not known for its progressive stance on abortion. \nOther states have used the constitution more overtly to protect the right to abortion; Ohio will hold an election on Tuesday deciding State Issue 1, which could limit the ability to amend the state constitution through further ballot measures \u2014 including one that would enshrine the right to abortion in Ohio\u2019s constitution. That measure will be voted on November 7 and would codify Ohioans\u2019 right to \u201cmake and carry out [their] own reproductive decisions.\u201d\nAbortion is presently legal in Ohio until viability despite a 2019 law banning the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy. A county court judge stayed that law last year after Roe v. Wade was overturned, ruling that Ohio\u2019s state constitution grants the right to abortion because it gives women equal protection and benefit under the law. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
