Wade was overturned. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder (file photo)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Georgia Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of the argument that the state\u2019s six-week abortion should be tossed out because it passed while Roe v. Wade was still standing.\nThat\u2019s one of the key arguments plaintiffs made when they challenged the law last year in Fulton County Superior Court, where Judge Robert C. I. McBurney called the provisions of the law \u201cplainly unconstitutional\u201d because they were enacted in 2019 \u2013 three years before Roe v. Wade was overturned \u2013 and temporarily blocked the law. The law is now in effect.\nMcBurney ruled that lawmakers should have to pass a measure in the wake of last year\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling.\n  Georgia Supreme Court Justice Charlie J. Bethel. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder\nThe state appealed McBurney\u2019s decision, which put the question before the state Supreme Court. Justices heard oral arguments Tuesday on the eve of the final day of the 2023 legislative session. The panel will issue a decision \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d said Chief Justice Michael P. Boggs.\u00a0\n\u201cThe entire theory of the case from the plaintiff\u2019s perspective is that the LIFE Act was void in 2019 because of federal judicial decisions,\u201d said Stephen Petrany, solicitor general with the Georgia Attorney General\u2019s Office. \u201cAnd so the notion that somehow Dobbs does not undo that \u2013 it would be incoherent.\u201d\nThe state is arguing that the 2023 ruling did not change the U.S. Constitution but rather offered a different interpretation of the text that should be applied retroactively. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling now famously called the 1973 decision \u201cegregiously wrong from the start.\u201d\n\u201cDobbs expressly says the prior precedent was wrong and \u2013 whether anybody agrees with that \u2013 it says that, and it\u2019s the last word on it,\u201d Justice Charlie Bethel said during Tuesday\u2019s proceeding.\nJustice Sarah Warren more pointedly poked at the plaintiffs\u2019 position.\n\u201cWhen you have judicial precedent that is applied retroactively, I do not think you can artificially separate them as you have tried to do here,\u201d Warren said.\nBut Julia Stone, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the health care providers and abortion rights advocates challenging the law, made the case Tuesday that lawmakers knew in 2019 that the six-week ban would run afoul of Roe v. Wade, which protected access to abortion services up until the point of fetal viability.\n  Atlanta Party for Socialism & Liberation Protesters outside the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective v. State of Georgia hearing. Aaleah McConnell/Georgia Recorder\nPassing the law anyway amounts to legislative overreach and makes the law void from the start, Stone argued.\n\u201cThis is not a case where there was gray area in this in 2019. This was a case where there were 50 years of Supreme Court precedent,\u201d Stone said.\nWhile arguments were being heard inside, a small group of protesters sounded off their disdain for the six-week abortion ban outside the Nathan Deal Judicial Center in downtown Atlanta. They held signs bearing messages like \u201cright to abortion is not negotiable\u201d and chanted phrases like \u201cmy body, my choice\u201d and \u201crepeal the ban.\u201d\nMany of the advocates said they protest because they know firsthand the mental and physical health risks women are faced with \u2013 whether they choose to have an abortion or carry the pregnancy to full-term.\u00a0\n\u201cThe power to control your own body should be something that everyone has,\u201d said Natalie Villasana, an organizer for Atlanta Party for Socialism and Liberation. \u201cBut instead, that\u2019s in the hands of just a few conservative politicians in Georgia, like just a few people are able to take away this fundamental right from millions of people. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\u00a0\nPost-oral argument reaction\nStone acknowledged after Tuesday\u2019s hearing that some of the justices who asked questions appeared skeptical of the argument. But she said the public \u201ccan\u2019t read ever too much into questions\u201d and said she remained hopeful the panel might block the law.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are 125 years of Georgia Supreme Court precedent that says you look at the constitutionality of the statute at the moment of its enactment. So when you do that here, it\u2019s a pretty straightforward application,\u201d she told reporters after the hearing.\nBut if the justices do decide to reverse McBurney\u2019s ruling, the legal challenge will be far from resolved. For example, the plaintiffs have also argued that Georgia\u2019s law violates the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy. Stone said she expected more appearances before the state\u2019s highest court as the constitutionality of Georgia\u2019s law is tested.\nMcBurney held a two-day trial to hear arguments and testimony back in October and has not ruled on other parts of the case.\u00a0\n  The bill\u2019s lead sponsor in 2019, now-Sen.

And so that\u2019s the tension that they had to deal with today,\u201d Kreis said.\nGeorgia was one of several states that passed new abortion restrictions in light of a new conservative majority on the nation\u2019s highest court. The law also includes personhood language, such as a provision that allows an expecting parent to claim an embryo as a dependent for Georgia taxes.\nBut the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, now-Sen.
