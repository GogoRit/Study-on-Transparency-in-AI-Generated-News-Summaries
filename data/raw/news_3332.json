Wade, is it time for the anti-abortion movement to finally embrace a seamless culture of life that extends its protections to mothers and children who have already been born?\nThe answer is no \u2014 no, it isn\u2019t. And yet many social conservatives believe just such a transformation lies around the corner. Their hope may be delusional, yet the fact of its existence is itself revealing.\nTwo decades ago, the conservative movement had essentially no internal opposition to its reigning creed of supply-side economics, which holds tax cuts for the rich to be the correct solution to all economic and fiscal circumstances and abhors the downward redistribution of wealth. There now exists a small but vocal clique of conservative intellectuals willing to criticize that creed \u2014 albeit usually in measured terms. (This is a disagreement among comrades, after all.)\nThose conservatives have grasped onto the Dobbs ruling as their chance to steer the party\u2019s economic doctrine away from its doctrinaire course. \u201cThere is now a really important opening for pro-life Republicans to be more open about their support of social-welfare programs,\u201d Charlie Camosy, ethics professor at the Creighton University School of Medicine and anti-abortion columnist for the Religion News Service, hopefully tells The Atlantic.\n\u201cThe pro-life impulse could control and improve conservative governance rather than being undermined by it, making the G.O.P. more serious about family policy and public health,\u201d proposes\u00a0Ross Douthat in a New York Times op-ed.\nDouthat makes a persuasive description of the moral stakes involved. The anti-abortion movement contains activists and thinkers who believe in a \u201cseamless garment\u201d of life, which requires support for generous social provisions for families in addition to restrictions on abortion. But his reasoning suffers from the same flaw that can be found every time he analyzes the Republican Party: He treats the existing party as though it is hypothetical while presenting the alternative party he wishes to exist as real. \u201cYou can imagine a future in which anti-abortion laws are permanently linked to a punitive and stingy politics,\u201d he writes, \u201cin which women in difficulties can face police scrutiny for a suspicious miscarriage but receive little in the way of prenatal guidance or postnatal support.\u201d\nThat is not merely the future. It is the past and present. After all, conservatives may have more latitude to restrict abortion now, but it\u2019s not as if they had no opportunity to do so before. Conservatives have applied a combination of legal restrictions, social pressure, and terrorist threats to make abortion exceedingly difficult to obtain in much of the country.\nThe Dobbs case originated in Mississippi, a state that has one remaining clinic that performs abortions. As the decision\u2019s dissenters note, \u201ca state-by-state analysis by public health professionals shows that States with the most restrictive abortion policies also continue to invest the least in women\u2019s and children\u2019s health.\u201d Mississippi is the state with the highest infant-mortality rate in the U.S.\nIs there any sign that this could change? Consider the negotiations around the child tax credit. The American Jobs Plan created an enhanced benefit for families, which has proven to be one of the most successful social experiments in recent U.S. history by reducing child poverty by one-third.\nThe measure, however, has failed to attract any Republican support and expired this year. Mitt Romney has tried to recruit members of his party to support a newer, bipartisan version of the plan. He unveiled his idea last year. The Niskanen Center, which helped Romney design the proposal, boasted that it would reduce the child-poverty rate from 12.41 percent to 8.37 percent.\nHowever, the measure was too generous to low-income families to attract any Republican support in Congress. So, recently, Romney retooled his plan and rolled out a newer version. The second, stingier version would, according to Niskanen, reduce the child-poverty rate to 10.8 percent. In other words, according to its own advocates, the new plan would be less than half as effective as the old one. In return for these concessions, Romney has gained a total of two Republican supporters in the Senate.\nIf Romney wants to win enough Republicans to join with the Democrats and break a Republican filibuster, he will have to give back even more, and there\u2019s hardly anything left to give back.\nOne can certainly sympathize with Romney\u2019s goals here. The problem is that he is working within the constraints of the Republican Party and the conservative movement. Those constraints include an absolute prohibition on new taxes or any cuts that would harm the rich. The sole exception is the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans are willing to eliminate because it harms blue-state residents and creates an incentive to shrink their states\u2019 governments down to red-state levels \u2014 that is, levels that require sparse welfare states, high poverty, and cruel treatment of the poor.\nObviously, coming events can\u2019t be predicted with any certainty. It\u2019s theoretically possible to imagine a future in which advocates of generous social family policy are aligned with, rather than against, advocates of restrictions on abortion.\nBut nothing about the Dobbs decision hastens the creation of such an alliance. To the contrary, abortion is becoming more salient, and centripetal forces that held together the conservative alliance will be stronger rather than weaker. Abortion opponents will fight battles in every state and in every Congress for the foreseeable future. They have no incentive to break with the allies who have stood with them for decades. Now they will ask Republicans to accept higher levels of political risk to enact abortion restrictions that were previously off the table and which risk blowback against the party. They need the anti-government right more than ever.\nThe anti-abortion movement\u2019s critics depict it as \u201cpunitive and cruel and patriarchal, piling burdens on poor women and doing nothing to relieve them, putting unborn life ahead of the lives and health of women while pretending to hold them equal,\u201d Douthat concedes. \u201cTo win the long-term battle, to persuade the country\u2019s vast disquieted middle, abortion opponents need models that prove this critique wrong.\u201d\nBut the hard fact is that, despite all Douthat\u2019s efforts to summon a better reality into existence, the critique is, in fact, correct.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for &c.\nIrregular musings from the center left.\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n          Privacy Policy and\n          Terms of Service apply.\n        \nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\npolitics\n\n\nthe national interest\n\n\nlife after roe\n\n\nmitt romney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nPro-Lifers Aren\u2019t Going to Start Caring About Families Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Middleton Was Spotted in Public, With Video to Prove It\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Says He Can\u2019t Get a $464 Million Bond.
