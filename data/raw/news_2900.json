We commend the Diocese of Boise of the Roman Catholic Church for voicing its support for the progression of SB 1309.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBackground on the bill\u00a0\nThis bill was largely modeled after the Texas Heartbeat Law which prohibits abortions after six weeks, the time when a heartbeat is first detected. Idaho\u2019s version of the bill allows relatives of the preborn to sue abortion vendors for a minimum of $20,000 in damages if abortion is committed after hearing a heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s happening\u00a0\u00a0\nOn March 23rd, Governor Little signed this piece of legislation to then have Planned Parenthood and abortionist Dr. Caitlin Gustafson file a lawsuit seven days later requesting the Idaho Supreme Court to review the law before April 22nd\u2014the date it was scheduled to take effect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Court ordered a stay on the legislation with an April 28th deadline for the state to submit its brief to the Court. Now, the Roman Catholic Church in Idaho is asking the state\u2019s Supreme Court to let it intervene in this lawsuit as it supports prohibiting abortions after hearing a child\u2019s heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction) applauded Idaho\u2019s Heartbeat Act and continues to advocate for its completion. SFLAction President, Kristan Hawkins, said, \u201cWith its strong heartbeat bill, Idaho is taking a crucial step closer to protecting ALL preborn children from abortion violence in the state.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe are grateful to our Catholic friends for engaging in this argument and standing together for life. When enacted, this bill will be a huge success for the Pro-Life Generation who want to see abortion abolished in their lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Babies are treasure, so why are they treated like trash?\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,091\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
