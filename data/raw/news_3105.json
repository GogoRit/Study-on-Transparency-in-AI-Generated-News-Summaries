On the international day of love\u2014named for a self-less, altruistic martyr and celebrated worldwide through acts of both romance and friendship\u2014the abortion lobby decided to announce that they didn\u2019t believe a fetal heartbeat was a sign of life. Their timing is wildly off \u2013 and so is their science. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at this heartless Valentine\u2019s Day message:\u00a0\u00a0\nWhere\u2019d this report come from?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe New York Times published an article entitled, \u201cAbortion Opponents Hear a \u2018Heartbeat.\u2019 Most Experts Hear Something Else.\u201d The premise of the article is that pro-life beliefs and legislation aren\u2019t founded in science and specifically targets heartbeat bills, like the Texas Heartbeat Law. The author, Roni Caryn Rabin, makes the claim that fetal heartbeats are artificially created and not determinant of life. She writes that the \u201cconsensus\u201d from experts is that \u201cthe sound expectant mothers hear during a scan [an ultrasound] is created by the machine itself, which translates the waves of electrical activity into something audible.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBut who\u2019s she calling an expert exactly?\u00a0\u00a0\nThat is the key question. For Rabin, an \u201cexpert\u201d is someone who supports abortion and overlooks the \u2018inconveniences\u2019 of science. These inconveniences are hard questions or truths that oppose the abortion agenda and ultimately lead to the pro-life conclusion\u2014which is exactly why they must be ignored at all costs. And when they can\u2019t be ignored, they\u2019ll be redefined to suit the abortion industry\u2019s anti-science fantasies. Rabin\u2019s sources do this expertly, which is probably how they earned her distinction as \u2018the experts.\u2019 Here are a couple things \u2018the experts\u2019 completely disregarded:\u00a0\u00a0\nThe fact that there is no national abortion reporting law, making claims about the \u201csafety\u201d of abortion violence on women utterly baseless.\u00a0 Rabin makes multiple claims about the safety of abortion, but where\u2019s her proof? Abortion data is scarce and only given on a voluntary basis by those doing the killing\u2014not a great system for determining truth.\u00a0\u00a0\nRabin claims that there\u2019s \u201clack of evidence\u201d that abortion is linked with infertility \u2013 another lie. Left untreated, a mother\u2019s Rh-negative status poses a serious risk factor to future fertility, yet this risk factor is ignored by abortionists. Rabin also ignores the fact that women who undergo abortion violence are at increased risk for subsequent preterm births, which are linked to infant mortality.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe majority of scientists have entirely different belief on when life begins than these pro-abortion doctors\u2014yet that majority opinion is seemingly thrown aside and not even discussed (more on that in a minute).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd they want to call pro-lifers \u201canti-science\u201d?\u00a0\u00a0\nWeird, right? Rabin completely disregards pro-life doctors in her analysis despite the fact that the pro-life movement is the only side of the abortion issue that actually embraces scientific truths. In fact, the entire pro-life movement is based on this\u2014taking moral action based upon scientific truths. The scientific truth behind our movement is that an overwhelming majority of American biologists (more than 95%) believe that life begins at conception\u2014and thus, so do we. Our moral outcry and call to action comes in with the problem of abortion\u2014the legal murder of a child which science has shown to be human and alive since he or she was conceived.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe sad fact is that the abortion lobby refuses to accept the majority of the scientific community\u2019s conclusion on when life begins\u2014and now, they\u2019re falsifying a reason not to believe in the universal sign of life: the heartbeat. Is this a coincidence? Not a chance. By illegitimatizing a preborn baby\u2019s heartbeat, they are further encouraging abortions up until the moment of birth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat is the Pro-Life Generation doing this Valentine\u2019s Day?\u00a0\u00a0\nIn contrast to trotting out unscientific and unethical claims (like some people this year), the pro-life movement is actively engaged in helping women and children. For example, Students for Life of America\u2019s initiative Standing with You has recently been relaunched in order to better assist our communities (check out a coalition letter that was published, pledging women a support system regardless of the outcome of Dobbs v. Jackson and wishing them a happy Valentine\u2019s Day!). We even spent our Valentine\u2019s Day celebrating women and the resources available to them. \u00a0\nStanding with You exists to make sure pregnant, parenting, and post-abortive women (along with their families) are supported in every way thinkable. That includes assistance with things such as housing, food, clothing, finances, childcare, counseling, peer-to-peer support, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s clear the pro-life movement is pro-science and pro-love.\u00a0\u00a0\nToo bad we can\u2019t say the same for the abortion lobby. They\u2019ve really shown their cards this time, once again exposing themselves as unscientific and inhumane. This Valentine\u2019s Day, out of love for all women and children, don\u2019t let their agenda go unchallenged. The most loving thing we can do is to speak truth and take action.\u00a0\u00a0\nClick HERE to find ways to help!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 644\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
