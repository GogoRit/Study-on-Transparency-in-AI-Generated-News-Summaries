Wade was overturned\u2014despite most Americans supporting it remaining legal.\nAnti- and pro-abortion rights supporters at the 50th annual March for Life rally on January 20 in ... [+] Washington, DC.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe RNC passed a resolution at its winter meeting directing lawmakers in Congress and state legislatures \u201cto pass the strongest pro-life legislation possible\u201d ahead of the 2024 election cycle\u2014citing six-week abortion bans as an example\u2014according to a copy of the resolution published by the anti-abortion rights SBA Pro-Life America.\n\n\n\nRepublican candidates are also directed to \u201cgo on offense in the 2024 election cycle\u201d by attacking Democrats and their \u201cextreme\u201d positions on abortion rights.\n\n\n\nRNC Committeewoman Tamara Scott, who sponsored the resolution, called attacking abortion rights a \u201ckey ingredient for GOP victory in 2024\u201d in a statement issued by SBA.\n\n\n\nThe resolution slammed Republicans\u2019 approach on abortion in the 2022 midterms\u2014in which many candidates backtracked on anti-abortion stances and even changed their websites to tone down their views\u2014criticizing candidates for not \u201cfighting back and exposing Democratic extremism on abortion.\u201d\n\n\nThe resolution was cheered by anti-abortion advocates, with SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser saying in a statement it sends a \u201cbold message\u201d to Republicans.\n\n\nThe RNC has not yet responded to a request for further comment on the resolution.\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Watch For\nSBA has previously identified Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Nebraska as the states they\u2019re targeting to pass further abortion restrictions and bans next, though an effort to pass a 15-week abortion ban in Virginia has already been thwarted by its majority-Democratic state legislature. Republicans in the House have already introduced and passed some abortion restrictions now that they have a narrow majority, but any anti-abortion rights bills are expected to fail in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and would be vetoed by President Joe Biden even if passed.\nBig Number\n60%. That\u2019s the share of Americans who believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a NPR/Ipsos poll conducted in January. The poll also found a 69% majority of respondents want abortion policy in their state to be decided by voters through ballot measures rather than state legislatures, with approximately half of both Democrats and Republicans reporting they disapprove of how their state\u2019s legislature has handled abortion over the past year.\n\nChief Critic\n\u201cIn 2022, voters resoundingly rejected anti-abortion politicians and made it clear that we do not want lawmakers controlling our bodies. Yet the RNC\u2019s response is to double down and make a national abortion ban a part of the party platform,\u201d Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said in a statement Monday. \u201cEvery candidate will be held accountable to this out-of-touch agenda.\u201d\nKey Background\nThe debate over abortion rights has ramped up in the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, as Republican-led states across the country have banned the procedure and debated new restrictions even as polling consistently shows a majority of Americans want it to remain legal. Six ballot measures in the midterm elections (including an August election in Kansas) came out in favor of abortion rights, and Americans\u2019 opposition to the court\u2019s ruling has been cited as a reason why Republicans failed to secure the \u201cred wave\u201d of GOP wins that had been anticipated. The RNC resolution is part of a broader effort by Republicans to continue to push abortion restrictions in the wake of the midterms anyway, however. House Republicans made multiple anti-abortion rights bills some of their first priorities after taking control of the chamber in January, and state lawmakers have introduced a slew of new bills restricting the procedure as legislatures have convened this month, particularly around restricting abortion pills.\nSurprising Fact\nAnti-abortion rights lawmakers have even suggested they may be willing to push restrictions in states where voters have signaled they support abortion rights through ballot measures. A bill introduced in Kansas tries to get around a court ruling protecting abortion rights statewide by allowing towns and counties to ban the procedure individually, even after 59% of the state\u2019s voters rejected its anti-abortion ballot measure in August.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nHouse Republicans Are Already Voting On Anti-Abortion Bills As GOP Eyes Even More Restrictions (Forbes)\nNew Kansas Effort To Ban Abortion\u2014Even After Voters Said They Want It Legal (Forbes)\nAbortion roiled the midterms.
