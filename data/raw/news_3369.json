One scene that precedes the second abortion sees Monroe talking to a CGI version of her unborn foetus, which asks her, \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me this time, will you?\u201dIn a statement published in The Hollywood Reporter by Caren Spruch, Planned Parenthood Federation of America\u2019s national director of arts and entertainment engagement, said:\u201cAs film and TV shapes many people\u2019s understanding of sexual and reproductive health, it\u2019s critical these depictions accurately portray women\u2019s real decisions and experiences. While abortion is safe, essential health care, anti-abortion zealots have long contributed to abortion stigma by using medically inaccurate descriptions of fetuses and pregnancy. Andrew Dominik\u2019s new film, Blonde, bolsters their message with a CGI-talking fetus, depicted to look like a fully formed baby.Planned Parenthood went on to say that it \u201crespects artistic license and freedom. However, false images only serve to reinforce misinformation and perpetuate stigma around sexual and reproductive health care. Every pregnancy outcome \u2014 especially abortion \u2014 should be portrayed sensitively, authentically and accurately in the media. We still have much work to do to ensure that everyone who has an abortion can see themselves onscreen. It is a shame that the creators of Blonde chose to contribute to anti-abortion propaganda and stigmatize people\u2019s health care decisions instead.\u201dAbortion scene from 'Blonde'NetflixAndrew Dominik respondsThe director has responded in the wake of this harsh criticism.Prior to the film\u2019s release, Dominik stated that there was something in Netflix\u2019s first NC-17 rated film \u201cto offend everyone\u201d. Now, in a recent interview with The Wrap, the director staded that he doesn't think the movie is anti-pro choice and dismissed the perceptions being made about the movie\u2019s abortion stance:\u201cI think the movie is pretty nuanced actually, and I think it\u2019s very complex, but that doesn\u2019t fit \u2014 people are obviously concerned with losses of freedoms, obviously they are. But, I mean, no one would have given a shit about that if I\u2019d made the movie in 2008, and probably no one\u2019s going to care about it in four years\u2019 time. And the movie won\u2019t have changed. It\u2019s just what sort of going on.\u201dAdditionally, Oates has defended the movie:\"I think it was/is a brilliant work of cinematic art obviously not for everyone. Surprising that in a post #MeToo era the stark exposure of sexual predation in Hollywood has been interpreted as 'exploitation.' Surely Andrew Dominik meant to tell Norma Jeane's story sincerely.\"In the wake of Roe V WadeReproductive rights and abortion are sensitive topics in the US, especially after the decision to overturn Roe v Wade by the Supreme Court only three months ago.The depiction of abortion in Blonde has reignited fears over the on-screen treatment of the right to choose. The film was always going to be divisive, as it features scenes showing physical and emotional abuse and offers a cruel catalogue of the traumas forced onto a woman. With the film industry wrestling with its depictions of abortion, viewing films like Blonde through the lens of Roe v Wade seems inevitable, and more and more films and series will be subjected to the same scrutiny, for better and for worse, with viewers finding it hard to distance themselves from recent world events. Criticism has also been levelled at fantasy series House of the Dragon, specifically a controversial birthing scene which some have defended a depicting a grim historical reality and others decrying a gratuitous, brutal and clich\u00e9d sensationalization of prolonged violence against women.Have you seen Blonde? Is it a potentially harmful film with an agenda, or are Planned Parenthood\u2019s comments unfair criticism to level at a film which doesn't have to be (or purpot to be) an activist tickbox due to its release date? Could nuanced dabate and stirring interesting conversations be enough, especially for a film\u00a0which actually calls out a harmful Hollywood system which frequently subjected its stars to the worst kind of treatments? And where does the line between representation and exploitation begin in films which audiences demand take a moral stance?Euronews Culture weighed in with our review of\u00a0Blonde.\u00a0Blonde is currently streaming on Netflix.Share this articleComments\n                You might also like\n            \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                          Culture news\n                        \n                                      \n                              \"Dress porn\": How Marilyn Monroe's iconic dresses were recreated\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                          world news\n                        \n                                      \n                              Hungarians march against stricter abortion rules \n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                          Culture news\n                        \n                                      \n                               Euronews Culture's Film of the Week: 'Blonde'\n                          \n                    Abortion \n                \n                    Cinema\n                \n                    Marilyn Monroe\n                \n                    film\n                \n                    Netflix \n                \n                    Abortion rights\n                ADVERTISEMENTTop stories\n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              These European festivities turn satire into a popular celebration\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              Gasp!
