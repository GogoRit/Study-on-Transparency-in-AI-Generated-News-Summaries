After that, they don\u2019t wanna know about you. They don\u2019t wanna hear from you. No nothing! No neonatal care, no daycare, no Head Start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you\u2019re pre-born, you\u2019re fine, if you\u2019re preschool, you\u2019re fucked.\u201dCarlin also said conservatives claim they\u2019ll do anything for the unborn. But once the child is born? This gif says it all:Carlin\u2019s performance is being passed around on social media after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicates that Roe v. Wade may soon be overturned, paving the way for abortion to be outlawed in parts of the nation.In the clip, Carlin says the pro-life movement isn\u2019t pro-life at all.\u201cThey\u2019re anti-woman, simple as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey believe a woman\u2019s primary role is to function as a broodmare for the state.\u201d(h/t digg)The legendary comic, who died in 2008 at the age of 71, is also the subject of an upcoming two-part documentary, \u201cGeorge Carlin\u2019s American Dream,\u201d which debuts on HBO Max later this month:This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.Recommended StoriesYahoo SportsNFL free agency good, bad and ugly: How has your favorite team done so far?Which teams should be most excited after a week of NFL free agency?1d agoYahoo SportsPass or Fail: Houston Texans show off new road uniforms after Reddit leakTexans CEO and Chairman Cal McNair took to Reddit to show off one of the team's new uniform combinations in response to a leak.17h agoYahoo FinanceThe CEO of Warren Buffett's favorite oil company thinks its stock is 'very undervalued'Occidental Petroleum's CEO said the company will focus on paying off debt for the next couple of years as it puts a pause on aggressive share buybacks.3h agoYahoo SportsMarch Madness: Ranking the NCAA men's tournament teams from 1 to 68UConn is the favorite, but there are at least eight others who are legit contenders to cut down the nets in April.2h agoYahoo SportsTimberwolves star Anthony Edwards throws down ridiculous dunk of the year over John Collins in win vs. JazzJohn Collins got put on a wild poster on Monday night, and had to leave the game due to a head injury.14h agoYahoo SportsBaker Mayfield gets called 'a 10 on the pr--- scale' by Bucs GM, then thanks him: 'I'll take that'Baker took it as a compliment, even though it didn't really sound like one.6d agoYahoo Sports2024 Fantasy Baseball: Jackson Holliday leads 5 key draft sleepers from the infieldDalton Del Don examines potential draft values with the upside to make a difference in fantasy baseball leagues.1d agoYahoo FinanceFed's inflation fight will affect housing supply for decades, says Redfin CEOThe housing market is showing signs of a recovery, but Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman warns higher rates will affect the housing sector for decades.2d agoYahoo SportsNearing a loaded 2024 NFL Draft, Justin Fields and the 2021 QB class remind us the position is a crapshootWhy Fields wasn\u2019t scooped by other teams largely centers on his one year of rookie contract control, which features a fifth-year option that will be set at $25.6 million.2d agoYahoo SportsAaron Rodgers says 'Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy' in wake of report he believed in conspiracy theoryRodgers' statement comes a day after a CNN story detailing comments Rodgers made about the shooting in 2013.5d agoYahoo SportsNL East season preview: What's in store for the Braves, Phillies, Mets, Marlins and Nationals in 2024?The Braves are aiming for a seventh straight division title.
