Wade\u2014and polling shows that Americans still broadly support abortion remaining legal and have concerns about the impact of the court\u2019s ruling, even as they remain less likely to support abortions later into a pregnancy.\nPro- and anti-abortion rights activists protest during the 50th annual March for Life rally in front ... [+] of the U.S. Supreme Court on January 20 in Washington, DC.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nBroad support for abortion rights: Gallup polls show 85% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in at least certain circumstances as of May, higher than when polling began in 1975 (76%), and 69% believe abortion should broadly be legal in the first three months of a pregnancy, marking a record high.\n\n\n\nSupport remains steady post-Dobbs: Americans\u2019 support for abortion being broadly legal has largely remained steady since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, with polling from Pew Research Center finding that it went up from 61% in March 2022 to 62% in July 2022, after the court\u2019s ruling, and remained at 62% into 2023.\n\n\n\nSteady support for Roe: Support for the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion precedent in Roe v. Wade was broadly popular before it was overturned, with a November 2021 Quinnipiac poll finding that 63% agreed with the court\u2019s ruling, and 72% of respondents in a January 2022 Marquette Law School poll and 69% of January 2022 CNN poll respondents opposed it being overturned.\n\n\n\nRoe\u2019s overturning unpopular: A Pew poll taken after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling in July found 57% disapproved of the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and a Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) poll taken throughout 2022 found 63% opposed Roe being overturned, including 43% who strongly opposed it.\n\n\nOne year on: The court\u2019s ruling has remained unpopular one year later, with a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in June finding 57% believe Roe\u2019s overturning was \u201cbad for the country\u201d because the \u201chealth and lives of women are more at risk\u201d (86% of those who said the ruling is bad agreed with that statement), a \u201cconstitutional right was taken away\u201d (81%) and \u201cstates are making abortion access harder\u201d (78%), with 50% of all respondents saying that abortion access has become even more restrictive than they expected.\n\n\nStill motivating Americans\u2019 votes: Abortion was widely viewed as a motivator for voters in the 2022 midterms, and that trend is continuing, with Gallup finding a record-high 28% of voters said in May that they\u2019ll \u201conly vote for candidates for major offices who share their position on abortion,\u201d and CBS/YouGov finding a 46% plurality are more likely to vote for a candidate who backs protecting abortion access, versus 36% who would rather vote for an anti-abortion rights politician.\n\n\nSlim support for abortion bans: A Gallup poll released in February found Americans\u2019 dissatisfaction with the country\u2019s abortion laws was at a record high of 69%, with 46% wanting laws to be less strict while only 15% think they should be stricter, and Pew polling from March and April found 62% of respondents are concerned states are making it \u201ctoo hard\u201d to get an abortion.\n\n\nFederal ban unpopular: CBS/YouGov found only 37% of respondents would favor a federal law that outlaws abortion nationwide (63% would oppose it), and a May poll from All in Together found only 39% of even Republican women would support a national ban, while 50% of women would support a federal law that instead legalized abortion.\n\n\nLegal access to abortion pills: As an ongoing court case has threatened access to the abortion medication mifepristone, a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in April and May found 66% believe mifepristone should remain on the market, and a 64% majority in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said they oppose laws that would outlaw medication abortion.\n\n\nEffects of Roe being overturned: A Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted between March and May found 20% of OBGYNs \u201chave personally felt constraints on their ability to provide care for miscarriages and other pregnancy-related medical emergencies\u201d since Roe was overturned, and 55% of women ages 18-49 said in May that they or someone they know have made decisions in the past year due to worries about abortion access\u2014such as using long-term birth control, stocking up on contraception, delaying getting pregnant or getting a vasectomy or their \u201ctubes tied\u201d\u2014with the CBS/YouGov poll finding that 53% think being pregnant is \u201cbecoming more dangerous\u201d as a result of the ruling.\n\n\nSupport for abortion exemptions: A Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES)/SurveyMonkey survey released in October found 91% support abortion when the woman\u2019s life is in danger and 86% support exceptions in the case of rape or incest.\n\n\nWhen abortion support drops: The further into the pregnancy, with a June Gallup poll finding that while 69% support abortion in the first trimester of a pregnancy, that drops to 37% in the second trimester and 22% in the third trimester.\n\n\nPartisan split\u2014but not in all cases: Democrats are statistically far more likely to support abortion rights than Republicans, with Pew finding that only 40% of Republicans support abortion being at least mostly legal versus 84% of Democrats\u2014though the PORES poll found 76% and 86% of Republicans support exceptions for rape and incest and when the mother\u2019s life is at risk, respectively.\n\n\nThe religious support abortion rights\u2014mostly: Pew\u2019s 2023 polling found that Americans with religious affiliations are far more likely to oppose abortion than the nonreligious (84% of whom believe abortion should be legal), though PRRI found that with the exception of white evangelical Protestants, Latter-day Saints, Hispanic Protestants and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a majority of every other religious group polled favor abortion rights.\n\n\nGender split\u2014not as big as you might think: Women are slightly more likely to support abortion than men, with Pew finding 64% of women want abortion to be legal versus 60% of men, and PRRI found LGBTQ Americans are the most supportive of abortion, with 83% backing abortion being legal as compared with 63% of cisgender heterosexual Americans.\n\n\nAsian and Black Americans most supportive: Pew\u2019s polling found majorities of every race support abortion being legal, though support was higher among Black (73% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases) and Asian (73%) respondents than those who are white and Hispanic (59% and 62%, respectively).\n\n\nSupport drops with age: The Pew poll found that while 62% of all age groups polled support abortion being legal in all or most cases, support declined with age, with 73% of 18 to 29-year-olds backing abortion rights versus 62% of respondents ages 30-49, 58% of those 50-64 and 56% of respondents 65 and older.\n\n\nSupport increases with more education: Pew found support for abortion also increased with how much education a person has received, with 56% of people with a high school degree or less supporting abortion being at least mostly legal versus 64% who attended some college, 66% with a four-year college degree and 69% with a postgraduate degree (PRRI and a Washington Post/ABC poll from 2021 found a similar correlation).\n\n\nParents less likely to support abortion rights: An All In Together poll, conducted in September 2021 with Lake Research and Emerson College Polling, found 36% of those with children in their house opposed a Texas ban on abortion versus 54.9% without kids, and the Post/ABC poll similarly found 58% of parents want the Supreme Court to uphold Roe v. Wade versus 62% of non-parents.\n\n\nMost States Support Abortion Being Legal\u2014Even Red Ones: The PRRI poll found majorities of residents in all but seven states support abortion being at least mostly legal\u2014with the exceptions being South Dakota (42% say it should be legal), Utah (42%), Arkansas (43%), Oklahoma (45%), Idaho (49%), Mississippi (49%) and Tennessee (49%)\u2014and there was no state where more than 14% of respondents said abortion should be illegal in all cases.\n\n\nSupport rises with income level: The Post/ABC poll found 59% of those earning less than $50,000 per year wanting the court to uphold the law versus 62% of those making between $50,000-$100,000 and 65% of those earning more than $100,000.\n\n\n\n\nSurprising Fact\nGallup found 52% of Americans now identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d and 44% as \u201cpro-life\u201d as of May, which is a change from the 49% who identified as pro-choice and 47% who said they\u2019re pro-life in May 2021\u2014though \u201cpro-choice\u201d identification is down from 55% in May 2022, when the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was leaked. The 2023 tally isn\u2019t far off from the 56% and 33% who said the same in 1995, respectively, when Gallup first started polling, though Americans\u2019 identification as \u201cpro-choice\u201d or \u201cpro-life\u201d has varied wildly in the nearly 30 years in between. Though at least a plurality of Americans have always supported abortion being legal in at least some circumstances in Gallup\u2019s polling, more respondents actually identified as \u201cpro-life\u201d than \u201cpro-choice\u201d in 2019, 2013, 2012, 2010 and 2009.\nTangent\nAmericans\u2019 support for abortion falls behind many other countries\u2014but not all\u2014with an Ipsos poll conducted in June and July 2022 finding 54% of Americans believe abortion should be permitted in at least some circumstances, versus a global average of 59%. Support for abortion is highest in Sweden (86% support), France (83%), Belgium and the Netherlands (both 78%), while the countries surveyed whose abortion views rank lower than the U.S. are Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, Japan, Brazil, China, South Africa, Colombia, India, Malaysia and Peru.\n\nKey Background\nAbortion first became legal nationwide with the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the federal right to an abortion. The court then affirmed that ruling in 2016, when it ruled in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt that states cannot enact abortion restrictions that impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the procedure. Republican state lawmakers repeatedly targeted abortion with an eye toward getting the Supreme Court to reconsider its precedent, resulting in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling striking down Roe v. Wade in June. Fifteen states now have abortion bans in place as a result, with others having enacted bans that have since been blocked in court.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nRoe V.
