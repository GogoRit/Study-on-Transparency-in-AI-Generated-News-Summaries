She\u2019s a board-certified OB-GYN and current faculty member at a Texas medical school.Last summer, she decided to stop seeing patients.Advertisement\u201cI can no longer provide the kind of counseling that I was trained to do,\u201d Levison said.AdvertisementLevison is a plaintiff in Zurawski vs. State of Texas, an ongoing lawsuit filed in March by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The plaintiff list now includes two medical professionals and thirteen women who say their health was put at risk when they were unable to receive care under the state\u2019s abortion bans.Breaking NewsGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy PolicyThe case aims to clarify the scope of the medical emergency under Texas bans. Vague exception language leaves doctors asking tough legal questions, Levison said, and patients facing barriers to care.\u2018You can\u2019t practice ethical medicine in that context\u2019Saturday marks a year since the U.S. Supreme Court voted to uphold the decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a case that centered on a Mississippi abortion ban.AdvertisementThe decision resulted in Roe vs. Wade being overturned, a landmark decision that protected the constitutional right to abortion for over five decades. Abortion legislation was then left up to individual states.Trigger laws \u2014 previously unenforceable heartbeat bills and restrictions on second and third trimester abortions \u2014 were enacted in  13 states. Other states passed legislation to protect a person\u2019s right to the procedure in all or most cases.Texas\u2019 abortion ban was put in place nearly a year before Roe was overturned.AdvertisementSenate Bill 8 went into effect in September 2021. It states that abortions cannot legally be performed in Texas beyond six weeks gestation, a window before some people find out they are pregnant, per Cleveland Clinic.AdvertisementUnder a subsequent trigger ban, it is a felony to perform an abortion unless the pregnant person is facing a \u201clife-threatening physical condition\u201d or \u201ca serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d Texas medical professionals who carry out the procedure can be faced with up to a $100,000 fine and life in prison. There are no stated exceptions for cases of incest, rape or fetal anomaly.Medication abortion, like mifepristone and misoprostol pills, are also illegal to dispense, but are approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.And, because any abortion-related criminal charges would be directed toward health care providers, many Texas doctors are hesitant to discuss abortion with their patients. Some fear  legal retribution.Advertisement\u201cYou can\u2019t practice ethical medicine in that context,\u201d Levison said.Carolyn Cline is the CEO of Woman to Woman Health Center, a pregnancy center in Dallas. She said the organization offers reproductive health services and information about abortion alternatives.Cline said she has seen confusion from women and their doctors in the last year, and her organization looks to \u201ceducate women about what the actual law says.\u201dHowever, Cline said there needs to be more clarity in the law about reproductive health so doctors and patients can be well-informed.Advertisement\u201cI think there needs to be clarity on exactly what the law says. We all need to understand it for the sake of the women, for the sake of those that are providing medical services as well,\u201d she said.Even if doctors do what they think is medically right, Levison asked, \u201cWhat is the risk?\u201d She said a court could decide that a health care provider made the wrong decision, that a patient\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t life-threatening.\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m speaking out is that my colleagues are younger than I am,\u201d she said. \u201cMany are in their 30s, have young families and are starting their career. One of the possible penalties after Dobbs is 99 years in prison. And you\u2019re going to put your family first.\u201dTrust needs to be given to the pregnant people and their physicians, Levison said.AdvertisementRelated:Texas women with risky pregnancies sue over how state\u2019s abortion ban forced them to flee\u2018Texas law doesn\u2019t have to do this\u2019Last August, Amanda Zurawski contacted her obstetrician about some strange pregnancy symptoms she was experiencing. Her doctor told her to come to the office for an exam.Zurawski was told by her medical provider that her cervix had dilated prematurely, and soon after, her membranes ruptured. Because her pregnancy was still so many weeks before viability, Zurawski was told that her baby would not survive.AdvertisementThere was little doctors could do to help Zurawski. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last April, she said that, while her health care providers knew she would lose her baby, they did not feel comfortable performing a medically-necessary abortion due to the language in Texas abortion laws.In order to receive the procedure, Zurawski\u2019s condition would have to deteriorate enough for the hospital\u2019s ethics board to consider it life threatening.She had to wait.Three days later, Zurawski was in the intensive care unit with sepsis, fighting to stay alive.AdvertisementShe is now the primary name on the Zurawski vs. State of Texas case, joined by women who experienced severe preventable infections, dangerous journeys to get an abortion out of state or the pain of carrying a baby with a fatal condition. Most cited emotional trauma as one of their reasons for joining the case.\u201cAs you read the stories, and as you begin to talk to patients \u2014 and they tell you what they were going through, how afraid they were, how afraid their doctors are \u2014 it\u2019s heartbreaking and it\u2019s infuriating,\u201d Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Counsel Marc Hearron said. \u201cNone of this had to happen, and what\u2019s happening right now is happening by design. Texas law doesn\u2019t have to do this.\u201dLast month, the Center for Reproductive Rights requested an injunction to block Texas abortion bans in the event of pregnancy complications.The state filed a plea to the jurisdiction on June 15, a document that could get the Zurawski case thrown out.AdvertisementA hearing on the motion will take place in July.Attorney General Ken Paxton and Texas Medical Board Executive Director Stephen Brint Carlton are named defendants in the case. The offices of Paxton and Brint Carlton did not respond to a request for comment.Paxton has previously said he will continue to defend \u201cthe pro-life laws of Texas and the lives of all unborn children.\u201dThe Texas Alliance for Life, a statewide anti-abortion organization, responded to the Zurawski case when it was filed in March via a public statement.AdvertisementThe organization said Texas law is \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d to allow doctors to treat pregnant people with life-threatening conditions without risk of criminal or civil liability.\u201cTexas Alliance for Life supports clarification of the medical emergency exception language within Texas\u2019 pro-life laws,\u201d the Alliance for Life said in the statement. \u201cThat clarification needs to come in the same way doctors are educated about other legislation affecting their practice in Texas.\u201dRelated:Are North Texas abortion clinics still open after overturn of Roe v. Wade?\u2018Too many mountains to climb\u2019With near total abortion bans, Hearron said reproductive care access is a key concern. He said low-resourced pregnant people are getting trapped in a health care crisis \u2014 and it\u2019s important not to lose sight of them.AdvertisementMany Texans faced with a situation where abortion is the medically-recommended option are unable to access care due to the high costs of out-of-state travel, transportation, child care, taking time off of work and the procedure itself.And, in the event of an immediate medical situation, the time it takes to travel by plane or car to another state is risky.These are the people that abortion bans are hitting the hardest, Hearron said.\u201cFor my patients who were primarily low-income, abortion really wasn\u2019t an option because they don\u2019t have the means to travel out of state or take time off from their jobs,\u201d Levison said. \u201cThey risk being fired. They would have to obtain child care. There were too many mountains to climb.\u201dAdvertisementAs of last summer, women\u2019s clinics and Planned Parenthood-affiliates can no longer provide abortions in the state. Many closed, others refocused their efforts to advocacy or other support. For many Texas residents, clinics were there only avenue to affordable reproductive health and abortion care.Marsha Jones is the co-founder and executive director of the Afiya Center, a North Texas-based organization that centers on reproductive justice. The organization primarily provides HIV education and health care access support to Black pregnant people.\u201cAt the end of the day, it all starts and ends with access,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been equitable access ever. And now, with the Dobbs decision and the overturning of Roe, that makes access even harder.\u201dAbortion bans have the greatest impact on people with the least access to resources, she said. And Black women additionally face a significant amount of stigma for their sexual and reproductive choices.Advertisement\u201cIt will just be more complicated even for a Black woman with resources to access an abortion in times like this than it will be for a white one without resources.\u201dFrom a future policy perspective, Jones hopes to see health care that reflects reproductive justice and expanded access. People\u2019s entire living experience includes their reproductive experience, she said.The Woman to Woman Health Center provides services for free, Cline said. She feels that her center provides people, regardless of their financial situation, with the services they need outside of abortion care.\u201cWe care greatly about women, and we want them to be well educated, we want them to be empowered and we want them to have good health care,\u201d she said.AdvertisementCline said her center doesn\u2019t believe abortion is in a woman\u2019s best interest or in the best interest of the baby she\u2019s carrying.Levison said  the state\u2019s limits on abortion access and the incongruity of what is considered a medical emergency puts pregnant people\u2019s lives at risk. Obstetric complications, she said, can happen to anyone.\u201cI wish that the general public would understand it,\u201d Levison said. \u201cThat abortion is a part of health care.\u201dAllie Kelly.
