Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh talks to the media during Big 10 football media days at Lucas Oil Stadium. \n\nRobert Goddin/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Michigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh has told ESPN that \u201cthe abortion issue is one that\u2019s so big that it needs to be talked about\u201d after saying he\u2019d raise an unwanted baby from a player or staff member of his. \n    \n\n            Harbaugh, a Catholic, and his wife Sarah spoke last week at the pro-life \u2018Plymouth Right to Life\u2019 event. He spoke about how his pro-life beliefs were instilled by his parents from a young age. \n    \n\n            \u201cI believe in having the courage to let the unborn be born,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI love life. I believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drive these beliefs in me. Quoting from Jeremiah: \u2018Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\u2019\u201d\n    \n\n            When asked about those comments in an interview with ESPN\u2019s Gene Wojciechowski over the weekend, Harbaugh said: \u201cFaith, family, football \u2026 those are my priorities. I just think that \u2026 the abortion issue is one that\u2019s so big that it needs to be talked about. It needs serious conversation. What do you think? What do I think? What do others think?\u201d\n    \n\n            He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a life-or-death type of issue. And I believe in, and I respect, people\u2019s views. But let\u2019s hear them. Let\u2019s discuss them because there\u2019s passion on both sides of this issue. So when you combine that with respect, that\u2019s when the best results come. \u2026 [I\u2019m] just contributing to that conversation and that communication, which I think is really important, in my opinion.\u201d\n    \n\n            Harbaugh\u2019s comments come after a huge uproar over the Supreme Court\u2019s momentous decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June which eliminates the nearly 50-year-old federal constitutional right to have an abortion in the US. \n    \n\n            On Tuesday, the Supreme Court officially transmitted its judgment, clearing the way for state restrictions to go into effect. A number of states \u2013 including Idaho, Tennessee and Texas \u2013 were waiting for this official word to come before enacting some of their laws to restrict abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank. \n    \n\n            More than half of the states in the US have laws that ban or severely restrict abortion rights, and some have so-called trigger laws that were meant to take effect automatically if Roe v. Wade were ever reversed. Since the court struck down Roe, legal fights are underway in several states with supporters of abortion rights seeing some success in temporarily blocking bans in at least five states, including Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan and Utah.\n    \n\n            The verdict has sparked widespread protests and demonstrations as abortion rights activists took to the streets to show their outrage at the decision. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarbaugh watches on during an intra-squad spring game.\n\nCarlos Osorio/AP\n\n\n\n            Harbaugh, a former NFL quarterback and NFL coach, has been outspoken about social justice issues over recent years, showing his vehement support for Colin Kaepernick as well as attending an anti-police brutality march in the week after George Floyd\u2019s murder. \n    \n\n            He said in the interview with ESPN that if any of his players or staff members are to have a baby that they are not prepared to care for, he and his wife would look after it. \n    \n\n            \u201cAny player on our team, any female staff member or any staff member or anybody in our family or our extended family \u2026 that doesn\u2019t feel like after they have a baby they can take care of it, we got a big house. We\u2019ll raise that baby.\u201d\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
