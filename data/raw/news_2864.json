Before the Connecticut House of Representatives passed a pro-abortion bill recently, young, Black Democrat Representative Trenee McGee spoke up in opposition and gave a fiery roast of Planned Parenthood in her statement. Let\u2019s discuss what she had to say and why it matters:\u00a0\u00a0\nOn Tuesday, April 19th, Democrat Rep. Trenee McGee, who serves the 116th District of Connecticut, spoke openly during a debate on House Bill 5414 against the abortion industry and its racist tendency to target and victimize the black community and their preborn children.\u00a0Watch her testimony below:\n\n\n\nRep. McGee stated, \u201cIn my journey and quest for racial justice when it comes to reproductive rights, it began in a classroom with black girls who knew about abortion when they were seven years old. They were taught in their classrooms\u2026about abortion as a birth control method. They were taught that at any point in time, when they were 13 or 12 or 15, they could go to a Planned Parenthood and receive an abortion without their parents knowing.\u201d\u00a0\nShe continued by contrasting how the abortion industry doesn\u2019t push itself on white women in nearly the same way by saying, \u201cThis differed when I traveled\u2026into the suburbs\u2026where there were young white girls who had access to all sorts of preventative methods, as well as even organizations that helped them to transition their births to their adoptive parents.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn order to further prove the racial bias of the abortion industry, Rep. McGee gave statistics on how abortion affects Black women, saying: \u201cThe majority of abortion clinics are located in the Black community\u2014social and economically depressed Black and brown communities\u2026I want to speak to the history of this industry and why I think its destructive to my community. Black women make up 14% of the child-bearing population yet obtained 36.2% of all reported abortions. Black women have the highest abortion ratio in the country\u2014474 abortions per 1,000 live births.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life of America (SFLA) has been similarly outspoken about the abortion industry\u2019s predatory practices on the Black community. SFLA President Kristan Hawkins recently co-wrote an op-ed with pro-life activist Patrina Mosley that was published at The Washington Times and entitled, \u201cAbortion is the Number One Killer of African Americans.\u201d\n\nIn the op-ed, the authors highlighted the same statistics that Rep. McGee pointed out and wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Planned Parenthood\u2019s founder Margaret Sanger was a feminist and eugenicist. Sanger, who allied herself with white feminist racists, demonstrated how specific targeting of birth-control methods would help to \u201cexterminate the Negro population.\u201d Abortion is the number one killer of African Americans, more lives than heart disease, cancer, violent crimes or accidents. \u202fCoincidence? Planned Parenthood and pro-abortionists would have you think so today.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIn fact, the abortion lobby actually pushes the nonsensical idea that it is the pro-life movement that is racist for saying that Black Preborn Lives Matter. In what universe does that logic make sense? It sure doesn\u2019t in ours because the pro-life movement is seeking to save the lives of all babies, regardless of their color, circumstances of conception, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe applaud Rep. McGee for publicly standing up for life and denouncing the abortion industry despite the fact that her beliefs are in the minority within her party. She serves as an excellent example of the diversity of the pro-life movement as our movement is not united by one party, one religion, one sex, or one race. Instead, we are all unified by one belief that life is sacred and should be protected\u2014from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death.\u00a0\u00a0\nHats off to you, Rep. McGee; keep breaking barriers and speaking up for life!\u00a0To read more about HB 5414, click HERE.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: What is Planned Parenthood\u2019s Missing Annual Report Hiding?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,379\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegehigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
