Despite the suggestions of the Mississippi Solicitor General and certain Supreme Court Justices during the\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health oral argument\u00a0this past December, controversies over abortion will not cease if\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0is overturned. Rather, they will be decided state by state. They will rage everywhere, including here.The positions of the pro-life and pro-choice proponents appear intractable. But if we take a closer look at the ends that each camp seeks, and also consider the evidence that exists on how best to obtain them, there are clear legal solutions that should satisfy all sides, including first steps the Minnesota Legislature can take this term.[image_caption]Laura Hermer[/image_caption]Pro-life supporters state that\u00a0every life is sacred\u00a0and should be\u00a0protected from conception. Pro-life advocates presumably want\u00a0viable pregnancies\u00a0to yield\u00a0babies who are loved\u00a0and given the best start possible. Pro-choice advocates do, too. What sense does it make to knowingly doom babies to a life of poverty and neglect in the absence of effective programs to support mothers and infants? \n \n\nAs all parents know, babies are utterly helpless and dependent on parents to love them and care for their every need. What happens when babies are unwanted? We know from\u00a0studies of unwanted infants\u00a0who were institutionally fed and housed\u00a0but otherwise neglected that such deprivation, \u201ccan have a profound and lasting psychological impact despite subsequent environmental enrichment in well resourced and supportive families.\u201d Children neglected in the home\u00a0are also more likely to suffer\u00a0lasting\u00a0negative psychosocial consequences, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and insecure relationships.There are\u00a0surprisingly few studies\u00a0examining the effects of unintended pregnancy on children and mothers. But we do know from the\u00a0Turnaway Study, which compares long-term outcomes in families with babies born to women who were denied an abortion versus those who were able to obtain one, that both poor maternal bonding and impoverishment were\u00a0significantly more common\u00a0in families where a desired abortion was denied than where an abortion was obtained and there was a subsequent pregnancy. Women denied abortions were\u00a0more likely to remain\u00a0in violent relationships than those who obtained a wanted abortion. They experienced\u00a0significantly more financial distress\u00a0than the group that obtained an abortion, were no more likely to live with a male partner, and were more likely to live alone with their child. Diminished economic status\u00a0also impacted older, existing children\u00a0of women who were unable to access a desired abortion.The only person who should be permitted to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the person who will bear primary responsibility to love, raise, and care for the resulting child. That is the pregnant person. No activist, religious institution, court, or state can make such a consequential decision for a competent adult.We can best ensure that babies have loving homes and do not suffer from undue emotional or economic deprivation by taking several important steps. We know that providing everyone with the\u00a0tools\u00a0they need to\u00a0plan\u00a0and\u00a0support\u00a0their pregnancies \u2013 including\u00a0abortions\u00a0where necessary \u2013 result in wanted children with healthier starts. We know that providing\u00a0hassle-free financial\u00a0support\u00a0to\u00a0low-income\u00a0families yield\u00a0better\u00a0outcomes\u00a0for children. We know that both children raised in thriving, low-violence communities and their parents do better than those in neighborhoods and homes\u00a0plagued by violence. We know that providing children with access to a high quality public education can yield\u00a0upward social mobility, and that working parents need\u00a0subsidized, high quality childcare\u00a0for their well-being and that of their\u00a0children. \n \n\nThe Minnesota Legislature can start by enacting SF 731/HF 259, the\u00a0Protect Reproductive Options Act, to put Minnesotans in control of their own reproductive futures. It should also expand the\u00a0Working Family Credit, increase child care assistance, and undertake significant police and public safety reforms to help reduce violence against our communities, among other measures. These steps will help support the flourishing of our communities and children, without imposing one way of life on everyone else. These are steps we should all support.Laura Hermer is a professor of Law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. \n\nWant to add your voice?\nIf you\u2019re interested in joining the discussion, consider writing a\u00a0Community Voices\u00a0commentary or counterpoint.

They are anti-abortion or, more accurately, anti-choice. They are \u201cpro\u201d nothing other than limiting the reproductive freedom of women.\nSecond, as we have seen across the country, the anti-choice forces have become increasingly absolutist. They are interested in nothing that could plausibly be called a \u201ccompromise.\u201d\nThird, while the proposal reaches a good result \u2013 leave the decision to the woman who is pregnant \u2013 framing it as the decision of the person responsible for loving and caring for the child could lead to unintended consequences. Is that going to be a legal standard? If so, could someone who expresses an interest in adopting an unborn child get a court order preventing an abortion? If they could, would that be a legal commitment on their part?\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nPat Berg since 2011 says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/23/2022 at 11:35 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to how absolutist the anti-choice forces are, consider this excerpt from a HuffPost article on Oklahoma\u2019s proposed bill to ban abortions after 30 days:\n\u201cTreat said he \u2018really wished to limit it down to \u2026 the moment of conception\u2019 but that this is what the bill-drafting staff came up with.\u201d\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/oklahoma-abortion-ban-30-days_n_62154241e4b06e1cc5868284\nTheir interest in compromise is exactly equal to zero.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Terry says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/23/2022 at 10:21 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nGood luck with that.  \nOnce again, thanks to Ruth Bader Ginsberg for putting her own ego ahead of womens\u2019 health.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nRichard Owens says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/23/2022 at 12:21 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPlease explain.

And I sure wish that she had taken her age and medical history into account, because those who wanted her to retire turned out to be exactly right.  \nThe problem isn\u2019t that the court is 6-3, because Roberts votes with the liberals on the worst stuff.   No, the worst cases are 5-4, and that 5th vote is Ginsberg\u2019s Trump-appointed replacement.  When Roe v Wade goes, that is Ginsberg\u2019s fault.  Every case that goes 5-4 the wrong way can be blamed on Ginsberg\u2019s massive ego.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nFrank Phelan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/24/2022 at 05:52 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo tell me who the president could have nominated this spring that you would rather see on the court than me?\u201d\nIt takes a massive ego to think that. But it takes an ego levels larger to verbalize that in a media interview. And yet, that is exactly what Ginsburg said about herself. Love her and her legacy if you like, but there is no denying that that was a massive ego.

In fact, I\u2019d go just a bit further and suggest that most of the objections to abortion\u00a0\u2013 whether from males or females \u2013\u00a0are religious ones. Since the Constitution is quite clear that there can be no established religion in the U.S., a good argument can be made that imposing birth on a pregnant woman who doesn\u2019t want the child is imposing a particular religious view on both her and the society, and is therefore unconstitutional. \nI don\u2019t see the present SCOTUS coming close to endorsing that view, at least in my lifetime, so, lacking that, I\u2019m with RB.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nMary Linstroth says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/23/2022 at 03:26 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThank you, Laura Hermer for covering \u201cthe whole picture\u201d of raising a child.

Unless and until all women are afforded free and complete healthcare their entire lives, it is women who are responsible for the care and well-being of the vessel in which babies are incubated, and the care and well-being of the zygotes, embryos, and fetuses during that incubation. Until society supports and funds the entire well-being of women rather than leaving that burden on the women themselves, no one but the woman whose body hosts hosts a zygote, embryo, or fetus should have any say over whether she continues to do so.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Straka says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/23/2022 at 03:28 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThe conclusion that the pregnant person is the only one who can decide whether a pregnancy should continue or not is correct. But to say that \u201cThe only person who should be permitted to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the person who will bear primary responsibility to love, raise, and care for the resulting child.\u201d does not imply that that person is the pregnant woman. The implication is that if a loving caregiver can be found for the child, then the woman can be forced to carry the pregnancy to term. A dangerous idea which only plays into the hands of the antiabortion movement.\n\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\nRachel Kahler says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02/24/2022 at 04:45 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAgreed.

Jackson Women\u2019s Health </em>oral argument</a>\u00a0this past December, controversies over abortion will not cease if\u00a0<em>Roe v. Wade</em>\u00a0is overturned. Rather, they will be decided state by state. They will rage everywhere, including here.</p>\n<p>The positions of the pro-life and pro-choice proponents appear intractable. But if we take a closer look at the ends that each camp seeks, and also consider the evidence that exists on how best to obtain them, there are clear legal solutions that should satisfy all sides, including first steps the Minnesota Legislature can take this term.</p>\n<p>Pro-life supporters state that\u00a0<a href=\"https://concernedwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CWA-Brochure-Biblical-Support-for-Core-Issues.pdf\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://concernedwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CWA-Brochure-Biblical-Support-for-Core-Issues.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1645220060466000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2KDVS-FuvhJBYNhYDFm8iO\">every life is sacred</a>\u00a0and should be\u00a0<a href=\"https://aul.org/mission/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aul.org/mission/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1645220060466000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ycsqY1V6IrZUIP5V0QYmq\">protected from conception</a>. Pro-life advocates presumably want\u00a0viable pregnancies\u00a0to yield\u00a0babies who are loved\u00a0and given the best start possible. Pro-choice advocates do, too. What sense does it make to knowingly doom babies to a life of poverty and neglect in the absence of effective programs to support mothers and infants?</p>\n<p>As all parents know, babies are utterly helpless and dependent on parents to love them and care for their every need. What happens when babies are unwanted?

But we do know from the\u00a0Turnaway Study, which compares long-term outcomes in families with babies born to women who were denied an abortion versus those who were able to obtain one, that both poor maternal bonding and impoverishment were\u00a0significantly more common\u00a0in families where a desired abortion was denied than where an abortion was obtained and there was a subsequent pregnancy. Women denied abortions were\u00a0more likely to remain\u00a0in violent relationships than those who obtained a wanted abortion. They experienced\u00a0significantly more financial distress\u00a0than the group that obtained an abortion, were no more likely to live with a male partner, and were more likely to live alone with their child. Diminished economic status\u00a0also impacted older, existing children\u00a0of women who were unable to access a desired abortion.</p>\n<p>The only person who should be permitted to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the person who will bear primary responsibility to love, raise, and care for the resulting child. That is the pregnant person. No activist, religious institution, court, or state can make such a consequential decision for a competent adult.</p>\n<p>We can best ensure that babies have loving homes and do not suffer from undue emotional or economic deprivation by taking several important steps. We know that providing everyone with the\u00a0tools\u00a0they need to\u00a0plan\u00a0and\u00a0support\u00a0their pregnancies \u2013 including\u00a0abortions\u00a0where necessary \u2013 result in wanted children with healthier starts. We know that providing\u00a0hassle-free financial\u00a0support\u00a0to\u00a0low-income\u00a0families yield\u00a0better\u00a0outcomes\u00a0for children. We know that both children raised in thriving, low-violence communities and their parents do better than those in neighborhoods and homes\u00a0plagued by violence. We know that providing children with access to a high quality public education can yield\u00a0upward social mobility, and that working parents need\u00a0subsidized, high quality childcare\u00a0for their well-being and that of their\u00a0children.</p>\n<p>The Minnesota Legislature can start by enacting SF 731/HF 259, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF259&amp;type=bill&amp;version=0&amp;session=ls92&amp;session_year=2021&amp;session_number=0\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number%3DHF259%26type%3Dbill%26version%3D0%26session%3Dls92%26session_year%3D2021%26session_number%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1645220060467000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yXorXpXVglaSXnBBt03dh\">Protect Reproductive Options Act</a>, to put Minnesotans in control of their own reproductive futures. It should also expand the\u00a0Working Family Credit, increase child care assistance, and undertake significant police and public safety reforms to help reduce violence against our communities, among other measures. These steps will help support the flourishing of our communities and children, without imposing one way of life on everyone else. These are steps we should all support.</p>\n<p><em>Laura Hermer is a professor of Law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.</em></p>\n\n\n This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2022/02/a-pro-child-solution-to-the-abortion-debate/\">article</a> first appeared on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.minnpost.com\">MinnPost</a> and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/favicon.png?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:1em;height:1em;margin-left:10px;\"><img id=\"republication-tracker-tool-source\" src=\"https://www.minnpost.com/?republication-pixel=true&post=2082057&amp;ga4=3376753669\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\">\n Copy to Clipboard\n1\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMinnPost Recommends\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProposed changes to Minnesota\u2019s cannabis law have one eye on the future market and one eye on the courts \n\nby Peter Callaghan \n03/14/202403/14/2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMnDOT poised to reduce or remove \u2018original sin\u2019 Minneapolis freeway: Olson Memorial Highway \n\nby Bill Lindeke \n03/11/202403/11/2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNew report details how \u2018land grabs\u2019 from tribes have enriched the University of Minnesota \n\nby Ana Radelat \n02/14/202402/14/2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn thin ice: Local budgets take a hit during busy search-and-rescue season \n\nby Ava Kian \n03/01/202403/01/2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSmudging in schools bill provides mental health benefits, according to supporters \n\nby Deanna Pistono \n03/07/202403/07/2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to our major sponsors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis a 501(c)(3) nonprofit newsroom\n\nAbout Us\nCareers\nAdvertise\nMembership\nHelp\nContact\nSubmit a Tip\nCode of Ethics\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nRSS Feed\n\nP.O.
