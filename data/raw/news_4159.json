A work of historical fiction, the novel is set in the interbellum rural South. Building a town on the ruined plantation of Marse Charles, the black inhabitants are his former slaves. Since the culmination of the Civil War they live in freedom, rarely interacting with white society. They struggle to survive, especially as an incurable disease ravages the town\u2019s children.\n\nThe narrative focuses on Rue, a midwife and healer, who learned her skills from her mother, Miss May Belle. Their ability to heal is so powerful that their skills are often misidentified as magic. Indeed, Miss May Belle shows a proclivity for the supernatural and crafting curses.\n\n\nRue\u2019s talents, in contrast, result from an affinity with naturalism and herbalism. When a baby is born in a caul and with black eyes, the townspeople accuse Rue of witchcraft. The accusations are both exasperated and alleviated by the arrival of Bruh Abel, an itinerant preacher.\n\n\nFrom the start, Conjure Women adroitly unpacks the nuances of interbellum society, the influence of spirituality, and the power of superstition. Yet it is Atakora\u2019s reiteration of the current calls for racial justice that positions Conjure Women as an unadulterated masterpiece.\n\n\nSmoke by werner22brigitte (Pixabay License / Pixabay)\n\nTo draw parallels between the past and present, Conjure Women rejects time as linear. This is explicitly communicated as the narrative shifts between \u201cSlavery time\u201d, capturing the antebellum era, and \u201cFreedom time\u201d, centralizing the interbellum. The Civil War does not represent a singular stage for pre- and post-war society. Rather, Atakora uses the Civil War to exhibit time\u2019s fluidity between a historical and contemporary moment.\nFor example, when characters consider the encroaching Civil War, they frame the northerners as motivated by blood, focused on dissolving southern culture in order to enforce desolation rather than emancipation. The threat of cultural loss is akin to the present-day refusal to abandon symbols of racism such as the confederate flag, statues of slave owners, and military generals. Certainly, the Civil War era saw the United States as a divided nation. Through Atakora\u2019s lens, said division remains and is as evident as ever.\nSimilarly, the discourses constructing women\u2019s control of their bodies and sexualities are another accurate reflection of modern discourses. As healers, Miss May Belle and Rue both assist women, black and white, in conception, abortion, and sexual health. The mother and daughter provide medical treatments to enable women to take control of their reproductive systems, especially after surviving sexual violence. Their ability to heal and control is not magic, it is agency.\nAs women\u2019s bodies are held in dominion by white ownership, Miss May Belle and Rue are conductors of power. Without question, abortion has always existed despite its deregulation and illegality. Conjure Women demonstrates the prevalence of these services and the resulting urgency for women\u2019s corporeal control across time and space.\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement and subsequent uprisings have exposed the ubiquity of police brutality, it is impossible to ignore the lastingness of using violence to control black bodies. Conjure Women\u2019s depiction of slavery\u2019s atrocities is painfully authentic. More so, Atakora intentionally emphasizes the daily acts of violence to reveal the fullest extent of the abuse.\nFor Atakora, there are two primary branches of corporeal violence: the first is sexual. Miss May Belle and Rue are constantly curing women of venereal disease or supporting them as they recover from rape \u2014 both instances delivered by their white master. But they also create the tinctures that act as birth control, allowing women to decide when and if they become pregnant.\nYet the ability to take control of their bodies was furtive. More frequently, the commodification of women\u2019s reproduction, specifically the belief that slaves were akin to livestock, prevailed. Marse Charles deliberately purchased slaves whose reproductive capacity would increase his finances. Slave owners enforced reproduction as an economy, and in doing so severed families while positioning a person as nothing more than capital.\nHere Atakora extends Marx\u2019s theory suggesting the reproduction of goods enabled society to re-create itself. Instead, Conjure Women is more deliberate in its statement that the economics of women\u2019s reproduction effectively re-creates racism. Readers will easily transfer Conjure Women\u2018s focus on the commodification of birth into the present and see how the trajectory disproportionately affects women of color.\nThe novel\u2019s second branch of systematic violence is experienced by the male characters. When Jonah first arrives at the plantation as a slave, his youth, vitality, and of course, blackness, presents an imaginary threat to Marse Charles. To cull the unease, he ties Jonah down and smears bacon grease over his body. The smell of the lard lures in wild pigs who eat Jonah\u2019s genitals and lower body. It was not Marse Charles\u2019 intent to kill but to render Jonah sexless.\nLikewise, Rue\u2019s father is lynched after he is falsely accused of impregnating Varina, Marse Charles\u2019 daughter. Much as the murder of Eric Garner and George Floyd, in addition to the countless black citizens murdered in cold-blood, Jonah and Rue\u2019s father were killed by a bogus threat founded on systematic racism. The line drawn from Conjure Women to today displays the violence as mostly unchanged other than the mechanics of the killings.\nHere Atakora poses a vital question: is lynching the same as the asphyxia related deaths of Garner and Floyd, and by extension, the seemingly endless shootings? When considering the history of violence endured by African Americans, the answer is an unequivocal yes: Eric Garner\u2019s and George Floyd\u2019s murders are a modern form of lynching.\nConjure Women testifies to the oppressive control prevalent in the past while drawing stunning parallels to the here and now. That injustice is currently facing a struggle and perhaps society has reached its turning point. However, Atakora makes it clear that unless oppression is dismantled now, it will remain in control through the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRATING  9 / 10\n\n\n\nTAGS  afia atakora black lives matter books feature conjure women historical fiction penguin-random house racism reproductive rights slavery \n\nRESOURCES AROUND THE WEB\n\n\nAfia Atakora | Penguin Random House\n\n\nAfia Atakora (@AfiaAtakora) | Twitter\n\n\nAfia Atakora reads from her novel CONJURE WOMEN! - YouTube\n\n\nConjure Women by Afia Atakora | Penguin Random House Canada\n\n\nConjure Women (Barnes & Noble Book Club Edition) by Afia ...\n\n\nConjure Women by Afia Atakora: 9780525511489 ...\n\n\nA Conversation with Afia Atakora, Author of Conjure Women ...\n\n\nConjure Women: A Novel (9780525511489): Atakora, Afia\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\nUnorthodox StorytellingThe 10 Best Hip-Hop Tracks of 1991\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFeatured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Featured: Top of Home Page/Features/Film/Film Feature/Interviews \n\nHappiness in Kurdistan: An Interview with \u2018Transient Happiness\u2019 Director Sina Muhammed\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrady Trainor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n19 March 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Books/Culture/Economics/Featured: Top of Home Page/Features/Reviews \n\nDisillusion and the Glimmer of Hope for American Suburbs\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Pike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n19 March 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Featured: Top of Home Page/Features/Lists/Music/Music Features/Sound Affects \n\nThe 10 Best Oasis Songs From the B-Sides\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrice Ezell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n19 March 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Featured: Top of Home Page/Features/Film/Film Feature/History/Music/Music Features \n\nCymande Are Possibly the Most Sampled British Musical Artists of All Time\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Pike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n18 March 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Featured: Top of Home Page/Features/Lists/Music/Music Features/SAVE/ IGNORE: popular/Sound Affects \n\nThe 10 Best John Coltrane Solos\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob Adams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n18 March 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPublish with PopMatters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Announcements/Books \n\nPopMatters Seeks Book Critics and Essayists\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Zarker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n24 January 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All Things Reconsidered/Announcements/Featured: Top of Home Page/Film \n\nCall for Papers: All Things Reconsidered \u2013 FILM Winter 2023-24\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Zarker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n10 January 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All Things Reconsidered/Announcements/Featured: Top of Home Page/Music \n\nCall for Papers: All Things Reconsidered \u2013 MUSIC Winter 2023-24\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Zupko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n9 January 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Announcements \n\nSubmit an Essay, Review, Interview, or List to PopMatters\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopMatters Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n26 July 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Announcements/Music/Music Reviews \n\nPopMatters Seeks Music Writers\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopMatters Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n28 September 2022 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \nPublish with PopMatters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Announcements/Books \n\nPopMatters Seeks Book Critics and Essayists\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Zarker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n24 January 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All Things Reconsidered/Announcements/Featured: Top of Home Page/Film \n\nCall for Papers: All Things Reconsidered \u2013 FILM Winter 2023-24\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Zarker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n10 January 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All Things Reconsidered/Announcements/Featured: Top of Home Page/Music \n\nCall for Papers: All Things Reconsidered \u2013 MUSIC Winter 2023-24\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Zupko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n9 January 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Announcements \n\nSubmit an Essay, Review, Interview, or List to PopMatters\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopMatters Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n26 July 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Announcements/Music/Music Reviews \n\nPopMatters Seeks Music Writers\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopMatters Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n28 September 2022 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboutMasthead\nSubmission Guidelines\nMission\n \n\n\n\nBizAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\nFollow UsFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nSpotify\n \n\n\n\nCategoriesMusic\nFilm\nTelevision\nBooks\nCulture\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1999-2021 PopMatters Media, Inc.
