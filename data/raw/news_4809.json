Wade decision.\nMonday\u2019s decision marked the second time that the court has ruled against an admitting privileges requirement, following a 2016 ruling that struck down a similar law in Texas.\nWhile supporters of reproductive rights claimed a victory, they cautioned that as many as 16 other abortion-related cases around the country have the potential to be heard by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that abortion clinics have been given a special carve out shielding them from the responsibility for providing a standard of care that a woman deserves under any circumstance\u2026\"https://t.co/EF5S9j0Z99\n\u2014 CWA LAC (@CWforA) June 29, 2020\n\n\u201cWhat we saw today was really a reaffirmation and a rehashing of the 2016 Texas case, and it came down to the same conclusion,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, interim associate director of state policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and policy organization.\nNow, she added: \u201cEveryone goes back to the drawing table and reevaluates their strategy.\n\u201cThose who support abortion rights are looking into this case to see how they can roll back abortion restrictions, and abortion opponents are looking to see how they can shift their own strategy,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAt the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, Executive Director Eric Scheidler said abortion opponents were disappointed with the Supreme Court, even as its two newest members were appointed by Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nBreathe easier today. \nContinue the work tomorrow to make sure abortion remains safe and legal.https://t.co/NjrXXWcQDN\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 29, 2020\n\nTrump promised during his 2016 campaign to appoint justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion.\nThe court needs at least one, if not two, more such judges to be appointed, Scheidler said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing that the Supreme Court is set to overturn Roe v. Wade any day now. I\u2019ve always been sceptical of that claim,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be passing out fliers, reaching out at abortion facilities, talking to our politicians.\u201d\nA wave of anti-abortion rights measures has been passed by Republican-led state legislatures in an effort to prompt the court to overturn its landmark ruling, especially since Trump\u2019s election in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInside Story Americas \u2013 US abortion battles (24:52)\n\n\n\n\u201cStates were jockeying for position around whose case would be the first to make it to the Supreme Court,\u201d Nash said.\nAndrea Miller, head of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, a pro-abortion rights group, expressed relief that people in Louisiana would continue to have access to abortion.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no telling what will happen next time an abortion case comes before the court,\u201d she said in a statement.\nSource: Reutersaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
