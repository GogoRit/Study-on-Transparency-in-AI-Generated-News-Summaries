CACR 18 would enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution. That had 1,416 sign up in support of the bill and 134 opposed. HB 1674 would establish abortion protection rights before 24 weeks in state law. There were 1,493 who signed up to support that measure and 136 opposing it.\nThe bills come as the United States Supreme Court is expected to weigh in this spring on several suits related to reproductive freedom.\nDr. Maris Toland an obstetrician in Lebanon said New Hampshire\u2019s current abortion ban sends a message of mistrust and derision to doctors, who are in short supply in this state and are burned out, she said.\n\u201cYou invalidate our training and our expertise,\u201d she said, with this law, she said which would make punishable by seven years in prison performing an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nShe said she has options on where to practice medicine, and so do others and that is what might be of concern to the future of women\u2019s health in the state. For women who need care, they need to be able to make decisions with their physicians and the new law takes options away, Toland said.\nThe new law also requires women to get an ultrasound prior to an abortion and does not make any exceptions in the late-term abortions for rape, incest, and in the case of fatal anomalies where the fetus cannot survive outside of the womb.\nLast week, the Senate passed a bill to remove the ultrasound provision from the law but Republicans rejected efforts to add exceptions, remove the criminal penalties for providers, or repeal the law altogether.\nGovernor Sununu has said he would support revisions to the new law including those related to the ultrasound requirements and criminalizing medical procedures. But he has maintained that limiting abortions to the first 24 weeks is not radical and supported by many and that other states have \u201csimilar\u201d laws.\nOpponents have said New Hampshire\u2019s law is far more restrictive than in most other states.\nShannon McGinley of Bedford, speaking on her own behalf and not as the executive director of Cornerstone Action, said while pregnant at 18 weeks she found by ultrasound that her son had a congenital fetal anomaly, while not fatal.\nShe and her husband were urged to consider abortion and upon a second opinion, she took the pregnancy to term and found there was nothing wrong with the baby.\nSeveral other individuals had similar stories.\nSandra Rogazio opposed the bill and read Deborah Bishop\u2019s testimony.\nBishop wrote that when she was 22, she agreed to abortion then canceled the appointment and decided on adoption. She gave the baby girl to a couple who could not conceive.\nBishop wrote she had another pregnancy which was considered unviable and rejected the recommendation to terminate, and the boy was born perfectly healthy. While in college and bicycling home to surprise her on mother\u2019s day, he died in a tragic bicycle accident. She noted she was comforted at that loss by her daughter whom she had given away.\n\u201cShe has helped me to mend my broken heart,\u201d Bishop\u2019s testimony read.\nWhile there was a lot of emotional testimony, former State Senator Matthew Hood, now vice president of government relations for Dartmouth Hitchock medical center said the law has practical implications to health care, in addition to forcing women to seek care out of state or attempt to convince a medical provider to break the law\nHe said Dr. Ilana Cass would be much more eloquent on the topic because she works to try to recruit ob/GYN providers to New Hampshire.\nHe read from her letter to the committee that the fetal health protection act imperils the lives of women \u201cwhom we are fully capable of providing for\u201d and the law would have a systemic effect of steadily eroding access \u201cby deterring physicians from practicing in the state.\u201d\nAttorney Ian Huyett, general counsel and director of policy for Cornerstone Action of New Hampshire spoke in opposition to the repeal bill.\nUpon questioning, he said Cornerstone did participate in the drafting of the current law last spring.\nAsked if there was a public hearing on that, which became part of the budget bill, Huyett said there was testimony on another bill and all the material aspects of the law went through a full democratic hearing process.\nKayla Montgomery, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and Planned Parenthood Action Fund said she supported the full repeal of the recently enacted and \u201ccruel, arbitrary\u201d law and said she believes that patients, not politicians should decide on issues of abortion with their physicians.\n\u201cThere is no playbook when it comes to pregnancy and pregnancy loss,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cWe have some of the best doctors in the world, yet the state is now sending people out of state if they can afford it,\u201d to have an abortion after 24 weeks.\nJason Hennessey, speaking as president of New Hampshire Right to Life, opposed the bill.\nHe asked two central questions related to the bill: \u201cwho is a person and what rights to people deserve?\u201d\nHennessey said the bill erasing the new law would \u201cmove New Hampshire backward allowing babies to be killed for any reason up to the last moment of the pregnancy.\u201d\nHe said there is broad consensus around the country about opposition to late-term abortions.\nHe asked who was the most vulnerable?\n\u201cThe child deserves society\u2019s protections,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not just about the rights of the mother. There is another person there.\nThough not a physician, he said it would make better health sense for the mother \u201cto deliver her dead baby\u201d than undergo an abortion.\nDevan Quinn, director of policy for the NH Women\u2019s Foundation, said the new law creates \u201cinequitable barriers\u201d and is particularly unfair for low-income women, survivors of domestic violence, and those without access to transportation. She said the ultrasound mandate which the law requires prior to abortion contributes to an effort to shame women, she said.\nSarah Marcoux and her daughter Samantha Marcoux, 17, of Northfield both came to oppose the bill, one being almost aborted by the other after an inaccurate diagnosis.\nSamantha said \u201cknowing I could have been aborted by a wrong diagnosis made it amazing,\u201d she said that she was able to stand and oppose the bill.\nThe Committee will hold an executive session on all these bills, as well as three efforts to further restrict abortion access, on February 18.\n\n\nNewsletter\n\nJoin thousands already receiving our daily newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterests \nThe Telegraph Daily Newsletter\nSales and Events\nObituaries\n\n\n\nAre you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?  *\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater Nashua \n\n\n\nEaster Bunny to arrive at Aviation Museum by student-built airplane\n\n\n\n\nAviation Museum of NH to host lecture on airlift rescue effort for New England sea turtles\n\n\n\n\nUNH Macfarlane Research Greenhouses Open House slated for April 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNewsletter\n\nJoin thousands already receiving our daily newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterests \nThe Telegraph Daily Newsletter\nSales and Events\nObituaries\n\n\n\nAre you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?  *\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nSubmit News\nTerms of Service\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\n Copyright \u00a9 The Nashua Telegraph | https://www.nashuatelegraph.com | 110 Main St, Ste 1, Nashua, NH 03060 | 603-882-2741 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
