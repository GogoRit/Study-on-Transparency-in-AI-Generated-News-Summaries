Women and girls in Burkina Faso are being discriminated against by a system that won\u2019t let them make decisions about their education, healthcare and contraception.\nWe\u2019re campaigning for the authorities in Burkina Faso to make sure women and girls\u2019 rights are protected in the law and in practice, so that women are able to make choices about their own bodies and ultimately have more of a say in their own lives.\n\n\tThings are starting to change\nWhile life remains difficult and unequal for women in Burkina Faso, there are signs that change is on the way.\nIn February, the government announced its commitment to eradicating early and forced marriage in the country \u2013 an abusive practice where girls are married either before they\u2019re 16, or made to marry against their will.\nBurkina Faso\u2019s Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Civic Promotion put out a statement saying that it plans to raise the legal age of marriage for girls to 18. The ministry also plans to ensure that forced marriage is clearly outlawed in Burkina Faso\u2019s criminal code.\nHuge thanks to the 19,454 people in the UK who signed our petition calling on the country\u2019s president, Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9, to make sure the rights of women and girls are protected by law, and work to do away with current injustices.\n\nBut it\u2019s still bad news for girls\n\n\tDenied contraception\nWhen H\u00e9l\u00e9ne heard about contraception, she wanted to use it, but her husband wouldn\u2019t let her.\n\u2018My husband didn\u2019t agree, so I couldn\u2019t. Anyway, I didn\u2019t have the money. How was I going to get the money?\u2019\nH\u00e9l\u00e9ne is now a 25-year-old mother of four children\n\nShe managed to access some through a healthcare clinic, but her husband wouldn\u2019t give her the money to renew her contraceptive injection, so she fell pregnant again.\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult to raise the subject [of contraception] with him. He is automatically against it. When the husband speaks, we have to put up with everything\u2026 Without money, there was nothing I could do and the last child, which I did not want, was born.\u2019\nH\u00e9l\u00e9ne\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e9ne\u2019s situation is all-too-common in Burkina Faso, where women are too often unable to make decisions about their body and sexual and reproductive lives. This includes access to information and contraception, the right to decide who to marry and how many children they will have - or whether they have them at all.\n\n\tForced to marry as a girl\n\u2018When I was 12, my father married me off to a 25-yearold man. I refused to go to his house. My parents beat me, but I refused to leave the family home.\u2019\nRose, aged 46. Her resistance won out and she is now married to the man she loves.\n\nDespite being illegal, forced marriage remains commonplace. Most women are married by the age of 19.\n\n\tEducation cut short\nOnly 64% of girls in Burkina Faso are able to go to school, and many have to leave to get married or take on domestic work.\nEven the most basic information of sexual and reproductive health is inaccessible to most girls. Mariama, now a 25-year-old mother of three children, did not know that she could get pregnant from having sex, for example.\n\n\tDenying healthcare is deadly\nThe country has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality \u2013 when a woman dies as a result of her pregnancy \u2013 in the world. One in every 22 women will die simply from getting pregnant. With education and healthcare programmes in place, these deaths could be dramatically reduced.\n\u2018Sometimes I have to get into debt just to renew my contraception.\u2019\nSofia, aged 40, sells doughnuts to make a living\n\nBurkina Faso has one of the lowest rates of contraceptive use, with just 17% of women and girls taking measures to make decisions about their own bodies and lives. Contraceptives may not be something a girl knows about, and if they are available they can be prohibitively expensive \u2013 emergency contraception can cost one-fifth of a woman\u2019s monthly income if she earns the minimum wage. A woman who has been raped must still pay for her own emergency medical care \u2013 not an option for many women in this situation.\n\n\tWhat we're calling for\nWe're asking the President of Burkina Faso to:\n\n\n\t\tImprove access to sexual and reproductive health services and information for women and girls\n\n\t\tMake contraception free\n\n\t\tEnsure that women and girls have the right to decide whether to have children, and how many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          18 May 2020, 05:54pm\n        \n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While you\u2019re here\u2026\nLike you, we are horrified by the violence and the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We\u2019re calling for an immediate ceasefire by all parties in the occupied Gaza Strip and Israel to prevent further loss of civilian lives.
