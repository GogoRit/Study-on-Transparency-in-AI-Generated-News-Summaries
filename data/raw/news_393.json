On Tuesday afternoon, Poland\u2019s National Women\u2019s Strike, an NGO fighting for women\u2019s rights,\u00a0demanded via Facebook\u00a0that women in Poland should be able to access their full rights to abortion, called for the government to step down and encouraged women for continued protests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to the protesters\u2019 demand that women be given the freedom to end a pregnancy, Morawiecki argued that \u201cin order to have the freedom of choice you first must be alive.\u201d\nAccording to the law passed last Thursday, Polish women may have abortions only in cases of rape or incest, or if the life of the mother is endangered, further tightening what were already some of the EU\u2019s strictest abortion laws.\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, Poland\u2019s deputy prime minister and the country\u2019s de facto leader, has also defended the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThis judgment is completely in line with the Polish constitution. There could have been no other judgment on this issue,\u201d he said.\nZosia Wanat contributed reporting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Tags\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt decisions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Countries\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoland\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated People\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMateusz Morawiecki\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCroatia president vows \u2018rivers of justice\u2019 after court blocks him from running for PM\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t21 HRS ago \t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 questions about the EU Parliament suing the Commission over Hungary cash\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhich Trump trial will go first, and 4 other questions after a busy week in court\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 16\t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElon Musk wades in on Belgian far-right figure\u2019s prison sentence\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 13\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMore from Laurenz Gehrke\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKremlin spies suspected of infiltrating German government, according to report\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe domestic intelligence service is said to be investigating 2 officials who work on energy supply.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAug 31\t\t\n\n3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScholz pitches major EU enlargement \u2014 with reform\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nIn order to expand the EU, Brussels must change first, the German chancellor argues.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAug 29\t\t\n\n5 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe can brew it: Munich eyes Oktoberfest at sobering moment for Europe\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nBeer festival sparks backlash with the Continent ailing due to drought, war and COVID fears.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAug 29\t\t\n\n6 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLast call for Germany\u2019s \u20ac9 ticket to ride\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nA summer of very cheap travel in Germany is coming to an end, but it could return in a different form.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAug 24\t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nApp Store\n\n\nPlay Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\nAgriculture and Food\n\n\nCentral Banker\n\n\nCompetition and Industrial Policy\n\n\nCybersecurity and Data Protection\n\n\nDefense\n\n\nEnergy and Climate\n\n\nEnergy and Climate UK\n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\nFinancial Services UK\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\nMobility\n\n\nParis Influence\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nTechnology UK\n\n\nTrade\n\n\nTrade UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nBerlin Bulletin\n\n\nBerlin Playbook\n\n\nBrussels Playbook\n\n\nChina Watcher\n\n\nDigital Bridge\n\n\nDimanchissime\n\n\nEU Election Playbook\n\n\nEU Influence\n\n\nGlobal Playbook\n\n\nGlobal Policy Lab: Living Cities\n\n\nLondon Influence\n\n\nLondon Playbook\n\n\nPlaybook Paris\n\n\nPOLITICO Confidential\n\n\nSunday Crunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\nEU Confidential\n\n\nPolitics at Jack and Sam's\n\n\nPower Play\n\n\nWestminster Insider\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nAll Opinion\n\n\nBeyond the Bubble\n\n\nClub Med\n\n\nDeclassified\n\n\nFrom Across the Pond\n\n\nUnpacked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Series\n\n\nCOP28\n\n\nLiving Cities\n\n\nPOLITICO 28\n\n\nQatargate files\n\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\n\nPOLITICO Pro\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\nResearch and analysis division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\nMedia Solutions\n\n\nResearch and Analysis Division\n\n\nPress\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nCareers at POLITICO\n\n\nTs&Cs\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nManage Privacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
