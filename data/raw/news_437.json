Doug Jones should \u201cseek forgiveness\u201d for his support for abortion rights.The ad doesn\u2019t say what the candidate\u2019s views are. The former Auburn head football coach says he is anti-abortion, and last year said he was \u201call for\u201d a law that banned abortion in almost all non-medical circumstances in Alabama, including cases of sexual assault. Tuberville's campaign declined to answer questions from the Advertiser about abortion and gun rights. The Republican nominee has also declined to answer questions about COVID-19 and climate change.\u00a0Jones supports abortion rights, writing in response to questions that abortion \u201cis a deeply personal decision between a woman, her health care provider and her faith.\u201d\u201cThere are deep disagreements on the issue of abortion and I respect those who oppose abortion for religious or personal reasons,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cBut while some candidates might deny the complexity of this issue \u2014 and appeal to folks in a politically self-serving way that ignores the facts \u2014 this issue is rarely so simple for those who face this gut-wrenching situation.\u201dMore: Where Doug Jones, Tommy Tuberville stand on addressing the COVID-19 outbreakJones does oppose late-term abortions,\u00a0which are rare,\u00a0and wrote in response to questions that he \u201cdoes not support the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.\u201d\u00a0 Jones, like other Democrats, has\u00a0voted for appropriations bills that include the Hyde Amendment, which bans abortion funding in most federal health insurance programs and is routinely included in those bills.\u00a0Jones said in 2018 he \u201cdoes not support any changes\u201d to current bans on federal abortion spending, one way or the other.\u00a0Jones has broken with abortion rights supporters on other issues, including voting to confirm some of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees and for a bill that drew strong opposition from the country\u2019s leading organization for gynecologists and obstetricians.\u00a0More: Where Alabama U.S. Senate candidates Doug Jones, Tommy Tuberville stand on climate changeThe senator also broadly supports gun rights, writing that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want someone to vote against my right to bear arms or take my guns away\u201d and stressing work to protect hunting and wildlife resources. Jones does support improvements to the background check system and closing loopholes in the existing system.\u00a0More: Read Doug Jones' 9 responses to questions on abortion and gun rightsAbortion\u00a0Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett discusses Roe v. WadeSupreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett discussed Roe v. Wade at Jacksonville University\u2019s Public Policy Institute in 2016.USA TODAY HandoutThe abortion rate in the United States peaked in 1981 at 29.3 per 1,000 women, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which collects data on reproductive issues and supports abortion rights. Since then, abortions in the United States have gone into a steady decline.\u00a0Between 2011 and 2017, the rate fell from 16.9 per 1,000 women to 13.5 per 1,000. Alabama\u2019s abortion rate, which is lower than the national average, also fell during that time, from 8.3 abortions per 1,000 women in 2011 to 6.4 in 2017. The Guttmacher Institute says a broader decline in pregnancies appears to be the main reason for the fall in the abortion rate, though it said state-imposed restrictions are also playing a factor.\u00a0Jones said the best way to reduce abortion is to \u201cimprove the quality of life and economic outlook for women.\u201d To do that, Jones wrote, he supported measures to raise the minimum wage and improve maternal health care, in particular disparities between white and Black Alabamians.\u00a0According to NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group, Jones voted for their positions 69% of the time in 2019. Most of the breaks occurred when Jones voted to confirm judges the organization opposed. Jones also voted to advance a bill to provide criminal penalties for withdrawal of medical care from a child who is born during an abortion or attempted abortion. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposed the bill, saying it could criminalize the induction of labor in cases of fetal abnormalities.\u00a0Jones declined to say if he would vote for an otherwise-qualified Supreme Court nominee who may not share his views on abortion. The senator cited his statement last month that he would not vote for any Supreme Court nominee before the election, saying the current process was moving too quickly.\u00a0\u201cMitch McConnell\u2019s move to rush the confirmation of this nominee may very well cause irreparable harm to the confidence that the American people should have in the independence of the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.Jones wrote that he supports adoption and foster programs, as well as \u201cextending\u201d current federal programs that make contraceptives cheaper and more accessible for women as a way to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the abortion rate.\u201cToo many people in this state want to stand on a moral soapbox about this issue and ignore the fact that human beings act in certain ways that are often irresponsible or uninformed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that better education and easier and cheaper access to contraception would reduce unwanted pregnancies.\u201dGunsGiffords pushes gun reform during virtual DNCGabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot and has since become a national advocate for tighter gun control, was among a lengthy list of Democratic speakers Wednesday for the third night of the party\u2019s national convention. (Aug 19).APGun ownership in Alabama has declined slightly over the past 30 years. A Rand Corporation study released in April found that roughly 50% of\u00a0 all households in Alabama in 2016 had a firearm, down\u00a0from 63% in 1990\u00a0but a bit higher than the 48% estimated to have owned guns in 2010.\u00a0But in Alabama, deaths from firearms are higher than average. According to the CDC, Alabama had 21.8 deaths by firearm per 100,000 people in 2018, second only to Mississippi. \u00a0Alabama\u2019s 1,064 deaths from firearms that year were higher than the 821 reported in New York, a state with almost four times the population of Alabama. More than half of gun deaths in Alabama are deaths by suicide; firearms were present in 70% of recorded suicides in the state in 2016, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.\u00a0In a 2019 interview with the Daily Mlountain Eagle, Tuberville said he is \u201cnot for any form or fashion of gun control\u201d and spoke of \u201cmental health treatment\u201d to address gun violence. But he gave no specific statement as to what he would support or oppose on that front.\u00a0Jones wrote that he supports red flag laws, in which a family can get a court order to temporarily take firearms from a person threatening harm to himself or others. Jones also reiterated his support for Medicaid expansion, which could make mental health services more accessible. He also said there needs to be destigmatization of mental health issues \u201cso that no one feels uncomfortable talking about their pain.\u201d\u00a0The senator wrote he supports raising the minimum age for \u201ccertain semi-automatic weapons\u201d to 21, though he opposes raising the age limit for the purchase of other firearms. Jones also said he supports closing the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d allowing gun purchasers to obtain a gun after three days whether a background check has been completed.\u00a0He also supports closing what is called the \u201cboyfriend loophole.\u201d Federal law bans domestic abusers from owning guns, but only if the victim was a spouse, someone they lived with or someone with whom the abuser shared a child. It does not cover domestic abusers in relationships outside those definitions.\u00a0\u201cClosing this loophole would help prevent domestic violence deaths,\u201d Jones wrote.\u00a0Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
