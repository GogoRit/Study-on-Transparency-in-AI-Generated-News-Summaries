This is about dogs, cats & priests\nWhen it is time to say goodbye to a loyal companion\n\n\nIn Pope Francis\u2019 2015 encyclical \u201cLaudato Si\u2019, on Care for Our Common Home,\u201d he pointed to St. Francis of Assisi\u2019s example, in that \u201cwhenever he would gaze at the sun, the moon or the smallest of animals, he burst into song, drawing all other creatures into his praise.\u201d\u00a0\nThe pope explained it was not just\u00a0 an \u201cintellectual appreciation,\u201d but that in the world around him \u201ceach and every creature was a sister united to him by bonds of affection. That is why he felt called to care for all that exists.\u201d\u00a0\nIn 2019, Arkansas was ranked 34th in the U.S. by the nonprofit Animal Legal Defense Fund for its lack of animal cruelty laws, particularly having no felony charges for abandonment or neglect; an ag-gag law that allows businesses to sue whistleblowers for exposing abuses on farms or other businesses; and because an agency or department is not required to report suspicions of animal cruelty.\u00a0\nIn 2019, Arkansas House Bill 1778 failed on the House floor, which called for greater penalties for animal abusers. It would have upped a third conviction of cruelty against a dog or cat to a Class D felony, which is now a misdemeanor under existing law.\u00a0\nRep. Jim Sorvillo of Little Rock, who sponsored the bill, told KATV when the bill failed, \u201cNationally, we are known for the fact that we allow animal abuse. What disappoints me is that our representatives, our elected officials would not stand up for something that Arkansans really want.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI would say \u2018yes, it is a sin\u2019 because we are damaging part of God\u2019s creation,\u201d Father Shaun Wesley said of animal abuse. \u201cEven though when we\u2019re looking at the moral priority, as it\u2019s not as serious as human life, but it\u2019s harming a part of God\u2019s creation \u2026 I would say it is clearly a sin because it\u2019s damaging something God gave us for our enjoyment and benefit.\u201d\u00a0\nThere is also a connection between animal and human abuse. The National Link Coalition, an advocacy group that researches the links between various types of abuse, pointed to research by the National Coalition of Domestic Violence which stated 71 percent of domestic violence victims who owned pets reported their abuser had \u201cthreatened, injured or killed family pets.\u201d It also stated 87 percent of pet abuse was committed in the presence of a partner being abused, for either revenge or control.\u00a0\nIn Arkansas, puppy mills are common, characterized as high-volume dog breeding facilities that overbreed females and ignore basic care for the animals. Two puppy mills in Arkansas made the 2020 Humane Society of the United States \u201cHorrible Hundred\u201d list of worst puppy mills in the country.\u00a0\nFather Luke Womack said, \u201cThat\u2019s particularly emotional for me because of adopting Luna. If I hadn\u2019t adopted her, who knows. She may have been adopted, she may not have. The reason that we need to love and care for our pets is because they provide us with that unconditional love.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile it can be a problem to assign human characteristics to animals, Father Stephen Gadberry said \u201cthey\u2019re not just objects, they\u2019re living creatures.\u201d\n\u201cTo be pro-life means to support the whole cycle of life and it\u2019s not just human cycles of life. We require food, shelter, community; it\u2019s the life of other people and other things, plants and animals, all livelihood,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAll of creation is in Christ so that would include all of the fallen world, plants, animals and people. So at the end of time all of creation will be glorified if we believe in the body and the soul, the soul lives on. There's a glorification. That would include plants and animals in the plan of salvation.\u201d\n\n\nPets and grief\u00a0\nRead more pet stories:\u00a0\nEnough about bad news.
