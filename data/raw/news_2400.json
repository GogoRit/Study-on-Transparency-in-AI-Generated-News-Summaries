They vehemently oppose contraception as well as safe, legal abortion. Motherhood is extolled as the pinnacle of human achievement for women.\nLast year in Verona, Italy, many of these groups converged at the World Congress of Families summit of ultra-conservative activists and their far-right political allies. Like other speakers, Eduard Habsburg-Lothringen, a member of one of Europe\u2019s oldest royal families, introduced himself by announcing how many children he has fathered (six).Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Mexico\u2019s teachers seek relief from pandemic-era spike in school robberieslist 2 of 4\u2018A bad chapter\u2019: Tracing the origins of Ecuador\u2019s rise in gang violencelist 3 of 4Why is the US economy so resilient?list 4 of 4Is China\u2019s economy in serious trouble?end of list\nYou would think, given their power and obsession with motherhood, these groups would have successfully campaigned to ensure childbirth is a safe and positive experience for women. Instead, they have paradoxically left campaigns against obstetric violence to the feminists and global health experts that they also vehemently oppose.\nEven before COVID-19, too many women endured unacceptable dangers and mistreatment giving birth. The pandemic appears to have made this much worse. Since March, women in at least 45 countries have faced childbirth experiences during the pandemic that defy international guidelines as well as national laws and policies.\nIn countries around the world, women have been forcibly separated from newborns; required to give birth \u201calone\u201d without support from partners or relatives; denied pain medication. They have been shouted at and treated \u201clike machines\u201d. At some hospitals, all women have been subjected to \u201cmandatory\u201d caesarean sections.\nThese incidents have occurred even in places which are hotspots for ultra-conservative movements, and where they have national political power or influence. \u201cNo woman should be treated how I was treated during childbirth,\u201d said one new mother in the US, where these groups have celebrated President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d administration.\n\u201cMy husband and I will handcuff ourselves together if doctors won\u2019t allow him in,\u201d said a woman in Ukraine, where the president encouraged people to use the lockdown to have more babies. Here, as in Armenia, restrictions on women giving birth have even outlasted lockdowns. You can take your partner to a restaurant but not a maternity ward.\nGlobally, \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-family\u201d movements have not slowed down during COVID-19. They have been busy campaigning\u00a0\u2013 but not to protect the rights of pregnant women and new mothers. Their focus has been on limiting women\u2019s choices.\nIn the US, for example, conservative states moved quickly to \u201cban\u201d abortions by classifying them as non-essential services. Last week, the Supreme Court upheld Trump administration rules allowing employers to opt out of including birth control in an employee\u2019s health insurance plan.\nThe United Nations warned that COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown disruptions could result in seven\u00a0million unintended pregnancies in just six months. For a heartbreaking number of women, they have had no choice but to continue these pregnancies or seek unsafe abortions.\nThose who have arrived at maternity wards to give birth during the pandemic have faced other restrictions that top doctors and lawyers denounced as \u201cunnecessary\u201d and part of an \u201calarming pattern of women\u2019s health and rights being deprioritised\u201d.\nMotherhood-obsessed ultra-conservatives have the power, and you would think the motivation, to do something about this. But instead, many of these same movements have attacked the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 the global health body that is standing up for women\u2019s rights to timely, quality and respectful care in childbirth.\nA week after the pandemic was declared, the WHO even issued specific guidance on childbirth during COVID-19 \u2013 insisting, among other things, that women giving birth be treated with respect and dignity; be allowed birth companions, and; be supported to breastfeed and have skin-to-skin contact with newborns. (Yes, this is the same WHO that the \u201cmost pro-life president\u201d Donald Trump has sought to savagely defund.)\nBy not using their power to make a difference for women in childbirth, ultra-conservatives reveal how their interests actually lie elsewhere \u2013 in promoting and defending childbirth as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d, something that we must do in patriarchal societies, and that we should not \u201ccomplain\u201d about. This is bad news for women\u2019s rights, certainly \u2013 but it is also, ultimately, a losing strategy for these groups.\nEventually, ultra-conservatives\u2019 silence on these issues will undermine their efforts to expand. Many of the people that these movements are trying to reach will share feminists\u2019 concerns about these issues, and want these conditions for women giving birth to be better. Once again, this pandemic should teach us we have more in common than we do not \u2013 and help us protect women\u2019s rights and lives.\n\u201cI honestly hope,\u201d said one woman in Italy, that those in power \u201cwill learn something from our suffering and prevent other women from going through that we had to go through\u201d. She gave birth in late March \u2013 shortly after one of the co-hosts of last year\u2019s ultra-conservative summit in Verona called for people to use the COVID-19 lockdown to reproduce, exclaiming: \u201cLet\u2019s stay at home and have a baby!\u201d\nLike many women around the world, she had to go through childbirth \u201calone\u201d with her partner banned from the hospital she went to. She was also separated from her newborn for more than six hours after birth. Feminists and global health experts are listening to these stories and calling for change. Will ultra-conservatives join them?\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.\naj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
