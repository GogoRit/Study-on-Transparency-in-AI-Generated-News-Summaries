Wade \u2013 when the US Supreme Court affirmed access to abortion as a constitutional right \u2013 Florida legislators are considering a bill that would threaten adolescent girls\u2019 access to abortion.\nThe bill, HB265/SB404, would force teenage girls to get parental consent for abortion. Florida state law already requires girls under 18 to notify a parent before an abortion or go to court to get a waiver from a judge. The proposed law would require girls to get written, notarized consent from a parent or legal guardian for an abortion or to seek a judicial waiver.\nResearch shows that most girls involve a parent or another trusted adult in their abortion decision, whether or not the law requires it. But some girls can\u2019t involve a parent.\nI interviewed several Florida lawyers who represented girls who sought abortions but could not tell their parents. Their clients feared being beaten, kicked out of the home, alienated from their families, or forced to continue a pregnancy against their wishes. Some girls didn\u2019t live with their parents or even know where they were. Some had been removed from their parents\u2019 care because of abuse or neglect. Forcing girls in these circumstances to get a parent\u2019s consent could put them at serious risk.\nBut under the bill, the only other option to seeking a parent\u2019s permission will be a judicial bypass. For a pregnant girl who is scared and doesn\u2019t have parental support, going to the county clerk\u2019s office during business hours \u2013 when she should be in school \u2013, finding the right department, meeting a court-appointed attorney, and then proving to a judge that she is mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion, or that involving her parents is not in her best interest, is an intimidating process. And all this delays girls\u2019 getting care.\nFlorida already has an onerous parental notification requirement. But HB265/SB404 will make it even harder for girls to get timely access to the health care they need. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be testifying in opposition to the bill in Florida\u2019s Senate Rules Committee meeting today.\nParents who have built loving, supportive family relationships should trust that their daughters will turn to them for guidance no matter what the law requires. And forcing girls who do not have parental support to go to court to get an abortion is burdensome and cruel.\nFlorida\u2019s legislators should reject the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 11, 2019\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nUS State of Ohio Proposes Extreme Abortion Ban \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 10, 2019\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nWhat Life is Like When Abortion is Banned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n          Feature\n        \n\n\n\u201cA Sense of Terror Stronger than a Bullet\u201d\n\n\nThe Closing of North Korea 2018\u20132023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Contribute to Society\u201d\n\n\nThe Need for Legal Gender Recognition in Tabasco, Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 11, 2019\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nUS State of Ohio Proposes Extreme Abortion Ban \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 10, 2019\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nWhat Life is Like When Abortion is Banned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
