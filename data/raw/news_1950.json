She\u2019s one of five Texas women who were denied abortions and are now suing the state.\nSuzanne Cordiero/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor days, I was locked in this bizarre and avoidable hell,\u201d Amanda Zurawski said Tuesday outside the Texas state Capitol.\nShe\u2019s one of five women suing the state over its restrictive abortion law after they were denied the procedure despite their lives being in danger\u2014and their doctors confirming their fetuses would not survive birth. Their lawsuit seeks to affirm that doctors in Texas can provide abortions for certain medical exceptions, and seeks specific directives that outline what conditions qualify for a legal abortion in the state.\nHere are the stories of each plaintiff and their experience with Texas\u2019 abortion law, as detailed in statements to the media and in court documents:\nAmanda ZurawskiZurawski went through fertility treatments for over a year before she finally became pregnant with her first child. Eighteen weeks in, her doctor told her she had cervical insufficiency and that the fetus would eventually die.* She asked what her options were and her health care team said there was nothing they could do because of Texas\u2019 anti-abortion law. Zurawksi\u2019s doctors could not intervene until her fetus no longer had a detectable heartbeat or she herself became deathly ill\u2014so she had to wait. Soon, Zurawksi developed sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection, and her family flew to her bedside, fearing her death. Doctors were finally able to induce delivery without violating Texas\u2019 abortion law. \u201cAn abortion would have prevented the unnecessary harm and suffering that I endured, not only the psychological trauma that came with three days of waiting, but the physical harm my body suffered, the extent of which is still being determined.\u201d\n\n\n\nLauren HallHall became pregnant last year, but at 18 weeks her specialist told her that her baby had anencephaly, a life-threatening condition that prevents the fetus from developing a skull or brain. Hall\u2019s doctor said she had two options: wait to miscarry or travel out of state to get a legal abortion. However, if Hall decided to go out of state, her doctor wouldn\u2019t be able to send any of her medical records to her new out-of-state provider. Hall said she tried contacting other Texas doctors for help, but none would take her case. \u201cProviders are scared to treat cases like ours without guidelines from the state, and more people will suffer and lose their lives if a change is not made,\u201d she said outside the state Capitol Tuesday. Hall ended up booking a flight to Seattle to get an abortion. One year later, she\u2019s pregnant again. \u201cI compulsively look up every ache and pain, terrified that I will find myself in this unbearable situation again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\nLauren MillerMiller was pregnant with twins, and at her 12-week ultrasound, her doctor found that one of her fetuses had Trisomy 18, a rare birth defect that was preventing proper brain development. Her doctors said this fetus would likely not survive outside of Miller\u2019s womb. Her Texas doctor said he could not help her and that she needed to go out of state to get an abortion. The longer she waited, the more endangered she would become, along with her remaining healthy fetus. She ended up traveling out of state to get an abortion. Speaking at Tuesday\u2019s press conference, she acknowledged that she had access to critical resources to help her, including family to watch her 1-year-old son while she traveled and personal connections with doctors outside of Texas. \u201cLayers of privilege should never determine which Texans can get access to the health care they need,\u201d she said. Miller is currently pregnant with her remaining fetus.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna ZargarianZargarian found out she was pregnant in 2021, shortly before Texas\u2019 abortion ban went into effect. A few months into her pregnancy, her water broke\u2014known as premature rupture of membranes\u2014and doctors said her fetus would not survive. \u201cMy heart broke into a million pieces,\u201d she said. Her doctors said the fetus\u2019 chances of survival were slim to none, and, under Texas\u2019 abortion law, they couldn\u2019t offer her an abortion until her life was actively in danger. One doctor eventually told her she was wasting her time in Texas trying to get the health care she needed, so she finally booked a flight to Colorado to get an abortion. \u201cIt was like Russian roulette knowing I was at risk of infection, hemorrhaging, or going into labor at any moment\u201d of the two-and-a-half-hour flight.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\ufeffAshley BrandtLast year, Brandt, who is already mother to a 3-year-old son, discovered she was pregnant with twins. At her 12-week ultrasound, Brandt\u2019s doctor informed her that one of the fetuses also had anencephaly and would not survive labor. However, the fetus still had a detectable heartbeat, taking abortion off the table under Texas law. According to the lawsuit, she had to travel out of state for an abortion to save the life of her remaining fetus. Brandt\u2019s doctor was so fearful of documenting her abortion care, the lawsuit said, that he described her condition as \u201cvanishing twin syndrome\u201d\u2014a completely different medical condition that causes a miscarriage.\n\nCorrection, March 8, 2023: This piece originally misstated the stage of pregnancy at which Zurawski received her diagnosis; she was 18 weeks pregnant, not six months. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Reproductive Rights\n            \n\n\n              Texas\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
