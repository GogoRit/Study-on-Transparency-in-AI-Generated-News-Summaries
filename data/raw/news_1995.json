Jim Pillen holds a 5-day-old newborn in his arms moments before signing LB 574 into law on Monday, May 22, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014\u00a0Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen on Monday signed into law new restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care for minors, which opponents vowed to fight until the very end.\n  Gov. Jim Pillen speaks at a news conference for the signing of LB 574 on Monday, May 22, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nLegislative Bill 574, proposed by State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, passed 33-15 last Friday on the final round of debate. The measure includes an approximate 10-week abortion ban (12 weeks gestational age) and restrictions on transition surgeries, hormone therapies and puberty blockers for youths.\n\u201cToday is an extraordinary, historic day for the State of Nebraska,\u201d Pillen said at a signing ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s a day where it\u2019s really simple: Protect our kids so that our state has a bigger and brighter future.\u201d\nUnder the law, the chief medical officer and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services would be charged with setting the rules and regulations around the puberty blockers and hormones for patients before the age of 19. Transition surgeries would be prohibited.\n\u2018Today is about celebrating\u2019\nThe abortion restrictions will become law after one legislative day, approximately at midnight on Tuesday, according to legislative rules.\n  State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, a lead sponsor to further restrict abortion this year, speaks on LB 574 as it was signed into law on Monday, May 22, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nState Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who led the original six-week abortion ban that failed by one vote on second reading, choked up Monday as she thanked her colleagues and Pillen for sticking by her and getting more restrictions into law.\nThe current law allowed abortions up to 20 weeks post-fertilization, or 22 weeks gestational age. LB 574 included exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\u201cToday is about celebrating and protecting the unborn and allowing our children to grow,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cI look forward to the day when every child is protected from conception from elective abortions.\u201d\n  State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, the lead sponsor of LB 574, speaks at a news conference prior to her law being signed into law on Monday, May 22, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nThe gender care restrictions will become effective Oct. 1, and youths who previously received transition medications before that date can continue. However, opponents said it\u2019s unclear whether the law allows patients who received blockers, for example, to then receive hormones.\nLB 574 faced significant opposition this year and spurred a 12-week-long filibuster, but Kauth and Pillen said the purpose is simple: \u201cprotecting our kids and saving babies.\u201d\n\u201cI brought LB 574 because you have too many kids who are being swept up in what is a social contagion and being told that their bodies are not perfect the way they are and if they just switch their gender, they\u2019ll be fine, everything will be great,\u201d Kauth said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\u2018We will not stop\u2019\nThe new law is expected to face significant challenges at the ballot box and in the courts, according to opposing senators and advocacy organizations outside the Legislature.\nPillen said he and his team are ready to fight any challenges.\n  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln speaks against LB 574 on the floor of the Legislature on Friday, May 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).\nState Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, George Dungan of Lincoln and John Cavanaugh of Omaha, all attorneys, have said the bill faces multiple areas of scrutiny under the law.\nOne argument is that LB 574, on the gender care side, discriminates on the basis of sex. It is one of 130 bills nationwide that would restrict health care for primarily LGBTQ people.\nFor example, cisgender boys or girls could continue to receive some restricted treatments, such as breast augmentation or puberty blockers, while transgender youths could not.\nThe ACLU includes LB 574 among nearly 500 state-level proposals that are \u201cattacks on LGBTQ rights.\u201d\nAfter the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022, dozens of states moved to restrict abortion, with lawsuits challenging many of those new laws. Multiple states have also implemented restrictions or bans on gender-affirming care since the Supreme Court struck down Roe, which have been challenged, too.\nMindy Rush Chipman, interim executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska, said Pillen\u2019s signature \u201cbetrays a total disregard for Nebraskans\u2019 freedom, health and well-being.\u201d\n\u201cEvery option is on the table to undo these regressive measures, including seeking justice through the courts,\u201d Rush Chipman said in a statement. \u201cWe will not stop working toward a future that safeguards all Nebraskans\u2019 rights, including the rights of transgender youth, their families and people in need of reproductive health care.\u201d\n\u2018Backdoor\u2019 ban and single subject\nOpponents have also said the law violates the Nebraska Constitution\u2019s \u201csingle subject\u201d rule, requiring that laws deal with single issues.\nKauth and other supporters argue their law holds up on this standard because it deals with health care and protects babies and children.\n  State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln, John Fredrickson of Omaha, Megan Hunt of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, from left to right, huddle on Thursday, April 13, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nDungan on Friday also criticized the Legislature\u2019s \u201cunlimited and unrestrained\u201d delegation to the chief medical officer and DHHS.\u00a0\nState Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha said the delegation could lead to a \u201cbackdoor\u201d ban on transition medications for transgender minors.\nPillen did not specify what guidance he would give interim chief medical officer Dr. Timothy Tesmer, whose confirmation hearing is this week. However, Pillen noted he has known Tesmer for a long time.\n\u201cHe knows Nebraska,\u201d Pillen said of Tesmer. \u201cHe understands that his job is to carry out the law that has been signed in, and that\u2019s what we expect him to do.\u201d\nTesmer served as chair of the State Board of Health in March when it issued a statement in support of an unamended version of LB 574 that included a full ban on the medications for minors.\nState Sen. Lynne Walz of Fremont and Cavanaugh put forward specific rules and regulations that would have clarified some of this confusion and offered specific guidance for when the bill goes into effect. They drafted these with Fredrickson.\nWalz said their proposed version could serve as a \u201croadmap\u201d for Tesmer.\n\u2018Nebraska nice\u2019 not \u2018Nebraska meek\u2019\nState Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair introduced the amendment to revive an abortion ban this year, calling those efforts one of \u201clegislative teamwork, compromise and courage.\u201d\n  Blair State Sen. Ben Hansen speaks at a news conference prior to the signing of LB 574 into law on Monday, May 22, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\n\u201cWhile this approach doesn\u2019t seem to be the norm in Washington, D.C., this is what good government looks like,\u201d Hansen said.\u00a0\nLawmakers also gave a nod to State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar, whose absence Friday as she was hospitalized for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting tied to pregnancy. This almost doomed LB 574, but Slama returned that afternoon, still sick, and provided the 33rd vote for passage.\nIt\u2019s one example of extraordinary efforts to get the bill passed. Others included getting State Sen. Ray Aguilar of Grand Island, who was recovering from knee surgery, to the chamber in time to vote on first round, as well the Legislature taking a 45-minute pause in debate on second round to salvage the legislation.\nHansen said that when it comes to protecting children, lawmakers would do all they could.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not confuse \u2018Nebraska nice\u2019 with \u2018Nebraska meek,\u2019\u201d he said.\nFilibuster to continue as 2024 takes shape\nAnother Kauth proposal, LB 575, the \u201cSports and Spaces Act,\u201d is expected to be considered next year. It would restrict sporting teams, bathrooms and locker rooms for K-12 schools based on sex assigned at birth.\n  Nearly 30 Nebraska lawmakers joined Gov. Jim Pillen and representatives from the Nebraska Family Alliance, Nebraska Catholic Conference and Nebraska Right to Life for the signing of LB 574 on Monday, May 22, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nState Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Education Committee, said it\u2019s his hope the bill comes to the floor and is passed next year.\u00a0\nThe bill has 28 cosponsors, more than LB 574, and is missing four supporters of that measure: State Sens. John Arch of La Vista (the speaker), Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, Mike Moser of Columbus and Slama.\nFive of the eight Education Committee members are cosponsors.\nCosponsorships do not always mean promised support, but it\u2019s an indication that LB 575 could be a defining mark in 2024.\nKauth said the 12-week-long filibuster aided in the passage of LB 574 because it allowed senators to work together on the sidelines and shore up support.\n\u201cHad they not filibustered, this bill would have been dead in February,\u201d Kauth said, calling it a three- to five-year issue to work on.\n  State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha works at her desk on the floor of the Legislature on Thursday, May 18, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. Multiple senators now have an LGBTQ pride flag on their name plates. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nThe filibusters, led by State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh and Megan Hunt, both of Omaha, have promised to continue the fight.\nCavanaugh said that Friday\u2019s vote was \u201cunfortunate\u201d already, but because Pillen is \u201crushing\u201d to sign the bill, with an emergency clause to go into effect almost immediately, it will lead to \u201cextremely devastating\u201d effects for the Nebraska medical community and health care generally.\n\u201cI think that this is not what Nebraska is,\u201d Cavanaugh said of LB 574. \u201cThis is not what Nebraska wants, and we will see that reflected in the coming months and year.\u201d\nCorrection:\u00a0The caption with the photograph of Gov.
