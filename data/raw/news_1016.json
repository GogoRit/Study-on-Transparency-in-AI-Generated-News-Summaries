(AP) \u2014 Abortion clinics in Louisiana can continue operating while a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s near total ban on abortions is resolved, a state judge ruled Thursday.The preliminary injunction issued by state district judge Donald Johnson in Baton Rouge is the latest development amid a flurry of court challenges to state \u201ctrigger\u201d laws that were crafted in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established abortion rights, which it did June 24.For weeks, access to abortion has been flickering in Louisiana where there are three clinics. A statewide abortion ban has taken effect twice and been blocked twice since the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June. Johnson had entered a temporary hold on enforcement July 11, pending arguments in the case that were heard Monday.Johnson\u2019s new ruling allows clinics to continue providing abortion procedures while a lawsuit filed by a north Louisiana abortion clinic and others continues. The order gives attorneys on both sides 30 days to develop plans for a trial on whether the law should be permanently blocked.\n\nThe state could appeal his order, however, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry has said he expects the case to wind up at the state Supreme Court.\nIn his reasons for the decision, Johnson said that due to the \u201cvagueness\u201d of the law, members of the Medical Students for Choice \u2014 one of the plaintiffs in the case \u2014 do not have \u201cadequate notice if, or to what extent, they can continue to perform or assist\u201d in abortions. Johnson said that is a violation of the members\u2019 rights to due process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis harm is not speculative,\u201d Johnson wrote. He added that members of Medical Students for Choice risk prosecution if they were to incorrectly apply abortion laws. Despite the new ruling, Landry said in a statement that he looks \u201cforward to ending this legal circus by getting the case to the State\u2019s Supreme Court as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is a north Louisiana clinic that has continued abortion care in Shreveport under Johnson\u2019s temporary order. Clinics in Baton Rouge and New Orleans had stopped operations pending Johnson\u2019s decision on the injunction. A spokeswoman for those clinics said both were open Thursday, scheduling patients for counseling and abortions.\u201cWith this decision, Chief Judge Johnson determined that we are likely to succeed on the merits of our lawsuit,\u201d Joanna Wright, an attorney for the clinic, said in an email. \u201cWe are prepared to prove our case and hope to obtain a final ruling that the trigger bans are unconstitutional and cannot be enforced.\u201dThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit don\u2019t deny that the state can now ban abortion as a result of the Supreme Court ruling. Instead, they contend that Louisiana now has multiple, conflicting trigger mechanisms in the law. They also argue that state law is unclear on whether it bans an abortion prior to a fertilized egg implanting in the uterus.And while the law provides an exception for \u201cmedically futile\u201d pregnancies in cases of fetuses with fatal abnormalities, the plaintiffs noted it gives no definition of the term and that state health officials have not yet provided a list of conditions that would qualify as medically futile.\n\nIn Louisiana, there is little question that an abortion ban will eventually be in effect in the state where the Legislature has long been dominated by abortion opponents. But the court case has resulted in more time for the state\u2019s three abortion clinics \u2014 in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans \u2014 to stay open.Debate over the ban stretched into the State Bond Commission meeting Thursday. Members withheld a $39 million non-cash line of credit for the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board power plant project as a way to \u201csend a message\u201d to city leaders who said they would not enforce the statewide abortion ban.\u201cToday, our Bond Commission forced elected officials in New Orleans to decide if they will enforce State law,\u201d Landry said in a written statement.\n\nLandry was not present for Thursday\u2019s meeting but called on the commission earlier in the week to not approve financing for any deals involving New Orleans until officials have \u201caffirmed that they will enforce State laws.\u201d Not all were in favor of this approach, including Gov. John Bel Edwards.\u201cThe idea that you seek to punish all the people living in a certain area because you are at odds with some of their elected officials, that\u2019s not a reasonable approach,\u201d Edwards, a Democrat who opposes abortions, said on his monthly radio show Wednesday. \u201cYou are not just punishing those people.\u201d___Associated Press writer Kevin McGill in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
