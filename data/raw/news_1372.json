(Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana\u2019s controversial religious freedom law is at the heart of at least two ongoing lawsuits that seek to strike down the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban, fueling debate about where to draw lines between religion and policy.\nThe first legal challenge \u2014 a class action lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana \u2014 argues that the new abortion law violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nThe Satanic Temple \u2014\u00a0a nontheistic religious organization based in Salem, Massachusetts \u2014 filed a separate federal lawsuit last week, making a similar claim that the Indiana abortion ban violates RFRA. The group maintains the ban is unconstitutional and an infringement on its members\u2019 religious beliefs.\nThe new abortion ban is on hold for now after a Republican judge in Owen County last month issued a temporary injunction in a separate ACLU lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of the law. Under the injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law stands \u2014 allowing abortions up to 20 weeks \u2014 while the matter continues to play out in court.\nIndiana\u2019s RFRA law is not often used in court challenges, but legal experts say the lawsuits could be at least somewhat meritorious.\nSuch speculation is largely on hold until the cases play out more in court, however. The Indiana Attorney General\u2019s office has yet to file responses in either lawsuit, and oral arguments for the ACLU case won\u2019t be heard until next week.\nDebating the intersection of law and religion\u00a0\nThe lawsuits attempt to turn RFRA\u2019s language back on Indiana\u2019s Republican lawmakers who supported both the religious freedom bill and the abortion ban.\nThe controversial RFRA measure \u2014 lauded by religious conservatives \u2014 passed the Indiana legislature in 2015, prohibiting government action that interferes with a person\u2019s religious exercise. It stipulates that the government must show a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to enact a law that forces someone to do something against their religious beliefs.\nFormer Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who signed the law, drew major criticism from opponents who argued that RFRA makes discrimination legal.\nThe ACLU lawsuit was filed in Marion County Superior Court on behalf of Hoosier Jews for Choice, as well as five anonymous women who represent a variety of faiths including, Judaism, Islam, and independent spiritual belief systems.\nStory continues below\nACLU complaint\n\u00a0\nThey argue that they have \u201csincere religious beliefs that direct them to obtain an abortion\u201d that would be banned \u201cand who are at risk of needing an abortion in the future consistent with these beliefs.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the plaintiffs, although some religions \u2014 and adherents of those religions \u2014 believe that human life begins at conception, \u201cthis is not a theological opinion shared by all religions or all religious persons.\u201d\nDaniel Conkle, an Indiana University law professor who testified in support of RFRA in 2015, said unless the plaintiffs in the ACLU case can show their religious beliefs require them to seek an abortion, they\u2019re unlikely to prevail in court.\n\u201cSome of these claimants are women whose religion permits her to have an abortion, but that\u2019s all she can say,\u201d Conkle said. \u201cIn my view, that in and of itself will not be enough to meet the threshold. A lot of people are religious, and the religions of most folks permit them to do all kinds of things. But here, does the religion require a person to have an abortion, versus merely permit it?\u201d\nBut \u201cit gets very fuzzy,\u201d if a claimant can successfully argue that their religion \u201csignificantly or substantially points them in that direction,\u201d Conkle continued.\u00a0\nHe said it\u2019s possible that \u201cat least some women\u201d could get through that initial legal hurdle by proving their religious \u201cstrongly influences or motivates\u201d them to get an abortion, but he noted that more testimony needs to be heard to determine if that\u2019s the case for any of the ACLU\u2019s clients.\u00a0\nIf so, it would then be up to the state to show that the abortion ban \u201cserves a compelling governmental interest.\u201d The state could prevail on the grounds that the prevention of abortion serves a compelling interest in protecting human life, Conkle said, but \u201cthat argument may or may not succeed.\u201d\n\u201cThe state has to show that the abortion law not only serves a legitimate interest in protecting fetal life, but that the interest is compelling, which is a much, much more difficult standard to meet,\u201d he said.\nRobert Katz, another Indiana University law professor, added that the Indiana attorney general\u2019s response to the ACLU filing \u2014 which is due by Nov. 2 \u2014 will also shed light on the state\u2019s defense of the ban.\n\u201cThe state\u2019s main challenge will be to provide public reasons for banning abortion, that is, reasons that people of different religions and moral backgrounds could accept,\u201d Katz told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. \u201cThe ban cannot be sustained based on one or more religious groups\u2019 distinct and controversial theological claims about fetuses and pregnant women.\u201d\nCan a RFRA challenge overturn the abortion ban?\nIt\u2019s also still unclear whether the lawsuit filed by The Satanic Temple could be successful in court.\nThe group\u2019s legal challenge similarly alleges \u200b\u200bthat Indiana\u2019s abortion ban violates RFRA. The Satanic Temple says the ban makes the exercise of the Satanic abortion \u201critual\u201d a crime.\nStory continues below\nSatanicTempleLawsuit\n\u00a0\nThe ritual serves as a protective rite designed to \u201ccast off notions of guilt, shame, and mental discomfort that a patient may be experiencing due to choosing to have a medically safe and legal abortion,\u201d according to court documents filed by The Satanic Temple.\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana \u2014 asks the court to stop the enforcement of Indiana\u2019s near-total ban on abortion for members of The Satanic Temple who became \u201cinvoluntarily pregnant\u201d after their birth control failed. The Indiana chapter has over 11,300 members, according to the lawsuit.\u00a0\n\u201cAll of the involuntary pregnant women who are (temple) members believe the fetal tissue they carry in their uterus \u2014 from conception until viability \u2014 is part of their body and not imbued with any humanity or existence,\u201d plaintiffs said in the lawsuit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Satanic Temple previously filed lawsuits against abortion restrictions in other states, including in Texas and Missouri.\nConkle said \u201climited relief\u201d is the most likely outcome in either lawsuit, not an outright strike-down of the abortion ban.\n\u201cThat would confine the operation of the Indiana abortion law in such a way that it would not apply to those particular women, in those particular circumstances,\u201d Conkle said. \u201cIt would not invalidate the law outright.\nOther legal challenge ongoing\nOral arguments for the ACLU lawsuit are scheduled for Oct. 14 in Indianapolis.\u00a0\nThe state has until mid-October to respond to the lawsuit filed by The Satanic Temple.\nMeanwhile, a separate ACLU of Indiana lawsuit filed on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center is also still pending. The state attorney general\u2019s office appealed the injunction issued in the lawsuit and is awaiting a new ruling from the appellate court. Lawyers representing the state are hoping to advance the issue to the Indiana Supreme Court.\nThe suit argues that the abortion ban \u201cwill infringe on Hoosiers\u2019 right to privacy, violate Indiana\u2019s guarantee of equal privileges and immunities, and violate the Constitution\u2019s due course of law clause through its unconstitutionally vague language.\u201d\u00a0\nThe court challenge is based on the Indiana Constitution. The Supreme Court of the United States in June ruled that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee abortion rights.\nThe Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly advanced the abortion-restricting measure during a heated, two-week special session that concluded in August.\nThat made Indiana the first state in the nation to approve such legislation since the high court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe ban outlaws all abortions except in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly and cases of serious health risk to the mother. One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime. Rape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also strips abortion clinics of their state medical licenses, and provides that only hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers can provide abortions.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXUp for debate: Can Indiana\u2019s religious freedom law strike down the state\u2019s abortion ban?\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle October 3, 2022\nUp for debate: Can Indiana\u2019s religious freedom law strike down the state\u2019s abortion ban?\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle October 3, 2022\n Indiana\u2019s controversial religious freedom law is at the heart of at least two ongoing lawsuits that seek to strike down the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban, fueling debate about where to draw lines between religion and policy.\nThe first legal challenge \u2014 a class action lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana \u2014 argues that the new abortion law violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nThe Satanic Temple \u2014\u00a0a nontheistic religious organization based in Salem, Massachusetts \u2014 filed a separate federal lawsuit last week, making a similar claim that the Indiana abortion ban violates RFRA.
