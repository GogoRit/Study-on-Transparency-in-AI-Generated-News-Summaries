Photo via Flip Benham/Facebook\nNew Documentary Falsely Claims Christian Right Paid \u201cJane Roe\u201d to Be Pro-Life\nBy Jessilyn Lancaster, Managing Editor\nPro-life leaders who knew Norma McCorvey, aka \u201cJane Roe\u201d of Roe v. Wade, firmly deny they paid McCorvey to change her abortion rhetoric, as a new documentary claims.\nThe documentary, AKA JANE ROE, features interviews with McCorvey, who says, \u201cI took their money, and they\u2019d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201d\nWhen asked by the director if her pro-life views were all an act, McCorvey replied: \u201cYeah, I did it well too. I am a good actress \u2014 of course I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d\nHowever, pro-life leaders like Flip Benham, who baptized McCorvey, say this is simply untrue.\n\u201cAKA JANE ROE in no way reflects the real history and miracle of faith that transformed both Miss Norma and Miss Connie. It is, unfortunately, Nick Sweeney\u2019s attempt to rewrite history and shoehorn statements from a dying, hurting woman into his truncated and perverted view of life,\u201d Benham said in a press release.\n\u201cWe never paid Miss Norma a penny,\u201d Benham said. \u201cWe certainly helped Miss Norma and Miss Connie Gonzales (her lesbian partner at the time) to get back on their feet after Jasbur Ahluwalia, the owner and abortionist at A Choice for Women fired them. They had no source of income. Many in our group would donate to help them get along, but we did this for all the abortion mill employees who quit their jobs and trusted Jesus. We would help them find work, find church homes, take care of their kids, whatever we could do for them we did.\u201d\n\u201cWe also did this for abortion minded mothers who desperately needed help. We took care of them. This is what Christians do\u2014we still do this today,\u201d Benham\u2019s release continued.\nOther pro-life leaders who knew McCorvey said she genuinely lived out her pro-life beliefs.\nLauren Muzyka, the executive director of the pro-life organization Sidewalk Advocates, said she used to pray next to McCorvey on the sidewalks outside abortion clinics.\n\u00a0\n\nI prayed with Norma McCorvey in front of an abortion facility for the 40 Days for Life-Dallas campaign just before she died. That and so many other activities she did with our Dallas #prolife community were unpaid. There was no doubt in our minds she was pro-life.#NormaMcCorvey\n\u2014 Lauren Muzyka (@LaurenMuzyka) May 20, 2020\n\nLila Rose of Live Action said she had many friends in common with McCorvey, and McCorvey\u2019s conversion to Christianity was very real.\n\nI\u2019ve been in touch with many of Norma\u2019s personal friends \u2013 people who knew and loved Norma personally for years. They share that her conversion was real, and that she felt tormented by the deadly law that has led to the deaths of over 60 million children. #NormaMcCorvey\n\u2014 Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) May 20, 2020\n\n\u00a0\nJanet Morena, executive director of Priests for Life, was a personal friend of McCorvey\u2019s and shared many stories on Twitter about McCorvey\u2019s change of heart after Roe V. Wade took effect.\nMcCorvey herself told the New York Times in 1994 how miserable she was as an abortion advocate.\n\u201c[Pro-abortion attorney] Sarah [Weddington] saw these cuts on my wrists, my swollen eyes from crying, the miserable person sitting across from her, and she knew she had a patsy. She knew I wouldn\u2019t go outside of the realm of her and Linda. I was too scared. It was one of the most hideous times of my life,\u201d McCorvey said at the time.\nBenham, who said he has only seen the trailer to the documentary, believes the McCorvey did say some \u201coutrageous things,\u201d but these statements do not reflect the transformative work Christ did in her life.\n\u201cAnyone can gather facts, grab statements and twist them to tell a lie. This is what happened to my dying friend, Miss\u00a0Norma McCorvey,\u201d Benham said.\n\u201cI saw that he got Miss Norma on tape saying some pretty outrageous things. Again, I have not seen the full video, but that was just Norma being Norma. Those who knew her best, know this. She was, indeed, utterly unfiltered and a whole lot of fun. Yet, she could also be very fickle and hard-headed (just like me!) And, she said many things that were simply not true at times, only to come back and set the record straight. This was simply part of her maturing walk with Jesus,\u201d Benham continued.\n\nYet, AKA JANE ROE seeks to erase McCorvey\u2019s testimony and replace it with a revisionist agenda.\n\u201cIn her dying days, this FX documentary has sought to redefine the life-changing legacy of Jesus Christ for over three decades in Norma McCorvey\u2019s life\u2026all with a few, flippant statements. Sad.\u201d\nMcCorvey\u2019s ultimate pro-life legacy is so staunch that even the New York Times complained in her obituary that she was not the \u201cidealized Jane Roe crusader many Americans visualized.\u201d\nFurthermore, the paper reported, \u201cShe underwent two religious conversions, as a born-again Christian and as a Roman Catholic, and became in her last decades a staunch foe of abortion, vowing to undo Roe v. Wade, testifying in Congress and bitterly attacking Barack Obama when he ran for president and then re-election.\u201d\nNow in her death, abortion supporters want to twist her narrative to deny Christ and gain fuel for their evil movement that has killed millions of people in their most vulnerable state of life and caused a drastic birth dearth that is destroying civilization.\nMedia-wise consumers should use the documentary as an opportunity to practice discernment and recognize that what appears on screen is often a revisionist\u2019s take on true historical events.\n\u00a0\n\nNow more than ever we\u2019re bombarded by darkness in media, movies, and TV.
