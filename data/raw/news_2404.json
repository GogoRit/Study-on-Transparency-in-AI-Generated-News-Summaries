Bill Lee\u2019s wish to make Tennessee \u201cone of the most pro-life states in America,\u201d it is anything but.If every life is as \u201cprecious\u201d and the state has a \u201cresponsibility to protect it\u201d as Lee claims, he would not be failing to enact appropriate COVID-19 precautions throughout Tennessee, now a virus hot spot.He would not sign legislation banning access to necessary health care services like abortion, as he did on July 13.And he would go further than extending a reprieve through the end of the year to Harold Wayne Nichols, originally scheduled to be executed on Aug. 4, as he did on July 17. \u00a0Lee\u2019s stance on life is contradictoryHow can you say every life is precious, including a potential life in utero, yet electrocute a fellow human to death? The COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the health and welfare of nearly 7 million people living in Tennessee, has stalled Nichols\u2019 execution. But it has not stopped it. Yet Lee has the power to do so.As a moral philosopher and bioethicist, I am disappointed by the incoherence of Lee\u2019s policies. The Republican party has long chosen rhetoric over rationality in claiming a pro-life mantle for themselves, despite promoting an agenda incongruent with health-care justice, civil rights, and human rights. The only coherence in the policies Lee enacts and upholds, which deny Tennesseans basic goods necessary for life, and sometimes life itself, is their consistency with an illogical conservative agenda.Lee is not one of my students who I can coach toward better logic and more thoughtful arguments. But Harold Wayne Nichols is. For five years I have been an educator on Tennessee\u2019s death row.Almost six years ago, I had an abortion in Tennessee. Now Lee is going to tell me that I cannot self-determine my own health choices and terminate a pregnancy if necessary for my life and well-being. Yet Lee can, in the name of the state of Tennessee, allow adult humans to be terminated.I thought every life was precious, and the state has a responsibility to protect it.The governor should make use of his own policiesIn January Lee amended the clemency process as part of his criminal justice reform agenda. The intent was to make clemency, which could take the form of pardon, exoneration or commutation, more accessible to those incarcerated in Tennessee. To commute a sentence is not to remove guilt or responsibility. It is not a pardon or exoneration. It does not indicate forgiveness or remove blame. It changes the punishment associated with a guilty verdict, such as modifying a death sentence to life in prison.Hear more Tennessee Voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.To date, Lee has not commuted a single death sentence. Three men have been executed during his tenure as Governor. With two other executions already scheduled for early 2021, Nichols could be the fourth, fifth or sixth execution in Tennessee during Lee\u2019s governorship.Some will believe Nichols must die in order to respect his victim\u2019s life. Some will say I murdered an unborn baby. If this were true then every murder charge should be a capital charge, and I should be on death row right along with Nichols.Commute sentences of death row prisonersIf every life is precious, why not commute Nichols\u2019s sentence? And those of Byron Black and Oscar Franklin Smith, who have set execution dates as well?If Tennessee is to be among the most pro-life states in America, it must stop killing at the hands of the state, and it must stop infringing on the health and well-being of its women and girls.Elizabeth Lanphier, PhD, MS facilitates the REACH Coalition (reciprocal education and community healing) class at Riverbend Maximum Security Prison, composed of \u201cinsider\u201d incarcerated students and\u00a0\u201coutsider\u201d volunteer educators from across Nashville.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
