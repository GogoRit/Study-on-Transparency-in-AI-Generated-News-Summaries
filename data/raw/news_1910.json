The 1864 law that Hazelrigg wants the court to uphold imposes a near total ban on abortions, providing no exceptions for rape or incest and allowing abortions only if a mother\u2019s life is in danger.\n\nIn late December, the Arizona Court of Appeals said it wasn\u2019t viewing the pre-statehood law in isolation of other statutes and concluded the state\u2019s laws make it clear doctors are permitted to perform abortions. It said the 1864 law can coexist with the law that allows the procedure through the 15th week of pregnancy. Non-doctors would still be subject to prosecution under the old law, the appeals court said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep.

Wade decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to an abortion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned the landmark decision in June, then-Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich succeeded in getting a state judge in Tucson to lift a court order blocking its enforcement. In Hazelrigg\u2019s appeal, lawyers for the obstetrician said the court incorrectly concluded that the law doesn\u2019t apply to doctors. They argued Arizona\u2019s laws don\u2019t expressly allow abortion but rather forbid it. They are asking the state Supreme Court to lift the injunction that blocks enforcement of the pre-statehood law.\n\nLawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative advocacy group defending Hazelrigg, said the appeals court rewrote the law and did \u201cwith a pen what abortion proponents could not do with a vote.\u201dBrittany Fonteno, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Arizona, characterized Hazelrigg\u2019s appeal as a last-ditch effort. \u201cIn December 2022, the Arizona Court of Appeals correctly harmonized all of the state legislature\u2019s laws, and under that interpretation, abortion has been and continues to remain legal in Arizona,\u201d Fonteno said. \u201cAs we have said time and time again, this archaic abortion ban the intervener (Hazelrigg) is trying to revive is cruel, harmful, and unpopular with the majority of Arizonans.\u201dAbortion providers in Arizona halted all care in the state after Roe was struck down, restarted in mid-July after a \u201cpersonhood\u201d law giving legal rights to unborn children was blocked by a court, and stopped them again when the Tucson judge lifted an injunction on the 1864 law. Planned Parenthood restarted abortion care across the state after receiving a stay in their case and continued providing care after Brnovich\u2019s office agreed in another abortion lawsuit not to enforce the old law until litigation is resolved.Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes, who succeeded Brnovich, did not appeal the appeals court decision. ____ This story has been corrected to say Hazelrigg is seeking to uphold the law, not challenge it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJACQUES BILLEAUD\n\n\n                Billeaud is an Associated Press reporter who covers courts and law enforcement in Arizona.
