Here\u2019s what to expect.\t\t\n\n\t\t\tSenate Bill 20, now state law, goes into effect on July 1, curbing women\u2019s access to abortion and restricting health care providers ability to provide the procedure. \t\t\n\n\n\n\nby\nRachel Crumpler \nJune 30, 2023August 10, 2023 \nFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmail \n\n\n Overnight, abortion access will significantly diminish in North Carolina as the time frame for seeking most abortions drops from 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks starting July 1. The new law does provide some exceptions \u2014 for rape, incest, fetal anomalies and risk to the mother \u2014 that allow an abortion after 12 weeks. Credit: Rose Hoban\n\n\n\n\nBy Rachel Crumpler\nBeverly Gray, an OB-GYN at Duke Health who provides abortion care, expects that turning away people seeking abortions in North Carolina will be a daily occurrence beginning tomorrow, when the state\u2019s new restrictions passed by Republican lawmakers take effect.\nOvernight, abortion access will significantly diminish as the time frame for seeking most abortions in the state drops from 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks.\u00a0\nGray said cutting weeks of access in the state will make turning patients away from care \u2014 which already happened under the 20-week ban \u2014 more frequent.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s devastating to her, to her colleagues and to many women, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cI think about when we turn someone away, will they be able to make it to another state?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cAnd if they can\u2019t, what is their life going to be like? What is their child\u2019s life going to be like?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not lost on Gray why she will be turning more people away \u2014 timelines set by North Carolina lawmakers over the objections of medical professionals and a veto by Gov. Roy Cooper. Gray still has the same skills to help patients in an array of situations, but her hands will be newly tied \u2014 taking previously available options for reproductive health care off the table.\n\n\nAmy Bryant, another OB-GYN and abortion provider, knows the new North Carolina law will put care out of reach for many patients, such as a 17-year-old whom she treated a few weeks ago. The teen, who was just finishing high school, sought an abortion when she was 13 weeks and one day pregnant. Tomorrow, that patient would be left to carry the pregnancy to term or travel out of state.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just going to happen so much more,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfair.\u201d\nWhile most abortions occur before 12 weeks, Bryant said, there are plenty of scenarios when that\u2019s not possible. At least 1,878 North Carolinians obtained abortions after 12 weeks of\u00a0pregnancy in 2021 out of a total 27,305 who had abortions, according to the latest data available from the state health department.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s new law does provide some exceptions \u2014 for rape, incest, fetal anomalies and risk to the mother \u2014 that allow an abortion after 12 weeks. Still, Bryant said, some of the most vulnerable patients will be outside the window of care, such as teenagers with irregular periods who often identify pregnancy later, or those who need more time to pull resources together.\nGray has similar concerns about access to care.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of complex social reasons that impact why people need care,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI think a lot of those patients don\u2019t fall into the exceptions \u2014 patients who may be living in poverty, who are working multiple jobs, who already have kids, who have delays in care because they at baseline don\u2019t have access to health care.\u201d\nAs a result of the new restrictions, Bryant anticipates that North Carolina will face increased birth complications and elevated maternal and infant mortality rates \u2014 trends seen in other states with restrictive abortion policies.\n\u201cMy colleagues and I want to abide by the laws, and we want to provide the best possible care,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThere are times where that really does come into conflict, and it\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d\u00a0\nNew era of care\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision in June 2022 handed the authority to regulate abortion back to states and their elected officials, North Carolina providers working in reproductive health care have faced a challenging year navigating the shifting legal landscape. Tomorrow, they will enter a new era, adjusting their practices to conform to the added constraints on their work.\nIn addition to cutting by eight weeks the time window allowed for most abortions, lawmakers placed more requirements on women seeking abortions and on their providers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the biggest changes is requiring an in-person appointment for state-mandated counseling at least 72 hours before an abortion. Previously, this pre-procedure counseling could occur over the phone or online. Gray said for patients and providers, this will be one of the most difficult requirements to adjust to and, she emphasized, it\u2019s not medically necessary.\nAs a result, patients will be required to visit clinics at least twice \u2014 many needing to travel long distances to reach one of the state\u2019s 14 abortion clinics spread over nine counties. The additional appointment will necessitate extra time off work, miles driven, hotel stays and child care costs.\n\n\u201cWe expect that to be a significant barrier for many patients, and probably an insurmountable one,\u201d Molly Rivera, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic spokesperson, told NC Health News in May. \u201cEspecially for folks in rural parts of the state who have to already drive hours to get to an abortion clinic. Especially for folks that don't have paid time off of work. Especially for people who already have kids at home.\u201d\nFor providers and clinics, adding an extra appointment to an already busy workload will create another layer of complexity to scheduling. There also are new reporting requirements that physicians say will be burdensome.\n\u201cI would rather spend that time with my patient and their family,\u201d said Caledonia Buckheit, an OB-GYN in the Triangle. \u201cI don't want my time and effort to be towards paperwork and legal \u2014 these things that are not patient-centered.\u201d\nSeveral other provisions in Senate Bill 20 are being challenged by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and Gray in a lawsuit that was filed June 16 in U.S. District Court. The health care providers argue that specific provisions are so vague or contradictory that doctors are uncertain about what\u2019s lawful.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, lawmakers at the General Assembly revised several of the challenged abortion provisions this week by passing amendments to a separate bill. For example, one revision clarified that medication abortions are permitted up to 12 weeks in the state.\u00a0Previously, language in Senate Bill 20 stated in one place that the age of the fetus could be \u201cno more than 70 days,\u201d or 10 weeks. \nGov. Cooper signed the revised provisions into law Thursday afternoon, less than 48 hours before the new restrictions take effect.\n\"In addition to being dangerous for women, the rushed abortion ban was so poorly written that it is causing real uncertainty for doctors and other health care providers,\u201d Cooper wrote in a statement about signing House Bill 190. \u201cThis bill is important to clarify the rules and provide some certainty, however we will continue fighting on all fronts the Republican assault on women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\"\nAt a federal court hearing for the lawsuit heard in Greensboro on Wednesday, the plaintiffs and defendants agreed that the new language resolves issues with several provisions. However, the passage does not resolve the entirety of the lawsuit. The remaining differences likely will be addressed through future legal proceedings.\n \n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nFirst Name Email*\n\nZip Code* NameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur lawsuit was never going to be able to give North Carolinians the bodily autonomy that they deserve,\u201d Rivera said after the court hearing. \u201cThis law passed. It's happening. But we did come to the court to get clarity so that we know how to comply with this sweeping law so that we can help patients navigate this reality.\u201d\nOther portions of the bill, such as the mandate that any abortion after 12 weeks be provided in a hospital and the implementation of any new, potentially stringent licensing rules on the state\u2019s abortion clinics, will not go into effect until October.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\nread more coverage of abortion access\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat else grabbed your attention in 2023? North Carolina\u2019s top health topics. \n \nby Rachel Crumpler, Rose Hoban, Anne Blythe, Will Atwater and Charlotte Ledger \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccess to abortion fraught with more logistical challenges as patients confront increased restrictions \n \nby Rachel Crumpler \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNew numbers reveal ongoing impact of abortion restrictions, loss of access to care in NC \n \nby Rachel Crumpler \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow sick is sick enough?\nThe new law about abortion does provide some exceptions for rape, incest, fetal anomalies and risk to the mother that allow abortions later in pregnancy, but physicians have concerns about how workable those are in practice.\nLisa Carroll, a high-risk pregnancy OB-GYN worries about her patients \u2014 many of whom have chronic illnesses that are exacerbated by pregnancy. Many conditions are not immediately life-threatening, but pregnancy could cause long-term health risks.\nFor example, Carroll recently treated a pregnant patient with kidney disease. Carrying the pregnancy caused significant dysfunction to the woman\u2019s kidneys, for which she required dialysis. Carroll had a long conversation about her options to continue the pregnancy or terminate. The patient chose to continue the pregnancy, but Carroll said she\u2019s unsure if the same situation presented next week would be considered life-threatening enough to meet the law\u2019s exception.\n\u2018Particular wording\u2019\nCarroll spends most of her time screening for and diagnosing fetal anomalies in pregnancies, and the law allows abortions up to 24 weeks in cases where a \u201clife-limiting\u201d anomaly is found.\u00a0\nMedical professionals have voiced concern over the phrase \u201clife-limiting\u201d anomaly, calling it broad and open to interpretation.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is life-limiting?\u201d Carroll asked. \u201cDoes that mean that the fetus isn't expected to live a month after birth? Isn't expected to live a year after birth? Isn't expected to live to the age of 10?\u201d\nRachel Veazey, a reproductive genetic counselor in the Triangle, agrees that \u201clife-limiting\u201d is ambiguous.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u200b\u200breally particular wording that, I think, is going to throw our field for a loop,\u201d Veazey said.\nVeazey explained that very few conditions are considered definitively lethal \u2014 or always causing a newborn baby to die. Many fetal anomalies are a spectrum that often catch expecting parents by surprise. Often, she said, they result in a child with such profound disabilities that their quality of life is severely diminished.\u00a0\n\u201cWith a lot of families, we end up having conversations about quality of life versus life-limiting,\u201d Veazey said. \u201cThere's a lot of anomalies or genetic conditions that very much alter the picture of what families imagine when they enter into a pregnancy that is not compatible with their life, and they would view it as life-limiting. But we know that's not what the rough definition of what the law is going for.\u201d\n\u2018Counseling conundrum\u2019\nIn some ways, though, Carroll said not having a definitive list of conditions is helpful because individual physicians and health care institutions can determine what they are comfortable deeming life-limiting based on the context of each individual case.\nOperating in this gray area is also problematic, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is good to allow for physician judgment, but the problem is that physician judgment is now open to criminalization,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIf there are other physicians who disagree, or who say that it's not life-limiting, or it's not life-limiting in all cases, or wasn't life-limiting in that particular case \u2014 then I may be criminalized for that individual judgment.\u00a0\n\u201cThat is not something that is normal or appropriate or fair in the practice of medicine, and it may lead physicians to be counseling patients based not on the patient's best interest or the fetus\u2019 best interest.\u201d\nVeazey said the patients she counsels with identified fetal anomalies regularly choose to terminate the pregnancy. While she expects a good portion of fetal anomalies to be detected by 24 weeks, it will not encompass all conditions, nor necessarily account for those who are delayed starting prenatal care or who face delays due to the state\u2019s new abortion restrictions. That\u2019s why she believes her job may become more focused on grief counseling in the months ahead as she sees more patients who may be carrying pregnancies to term who would have \u2014 in a different legal landscape \u2014 opted for abortion.\n\u201cA lot of the conversations we have with families that are continuing with pregnancy are helping them understand what the health care management looks like for that child or individual with a birth defect or genetic condition,\u201d Veazey said. \u201cImagining doing that with or for someone who wouldn't have on their own volition decided to continue a pregnancy is a different kind of counseling.\u201d\nAlthough medical professionals see potential ambiguity with other conditions, the law does make one thing clear in regard to fetal anomalies: New language bans abortions at any gestational age due to the identification of the fetal abnormality of trisomy 21, known as Down syndrome \u2014 one of the most common genetic differences in a human embryo.\n\u201cIt's going to create a very strange counseling conundrum for high-risk OB doctors, for all general providers, anybody who provides prenatal care,\u201d Carroll said.\nLoss of options\nTomorrow North Carolina will join the ranks of about 20 other states across the country that have banned or increasingly restricted abortion access since Dobbs. Before this legal change, the state served as one of the last remaining abortion access points in the South.\n\nIn states with new restrictions, there were fewer abortions, while the numbers show that many women traveled to other states for procedures. In sum, though, the Society for Family Planning has collected data on abortions across the country and found that in the first nine months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, there were a cumulative 25,640 fewer abortions in the U.S.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe know that bans or restrictions on abortion care don't stop abortions from happening,\u201d Rivera from Planned Parenthood South Atlantic said. \u201cThey just make it harder for people to do it, which inevitably pushes them further into their pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cSo even a patient who has decided long ago that not only did they realize they were pregnant but they decided they didn't want to be, they are not able to get an abortion right away. They first have to figure out whether or not they can get it in their home state. And if they learn that they cannot, they have to figure out where to get it next. And that's complicated.\u201d\u00a0\nGray wishes that lawmakers would trust women to make their own reproductive health decisions.\n\u201cPatients are really the experts of their lives, and they know what they're able to handle and not able to handle,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI think they make really thoughtful decisions, and this law makes it harder for them to be thoughtful. It makes it harder for us to provide evidence-based care and just creates chaos for an already busy and taxed medical system. It doesn't improve care.\u201d\n\n\n\nTell us your story about abortion access\nNC Health News will be continuing to cover the effects of increased abortion restrictions in the months ahead and the best way for us to do that is with your help \u2014 hearing concrete examples of how you are navigating the new law.

Still, Bryant said, some of the most vulnerable patients will be outside the window of care, such as teenagers with irregular periods who often identify pregnancy later, or those who need more time to pull resources together.</p>\n<p>Gray has similar concerns about access to care.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of complex social reasons that impact why people need care,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI think a lot of those patients don't fall into the exceptions \u2014 patients who may be living in poverty, who are working multiple jobs, who already have kids, who have delays in care because they at baseline don't have access to health care.\u201d</p>\n<p>As a result of the new restrictions, Bryant anticipates that North Carolina will face increased birth complications and elevated maternal and infant mortality rates \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/dec/us-maternal-health-divide-limited-services-worse-outcomes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trends seen in other states with restrictive abortion policies</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy colleagues and I want to abide by the laws, and we want to provide the best possible care,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThere are times where that really does come into conflict, and it's gotten worse.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New era of care</strong></h4>\n<p>Since the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Dobbs</em> decision in June 2022 handed the authority to regulate abortion back to states and their elected officials, North Carolina providers <a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2023/06/23/after-the-fall-of-roe-physicians-confronted-their-toughest-year-working-in-reproductive-health-care/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working in reproductive health care have faced a challenging year</a> navigating the shifting legal landscape. Tomorrow, they will enter a new era, adjusting their practices to conform to the added constraints on their work.</p>\n<p>In addition to cutting by eight weeks the time window allowed for most abortions, lawmakers placed more requirements on women seeking abortions and on their providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes is requiring an in-person appointment for state-mandated counseling at least 72 hours before an abortion. Previously, this pre-procedure counseling could occur over the phone or online. Gray said for patients and providers, this will be one of the most difficult requirements to adjust to and, she emphasized, it\u2019s not medically necessary.</p>\n<p>As a result, patients will be required to visit clinics at least twice \u2014 many needing to travel long distances to reach one of the state\u2019s 14 abortion clinics spread over nine counties. The additional appointment will necessitate extra time off work, miles driven, hotel stays and child care costs.</p>\n<p>!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();</p>\n<p>\u201cWe expect that to be a significant barrier for many patients, and probably an insurmountable one,\u201d Molly Rivera, <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-south-atlantic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Planned Parenthood South Atlantic</a> spokesperson, <a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2023/05/15/governor-stamps-veto-on-hastily-passed-new-abortion-restrictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told NC Health News</a> in May. \u201cEspecially for folks in rural parts of the state who have to already drive hours to get to an abortion clinic. Especially for folks that don't have paid time off of work. Especially for people who already have kids at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>For providers and clinics, adding an extra appointment to an already busy workload will create another layer of complexity to scheduling. There also are new reporting requirements that physicians say will be burdensome.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would rather spend that time with my patient and their family,\u201d said Caledonia Buckheit, an OB-GYN in the Triangle. \u201cI don't want my time and effort to be towards paperwork and legal \u2014 these things that are not patient-centered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Several other provisions in <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-south-atlantic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Senate Bill 20</a> are being challenged by <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-south-atlantic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Planned Parenthood South Atlantic</a> and Gray in a lawsuit that was filed June 16 in <a href=\"https://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. District Court</a>. The health care providers argue that specific provisions are so vague or contradictory that doctors are uncertain about what\u2019s lawful.</p>\n<p>After the lawsuit was filed, lawmakers at the General Assembly revised several of the challenged abortion provisions this week by passing amendments to a <a href=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/h190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">separate bill</a>. For example, one revision clarified that medication abortions are permitted up to 12 weeks in the state.&nbsp;Previously, language in Senate Bill 20 stated in one place that the age of the fetus could be \u201cno more than 70 days,\u201d or 10 weeks. </p>\n<p>Gov. Cooper <a href=\"https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2023/06/29/governor-cooper-signs-bill-law#:~:text=Governor%20Cooper%20made%20the%20following,and%20other%20health%20care%20providers.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">signed</a> the revised provisions into law Thursday afternoon, less than 48 hours before the new restrictions take effect.</p>\n<p>\"In addition to being dangerous for women, the rushed abortion ban was so poorly written that it is causing real uncertainty for doctors and other health care providers,\u201d Cooper wrote in a statement about signing House Bill 190. \u201cThis bill is important to clarify the rules and provide some certainty, however we will continue fighting on all fronts the Republican assault on women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\"</p>\n<p>At a federal court hearing for the lawsuit heard in Greensboro on Wednesday, the plaintiffs and defendants agreed that the new language resolves issues with several provisions. However, the passage does not resolve the entirety of the lawsuit. The remaining differences likely will be addressed through future legal proceedings.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur lawsuit was never going to be able to give North Carolinians the bodily autonomy that they deserve,\u201d Rivera said after the court hearing. \u201cThis law passed. It's happening. But we did come to the court to get clarity so that we know how to comply with this sweeping law so that we can help patients navigate this reality.\u201d</p>\n<p>Other portions of the bill, such as the mandate that any abortion after 12 weeks be provided in a hospital and the implementation of any new, potentially stringent licensing rules on the state\u2019s abortion clinics, will not go into effect until October.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-secondary-background-color has-background\"> </div>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How sick is sick enough?</strong></h4>\n<p>The new law about abortion does provide some exceptions for rape, incest, fetal anomalies and risk to the mother that allow abortions later in pregnancy, but physicians have concerns about how workable those are in practice.</p>\n<p>Lisa Carroll, a high-risk pregnancy OB-GYN worries about her patients \u2014 many of whom have chronic illnesses that are exacerbated by pregnancy. Many conditions are not immediately life-threatening, but pregnancy could cause long-term health risks.</p>\n<p>For example, Carroll recently treated a pregnant patient with kidney disease. Carrying the pregnancy caused significant dysfunction to the woman\u2019s kidneys, for which she required dialysis. Carroll had a long conversation about her options to continue the pregnancy or terminate. The patient chose to continue the pregnancy, but Carroll said she\u2019s unsure if the same situation presented next week would be considered life-threatening enough to meet the law\u2019s exception.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>\u2018Particular wording\u2019</strong></h4>\n<p>Carroll spends most of her time screening for and diagnosing fetal anomalies in pregnancies, and the law allows abortions up to 24 weeks in cases where a \u201clife-limiting\u201d anomaly is found.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Medical professionals have voiced concern over the phrase \u201clife-limiting\u201d anomaly, calling it broad and open to interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is life-limiting?\u201d Carroll asked. \u201cDoes that mean that the fetus isn't expected to live a month after birth? Isn't expected to live a year after birth? Isn't expected to live to the age of 10?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rachel Veazey, a reproductive genetic counselor in the Triangle, agrees that \u201clife-limiting\u201d is ambiguous.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u200b\u200breally particular wording that, I think, is going to throw our field for a loop,\u201d Veazey said.</p>\n<p>Veazey explained that very few conditions are considered definitively lethal \u2014 or always causing a newborn baby to die. Many fetal anomalies are a spectrum that often catch expecting parents by surprise. Often, she said, they result in a child <a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2021/06/08/disability-groups-struggle-to-respond-to-latest-abortion-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with such profound disabilities</a> that their quality of life is severely diminished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a lot of families, we end up having conversations about quality of life versus life-limiting,\u201d Veazey said. \u201cThere's a lot of anomalies or genetic conditions that very much alter the picture of what families imagine when they enter into a pregnancy that is not compatible with their life, and they would view it as life-limiting. But we know that's not what the rough definition of what the law is going for.\u201d</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>\u2018Counseling conundrum\u2019</strong></h4>\n<p>In some ways, though, Carroll said not having a definitive list of conditions is helpful because individual physicians and health care institutions can determine what they are comfortable deeming life-limiting based on the context of each individual case.</p>\n<p>Operating in this gray area is also problematic, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is good to allow for physician judgment, but the problem is that physician judgment is now open to criminalization,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIf there are other physicians who disagree, or who say that it's not life-limiting, or it's not life-limiting in all cases, or wasn't life-limiting in that particular case \u2014 then I may be criminalized for that individual judgment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not something that is normal or appropriate or fair in the practice of medicine, and it may lead physicians to be counseling patients based not on the patient's best interest or the fetus\u2019 best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Veazey said the patients she counsels with identified fetal anomalies regularly choose to terminate the pregnancy. While she expects a good portion of fetal anomalies to be detected by 24 weeks, it will not encompass all conditions, nor necessarily account for those who are delayed starting prenatal care or who face delays due to the state\u2019s new abortion restrictions. That\u2019s why she believes her job may become more focused on grief counseling in the months ahead as she sees more patients who may be carrying pregnancies to term who would have \u2014 in a different legal landscape \u2014 opted for abortion.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of the conversations we have with families that are continuing with pregnancy are helping them understand what the health care management looks like for that child or individual with a birth defect or genetic condition,\u201d Veazey said. \u201cImagining doing that with or for someone who wouldn't have on their own volition decided to continue a pregnancy is a different kind of counseling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although medical professionals see potential ambiguity with other conditions, the law does make one thing clear in regard to fetal anomalies: New language bans abortions at any gestational age due to the identification of the fetal abnormality of trisomy 21, known as Down syndrome \u2014 one of the most common genetic differences in a human embryo.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's going to create a very strange counseling conundrum for high-risk OB doctors, for all general providers, anybody who provides prenatal care,\u201d Carroll said.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Loss of options</strong></h4>\n<p>Tomorrow North Carolina will join the ranks of about 20 other states across the country that have banned or increasingly restricted abortion access since Dobbs. Before this legal change, the state served as one of the last remaining <a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2022/08/08/how-long-will-north-carolina-remain-an-abortion-access-point/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">abortion access points in the South</a>.</p>\n<p>In states with new restrictions, there were fewer abortions, while the numbers show that many women traveled to other states for procedures. In sum, though, the <a href=\"https://societyfp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Society for Family Planning</a> has collected <a href=\"https://societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WeCountReport_6.12.23.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">data on abortions</a> across the country and found that in the first nine months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, there were a cumulative 25,640 fewer abortions in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that bans or restrictions on abortion care don't stop abortions from happening,\u201d Rivera from Planned Parenthood South Atlantic said. \u201cThey just make it harder for people to do it, which inevitably pushes them further into their pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSo even a patient who has decided long ago that not only did they realize they were pregnant but they decided they didn't want to be, they are not able to get an abortion right away. They first have to figure out whether or not they can get it in their home state. And if they learn that they cannot, they have to figure out where to get it next. And that's complicated.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gray wishes that lawmakers would trust women to make their own reproductive health decisions.</p>\n<p>\u201cPatients are really the experts of their lives, and they know what they're able to handle and not able to handle,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI think they make really thoughtful decisions, and this law makes it harder for them to be thoughtful. It makes it harder for us to provide evidence-based care and just creates chaos for an already busy and taxed medical system. It doesn't improve care.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-secondary-background-color has-background\"> </div>\n\n\n This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2023/06/30/ncs-new-abortion-restrictions-take-effect-tomorrow/\">article</a> first appeared on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org\">North Carolina Health News</a> and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-favicon02.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:1em;height:1em;margin-left:10px;\"><img id=\"republication-tracker-tool-source\" src=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/?republication-pixel=true&post=48430\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\">\n Copy to Clipboard\n1\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTagged: abortion,\u00a0abortion access,\u00a0abortion rights,\u00a0Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization,\u00a0fetal anomalies,\u00a0Gov.
