from the Lone Star State after a six-week ban went into effect in September, the organization said Thursday. \n    \n\n            Colorado and Oklahoma clinics saw some of the biggest surges in Texas abortion seekers, the organization said. Between September 1 and December 31, 2021, abortion patients with Texas zip codes made up more than half the total number of patients at Oklahoma Planned Parenthood clinics, in what was a 2500% increase in Texas traffic to those facilities. Texas patients amounted to less than 10% in Oklahoma clinics the same time the year before.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abortion pill known as RU-486, seen here as Mifeprex.\n\nNewsmakers/Getty Images/FILE\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMedication abortion now makes up the majority of US abortions, study shows, as states push to restrict it\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cOklahoma alone cannot begin to absorb the number of patients fleeing Texas for abortion care,\u201d Planned Parenthood-Great Plains medical director Iman Alsaden told reporters Thursday, while noting that Oklahoma lawmakers are considering a Texas-like ban themselves.\n    \n\n            \u201cBanning abortion doesn\u2019t stop people from needing abortion,\u201d Alsaden said.\n    \n\n            The new data \u2013 which also included clinics in, New Mexico, Kansas and Missouri \u2013 was released after the Texas Supreme Court heard oral arguments about Texas law, known as SB8. The justices are not considering at this time whether to block the law, but rather are weighing in \u2013 at the request of a federal appeals court \u2013 on a procedural question that has arisen in the federal lawsuit the clinics brought against the six-week ban. \n    \n\n            With the law, Texas employed a novel enforcement mechanism that has allowed the ban to stay in force \u2013 even in the face of Supreme Court precedent protecting abortion rights through viability, a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy. \n    \n\n            Rather than impose criminal or administrative penalties on clinics that violate the ban, the legislature gave private citizens anywhere in the country the right to sue, in state court, providers or anyone else who facilitates an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. \n    \n\n            The threat of that litigation has been enough to stop Texas clinics from offering the procedure after that point, which is around six weeks into the pregnancy and before many people realize their pregnant. \n    \n\n            With abortion now inaccessible for many Texans in their state, they\u2019ve traveled out of state to obtain the procedure instead. This surge has in turn impacted the residents of neighboring states by straining resources at clinics.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas State Capitol is seen on the first day of the 87th Legislature's third special session on September 20, 2021 in Austin, Texas. \n\nTamir Kalifa/Getty Images/FILE\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhat to know about 6 other statewide jobs on Texas' midterm ballot\n\n\n\n\n            Patients are having to wait a month to book abortion appointments at the Hope Medical Group for Women facility in Shreveport, Louisiana, according to the clinic\u2019s administrator, Kathaleen Pittman.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe are seeing women who are coming to us from Texas \u2013 even from Louisiana \u2013 who are later in the pregnancy,\u201d she told reporters Thursday, adding that her clinic used to specialize in terminating early pregnancies. \u201cWe are seeing very few early pregnancies these days for termination because it\u2019s taking so long for everyone to get in.\u201d\n    \n\n            Texans made up 18% of her clinics patients before the six-week ban and by October, made up 55%; now they\u2019re 64% of the clinic\u2019s patients.\n    \n\n            Planned Parenthood clinics in Colorado saw a more than 1000% increase, compared to previous years, in abortion patients with Texas zip codes between Sept. 1, 2021, and the end of the year, according to the new data. \n    \n\n            For New Mexico clinics, the increase was more than 100%, Planned Parenthood said Thursday. \n    \n\n    Limited options for clinics in their federal court challenge\n\n\n            Thursday, Texas Supreme Court justices were scrutinizing the text of the law and what it says about state licensing officials\u2019 obligation to enforce the ban against clinics.\n    \n\n            In a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme Court said in December that clinics could not obtain federal court orders against state court officials to prevent them from presiding over litigation brought under the ban. The US Supreme Court let the lawsuit proceed against a handful of state licensing officials, but the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals has now asked the Texas Supreme Court to decide if those officials play enough of a role enforcing the law that would make it appropriate for federal courts to issue an order blocking them from carrying out aspects of the ban. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDALLAS, TEXAS - JULY 11: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC held at the Hilton Anatole on July 11, 2021 in Dallas, Texas.

They intend to seek a federal court order blocking state officials from implementing the ban.  \n    \n\n            Texas, in defending the ban, noted that Gorsuch\u2019s language was hedged and Texas is arguing that the Texas Supreme Court should have the final word on where such an order can be sought in federal court. \n    \n\n            In a statement after Thursday\u2019s hearing, Texas Right to Life spokesperson Kim Schwartz said the group believed that the clinics\u2019 case was \u201cinvalid\u201d and that it was \u201cconfident that the Texas Heartbeat Act will once again prevail against the abortion industry\u2019s attack.\u201d\n    \n\n            At the oral arguments Thursday, some Texas justices questioned whether they should second guess the US Supreme Court\u2019s view, with Justice Debra Lehrmann telling Texas\u2019 attorney that the US Supreme Court\u2019s read of the law is \u201ccertainly not something we\u2019re just going to thumb our nose at.\u201d \n    \n\n            Several other justices however suggested they were inclined to rule in Texas\u2019 favor. Justice Brett Busby said that if that court said the licensing officials didn\u2019t play a role in a ban, it would give the clinics the same relief they were pursuing in federal court. \n

you get there,\u201d Busby suggested, prompting pushback from the clinics\u2019 lawyer Marc Hearron.\n    \n\n            On the Thursday afternoon press call, Hearron, who is a senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said that if the Texas Supreme Court ruled against the clinics, it would effectively end their challenge to the law in federal court.\n    \n\n            But even if the clinics were to succeed and secure federal court orders against the state officials, that would only stop those officials from disciplining clinics for violating the ban.\n    \n\n            \u201cThat will not stop individuals from filing lawsuits under SB8,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not stop the bounty hunting scheme or fully restore abortion access across the state.\u201d\n
