State Rep. Phelps Anderson, who broke ranks with his party in the vote last week on a 1969 bill that criminalizes abortion, has changed his voter registration to a \u201cdeclined to state,\u201d House Minority Leader Jim Townsend confirmed [\u2026]\nSanta Fe New Mexican  \nA Roswell Republican who voted in favor of repealing an antiquated anti-abortion law has left the GOP.\nState Rep. Phelps Anderson, who broke ranks with his party in the vote last week on a 1969 bill that criminalizes abortion, has changed his voter registration to a \u201cdeclined to state,\u201d House Minority Leader Jim Townsend confirmed Friday.\n\u201cI received a letter from him, and I have had a conversation with him, and he has left the Republican Party,\u201d Townsend said.\nAnderson\u00a0declined a request for an interview. \u201cSorry,\u201d he wrote in a text message late Friday. \u201cNot today as I have done enough.\u201d\nAnderson, 69, who represents portions of the conservative Chaves, Lea and Roosevelt counties, sided with seven Democrats on the House Health and Human Services Committee in voting to repeal the abortion ban.\nHis vote drew criticism from his constituents, as well as calls for his resignation.\n\u201cHe had told me earlier in the week that he thought he had become a distraction to the party \u2014 this wasn\u2019t because he was mad at the party\u00a0\u2014 it was because he thought he has become a distraction to the party,\u201d said Townsend, who also said he had received about 100 calls about Anderson on Friday.\nThe repeal of the abortion bill, which makes it a felony to perform an abortion in New Mexico, has been a divisive issue among lawmakers.\nIt went to the Senate floor in 2019 but failed when eight moderate and conservative-leaning Democrats joined all 16 Republican senators in voting to keep the law on the books.\nWith six of those Democrats no longer in office, five of whom lost their primary races in June to more progressive candidates who made the anti-abortion law a major campaign issue, the repeal is expected to head to the desk of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this year. And the governor, who made the repeal one of her top legislative priorities, is expected to give it her approval.\nThe current New Mexico statute is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that found overly restrictive state government regulations of abortion unconstitutional. But proponents of the bill expressed urgency in repealing the measure amid concerns the U.S. Supreme Court will weaken or overturn the ruling with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett giving conservatives a wide majority on the bench.\nReaction to Anderson switching from Republican to \u201cdeclined to state\u201d generated mixed reactions.\n\u201cRep. Anderson, straight up, is and has always been a decent man,\u201d Rep. Angelica Rubio, D-Las Cruces, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit, and says so much about who he is.\u201d\nIn an email, John Block, who founded the conservative news website Pi\u00f1on Post, wrote that Anderson\u2019s \u201cvote against human life in the womb is why his constituents forced him to relinquish his standing with the Republican Party.\u201d\n\u201cHe must now resign and allow local leaders to fill his seat with someone who truly represents the 66th District,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe time for wishy-washy, and unreliable \u2018Republicans\u2019 in the House is over.\u201d\nAnderson\u2019s decision to leave the GOP comes after Republicans gained a seat in the state House of Representatives after the November general election. But they are still outnumbered by Democrats nearly 2-to-1.\n\u201cWe were 24 members last year and we\u2019re 24 members again right now,\u201d Townsend said.\nDespite Anderson\u2019s departure, Townsend said House Republicans remain \u201cvery united.\u201d\n\u201cWould we have rather that Phelps stayed on board?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nTownsend said he\u2019s known Anderson for many years. According to Anderson\u2019s legislative biography, he served as a representative from 1977 to 1980 and has served again in the House since 2019.\n\u201cWhen the dust settles over this, he\u2019ll still be a friend of mine, whether he continues or resigns or whatever he does,\u201d\u00a0Townsend said. \u201cPhelps was a friend of mine before this all started, and Phelps will be a friend of mine when this is all over with.\u201d\nWhen the Republican caucus spoke about Anderson changing his party affiliation, Townsend said \u201cevery one of them spoke highly\u201d of Anderson.\n We're ad freeThat means that we rely on support from readers like you.
