After that, it was another hour-long taxi to Manchester. An eleven hour journey one way, it was exhausting. It was also the only option.\nUntil April 9, 2020 when the Department of Health (DoH) signalled that local health trusts could carry out abortion services, numerous women in Northern Ireland had to undertake these types of journeys to England, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, to terminate their pregnancies.\nWith flights cancelled and largely ceasing from Northern Ireland, a freight ferry transporting cargo was the last remaining reliable option. The delay in providing an abortion service in Northern Ireland \u2013 which the country was supposed to have by March 31 \u2013 demonstrates how contested the issue still is here.\nIn a report issued two weeks ago by the House of Lords, Northern Ireland\u2019s Attorney General John Larkin, who is pro-life, said the provision allowing abortion in Northern Ireland was inappropriate and that in imposing the regulations, the Secretary of State had exceeded his powers.\nHe wrote that \u201cthe relevant judgement call is best made by a local legislature\u201d.\nIn the last nine months, the conversation around abortion in Northern Ireland has shifted dramatically. Just last summer, the country possessed some of the harshest abortion laws in Europe. Today, activists are calling for Northern Ireland to follow England, Scotland and Wales, and allow telemedicine for at home abortions in light of COVID-19.\n\u201cGenerally there is a strong conservativism in Northern Irish society to do with sex and sexual health,\u201d said Dr Fiona Bloomer, a lecturer in social policy at Ulster University. \u201cReligiosity still has a hold over society.\u201d\nThe 1967 Abortion Act, which allowed for abortion in England, Scotland and Wales, did not include Northern Ireland, where abortion remained illegal except when a woman\u2019s life was at risk. Rape, incest, and fatal foetal abnormality were not sufficient grounds for abortion.\nThe United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) had said multiple times that restrictive abortion laws in Northern Ireland were in breach of the UK\u2019s international human rights obligations.\nIn 2018, then vice-chair of CEDAW, Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, said Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws at the time constituted \u201cviolence against women that may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u201d.\nIn July 2019, Members of Parliament voted for legislation which required the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution was not restored by October 21, 2019.\nAs Stormont was not functioning until January 2020, the DoH was then supposed to make abortion services routinely available in Northern Ireland by March 31, 2020.\nThat, however, did not happen.\nThough the law technically came into effect, services were not rolled out at the time. Guidelines to healthcare professionals who were ready to perform abortions were not issued.\nWhen asked why services were unavailable, the DoH issued a statement, which said: \u201cThe emergence of COVID-19 means that arrangement now needs reviewed. The minister is currently considering this urgently. Given the significance and sensitivity of the issue, it will be a decision for the Executive.\u201d\nUlster University lecturer, Fiona Bloomer, told The Detail she believed the COVID-19 crisis allowed the government to slow down and obstruct abortion access.\nNaomi Connor, the co-convenor of Alliance for Choice, the largest pro-choice group in the north, pointed to other medical services that were quickly made available in light of COVID-19.\nShe said: \u201cAt this point in time, our view is that it isn\u2019t a lack of service or provision. It\u2019s the lack of political will.\u201d\nMs Connor told The Detail her group had been inundated with an unprecedented number of calls after the COVID-19 lockdown. She estimated that in just two weeks of the lockdown alone pro-choice organisations in Northern Ireland had received over one hundred calls from pregnant women in Northern Ireland seeking abortions.\nShe also said that Alliance for Choice had received notice of multiple women in Northern Ireland, who after being refused abortions in the first few weeks of lockdown, attempted to take their own lives.\nLiz Parsons, the head of advocacy for Life, a British pro-life charity, told The Detail that her organisation was also receiving an unprecedented number of calls from pregnant women in the UK \u2013 over a hundred percent higher this time than in March 2019 \u2013 for listening and counselling services.\n\n\nPro-life demonstrators outside Stormont in November 2019.

After the British Pregnancy Advisory Service charity announced it would send abortion pills to women in Northern Ireland on the morning of April 9, the DoH issued a statement that afternoon that \u201cregistered medical professionals in Northern Ireland may now terminate pregnancies lawfully\u201d.\nThough the service is now available, multiple individuals we interviewed said that there is confusion and a lack of information about where abortion services are currently operating. There have been multiple cases where GPs have told women that they were unsure where women can access abortion services.\nMs Connor, from Alliance for Choice, said that one woman reported that she had asked her GP, just outside of Belfast, about abortion services, but he responded that he would only help if she decided to continue the pregnancy and refused to refer her to an abortion provider.\nAccording to the legal framework for abortion services published in March 2020, services are supposed to be offered in GP premises, and at Health and Social Care (HSC) trust clinics and hospitals.\nWhile the DoH attributed the delay in service provision to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fiona Bloomer, the academic at Ulster University who has written extensively on abortion access, said Health Minister Robin Swann had \u201cshirked his responsibilities\u201d by first failing to issue abortion guidelines and then pushing the issue to the Executive.\nShe said: \u201cI obviously recognise he (was) dealing with the immense responsibility of the COVID crisis, but this is part of the COVID crisis. By not taking action he forced women to take actions which are just not practical.\u201d\nMs Connor and Dr Bloomer, as well as Jill McManus, the Northern Ireland representative for Doctors for Choice UK, told The Detail that Alliance for Choice had repeatedly requested to meet with Robin Swann since his appointment as Health Minister in January, but were never granted a meeting.\nAlliance for Choice\u2019s Naomi Connor said that her organisation had written to Mr Swann over five times since the emergence of COVID-19 and received one response, but no agreement for a meeting.\nWhen asked about these issues, the DoH referred the Detail to the prior statement issued on April 9 that abortion would now be accessible, but did not directly respond to the question about meetings with Alliance for Choice and said it \u201chad nothing further to add\u201d.\nMatthew O\u2019Toole, an MLA for South Belfast who is a member of the SDLP, told The Detail that while he is pro-choice, he wouldn\u2019t criticise Robin Swann, who he said has \u201ca lot on his plate\u201d due to COVID-19.\nHe added that he was pleased that the DUP was unable to thwart the change in law.\nCarla Lockhart, DUP MP for Upper Bann, said the changes to Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws were a \u201cbadly drafted, ill-thought through proposal\u201d.\nSince the DoH approved abortions in Northern Ireland, the conversation has shifted from whether abortions will take place in hospitals to whether telemedicine abortions will be allowed.\nTelemedicine abortion, which has already been introduced in the rest of the UK in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, allows a woman in the early pregnancy period to take abortion pills at home after a remote consultation with a physician.\nDame Lesley Regan, Professor and Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Imperial College London and the former President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told The Detail that Westminister granted the provision to allow for telemedicine abortion so that women would not have to travel to clinics and potentially be exposed to the virus or transmit it to healthcare workers.\n\u201cThe vast majority...of all abortions are early and occur at or before 10 weeks of gestation,\u201d she said. \u201cThose pregnancies are usually very eligible to be dealt with medically so there is no necessity to go into an operating theater and have an operation. It is a question of taking two tablets.\u201d\nMatthew O\u2019Toole, the pro-choice SDLP MLA whose party has many anti-abortion representatives, said that he would be in favor of allowing telemedicine abortions in Northern Ireland given the current circumstances.\nWhen asked if he would support telemedicine abortions after the COVID-19 pandemic, he said he \u201cdid not have a detailed enough view on it,\u201d but would not be opposed to it in principle.\nPro-life campaigners have remained resolutely against telemedicine abortion services.\nLiz Parsons, of the pro-life charity Life, said that the notion that Northern Ireland would go from largely restricting abortion access a year ago to providing telemedicine abortions is \u201cunconsionable\u201d.\nDUP MP Carla Lockhart said: \u201cWe are fully aware of the many issues which the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is causing. However, we do not believe this crisis necessitates such a radical step as allowing for telemedicine abortions here. It is not the right way forward for women or for unborn children.\u201d\nIn response, social policy lecturer, Fiona Bloomer, said the DUP \u201cuses this symbolism of British identity that is important to them in so many aspects apart from the issue of abortion, and that\u2019s where the localised opinion dominates more than national policy\u201d.\nAdvocates for abortion services, as well as physicians, have stressed that telemedicine abortions are in fact quite safe.\nThe World Health Organization has listed both mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 the two medications used to induce abortions \u2013 on its list of essential medicines. It has also endorsed self-management of abortion at home in areas where women have a source of accurate information and access to a healthcare provider should they want it.\n\u201cI am not asking anyone who doesn\u2019t believe in abortion to have one,\u201d said Imperial College London\u2019s Dr. Regan. \u201cIrrespective of the COVID-19 lockdown we must continue to provide this care, otherwise we will certainly see tragedies.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nReceive The Detail\nstory alerts by email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\u2191\nTop\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew figures raise concerns over accuracy of COVID-19 care home death numbers\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeknife: Kenova team got access to millions of intelligence documents withheld from other inquiries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive The Detail story alerts by email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nReporters\nThe Detail Network\n\n\nThe Detail, 2nd Floor Callender House\n58-60 Upper Arthur Street, Belfast, BT1 4GJ\nTelephone + 44 28 9031 5930\n\n\n\u00a9 2011 - 2024 The Detail TV.
