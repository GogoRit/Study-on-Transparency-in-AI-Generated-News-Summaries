Here\u2019s her logic: If Jesus didn\u2019t mention the unborn, then they didn\u2019t matter to him. And if they didn\u2019t matter to him, they shouldn\u2019t matter to us.\n\nThere are actually three fatal flaws in this approach. First, even if it is true that Jesus didn\u2019t say anything about the unborn (and we don\u2019t actually know that), nothing logically follows from it. We certainly cannot conclude\u2014as Pam Keith implies\u2014that the unborn didn\u2019t matter to Jesus. That\u2019s a textbook example of a fallacious argument from silence.\n\nSecond, Jesus clearly did say a lot about the authority of the Old Testament. And the Old Testament affirms the value and dignity of human beings before they are born. Therefore it\u2019s reasonable to think Jesus would affirm their dignity and value, too.\n\nThird, in the New Testament, even Jesus and John are treated as themselves\u2014genuine, complete, valuable human beings\u2014while they are still in utero.\n\nTranscript\nIn today\u2019s example, pro-choice proponent Pam Keith tries to correct pro-life Christians by appealing to something Jesus supposedly didn\u2019t say. Here\u2019s the tweet: \u201cIn the Gospels, Jesus speaks often about how to treat people. He covers a lot of turf on the sick, the lepers, the afflicted, the poor, widows, daughters, sons, tax collectors, travelers, strangers, learned men, fools, the old and the young. But not one word about the unborn.\u201d\nPam seems to think that Jesus\u2019 apparent silence is significant. In a follow-up tweet, she says, \u201cIf they were important to him, at least one of the Gospels would reflect it.\u201d Here\u2019s her logic: If Jesus didn\u2019t mention the unborn, then they didn\u2019t matter to him. And if they didn\u2019t matter to him, then they shouldn\u2019t matter to us. You know what we gotta do, right?\nThere are actually three fatal flaws in Pam\u2019s approach. First, let\u2019s just assume Pam is right and Jesus never said anything about the unborn. What then can we conclude about Jesus\u2019 view of the unborn? The answer\u2019s simple. Nothing. Zip. Zero. Nada. Think about it. The historical record is also silent on Jesus\u2019 view of slavery, sex trafficking, spousal abuse, child abuse, drug use, sexual assault, systemic racism, and gay bashing. Should we take his silence on these issues to mean that they didn\u2019t matter to him?\nAlso, there\u2019s a big difference between the record being silent about Jesus\u2019 opinion on something and Jesus being silent about it. Remember, there are many things that Jesus said and did that just weren\u2019t written down. John tells us that.\nAnd by the way, we shouldn\u2019t expect Jesus to weigh in on every moral issue. His primary purpose was to seek and to save the lost, not to construct a comprehensive code of ethics.\nIncidentally, Jesus spent much of his time speaking to Jews who treated children, including unborn children, as a blessing, a reward, and a fulfillment of God\u2019s promise. In other words, explicitly condemning abortion, to the Jews, was unnecessary since it was a non-issue. So even if Jesus didn\u2019t say anything about the unborn, nothing follows. Pam\u2019s attempt is a textbook example of an argument from silence\u2014trying to conclude what someone did believe by what they didn\u2019t say. Bottom line, Jesus\u2019 silence is not approval.\nThis leads to the second flaw, the failure to realize that sometimes we can infer Jesus\u2019 view on one thing by listening to his view on a related thing. Stay with me on this. We all know Jesus was convinced the Old Testament was authoritative. He referred to it as the Word of God that cannot be broken. That\u2019s why he constantly refuted his opponents by appealing to the authority of the Scriptures. Yet, implicit in Pam\u2019s tweet is the presumption that Jesus\u2019 words, or lack thereof, are more authoritative than the rest of Scripture. But that wasn\u2019t Jesus\u2019 view.\nAll Scripture was God\u2019s word to him, not just the red letters. And that includes this passage from Psalm 139:13: \u201cFor you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother\u2019s womb.\u201d Notice, according to this passage, the psalmist was himself even before he was born. So in light of Jesus\u2019 explicit affirmation of the Scriptures, we know what he believed about the unborn\u2014the same thing the psalmist believes\u2014namely, that we existed in the womb as ourselves before we were born.\nThird, Luke, the Gospel writer, makes the exact same point the psalmist makes. In Luke 1:41\u201344 he records a pre-birth interaction between Jesus and John the Baptist that speaks directly to a biblical view of the unborn. When John is in the presence of Jesus, he\u2019s filled with the Holy Spirit, and he leaps for joy. And why is this significant? Because this happens when John is a second trimester fetus and Jesus is a first trimester embryo.\nSo what have we learned? First, even if Jesus didn\u2019t say anything about the unborn\u2014and we actually don\u2019t know\u2014we certainly cannot conclude, as Pam implies, that the unborn didn\u2019t matter to Jesus. That\u2019s a textbook example of the fallacious argument from silence.\nSecond, Jesus did say a lot about the authority of the Old Testament, and the Old Testament affirms the value and dignity of human beings before they were born. Therefore, Jesus would affirm their value and dignity too.\nThird, in the New Testament, even Jesus and John are treated as themselves\u2014genuine, complete, valuable human beings even in utero. So even if the Gospels are silent on the unborn\u2014and they\u2019re not\u2014that does not mean Jesus would condone the taking of innocent human life through abortion.\nClass dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWANT TO BE A STRONGER AMBASSADOR FOR CHRIST?\n\t\t  Let us equip you through our signature publications, videos, articles, and other mentoring tools.
