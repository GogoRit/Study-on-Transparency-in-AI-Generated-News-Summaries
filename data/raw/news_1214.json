Gavin Newsom (D), who has been broadly supportive of abortion rights, before it can become law. Similar bills could also pass in other states. New York lawmakers, for instance, have introduced legislation that would block law enforcement from cooperating with other states\u2019 investigations into violations of abortion bans, and New Jersey is also considering a bill that would block people from being extradited to other states.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nHow the clash between state abortion laws will play out in court. Critics of the California bill argue that it would violate the Constitution\u2019s \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d clause, which requires states to recognize other states\u2019 policies. California lawmakers argue the bill doesn\u2019t violate that clause, because the abortion bans go against the state\u2019s public policy and the Supreme Court has previously ruled that the clause doesn\u2019t require states to \u201csubstitute the statutes of another state for its own statutes.\u201d It\u2019s also unclear how necessary the law will be, as no lawsuits have yet been filed under the Texas ban against people who reside in other states. Legal experts also say it\u2019s hard to predict how things will play out if states that ban abortion try and prosecute residents who get abortions in other states\u2014as Missouri lawmakers have already proposed\u2014which could violate a clause that prohibits states from passing laws that burden interstate commerce.\n\nKey Background\nCalifornia\u2019s bill is part of a trend of Democratic-led states stepping up efforts to protect abortion rights in the face of Texas\u2019 abortion ban and its copycats, and as the Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. A draft opinion leaked by Politico shows a majority of justices were in favor of striking down Roe and letting states ban abortion as of February, though the court\u2019s final opinion won\u2019t be released likely until June. California lawmakers have also moved forward with other bills like one blocking the state\u2019s medical board from revoking the licenses of doctors who perform abortions, for instance, and the state leaders plan to put a measure on the ballot in November asking voters whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state Constitution. Other recent state measures include New York and Oregon establishing new funds to expand abortion access and Colorado and New Jersey enacting laws codifying abortion rights.\n\nFurther Reading\nCalifornia lawmakers take on Texas by blocking \u2018heartbeat\u2019 abortion laws (Los Angeles Times)\nAbortion-Travel Bans Are `Next Frontier\u2019 With Roe Set to Topple (Bloomberg Law)\n\nWashington Enacts Law Blocking Texas-Style Abortion Ban As More States Copy Texas Law (Forbes)\nConnecticut Moves to Blunt Impact of Other States\u2019 Anti-Abortion Laws (New York Times)\nRemoving federal abortion-rights protections may spark new legal fights between states (NPR)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Alison DurkeeEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
