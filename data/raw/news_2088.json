Gretchen Whitmer for defending her continuation of abortion procedures in Michigan amid the\u00a0COVID-19 ban on elective surgeries as \u201clife-sustaining.\u201dThe Democratic governor banned elective procedures March 21 that weren\u2019t essential to addressing a \u201cmedical emergency or to preserve the health and safety of a patient.\u201d\u00a0A clarification later added to the order said medical providers are responsible for using their \u201cbest clinical judgment\u201d in deciding whether outpatient procedures would \u201cpreserve the health and safety of their patients.\u201d\u00a0The continuation of abortion procedures was criticized by Right to Life of Michigan and mentioned in two separate federal lawsuits filed by the conservative American Freedom Law Center.The policy was raised last week when Whitmer was interviewed on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast with former President Barack Obama\u2019s senior adviser and political consultant David Axelrod, who asked the Michigan governor\u00a0about a lawsuit filed last Wednesday by Planned Parenthood against Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, whose coronavirus response efforts included banning abortions.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s your reaction to that?\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cYou\u2019re a governor you have to make these decisions as well.\u201dWhitmer responded that the attempt by some to lump abortions in among the banned elective surgeries in Michigan was \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u201cA woman\u2019s health care, her whole future, her ability to decide if and when she starts a family is not an election,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIt is a fundamental to her life. It is life-sustaining, and it\u2019s something that government should not be getting in the middle of.\"In response, Right to Life of Michigan President Barb Listing\u00a0renewed her call Friday for Whitmer to treat elective abortions the same as other non-essential procedures and accused the governor of letting ideology and her consideration by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as a potential running mate come before public health. The group has\u00a0argued that most abortions are for economic or social reasons.\u201cIf a lack of enough personal protective equipment is the reason that many surgeries remain postponed or canceled, then it\u2019s heinous that Gov. Whitmer is allowing abortion facilities to continue using up these precious supplies in surgical abortions and ultrasound examinations prior to medication abortions,\u201d Listing said in a statement.\u00a0The Michigan Catholic Conference also condemned the continued allowance of abortions during a pandemic and criticized Whitmer\u2019s comments on Axelrod\u2019s podcast. The conference is the public policy arm of the Catholic Church in Michigan.\u00a0The group noted it appreciated the governor's actions seeking to protect residents during the pandemic, but said Whitmer's podcast comments reflect \u201chow bifurcated and confusing her understanding of human life has become.\u201d\u201cHow can Gov. Whitmer on the one hand prohibit medical surgeries and the growth of food through gardening yet refer to a procedure that intentionally destroys a developing human person as \u2018life-sustaining?\u2019\u201d the group said in a statement.\u00a0Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan rejected\u00a0the objections by anti-abortion groups.\u00a0\u201cPeople who practice medicine \u2014 who see patients, give them their professional opinion based on years of training and experience, and then help carry out a treatment plan \u2014 agree that abortion is an essential and time-sensitive procedure,\" said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, a Planned Parenthood Advocates spokeswoman.\u00a0\"We believe in listening to doctors, not people who would exploit a worldwide pandemic to push a dangerous political agenda.\u201dPlanned Parenthood said Monday it has created an app called Planned Parenthood Direct that provides online access to its clinicians and allows patients to get\u00a0birth control,\u00a0treatment for urinary tract infections and other services without leaving home.Axelrod also asked the governor if she considered the Texas ban on elective abortions a \u201cback door\u201d way to push an anti-abortion agenda or a \u201clegitimate public policy decision.\u201d\u201cMy gut is it\u2019s the former,\u201d Whitmer said, but noted she didn\u2019t know the details of the Texas case. \u201cI do think that there is a very concerted effort to use every opportunity to take away women\u2019s ability to make our own health care decisions.\u201dThe Democratic governor has been involved in other abortion-related controversies during the pandemic.A week after Detroit police ticketed a man protesting outside a city\u00a0abortion clinic, Whitmer clarified her original stay-home order to exempt those engaging in activity protected by the First Amendment.\u00a0Andrew Belanger filed a federal lawsuit against Whitmer and the Detroit Police Department shortly after the citation.\u00a0\u00a0The governor's office clarified online that \u201cpersons may engage in expressive activities\u201d so long as they adhered to social distancing measures.\u00a0Western Michigan U.S. District Judge Janet Neff signed last week a stipulated agreement in which the city of Detroit agreed to dismiss the citation and dismiss Belanger's lawsuit with prejudice.eleblanc@detroitnews.comView Comments Staff Directory Site Map Legals Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Advertise Your Business Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Renvy.com Michigan.com\u00a9 2024 www.detroitnews.com.
