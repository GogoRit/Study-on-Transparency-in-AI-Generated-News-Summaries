Wade could limit abortion education for medical students.\n\n\n                                                                                    Photo by Emma Hayakawa |\n                                                                                                                                The Independent Florida Alligator\n                                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court heard oral arguments for a case that will determine the fate of abortion rights in the state Friday morning.\nThe lawsuit \u2014 Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida v. State of Florida \u2014\u00a0 challenges Florida\u2019s House Bill 5, a 15-week abortion ban approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022. This landmark case for Florida\u2019s abortion protections follows the U.S. Supreme Court's striking of Roe v. Wade last year, ending the federal constitutional right to an abortion.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group of abortion providers who brought forth the lawsuit, which includes Planned Parenthood, argues the law violates the state\u2019s constitutional right to privacy, a clause voters approved in 1980. In 1989, the Florida Supreme Court said the clause guarantees a right to abortion.\nA state trial court agreed with the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the 15-week ban was unconstitutional and issued a temporary injunction to block enforcement of the law July 5, 2022. The state appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court soon after.\nThere is no date set for a court decision. If the court rules to uphold the 15-week ban, it will trigger a six-week ban signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in April to take effect within the following 30 days of the decision. While the six-week ban includes some exceptions, like saving the mother\u2019s life, it eliminates exceptions for rape or incest after the 15-week mark.\nWhitney White, the ACLU attorney representing the plaintiffs, argued that the 15-week ban ignores the wishes of Floridians.\n\u201cThe Florida Supreme Court should respect the rule of law and protect the right of people to make personal medical decisions during pregnancy for themselves,\u201d White said.\u00a0\nWhite argued that the legislation violates Floridian\u2019s constitutional right to privacy by intruding on their personal decisions. She emphasized the law puts patients at risk of being forced to carry a pregnancy to term and coerces physicians to act against their moral and personal values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Whitaker, Florida\u2019s Solicitor General, asserted the privacy clause was focused on \u201cinformational privacy,\u201d rather than \u201cdecisional autonomy.\u201d The first protects people from having their information collected and disseminated by the government, while the latter relates to freedom of choice and protects the right to abortion.\nWhitaker added that extending the right of privacy to decisional autonomy could open the door to people using that right as a defense against worse actions, such as infanticide \u2014the act of killing a child younger than one year old\u2014 and spousal abuse.\n\u201cThe consequences would be striking,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThose all involve personal decisions I suppose the government could be said to be interfering with in some sense when the Legislature takes action to remedy choices that harm others.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, the justices prompted both sides with questions about what people\u2019s motivations to vote for the privacy clause in 1980 were.\n\n\n Enjoy what you're reading?

Justice Carlos G. Mu\u00f1iz seemingly agreed, adding that people voted for the clause during a time when abortion was not an issue on the ballot because it was federally protected by Roe v. Wade.\nMu\u00f1iz also referred to the Roe decision as an \u201cabomination\u201d and asked White about the protections for unborn children if the court ruled HB5 unconstitutional.\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to essentially take a whole class of human beings and put them outside of the protection of the law,\u201d Mu\u00f1iz said.\nHowever, Justice Jamie Grosshans shared her concern that reversing the 2022 state trial court\u2019s decision would involve rejecting over 30 years of precedent on abortion and non-abortion cases established by the state\u2019s privacy clause.\nLauren Book (D-Davie), the Florida Senate Democratic Leader, attended the hearing on Friday. She emphasized that this case is crucial to the future of the state\u2019s abortion care in a statement to The Alligator.\n\u201cIf this Court agrees to reverse precedent, the safety of women, girls, and sexual assault survivors throughout Florida and the Southeast will be imperiled,\u201d Book said in a written statement.\nContact Valentina at vsandoval@alligator.org.
