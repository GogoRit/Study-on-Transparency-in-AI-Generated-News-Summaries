One would ban nearly all abortions, with few exceptions, and another would ban abortions after roughly the six-week mark of pregnancy.\u00a0More: 'It's horrible.' Uncertainty looms as Oklahoma clinic braces for Texas-style abortion banEthical dilemmas exist for Oklahoma physicians when it comes to proposed abortion lawGov. Kevin Stitt has signed a law that would make performing an abortion a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison or up to a $100,000 fine. That is set to take effect in August, though it\u00a0already faces a\u00a0legal challenge.\u00a0That law provides an exception to allow abortion to save the life of a pregnant woman. But Oklahoma doctors say that\u2019s a gray area that could put them and their patients at risk.\u00a0More:\u00a0'It's horrible.' Uncertainty looms as Oklahoma clinic braces for Texas-style abortion banDr. Dana Stone, an Oklahoma City OB-GYN, said the exception is unclear\u00a0and \u201cincredibly dangerous for women.\u201d\u00a0It could mean delayed care for pregnant women\u00a0who have\u00a0life-threatening infections or bleeding during pregnancy that threatens their lives, Stone said.\u00a0\u201cI can't imagine having to look at a woman who has all kinds of signs of infection,\u201d she said, \u201cbut \u2026 the baby still has a heartbeat, and you're looking at 10 years in jail or a $100,000 fine if someone determined that you intervened inappropriately.\u201dThat leaves physicians to deal with an impossible ethical question.\u00a0\u201cHow sick do you have to let someone get before you intervene?\u201d Stone said.\u00a0More: 'It's horrible.' Uncertainty looms as Oklahoma clinic braces for Texas-style abortion banAt the signing for Senate Bill 612, the law that would make performing an abortion a felony, Stitt was asked about the limited exceptions to the law in the event of a medical emergency. He said that will be up to doctors to define.\u201cThat\u2019s something that doctors are going to make a decision on to protect the life of the mother,\u201d he said.Stitt and other Republican state leaders have pointed to crisis pregnancy centers, churches and other programs that would support a person through their pregnancy as alternatives to abortion.Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, emphasized that House Bill 4327, which would ban nearly all abortions, has exceptions for medical emergencies and in cases that involve rape or incest, so long as they are reported to law enforcement. While the other Texas-style ban has been sent to the governor, HB 4327 is still working through the Legislature.\u00a0Daniels said the state has an obligation to care for women experiencing a crisis pregnancy.\u201cMy goal is to see more women bring their babies into the world and experience the joy of loving and nourishing their child,\u201d she said.Banning abortions in Oklahoma creates fear of health risksThe Texas-style bills would open the door for litigation against anyone who \u201caids and abets\u201d someone in getting an abortion. But that\u2019s not a clear-cut definition either, said another Oklahoma OB-GYN who asked not to be named in this story.\u00a0Practically, the doctor said, it could mean that physicians will avoid mentioning abortions altogether when counseling a patient about her options in a high-risk pregnancy.\u00a0\u201cWhen we do find things that are significant abnormalities with babies, part of that discussion is helping the woman navigate what their next steps are,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cIf we can't even talk about the possibility of abortion, that definitely limits how we can review and discuss options.\u201d\u00a0In those cases, the patients often deeply want to have a child, but either for the fetus or the mother, carrying a pregnancy to term could mean serious health risks or even death.\u00a0Restrictive laws won't stop women from seeking abortions, the\u00a0OB-GYN said. Instead, they\u2019ll either have to travel long distances to receive one, if they have the means, or they may turn to less safe alternatives.\"That's going to put them at risk, put their lives at risk and put their reproductive health at risk for the future, as well,\" the doctor said.More: Abortion providers file suit after Oklahoma lawmakers send Stitt Texas-style abortion banUnequal access to abortions a concern due to propose Oklahoma lawWhat the\u00a0proposed laws will do, is create a \u201ctier of people who can get access to abortions,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Yap, who provides abortions in Tulsa at a Planned Parenthood clinic.\u00a0\u201cPeople who have more resources are going to be able to get it, but people who don\u2019t have as many resources will be left out of this really important health care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to force people to make travel decisions that they might not normally have wanted to make.\u201d\u00a0The Tulsa clinic has been inundated with patients from Texas seeking abortions after that state\u2019s six-week abortion ban, SB 8, went into effect last year. Many, unclear on what it would mean for someone to \u201caid and abet\u201d an abortion, come alone, Yap said.\u00a0\u201cPeople would come without any support,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just come alone, so that they wouldn\u2019t affect any of their friends or family who would support them, but they didn\u2019t want to get them involved in their abortion.\u201d\u00a0He and other Planned Parenthood staff said they\u2019re prepared to abide by any laws that go into effect.\u00a0\u201cIf that is something that\u2019s passed here, we will definitely follow the law to a T and stop providing abortions,\u201d said nurse practitioner Melissa Wilson, who doesn\u2019t provide abortions but counsels patients for a variety of health care needs, including abortions.\u00a0Staff in other states could help patients navigate the system to find safe, legal places to receive an abortion, Wilson and Yap said.\u00a0For Stone, the Oklahoma City OB-GYN, she fears stricter anti-abortion measures will mean even worse rates of maternal mortality. Oklahoma already has among the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country.\u00a0The state could take up a number of initiatives to better those outcomes, Stone said: expanding Medicaid coverage for a year after birth, instead of only a few months, making contraceptives widely available and affordable, and taking steps to maximize women's health before pregnancy.\u201cAlready, trying to give women all their care options we have those statistics,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI\u2019m just really concerned that that will get worse.\u201d\u00a0Abortion- and pregnancy-related terms to knowDoctors calculate how many weeks pregnant a person is based on when their last period was. That\u2019s a consistent way of dating a pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), because it eliminates variability in determining when during the menstrual cycle a person ovulates.\u00a0So, when someone is six weeks pregnant, that means six weeks have passed since their last menstrual period. That could mean a person\u2019s period could be about two weeks late, if they have regular monthly periods.Experts use various terms for a developing baby during pregnancy. From a pregnant person\u2019s last menstrual period to eight weeks, it\u2019s called an embryo. From then on, until delivery, it\u2019s called a fetus, according to the ACOG.Legislation to restrict abortions may often refer to a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d in determining a cutoff point for access to the procedures, but at the six-week mark, an embryo hasn\u2019t developed chambers of the heart yet, so there is no recognizable \u201cheartbeat\u201d at that point.In very early pregnancy, \u201cwhat pregnant people may hear is the ultrasound machine translating electronic impulses that signify fetal cardiac activity into sound\u201d we may recognize as a heartbeat, the ACOG explains on its website.\u00a0Until the chambers of the heart have been developed, typically about\u00a017 to 20 weeks, it\u2019s inaccurate to call an embryo or fetus\u2019 cardiac development a \u201cheartbeat,\u201d according to the ACOG.\u00a0There are multiple types of abortion procedures. Medication abortions are one kind, and in 2020, they made up about 65% of the 3,797 abortions recorded in Oklahoma.\u00a0In a medication abortion, a person takes a drug called mifepristone, along with another medication called misoprostol about 24-48 hours later, to end a pregnancy within about 10 weeks\u2019 gestation or less.Some abortions also can be performed in a clinic. These might sometimes be referred to as \u201csurgical abortions,\u201d but these types of procedures aren\u2019t surgery.\u00a0\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
