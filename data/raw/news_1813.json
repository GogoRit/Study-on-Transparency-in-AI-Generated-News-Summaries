But justices left open the possibility for other challenges in the future.\nPlaintiffs have 30 days to seek a rehearing before the decision is certified, meaning the ban won\u2019t be effective until Aug. 1, according to the ACLU of Indiana, which challenged the law. Rehearings are rarely granted.\nIn a split, 4-1 decision, the high court nixed a preliminary injunction that has kept the ban on hold since September. An injunction issued in a separate religious freedom challenge to the ban only applies to the plaintiffs in that case.\u00a0\nJustices opined that Planned Parenthood and other health care providers unsuccessfully brought a \u201cfacial\u201d challenge to the entire law, which alleged that the abortion ban is always unconstitutional and should therefore be voided.\nThe state Supreme Court, however, said the providers \u201ccannot show a reasonable likelihood of success\u201d with that challenge because there are cases in which the ban could be constitutionally enforced.\n\u201d \u2026 we hold that Article 1, Section 1 (of the Indiana Constitution) protects a woman\u2019s right to an abortion that is necessary to protect her life or to protect her from a serious health risk, but the General Assembly otherwise retains broad legislative discretion for determining whether and the extent to which to prohibit abortions,\u201d Justice Derek Molter wrote in the ruling.\nMolter is the newest member of the court, appointed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb in June 2022.\nStory continues below.\nOpinion Issued_ Vacated and Rema\n\u00a0\nThe five Indiana justices heard oral arguments over the constitutionality of the new law in January.\nThe court challenge was originally filed in Monroe County Circuit Court in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center.\nA special judge in Owen County later ruled that the ban likely violates the Indiana Constitution. An injunction issued by Judge Kelsey Blake Hanlon, a Republican, halted the state\u2019s new abortion law one week after it took effect. Under the injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law stood \u2014 allowing abortions up to 20 weeks.\nA joint statement from leaders of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai\u2018i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, ACLU of Indiana, Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, All-Options, the Lawyering Project, and Women\u2019s Med Center bemoaned the ruling.\u00a0\n  Anti-abortion protestors wait outside of the Senate Chamber on July 25 to testify against the Senate\u2019s proposed abortion ban, which they say doesn\u2019t go far enough. (Whitney Downard / Indiana Capital Chronicle)\nIn particular, the group decried the disparate impact the decision would have on nonwhite people, LGBTQ+ people and low-income Hoosiers who can\u2019t afford to travel elsewhere.\n\u201cNow, patients will be forced either to flee the state to access abortion if they have the means, seek abortion outside of the health care system, or carry pregnancies against their will with profound medical risk and life-altering consequences,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite this setback, we\u2019ll keep fighting to restore reproductive rights in Indiana and to help Hooisers get access to the services they need. Today\u2019s decision is not the end of our fight for equitable, compassionate care in Indiana, or the patients in surrounding states who rely on Indiana for access to abortion.\u201d\nThe Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly advanced the abortion-restricting measure during a heated, two-week special session last August.\nThat action made Indiana the first state in the nation to approve such legislation since the high court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe ban outlaws all abortions except in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly and cases of serious health risk to the mother. One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime. Rape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also strips abortion clinics of their state medical licenses, and provides that only hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers can provide abortions.\n\u201cWe celebrate this day \u2013 one long in coming, but morally justified,\u201d Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThank you to all the warriors who have fought for this day that upholds LIFE.\u201d\n Justices weigh the case\n\nMolter, along with concurring Chief Justice Loretta Rush and Justice Mark Massa, emphasized that \u2014 even when the Indiana General Assembly revised the state\u2019s abortion laws in response to U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade \u2014\u00a0 abortion continued to remain available \u201cto save the life of the mother.\u201d\nThat keeps in line with Indiana\u2019s Constitution, which protects a woman\u2019s right to an abortion that is necessary to protect her life or to protect her from a serious health risk. It also protects a fundamental right to \u201cliberty.\u201d\u00a0\nPlaintiffs in the case contended that right includes \u201ca bundle of liberty rights\u201d \u2014 like inferred rights to privacy, bodily autonomy, and self-determination \u2014 which coalesce to allow abortions up to fetal viability outside the womb: about 23 or 24 weeks.\nBut justices said that\u2019s not how the framers and ratifiers of Indiana\u2019s Constitution understood that language.\nIndiana Supreme Court Justices hear arguments in challenge to near-total abortion ban\n\n\u201cWe do not diminish a woman\u2019s interest in terminating a pregnancy because, for starters, it is a privately held interest \u2014 informed by privately held considerations. Moreover, we recognize that many women view the ability to obtain an abortion as an exercise of their bodily autonomy,\u201d Molter wrote. \u201cYet, and however compelling that interest is, it does not follow that it is constitutionally protected in all circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cBy saying Senate Bill 1 is not unconstitutional in its entirety in all circumstances, we do not say the opposite either \u2014 that every single part of the law can be applied consistent with our Constitution in every conceivable set of circumstances,\u201d the ruling continues. \u201cWe do not prejudge those questions.\u201d\nEven so, the court held that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the abortion ban \u201cbecause the law criminalizes their work and the injunction they seek would protect them from the law\u2019s criminal and regulatory penalties.\u201d\u00a0\nJustices maintained that others could still be successful if they challenge \u201ca particular part of the statute,\u201d or with a challenge that focuses on the law\u2019s application \u201cin a particular set of circumstances\u201d where a pregnancy endangers a woman\u2019s life or health.\u00a0\nBut in this lawsuit, the court contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a preliminary injunction failed to outline the specific limits on life or health exceptions and when those limits needed to be broader. \t\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\n\nJustice Geoffrey Slaughter joined the majority but said in a separate opinion that he would have ruled the health care providers who sought the injunction lacked a standing to sue in the first place, rather than ruling on the merits of the overall lawsuit.\u00a0\n\u201cDespite our differences, I ultimately agree with the Court that the disputed injunction must be vacated, and so I concur in its judgment. But unlike the Court, I would reach that result based on the lack of standing and not on the merits,\u201d Slaughter wrote. \u201c\u2026 the Court today dives into the constitutional scrum, pronouncing its views of myriad issues not squarely before us and not necessary to today\u2019s disposition. I would limit our decision today to Plaintiff\u2019s lack of standing.\u201d\nJustice Christopher M. Goff dissented, in part, writing that medical providers have standing to contest the constitutionality of Senate Bill 1 because the statute criminalizes their work. He also disagreed with his colleagues\u2019 decision to terminate the trial court\u2019s injunction \u201cin its entirety.\u201d\n\u201cMany of the liberties Hoosiers take for granted \u2014 the right to vote, to travel, to marry, to educate one\u2019s children as one sees fit, or to refuse medical treatment \u2014 stand on federal precedents that are also now vulnerable to reversal. Within this \u2018bundle of liberty rights\u2019 stands the fundamental \u2018right to be let alone,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn my view, even those who abhor abortion in all circumstances should be wary of unfettered government power over the most personal, private aspects of a person\u2019s life.\u201d\nGoff instead urged the General Assembly to put the question of bodily autonomy directly to Hoosier voters.\n\u201cIn my view, there is a reasonable likelihood that (Indiana\u2019s Constitution)\u2019s guarantee of \u2018liberty\u2019 includes a qualified right to bodily autonomy, one which the General Assembly must accord some weight in the legislative balance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore importantly, I believe that the abortion question is fundamentally a matter of constitutional dimension that should be decided directly by the sovereign people of Indiana.\u201d\n Other case still ongoing\n\nAppeals in a second case that seeks to strike down Indiana\u2019s abortion ban on the basis of the state\u2019s controversial religious freedom law are still playing out in court.\nThat underlying lawsuit was filed in August by the ACLU of Indiana on behalf of Hoosier Jews for Choice, as well as four anonymous women who represent a variety of faiths. The lawsuit argues that the new abortion law violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n  Ken Falk, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, discusses the group\u2019s lawsuit that seeks to suspend Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban while outside the Monroe County Circuit Court in Bloomington, Indiana, on Sept. 19, 2022. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)\nThe lawsuit prompted a Marion Superior Court judge to grant a second preliminary injunction against the state\u2019s abortion ban in December. Despite the Indiana Supreme Court ruling, the injunction will remain in the RFRA case.\nHowever, that injunction only applies to the plaintiffs in the case. ACLU of Indiana Legal Director Ken Falk contends it also applies to the class that the Marion County trial court has certified. The class includes all Hoosiers whose religious beliefs \u201cdirect them to obtain abortions in situations\u201d prohibited by Senate Enrolled Act 1 \u2014 the near-total abortion ban \u2014 and \u201cwho need, or will need, to obtain an abortion and who are not, or will not be, able to obtain an abortion because of the Act.\u201d\nRokita\u2019s office is appealing the injunction and the class action certification.\nBoth parties have since asked for a pause on the underlying lawsuit. The Marion County Superior Court granted the motion in a brief ruling earlier this month.\nThat separate appeal of the preliminary injunction is set for oral argument in the Indiana Court of Appeals on Sept. 12.\n \n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIndiana Supreme Court upholds abortion ban, but leaves door open for other legal challenges\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle June 30, 2023\nIndiana Supreme Court upholds abortion ban, but leaves door open for other legal challenges\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle June 30, 2023\n Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban, which prohibits the procedure with only narrow exceptions, will go back into effect after the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the law Friday.
