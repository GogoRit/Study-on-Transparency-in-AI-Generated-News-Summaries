Anthony Pro-Life America, attends a news conference on Capitol Hill in September to announce a new bill on abortion restrictions. Dannenfelser has argued that Republican candidates who went on the offense on abortion prevailed during the midterm elections.\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel M. Cohen\n        is a senior reporter for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of\n      \n      The 2022 midterm elections, explained\n    \n\n\n\n\nWhen he was campaigning for governor of Minnesota, Scott Jensen first said he\u2019d ban abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. Later, he said the governor couldn\u2019t do anything about abortion anyway, given Minnesota\u2019s constitutional protections. Last weekend, in a 22-minute Facebook Live video reflecting on his bruising loss, he made a new argument. \n\u201cThis election was not about inflation, and crime and education...for so many Americans across the country this election was about an intrusion into a person\u2019s autonomy,\u201d he said, referring to abortion. \u201cIn the future I think the lesson is clear \u2014 at least it should be to Republicans. If you infringe on someone\u2019s freedom, you may well lose. You\u2019ll probably lose.\u201d\nThe 67-year-old politician and physician announced his support for birth control over the counter, and morning-after pills in every medicine cabinet. \u201cThe pro-life movement should not be about trying to determine what the sexual mores or behaviors are of an American country,\u201d he said.\nA week out from the 2022 midterm elections, where abortion played a pivotal role in shaping both campaigns and voter turnout, candidates like Jensen, conservative strategists, and leaders of the movement to restrict abortion rights have been taking stock of the results for a cycle that was expected to be a much bigger blowout for Republicans. \nFinger-pointing abounds \u2014 at other Republicans, at Democrats, at the media. \nSome argue the midterm results are less bad than they first seem; Despite losing every abortion rights ballot initiative, and some key statewide races that would have enabled the legislatures to pass new abortion restrictions, Democrats failed to unseat incumbent governors and didn\u2019t win enough seats in Congress to pass any federal legislation restoring abortion rights. \u201cIf anything was less impressive on election night than the \u2018red wave,\u2019 it was the abortion wave,\u201d quipped Catherine Glenn Foster, the president of Americans United for Life. \nOthers, like Jensen, say the abortion results were terrible for Republicans and the party requires strategic recalibration if they\u2019re to win in the future. The reactions showcase the divisions and potential directions for the anti-abortion movement in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, where the fate of reproductive rights in America now lies largely in the hands of governors, state legislatures, and voters. \nAnti-abortion leaders argue the midterms showed politicians who restrict abortion access won\u2019t pay a price\nSome leaders and commentators who want to restrict abortion rights say they see no convincing reason to moderate their goals in the wake of the midterms.\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, has been working to push back on what she calls a \u201cfacile narrative\u201d that abortion rights were a winning issue for Democrats. In a Fox News op-ed she published on Monday, Dannenfelser argued that Republican candidates who went on the offense on abortion, and challenged their opponents\u2019 \u201cpro-abortion extremism\u201d prevailed, citing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, North Carolina Senator-elect Ted Budd, and Ohio Senator-elect J.D. Vance. She contrasted them with Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Adam Laxalt in Nevada, who she said \u201cburied their heads in the sand\u201d on abortion. (Laxalt ran an ad this fall stressing that abortion rights are protected under Nevada law, and Oz mostly focused on how the federal government shouldn\u2019t be involved.)  \nDannenfelser argued her movement was just outspent, and dinged leaders like Mitch McConnell for not campaigning against the anti-abortion ballot measure in his home state. \nGlenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, has put out similar glass-half-full post-mortems, noting that public officials who backed or enforced abortion restrictions were re-elected in nearly 20 states. \u201cDemocrats didn\u2019t crack state governor, state attorney general, or state house seats in red states that have enforced abortion limits since June,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAbortion activists couldn\u2019t defeat public officials in those states or win the U.S. House or Senate to block those state laws.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, speaks during a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on July 14.\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\n\nAnti-abortion media ran with similar arguments, emphasizing that Democrats and pro-choice activists failed to unseat politicians in certain races where they made abortion rights central. \u201cTexas Pro-Life Republicans Win Every Race After Democrats Promised to Beat Them for Banning Abortions,\u201d read one report in LifeNews. \u201cEvery Pro-Life Republican Governor Who Signed an Abortion Ban Won Re-Election\u201d read another.\nJohn Gizzi, the chief political correspondent for the right-wing NewsMax, published analysis concluding that arguments that abortion hurt Republican candidates are \u201cjust a lot of bunk\u201d by \u201cbig media\u201d and those who want abortion rights. \u201cIn race after race, abortion was not the deciding factor,\u201d he argued, and pointed to New York, where anti-abortion gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin over-performed, and nine out of 10 anti-abortion Republicans won congressional seats. \u201cIn many significant races across the U.S., Democrats used the abortion card without success,\u201d Gizzi added.\nOther conservative writers joined in to say the results were not as bad as the left suggested. \u201cDespite setbacks, despair is unwarranted,\u201d concluded Jonathon Van Maren in First Things magazine. John McCormack, the Washington correspondent for National Review, described the results as \u201cmessy\u201d but noted that there was no evidence Senate candidates paid a price for embracing a 15-week federal abortion ban. \u201cFor all the disappointment some Republicans felt on election night, a clean sweep for incumbent GOP governors was no small thing,\u201d he added. \u201cBy protecting the Senate filibuster at the federal level, pro-lifers ensured the survival of state laws that have taken effect since Roe ... and lived themselves to fight another day.\u201d\nAnd rather than losing because they embraced unpopular positions on abortion, as Jensen, the gubernatorial candidate from Minnesota, asserted, some conservative writers argued candidate quality was the far more persuasive explanatory variable. \u201cI\u2019ll put it plainly: Donald Trump continues to be a significant drag on the GOP,\u201d wrote Alexandra DeSanctis in the National Review. \u201cNearly every single one of his handpicked candidates failed or underperformed relative to other Republicans, in an economic climate highly favorable to the GOP. That\u2019s the story of last night\u2019s midterms.\u201d\nOther conservatives say the midterms show the need to stake out more popular positions \nNot all conservatives are viewing the midterm results with rose-tinted glasses.\nWilliam Saletan, a writer for The Bulwark, a center-right news outlet, published an analysis calling abortion \u201cdecisive\u201d in the midterms and said Republican candidates paid the price. Using national exit polls and a separate study overseen by the Associated Press, Saletan concluded the Dobbs decision influenced which candidates people voted for, and whether they voted at all. \u201cPolitically, the result is clear,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMost voters are pro-choice. They don\u2019t like what the Court did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra Bucciero and her son Luke approach a residence while canvassing for Proposal 3 in Dearborn, Michigan, on November 6. The ballot measure, which amends the state constitution to add the right to abortion and contraceptive use, passed during the midterms. \nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n\nSeveral pieces argued the results reflect the weaknesses of the anti-abortion movement. In an op-ed entitled \u201cPro-lifers were the midterms\u2019 biggest losers,\u201d writer Ben Kew said the results show \u201chardline abortion restrictions\u201d will hurt Republicans, and one solution could be to rally behind the \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d position espoused by Clinton. \u201cYet in these febrile and divided political times, anyone expecting an amicable compromise is likely to be in for a very rude awakening,\u201d he concluded pessimistically. \nAaron Renn, who runs a Substack focused on Christianity and politics, said the anti-abortion movement is \u201cdead in the water\u201d and emphasized the degree of actual support from Republican legislators has been vastly inflated in the past. \u201cConservative Christians need to understand that the majority of the public simply does not agree with their social positions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is going to be a painful adjustment for a lot of people who are used to thinking of themselves as a \u2018moral majority.\u2019\u201d\nTo stay politically relevant going forward, some anti-abortion writers urged their allies to seek \u201ccompromise and credible commitment to supporting women and children\u201d as Patrick Brown wrote in America magazine. This might require anti-abortion advocates to downgrade their absolutist goals. \u201cRepublicans will have to figure how to get half a loaf on this issue because trying to get a whole loaf will cause the oven to explode in their faces,\u201d wrote Ross Kaminsky in the Spectator. \nThe Wall Street Journal was even more blunt with its midterm assessment. \u201cIndependent voters in swing states may be unhappy with the direction of the country, but they didn\u2019t trust the GOP enough to give them power,\u201d the paper\u2019s influential editorial board wrote. \u201cAbortion seems to have been one factor that cut against the GOP this year, and the pro-life party will have to adjust its policy and message for 2024.\u201d \nSome anti-abortion leaders say the problem was they were outspent by opponents, and were disadvantaged by a biased media landscape\nThere were wide spending gaps between anti- and pro-abortion rights activists, and conservatives focused on those in their post-mortems. \u201cDuring this general election, Democrats spent an unprecedented $391 million on abortion-focused TV ads alone, compared with only $11 million on the GOP side \u2014 outspending them more than 35-to-1,\u201d wrote Dannenfelser in Fox News. In Michigan, the pro-choice coalition organizing to pass a ballot measure raised more than $40 million, more than double the $16.9 million the anti-abortion coalition fundraised.\nLila Grace Rose, president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, reacted to the abortion rights ballot measures by saying the results showed \u201cthe need to redouble our efforts of education & persuasion on the value of human life\u201d and to \u201cmatch & exceed the reach & resources of the abortion industry.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen-President Donald Trump shakes hands with anti-abortion activist Lila Grace Rose during an event at White House in 2019.\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\n\nThe advantage in spending, anti-abortion leaders argued, was coupled with lies perpetuated by Democrats and the media.\n\u201cWe need to recognize that voters are regularly lied to about abortion policy, and Republicans don\u2019t do enough to counter those lies,\u201d wrote DeSanctis in National Review, arguing voters in Michigan were presented with an inaccurate picture of the stakes of the abortion rights ballot measure. \u201cFor Democrats who spent millions casting their opponents as heartless villains who don\u2019t care if women die, and were met with silence or a weak response, lying worked,\u201d added Dannenfelser. \nVan Maren said pro-choice activists had adopted the same misleading playbook as reproductive rights activists used in Ireland. \u201cA relentless torrent of newspaper stories, commercials, and social media ads hammered this simple narrative: Vote for abortion, or women will die,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPro-lifers pushed back on these claims, but their rebuttals did not receive the same coverage.\u201d\nThe anti-abortion movement frames their post-Roe efforts as a decades-long project\nMany anti-abortion leaders say publicly they are not too worried about the results of the election and predict Dobbs outrage will fade the further away from the decision the country gets. While direct-democracy ballot measures proved a tough vehicle for anti-abortion advocates, they for now take solace that voters seem open to electing anti-choice politicians. \n\u201cThe midterms were disappointing, but not terrible for pro-lifers,\u201d said Brad Mattes, president of the Life Issues Institute. \u201cOverturning Roe was one generational struggle, persuading people about the evil of abortion is the next generational struggle.\u201d\nRamesh Ponnuru, a National Review editor, predicted after the midterms that most Republicans will keep saying they are pro-life when pressed but won\u2019t talk about the issue much, and others \u201cmay now put a higher premium on prudence\u201d in their rhetoric and anti-abortion governance. \nVan Maren urged his anti-abortion movement to lean into \u201cvictim photography\u201d going forward to show the public gruesome images that could change their mind on abortion. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, said the midterm ballot measure losses convinced her that more focus needs to be on the federal level. \u201cLike other injustices our nation faced in our past,\u201d she tweeted, \u201csome states will just refuse to acknowledge human rights and progress.\u201d  \n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
