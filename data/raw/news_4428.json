Christian \u00b7\nUpdated October 23, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday night, while the nation tuned into Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union (SOTU) address, many braced themselves for what would likely be a presentation of misleading statements mixed with inaccurate portrayals of his record. The office of Governor Andrew Cuomo was among that number. \nWith the recent passage of the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), a law ensuring that women have the ability to access the care that they need to protect their health without fear of being criminalized, New York was a likely target for Trump who has made it his mission to overturn Roe v. Wade and revoke a woman\u2019s right to choose. \n\u201cLawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth,\u201d Trump said of the RHA during his address. \u201cThese are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\u201dAlthough Trump painted the picture of women now having the permission to abort a child for whatever reason, up until the point of delivery, the RHA, as Cuomo\u2019s office defends, simply \u201ccodifies Roe v Wade into New York law.\u201d \nIn part, the legislation was put in place to protect women who are forced to choose between their life or death if potentially fatal issues arise later on in their pregnancy. Instead of leaning on the government to decide what happens to her or her child, women in New York can now, along with their health care professionals, make a decision that\u2019s appropriate for their particular situation.\nThe RHA also ensures that abortion is viewed as health care. That means doctors can perform the procedure safely without it being seen as a criminal act. Although Trump said he would be appealing to Congress to \u201cpass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb.\u201d The bill in its current form only allows abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy if a woman\u2019s health or life is in danger, or if a fetus is not viable.\nTrump aimed to further vilify the act and pull on the heartstrings of viewers by saying, \u201cLet us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children \u2014 born and unborn \u2014 are made in the holy image of God.\u201d But New York officials insist, \u201cThis bill/act is about making sure that at every point in pregnancy, a woman\u2019s health drives important medical decisions. Politicians are not medical experts and this is not an area where they should be interfering.\u201d\nTOPICS:\u00a0  black women and healthcare Donald Trump Reproductive Health Act State of the Union State of the Union address\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
