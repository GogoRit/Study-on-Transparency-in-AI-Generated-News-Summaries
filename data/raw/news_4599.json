State Capitol on Tuesday, May 21, 2019 as part of a national day of action (Capital-Star photo).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor eight years, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has been the sole barrier against legislation sponsored by the Republican-controlled General Assembly that would restrict access to abortion.\nAnd now, with the term-limited governor leaving office next year and a series of proposals to limit abortion access in Pennsylvania already circulating in the Legislature, reproductive rights advocates have issued a call to action to ensure people have autonomy over their bodies \u2014 all while a looming U.S. Supreme Court decision could overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cAbortion rights are always on the ballot,\u201d Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates Executive Director Signe Espinoza said during a Thursday town hall. \u201cEvery election is important to us, and the 2022 election is incredibly important in this fight and this movement as we continue to fight for abortion liberation.\u201d\nJosh Shapiro, the current state attorney general, and the endorsed Democratic candidate for governor, has promised to veto any bill restricting abortion access.\nBut the GOP primary field for governor is double-digits deep. The majority of candidates have expressed support for limiting access and adopting restrictive policies similar to the Texas ban, which prohibits the procedure once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 usually around six weeks of pregnancy and without exceptions in cases of incest and rape.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a champion in the governor\u2019s mansion. And we are going to work tirelessly with our supporters, our partners, and all the folks who are ready to do this work to ensure that we have another reproductive rights champion in the governor\u2019s mansion,\u201d Espinoza added.\nAn October 2021 poll by Franklin & Marshall College showed that 36 percent of registered voters support legal abortion under any circumstances, and 51 percent supported the procedure under certain circumstances. Eleven percent said they thought abortion should be illegal in all cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights are always on the ballot. Every election is important to us, and the 2022 election is incredibly important in this fight and this movement as we continue to fight for abortion liberation.\n\n\n\u2013 Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates Executive Director Signe Espinoza\n\n\nMore than a dozen state legislatures have imagined a post-Roe era, with bills to limit abortion access. And if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the landmark case, more could follow.\nCurrent Pennsylvania law permits abortion for any reason, except for selecting a gender, as long as six months \u2014 or 24 weeks \u2014 into a pregnancy. In 2019, the state Health Department reported 31,018 abortions.\n  Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, and Rep. Stephanie Borowicz, R-Clinton pray with attendees at the first Pennsylvania March for Life.\nPennsylvania Republicans have proposed limitations on abortion providers, including a bill that requires fetuses receive pain medication before an abortion.\nSen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, who\u2019s running for governor, is the lead sponsor on a bill that would ban abortion as early as six weeks, which is before most people know they are pregnant. Commonly dubbed \u201cheartbeat bills,\u201d the proposals, according to medical experts, are misleading because an embryo does not yet have a developed heart at six weeks gestation.\nState Rep. Stephanie Borowicz, R-Clinton, has repeatedly introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives.\nMost recently, Sen. Judy Ward, R-Blair, a former nurse, introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would add a section to the state\u2019s governing document declaring that there is no constitutional right to an abortion or public funding for the procedure. The measure advanced out of a Senate committee last month.\nThe GOP-controlled Senate Health & Human Services Committee also approved a Ward-authored bill prioritizing public funds for family planning services offered by private hospitals and federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and state health facilities. Ward argued the legislation would equitably distribute funds to providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not want to see what\u2019s happened in Texas and what has happened in other states already. And in 2022, we\u2019ve got work to do.\n\n\n\u2013 House Minority Leader Joanna McClinton\n\n\n\u201cI pray that we live in a country and a commonwealth that respects every human life, most especially those of the unborn,\u201d Ward, citing a lawsuit now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court as the motivation behind the proposed amendment, said in January.\nThe case, brought by a coalition of abortion care providers, asks the court to lift Medicaid restrictions on taxpayer funding for elective abortions.\nInstead, voters get to decide whether to approve the proposed change after it passes the House and Senate in two consecutive sessions.\nThe constitutional amendment process is lengthy and costly. But Republicans, who hold the majority in the General Assembly, appear to have adopted the strategy to circumvent Wolf and his veto pen since successfully curtailing the office\u2019s emergency powers through a referendum in May.\n  Kadida Kenner, a progressive activist, leads a crowd in chants in front of the Pennsylvania Capitol in support of abortion rights Tuesday, May 21, 2019. (Capital-Star photo by Stephen Caruso)\nPlanned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates have said the proposed constitutional amendment \u201cdistorts reality.\u201d They also argue that the constitutional change \u2014 and Ward\u2019s bill to implement a tiered funding system for family planning services \u2014 would restrict access to general health, including physicals, pelvic exams, breast cancer screenings, and routine checkups.\n\u201cIt means that if this were passed and later approved on the ballot, this bill would make it much easier for the state to ban and severely restrict abortion if Roe was ever overturned,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cWith a direct challenge to Roe in front of the Supreme Court, right now is the time for us to strengthen our commitment to sexual and reproductive health care and not strip away fundamental rights for Pennsylvanians.\u201d\nAdvocates urged supporters to contact lawmakers who have authored and supported legislation restricting abortion access in Pennsylvania, including Borowicz, Reps. Rob Kauffman, R-Franklin, Dawn Keefer, R-York, Tim O\u2019Neal, R-Washington, Donna Oberlander, R-Clarion, Kathy Rapp, R-Warren, and Frank Ryan, R-Lebanon \u2014 voicing their opposition.\nHouse Minority Leader Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, reiterated calls to action, telling advocates that her Republican colleagues are more concerned with limiting personal health decisions instead of pandemic recovery, school funding, and worker support.\n\u201cThe attacks on women\u2019s rights are the attacks on our ability to make decisions about our body, and Pennsylvania is in this national battleground,\u201d McClinton said Thursday. \u201cWe do not want to see what\u2019s happened in Texas and what has happened in other states already.
