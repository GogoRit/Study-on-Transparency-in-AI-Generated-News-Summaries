(AP) \u2014 An ardent abortion foe who once opposed allowing gay couples to be foster parents, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is the unlikeliest figure to complain about bills on the \u201cculture wars\u201d reaching his desk.But by vetoing a ban on gender confirming treatments for transgender youth, the Republican offered a rare rebuke to fellow conservatives who have been in overdrive this legislative session with bills expanding gun rights and restricting LGBTQ and abortion rights.\u201cI was told this week that the nation is looking at Arkansas because I have on my desk another bill passed by the General Assembly that is a product of the cultural war in America,\u201d Hutchinson said as he announced his decision. \u201cI don\u2019t shy away from the battle when it is necessary and defensible, but the most recent action of the General Assembly, while well-intended, is off-course.\u201d\n\nEven for veterans of the culture wars like Hutchinson, this year has been a jarring one in Republican-controlled statehouses from South Carolina to South Dakota. Fueled by an influx of hard-right lawmakers echoing former President Donald Trump and the backing of outside groups, Republican legislatures are pushing the bounds in already deeply Republican states on issues such as gun rights, access to abortions, and increasingly, protections for transgender people. \nThe bills reflect the larger mood of the Republican Party, which nationally has struggled to define Democrats in the post-Trump era. Instead, the focus has been on issues that drive the party\u2019s base and that Republicans use to portray Democrats as out of touch with average Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans\u2019 frustration with an inability to move policy at a federal level trickles down to more action in the states,\u201d Republican strategist Alex Conant said. \u201cI think a lot of these state legislatures are responding to the demands of the conservative base, which sees the culture wars headed in the wrong direction nationally.\u201d\n\nFew are going farther to the right than Arkansas, where Hutchinson over the past several weeks has signed bills restricting rights for transgender people, banning almost all abortions in the state, and easing restrictions on the use of deadly force in self-defense in the so-called Stand Your Ground law.The bills faced little to no resistance in the Legislature.\u201cThe conservative bent of this legislature is just so overwhelming that there\u2019s not any guardrails,\u201d said Sen. Keith Ingram, the top Democrat in Arkansas\u2019 Senate.Some of the measures Republicans are pushing in the country expand on longtime party priorities. Encouraged by Trump\u2019s three appointments to the Supreme Court, GOP lawmakers have moved beyond incremental abortion restrictions and are instead trying to enact outright bans like Arkansas has. Thirty-one such bans have been proposed in 15 states this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.The number of anti-abortion bills being considered in Oklahoma has nearly doubled over the past three years. South Carolina\u2019s Republican governor signed a measure banning nearly all abortions, a measure that was immediately blocked due to a legal challenge.\n\nEfforts to expand gun rights are also advancing in Republican states that already have few restrictions, with GOP lawmakers citing fears of new gun control measures under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Hutchinson in February signed a Stand Your Ground law loosening restrictions on the use of deadly force in self defense, a proposal that had stalled in past years. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee last week signed a law allowing most adults 21 and older to carry handguns without a background check or training.The new fronts include record numbers of voting restrictions fueled by Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020. A sweeping new voting law in Georgia prompted pushback from major corporations and even led to Major League Baseball pulling the All-Star Game out of Atlanta.The Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ rights group, said it\u2019s been alarmed by the record number of bills imposing restrictions on transgender people. More than 100 such bills have been filed so far this year, the group said. At least 20 states are considering treatment bans similar to Arkansas\u2019.\n\nGOP leaders say the bills in some cases reflect lawmakers catching up on sessions cut short last year due to COVID-19, but also constituents\u2019 desires.\u201cThat\u2019s the direction that Tennessee is wanting to move, based on the people they elected,\u201d said Cameron Sexton, the House speaker in Tennessee, where the flood of advancing bills includes an effort to make the Bible the state\u2019s official book.The agenda for Arkansas\u2019 House and Senate on any given day this year looks like a social conservatives\u2019 dream. Other bills working their way through the Legislature include one allowing schools to teach creationism and one prohibiting police from enforcing federal gun laws.\n\nThe flood of bills is even too much for Hutchinson. A longtime figure in the state\u2019s Republican politics, Hutchinson is a former congressman who called for reinstating the state\u2019s ban on gay foster parents when he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2006. Since taking office in 2015, he\u2019s signed some of the strictest abortion restrictions in the country.A day after he vetoed the transgender treatment ban, Republican lawmakers overrode him and enacted it anyway. Hutchinson signed the abortion ban despite his concerns about its constitutionality, and lack of the rape and incest exceptions. He signed the Stand Your Ground legislation despite past reservations about changes to the state\u2019s self-defense law.Conservatives have also dramatically scaled back Hutchinson\u2019s goal of passing a hate crimes bill this year. They\u2019re advancing instead a \u201cclass protection\u201d bill that doesn\u2019t refer specifically to categories such as race, sexual orientation or gender identity. The governor has said he supports the measure, though he acknowledges it wasn\u2019t his first choice.Arkansas Republicans say the bills show the shift farther to the right in the state, which Trump easily won in 2016 and last year. Republicans also expanded their majorities in both chambers of the Arkansas Legislature last year.\u201cAfter years of being told, this isn\u2019t what people want, this will hurt us, we\u2019ll lose an election, we\u2019re actually seeing the opposite being true,\u201d Republican Sen. Trent Garner said.The tone of the debate over the transgender measures is worrying opponents, especially health care professionals who have warned that the steps are marginalizing people already at high risk of bullying and suicide.At one point during a debate on one of the transgender measures in Arkansas, a Republican lawmaker cited a Bible verse that called people who wear another gender\u2019s clothes an \u201cabomination.\u201d Another compared parental acceptance of transgender youth to allowing a child to decide to become a cow.\u201cI grew up in a state that I didn\u2019t feel like was legislating hate against me,\u201d said Rep. Tippi McCullough, the top Democrat in the Arkansas House and the only openly gay member of the state Legislature.Hutchinson\u2019s stance against the treatment ban earned him the ire of Trump, who called the governor a \u201clightweight RINO,\u201d meaning Republican in name only. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential 2024 presidential hopeful who\u2019s tried to align herself with Trump, faced similar conservative backlash after reversing course on a transgender sports ban. Noem initially said she planned to sign the measure, then partially vetoed it and later issued an order that pushed schools to issue bans. Noem has promised to call a special legislative session this year to have lawmakers take up the issue again.Hutchinson said he doesn\u2019t regret the other transgender restrictions he\u2019s signed and isn\u2019t backing off his support for restricting abortion. But he said he hoped his veto would cause fellow Republicans to consider restraint on some social issues. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to pull back and say, is this really the role of the state?\u201d Hutchinson told reporters. \u201cIs this really reflecting confidence in parents and doctors to make good decisions?\u201d___This story has been corrected to reflect that Major League Baseball has moved the All-Star Game, not the World Series, from Atlanta.___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City, Kimberlee Kruesi and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville and Jeff Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
