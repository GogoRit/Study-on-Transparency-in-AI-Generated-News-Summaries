Here are 3 Pro-Life Lesson Plans!Brenna Lewis - 25 Mar 2020With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, many parents (and grandparents) are dealing with the transition of children from school to home. For many, this includes online classes provided by the school. But consider this: the quarantine may serve as an education opportunity in disguise.\nFor parents dipping their toes into the homeschooling world for the first time, you\u2019re probably discovering a few things. Firstly, that it\u2019s challenging (but in a good way). Secondly, you\u2019re probably finding that it\u2019s refreshing to know exactly what your children are learning and have some more control over teaching what you think is important for them to learn.\nIf you want to include some pro-life formation in their \u201cquarantine curriculum,\u201d we have three great suggestions!\nStudents for Life\u2019s \u2018Protecting Value\u2019 Curriculum\nStudents for Life serves pro-life students from middle school through grad school. In order to keep pro-lifers engaged and active, we\u2019re sharing our own Middle School Curriculum with you.\nYou can check out the material in various forms below. You may find that it\u2019s useful for children of varying ages; the content is very PG, but you know your child(ren) best. It was designed for children in 5th-8th grade. Note: the curriculum below may take a moment to load!\u00a0\nMiddle School Protecting Value Curriculum\nMiddle School Protecting Value Curriculum\n\n\n\u2018Principles & Choices\u2019 Curriculum by Healing the Culture\nHealing the Culture is offering their high school pro-life course free of charge during the coronavirus quarantine. \u2018Principles and Choices\u2019 is a fantastic program that explores pro-life philosophy, logic, ethics, justice, and more. This course was designed for young people in 9th-12th grade.\nAccess \u2018Principles & Choices\u2019 HERE.\u00a0\n\n\u2018Teaching Human Dignity\u2019 Program from the University of Notre Dame\nThe Teaching Human Dignity\u00a0series is a one of a kind collection of units, learning sequences, lesson plans, and resources that empowers teachers to incorporate life and human dignity issues into existing curriculum. Designed by Notre Dame faculty members, these resources take seriously the complexity of life and dignity issues in the modern world, and develop a consistent, unified approach that upholds the inviolable worth of every human being. All resources are available free of charge.
