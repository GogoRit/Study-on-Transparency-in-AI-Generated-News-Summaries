Wade falls\n\n\tHis stance on exceptions puts him at odds with 4 Republicans running for governor\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelissa Ingells \nMay 12, 2022 \n\nSpeaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, is seen during a convening of the Assembly at the Wisconsin State Capitol on Jan. 25, 2020 in Madison, Wis.\u00a0Coburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Watch \n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he would like to see exceptions for rape and incest if Wisconsin\u2019s ban on abortion goes into effect, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Vos made the comments a week after the leak of a draft U.S. Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that found a constitutional right to seek an abortion.\u201cI believe that if a woman is raped or a victim of incest that she should have a right with their family to decide what\u2019s the right choice for the child,\u201d Vos told the newspaper. \n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the draft ruling could change before it\u2019s likely released this summer, overturning Roe would put back in place an 173-year-old state ban on abortions in all cases except when two doctors determine a mother\u2019s life is at risk.Vos said a ruling on Roe could force lawmakers to consider other related reproductive issues like contraception. Vos told the Journal Sentinel that he didn\u2019t want to ban what he called \u201cpre-sex birth control\u201d like IUDs but would have to think about whether he would support banning emergency contraception like Plan B \u2014 which he opposed early in his career.Vos emphasized that he supports birth control generally.His stance on exceptions to an abortion ban puts him at odds with the four Republicans running for governor \u2014 who have all said they support a total ban on abortions. The Republican candidates running for governor are former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, construction executive Tim Michels, former U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson and state Rep. Tim Ramthun, R-Campbellsport.If elected, they could veto any revisions to the current ban if Vos were to get them through the Legislature.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nAs 2024 campaign winds up, Democrats knock Senate candidate Eric Hovde on abortion record \n\n \n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nOpponents and supporters of abortion access testify against 14-week ban \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin Republicans push bills they say would clarify state\u2019s abortion ban \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublicans propose exceptions to 1849 abortion ban \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
