But the overwhelming defeat of a measure that would have made it tougher to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution this fall was the latest indicator that the issue remains a powerful force at the ballot box.\nREAD MORE: This analysis shows which voters rejected Ohio\u2019s Issue 1 measure\nThe election saw record turnout for what\u2019s typically a sleepy August election date and sets up another battle in November, when Ohio will be the only state this year to have reproductive rights on the ballot. It also gives hope to Democrats and other abortion rights supporters who say the matter could sway voters their way again in 2024. That\u2019s when it could affect races for president, Congress and statewide offices, and when places such as the battleground of Arizona may put abortion questions on their ballots as well.\nDemocrats described the victory in Ohio, a one-time battleground state that has shifted markedly to the right, as a \u201cmajor warning sign\u201d for the GOP.\n\u201cRepublicans\u2019 deeply unpopular war on women\u2019s rights will cost them district after district, and we will remind voters of their toxic anti-abortion agenda every day until November,\u201d said Aidan Johnson, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nThe measure voters rejected Tuesday, known as Issue 1, would have required ballot questions to pass with 60 percent of the vote rather than a simple majority.\nInterest was unusually high, with millions spent on each side and turnout by far the highest for an August election in Ohio, which in the past have been mainly limited to local races. Turnout was even higher than the most recent off-year election in November, when voters in 2017 decided two statewide ballot measures.\nOpposition to the measure, which became a kind of proxy for the November abortion vote, extended even into traditionally Republican areas. In early returns, support for the measure fell far short of Donald Trump\u2019s performance during the 2020 election in nearly every county.\nThe November ballot question will ask voters whether individuals should have the right to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including contraception, abortion, fertility treatment and miscarriage care.\nOhio\u2019s GOP-led state government in 2019 approved a ban on abortion after cardiac activity is detected \u2014 around six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant \u2014 but the ban was not enforced because of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, which granted a federal right to the procedure. When a new conservative majority on the high court last year overturned the nearly 50-year-old ruling, sending authority over the procedure back to the states, Ohio\u2019s ban briefly went into effect. But a state court put the ban on hold again while a challenge alleging it violates the state constitution plays out.\nDuring the time the ban was in place, an Indiana doctor came forward to say she had performed an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio who could not legally have the procedure in her home state. The account became a national flashpoint in the debate over abortion rights and underscored the stakes in Ohio.\nOhio is one of about half of U.S. states where citizens may bypass the Legislature and put ballot questions directly to voters, making it an option that supporters of reproductive rights have increasingly turned to since Roe v. Wade fell. After abortion rights supporters said they hoped to ask voters in November to enshrine the right in the state constitution, Ohio Republicans put Issue 1 on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. In addition to raising the threshold to pass a measure, it would have required signatures to be collected in all 88 counties, rather than 44.\nThe 60 percent threshold was no accident, abortion rights supporters say, and was aimed directly at defeating the Ohio abortion measure. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, six states have had elections regarding reproductive rights. In every election \u2014 including in conservative states like Kansas \u2014 voters have supported abortion rights.\nIn Kansas, 59 percent voted to preserve abortion rights protections, while in Michigan 57 percent favored an amendment that put protections in the state constitution. Last year, 59 percent of Ohio voters said abortion should generally be legal, according to AP VoteCast, a broad survey of the electorate.\nLast month, a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found the majority of U.S. adults want abortion to be legal at least through the initial stages of pregnancy. The poll found that opinions on abortion remain complex, with most people believing abortion should be allowed in some circumstances and not in others.\nOpponents of the Ohio abortion question ran ads that suggested the measure could strip parents of their ability to make decisions about their child\u2019s health care or to even be notified about it. Amy Natoce, spokesperson for the anti-abortion campaign Protect Women Ohio, called the ballot measure a \u201cdangerous anti-parent amendment.\u201d\nSeveral legal experts have said there is no language in the amendment supporting the ads\u2019 claims.\nPeter Range, CEO of Ohio Right to Life, said he has been traveling across Ohio talking to people and \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the grassroots from the pro-life side more fired up to go and defend and protect the pre-born.\u201d\nWhile the November question pertains strictly to Ohio, access to abortion there is pivotal to access across the Midwest, said Alison Dreith, director of strategic partnership for the abortion fund Midwest Access Coalition.\nREAD MORE: Some Republican officials are trying to keep abortion off of state ballots. Here\u2019s how\nNine Midwestern states \u2014 Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Nebraska, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin \u2014 are considered restrictive, very restrictive or most restrictive of abortion rights by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports legal access to abortion.\n\u201cOhio in particular has always been a destination state for the states around it,\u201d Dreith said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t protect abortion access in Ohio, the options just continue to shrink for people seeking care in the Midwest.\u201d\nSri Thakkilapati, the executive director of the Cleveland-based nonprofit abortion clinic Preterm, said the effect of the Ohio vote will reverberate throughout the country.\n\u201cWhen we restrict access in one state, other states have to take up that patient load,\u201d she said. \u201cThat leads to longer wait times, more travel, higher costs for patients.\u201d\nThakkilapati called the energy around abortion rights in last year\u2019s midterms \u201cexciting.\u201d But she said the media attention died down, and people quickly forgot \u201chow tenuous abortion access is right now.\u201d The special election and ballot measure in Ohio are \u201ca reminder of what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Thakkilapati said.\n\u201cOther states are watching how this plays out in Ohio, and it may give anti-abortion groups in other states another strategy to threaten abortion rights elsewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for the majority who do want abortion access in their states but are seeing it threatened, the results in November could give them hope that the democratic process may give them relief.\u201d\nKimberly Inez McGuire, the executive director of Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, which focuses on young people of color under age 30, says the results of elections involving reproductive rights show that support doesn\u2019t come just from Democrats or in cities and states considered liberal bastions.\n\u201cThere was this idea that we couldn\u2019t win on abortion in red states and that idea has really been smashed,\u201d McGuire said. So, too, she said, is the \u201cmythology\u201d that people in the South and Midwest won\u2019t support abortion rights.\n\u201cI think 2024 is going to be huge,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think in many ways, Ohio is a proving ground, an early fight in the lead up to 2024.\u201d\nDreith said that since abortion hasn\u2019t been on a major ballot since last year, the Ohio vote this fall is \u201ca good reminder\u201d for the rest of the country.\n\u201cAbortion is always on the ballot \u2014 if not literally but figuratively through the politicians we elect to serve us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a reminder that this issue isn\u2019t going away.\u201d\nAssociated Press reporter Stephen Ohlemacher contributed from Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                An abortion rights protester holds a sign to keep abortion safe in Ohio at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Dobbs v Women's Health Organization abortion case, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision, June 24, 2022.
