The discriminatory restrictions result in severe consequences to the health and well-being of women in Malta,\" CYGEN said.\n\"The coronavirus pandemic has compounded the severe restrictions faced by women in Malta to access a safe termination, as the suspension of flights prevents them from accessing the medical procedure in neighbouring countries.\"\nThe Network said it had in January launced a campaign, #REFORM53 - Together for Legal Equality - which called on all Commonwealth governments to commit to reforming laws that discriminate against women, girls and LGBT+ people.\n\"CYGEN\u2019s statement voices support for Doctors for Choice Malta, the Women\u2019s Rights Foundation and Voice for Choice, who are working tirelessly to provide help to women seeking to terminate their pregnancy, and for support networks such as Abortion Support Network, a UK-based charity providing information and aid to women who reach out to them,\" it added.\nCYGEN's Maltese campaign lead Martina Farrugia urged the government to prioritise legalising safe abortion \"so that women do not face a disproportionate impact from the coronavirus pandemic.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Costa joined MaltaToday as a journalist in 2017. \n\n More from Massimo Costa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise \nContact \nDigital Edition\nSMS Alerts\n\n\nTerms and Conditions \nPrivacy Policy \nCookie Policy \nArchives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaToday is an independent media house based in Malta.
