While negotiations are ongoing, Rohatyn says the gallery \"will make this important work available for in-person viewings.\" Women\u2019s access to reproductive healthcare is once again under threat as the Trump Administration attempts to fill the late liberal US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg\u2019s seat with the conservative, pro-life judge Amy Coney Barret before the president\u2019s term is up in November. Many suspect the Affordable Care Act and the landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling may be the first agenda the court will overturn should Barret be confirmed. After decades of pushing for the expansion of women\u2019s right, the feminist activist artist Judy Chicago refuses to take this potential judicial reversal lying down.\u201cI\u2019m of the generation who fought for abortion rights, and the idea that the younger generation will have to fight for it all over again in the face of a misogynistic Supreme Court with right-wing attitudes is horrifying,\u201d Chicago says. \u201cBut of course repetition is also a part of women\u2019s history, unfortunately.\u201dA work from the artist\u2019s seminal Birth Project series, donated to Denver\u2019s Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains in 1983, is being offered in a virtual sale and party hosted by Sotheby\u2019s this evening to benefit the non-profit reproductive healthcare organisation. Chaired by Cecily Brown, Amy Cappellazzo, Lisa Dennison and Amy Sherald, the sale also includes works by Pat Steir, Marilyn Minter, Laurie Simmons, Rita Ackermann, Jeff Koons, Sol LeWitt and more.Chicago's 14 ft-wide Trinity Birth Quilt (1983) combines tie-dye and quilting and is being offered with an estimate of $250,000-$350,000\u2014a price that may set a new record for the artist's work at auction, which currently stands at $288,000 for one of her painted car hoods from 1964 that sold at a Los Angeles Modern Auctions sale in 2007. The proceeds from the quilt sale will be split equally between the chronically underfunded Planned Parenthood and the artist\u2019s non-profit organisation, Through the Flower, an institution that works to empower women artists while managing Chicago\u2019s extensive archive. Chicago produced the Birth Project series between 1980-85, creating more than 80 works combining needlework and painting that depict childbirth in an effort to \u201cchallenge the lack of images of birth and motherhood in Western art\u201d, she tells The Art Newspaper. Works from the series are held in various major museum collections and also other institutions like the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, where one piece is installed in a room where seminary students of Muslim, Christian, Jewish and other faiths come to discuss the \u201cdivine feminine\u201d. But still there is a dearth of images depicting childbirth, according to Chicago says. \u201cAs I understand it, even in this Sotheby\u2019s auction that will benefit a reproductive rights organisation, my work is the only image of birth, which you must admit is a little odd.\u201dThe artist and more than 150 needleworkers who collaborated on the Birth Project series gifted the works to Through the Flower in the 1980s, after the pieces separately toured over 100 venues. When the tour ended, the Chicago\u2019s organisation launched a permanent placement programme for the works, which involved donating the pieces to birthing centres and other institutions with the stipulation that the works could not be deaccessioned and would be returned to the organisation if the institution dissolved or removed the work from public view. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was approached by Sotheby\u2019s [about Trinity Birth Quilt], it made sense that this piece that provisionally lived in Denver could serve both Planned Parenthood and Through the Flower, which is a small organisation that, like all arts organisations, has been dramatically impacted by Covid-19,\u201d Chicago explains.She adds: \u201cBesides benefitting these organisations that are struggling to survive, the piece is also a means to highlight what\u2019s happening right now around women\u2019s reproductive rights.Chicago\u2019s work has remained perennially relevant as issues of gender, race and climate justice have come to the fore in recent years. She currently has exhibitions of her print work on display at Salon 94 in New York and Turner Carroll in Santa Fe, which commemorate the acquisition of her print archive by the Jordan Schnitzer Family Foundation. Jessica Silverman Gallery in San Francisco is also hosting an exhibition that explores Chicago\u2019s involvement with ecological and climate justice issues, and previews a recent series of porcelain works. In 2021, the De Young Museum in San Francisco will hold Chicago\u2019s first career retrospective, which was scheduled to open this year but was postponed due to the pandemic.
