Kelly Opposes Radical Abortion-On-Demand Bill, Leads Pro-Life Speeches on House Floor\n      Image    July 15, 2022 Press ReleaseWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Today,\u00a0U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA)\u00a0voted against House Democrats\u2019 abortion-on-demand bill, H.R. 8296. The \u201cWomen\u2019s Health Protection Act\u201d would preempt all state and federal restrictions on abortions, leading to enumerated rights to abortions up until birth and use of taxpayer funds for abortions. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 219-210 and now sits before the U.S. Senate.\u201cI am appalled by the bill brought before the House floor today that legalizes abortion up until the birth of the child.\u00a0 This radical agenda by House Democrats is opposed by 81% of Americans who recognize the sanctity of life,\u201d\u00a0Kelly said. \u201cI am proud to stand and fight for the little boys and girls who have the fundamental right to life.\u201d\nThis vote comes on the heels of Thursday night when Kelly took to the House floor, along with more than a dozen colleagues, to give a voice to the voiceless. At such a crucial time in the Pro-Life movement, Kelly covered a wide variety of topics, including the recent Roe v. Wade decision, the Heartbeat Protection Act, and the sanctity of life.\u00a0 He was honored to be joined by so many other Representatives who continue to fight for the Pro-Life movement. You can view the highlights of his floor speech\u00a0here.BACKGROUND\nIn 1973, Roe v. Wade\u00a0guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights. Over the last 50 years, more than\u00a063 million\u00a0abortions have taken place in the United States. During his service in Congress, Rep. Kelly has been a staunch advocate of the pro-life movement and protecting the unborn.\nIn 2021, Kelly\u00a0introduced the\u00a0Heartbeat Protection Act, which prohibits abortions when an unborn child's heartbeat is detected. The\u00a0Heartbeat Protection Act,\u00a0the leading pro-life legislation\u00a0with more than 100 co-sponsors, is supported by top conservative organizations including Heritage Action, the Susan B. Anthony List, the Family Research Council, and the Republican Study Committee, among others.\nSince being elected to Congress,\u00a0Kelly, a father of four and grandfather of ten, has worked to defend life by:\nProtecting the religious freedom of pro-life individuals and organization.\u00a0Opposing taxpayer funding of abortion\u00a0Opposing race and gender based abortions\u00a0Opposing abortion funding in foreign aid\u00a0Opposing abortion of unborn children who can feel painKelly has also worked to strengthen American families by making adoption more affordable, including his\u00a0Child Welfare Inclusion Act of 2021\u00a0and by co-sponsoring the\u00a0Adoption Tax Credit Refundability Act of 2021, among other bills.\n      Issues:Pro-Life & Family ValuesContact UsWashington DC Office1707 Longworth House Office BuildingWashington, DC\u00a0\u00a020515Phone: (202) 225-5406Fax: (202) 225-3103Erie District Office17 S.
