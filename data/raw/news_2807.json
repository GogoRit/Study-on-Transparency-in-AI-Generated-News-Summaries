He's also on the attack against his opponent.The 4th District is mostly rural counties in a state that is firmly Republican, and the seat has been held by Republican, Scott DesJarlais, for the last decade.\"I've spent the last two plus years on the ground building relationships with the people of Tennessee. I'm a different type of Democrat,\" Hale said during an interview via Zoom last week.Christopher Hale explained what he means by the words different type of democrat. He says he often upsets the democratic party establishment. He also calls himself a pro-life democrat.I asked him what he means when he says he's pro-life.\"In the book of Isaiah, God says that he, God, knew us before we were knitted in our mother's womb. That being said, My opponent is not pro-life. And here's what, there's a difference between what it means to be pro life and what it's not. For me, you should ask Scott DesJarlais' ex wife, you should ask his mistresses that he that he pressured into three abortions, he's not pro-life.\"Hale referencing DesJarlais' scandals from 2012. Those included urging his ex-wife to get two abortions and urging a mistress to also seek an abortion. DesJarlais has faced other scandals and continued to be re-elected to Congress. Hale tweets about many of those on a regular basis as well.Hale has also received some criticism recently. There have been several reports accusing him of using a mail and email list from a former employer without permission.\"There has never been anyone that has come up with one piece of credible evidence that they had ownership of that email list and I did not and I wait for it to this day,\" Hale said.There was also a report by Tennessee Lookout last week saying Hale has been accused, \"of broken promises and bounced checks.\" Allegations related to his Our Tennessee PAC and bouncing \"two campaign contribution checks to other candidates.\"We asked Hale for a response to those allegations. This was his complete response via email on that issue.\"The anonymous source claiming that I bounced a check to the Vice President's campaign is 100% wrong. There's no proof of it, because it never happened. I've also never been informed of any issue regarding any donation I've ever made to the Tennessee Democratic Party. Since 2018, I've made a series of personal contributions to the Tennessee Democratic Party, its local chapters, and some of its candidates, including: $1050 to the Houston County Democratic Party, $1000 to the Maury County Democratic Party, $500 to Chris Rowe\u2014a former candidate for the United States Congress\u2014and several hundreds of dollars to the Franklin County Democratic Party, the Rutherford County Democratic Party, and the Warren County Democratic Party. I do not have a full list of the numerous Tennessee Democratic candidates I've supported during that time period.In early 2019, I felt a strong desire to invest in Democrats in neglected rural counties throughout the state, including a dozen rural counties in my own congressional district. I felt the best way to do this was direct investment in down ballot candidates across Tennessee. I\u2019ve attached the original proposal I started pitching to donors and operatives in January 2020. Many donors and top operatives told me my plan was too ambitious and that I should lower my horizons. Despite the skepticism, I secured initial pledges and deep interest from a number of wealthy individuals both in and out of state, but I promised each that I wouldn\u2019t pull the trigger on the project if I decided to run for office in the 2020 cycle or get heavily involved in the 2020 presidential election.The draw towards both options was too strong for me to give myself fully to such an expansive cause, so while we didn\u2019t raise any money, I decided to keep the political action committee open, and I\u2019ve had conservations about ways of moving the project forward with leadership and staff and funding in 2021. The idea is just as valid today as it was when it was conceived in 2019.A lot of the same fundraising networks are helping fuel my 2020 campaign, where we outraised Scott DesJarlais by a 5:1 margin during the second quarter.The report was released a few hours before our interview and at the time NewsChannel 9 had not seen the report.Election Day is now just over 5 weeks away and Hale has a lot of work to do to have an opportunity to win this seat.\"We are gonna win this election because I've built the relationships. I've been on the ground sharing my message with people, and it's resonating,\" Hale said.Before this election cycle Hale ran for Congress in the same district two years ago. He lost in the Democratic Primary in 2018. In 2012 he worked on President Obama's campaign. Hale says he worked as an associate on the campaign's faith outreach team. He tells NewsChannel 9 he worked on the national Catholic outreach effort.We reached out to Scott DesJarlais' office requesting an interview to respond to Hale's statements multiple times over the last three days and at the time we posted this story we have not heard back.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\u00a9 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ..."
