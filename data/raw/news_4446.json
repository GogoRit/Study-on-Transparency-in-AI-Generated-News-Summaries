Ensuring women\u2019s human rights, including their reproductive rights, is essential to upholding EU values. \n\u201cPoland\u2019s flagrant disregard for these values is dangerous not only for women and girls in Poland, but throughout Europe. Women in Poland have sustained attacks against their rights again and again, and will not stop fighting for their right to abortion care. We stand with them every step of the way.\u201d\n\nRestrictive abortion laws \nPoland has one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws. It is one of only two of 27 EU member states that do not allow abortion on request or on broad social grounds. Under Polish law, abortion is only permitted to safeguard the life or health of women, or where the pregnancy results from rape. Prior to today\u2019s ruling it was also legal in situations of \u201csevere and irreversible foetal defect or incurable illness that threatens the foetus\u2019 life.\u201d Even in situations in which abortion is legal, multiple barriers combine to severely limit access to care in practice. \nPoland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party has repeatedly moved to further curb sexual and reproductive health and rights, including through a bill that would have enacted a total abortion ban. Such attempts have been met by mass public protests and condemnation by international human rights bodies and European institutions.\nAmnesty, the Centre for Reproductive Rights and Human Rights Watch sent independent expert monitors to observe the hearing of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal and analyse the decision regarding the constitutionality of access to abortion on the ground of \u201csevere and irreversible foetal defect or incurable illness that threatens the foetus\u2019 life\u201d.\n* Article 4a, sec. 1 point 2 and Article 4a sec. 2, first sentence of the Act on Family Planning, Human Embryo Protection, and Conditions of Legal Pregnancy Termination.\n\nView latest press releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  22 Oct 2020, 06:24pm\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our email list\n\nJoin our email list\n\nSign up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n Terms And Conditions\n Cookies Statement\n Cookies settings\n Privacy Notice\n Community Rules\n\n\n\nGet in touch\n\n Contact Us\n Work for Amnesty\n Events\n Venue Hire\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\n Urgent Actions\n Amnesty Shop\n Governance\n Media Centre\n Education And Training\n Safeguarding\n Other Resources\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n\n\n\n Terms And Conditions\n Cookies Statement\n Cookies settings\n Privacy Notice\n Community Rules\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in touch\n\n\n\n\n Contact Us\n Work for Amnesty\n Events\n Venue Hire\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\n\n\n\n Urgent Actions\n Amnesty Shop\n Governance\n Media Centre\n Education And Training\n Safeguarding\n Other Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Amnesty International UK 2023.
