Wade was leaked, Attorney General Dana Nessel restated that she would not enforce the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban and blasted the Planned Parenthood lawsuit filed against her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a litany of reasons why I believe that for somebody like myself, who believes it\u2019s my job to protect the health, safety and well-being of the 2.2 million women of reproductive age in the state of Michigan, that I will not enforce this law, because I think it will lead to further harm and further death of women in our state,\u201d Nessel said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 right-wing majority, heard arguments on a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks in December. A final decision was expected from the court by June, but the draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito confirmed the fears of abortion access advocates that the court plans to strike down the 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade.\nNessel said that although abortion isn\u2019t yet allowed in Michigan, she fears that the leak might expedite the decision.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to want this hanging around. so I imagine it\u2019ll come out earlier than was otherwise expected,\u201d Nessel said.\u00a0\nIf Roe is overturned, Michigan revert back to a 1931 state law that criminalizes abortions in all instances unless it is to protect the life of the pregnant woman. This law has stayed on the books for over 90 years, but has been moot since Roe was decided.\nNessel has said since campaigning in 2018 that she wouldn\u2019t prosecute anyone for performing abortions if Roe were to fall.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any reason why I can\u2019t be trusted to keep to my word on that,\u201d Nessel said.\u00a0\nBut in an attempt to get ahead of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Planned Parenthood of Michigan filed a lawsuit last month to block enforcement of the state\u2019s 1931 felony abortion ban, naming Nessel as the defendant.\u00a0\n\u201cI believe that what Planned Parenthood is trying to do is to go through my office in a way to attempt to get all 83 county prosecutors to be prohibited from enforcement. And I don\u2019t believe that legally that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Nessel said. \u201cI\u2019ve pledged multiple times that I will not enforce this law, and unless Planned Parenthood just doesn\u2019t believe me and thinks that I\u2019m misrepresenting what my position is, I don\u2019t understand why I would need to stipulate anything.\u201d\n  Bans Off Our Bodies protest in Lansing on May 3, 2022 | Allison R. Donahue\nInstead, Nessel recommends Planned Parenthood focuses on a lawsuit filed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who filed the same day as Planned Parenthood last month, saying she believes it is \u201cthe best avenue for relief that they\u2019re most interested in.\u201d\nWhitmer\u2019s lawsuit seeks to recognize the right to an abortion under the state constitution and to strike down the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban law. The governor used her executive message power to ask the state Supreme Court to take up the issue, skipping over the lower courts, and to expedite action on this case.\u00a0\n\u201cThe leaked Supreme Court opinion clearly demonstrates that the threat to abortion access in Michigan is real and imminent and we need relief blocking the 1931 ban as soon as possible,\u201d said Ashlea Phenecie,\u00a0 spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Michigan. \u201cPlanned Parenthood of Michigan has brought suit against the Office of the Attorney General and we are looking forward\u00a0 to having\u00a0 the merits of our claims evaluated and ruled upon by the Court, which has jurisdiction over this matter.\u201d\nNessel said that she asked the GOP-led Legislature to intervene in the Planned Parenthood lawsuit, but they haven\u2019t done so.\u00a0\nLast week, a House Appropriations subcommittee approved a bill that would allocate $750,000 in state funds to help the Legislature defend the 1931 abortion ban.\u00a0\nRep. Greg VanWoerkom (R-Norton Shores), the House Appropriations General Government Subcommittee chair, who sponsored the bill said \u201cit may become necessary if Attorney General Dana Nessel follows through on her pledge to not enforce a Michigan law banning abortion if a U.S. Supreme Court ruling affects Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\u201cI suggest they utilize those funds,\u201d\u00a0 Nessel said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt seems very odd to me that they would sue me to force me to defend this law when they could be defending it themselves,\u201d she added.\nThe attorney general said it\u2019s common for prosecutors to use their own discretion in deciding what issues their office prioritizes and where to dedicate funds. For her, prosecuting those who perform abortions creates too great of a risk to pregnant people\u2019s health and wellbeing.\u00a0\nOne scenario she fears if Roe is overturned and abortion becomes illegal in the state, there will be a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d in domestic violence and homicide.\nNessel said she has been going around the state talking to domestic violence advocates.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sort of putting them on high alert, telling them to expect to see an escalation in domestic violence cases and in domestic homicides as a result of this ruling,\u201d Nessel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXNessel questions Planned Parenthood abortion ban lawsuit against her\nby Allison R.
