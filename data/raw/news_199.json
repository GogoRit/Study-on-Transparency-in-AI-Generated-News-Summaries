(Photo by Greg Garrison/AL.com)By Greg Garrison | ggarrison@al.comPlanned Parenthood Southeast has opened  its downtown Birmingham clinic, at 1019 First Ave. North, and plans to offer abortion services at the new location.The clinic had a soft opening on July 14 and is now open for business, said Barbara Ann Luttrell, vice president of external affairs for Planned Parenthood Southeast.\u201cWe just started seeing patients,\u201d Luttrell said.\u201cIt\u2019s 11,000 square feet, a state-of-the-art facility,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will offer a full spectrum of reproductive health services.\u201dAt some point, that will include abortions, she said.\u201cIt will be available very soon,\u201d Luttrell said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an exact date.\u201dPlanned Parenthood previously had its office just off Highland Avenue in Birmingham\u2019s Southside, though abortions hadn\u2019t been offered there regularly since 2017.\u201cWe weren\u2019t providing abortion at the end,\u201d she said.The Planned Parenthood clinic in Southside was often a staging area for anti-abortion protests, peaking in 1988 with protests by Operation Rescue there and at several other abortion clinics that operated in Birmingham at the time. In 1998, Eric Robert Rudolph bombed New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic near the UAB campus, killing police officer Robert Sanderson, who was working there as a security guard. Rudolph was convicted and remains in prison. New Woman, now defunct, was not affiliated with Planned Parenthood.Pro-life groups have often picketed and surrounded abortion clinics with volunteer \u201csidewalk counselors,\u201d stationed on public sidewalks, who try to dissuade women from having an abortion.The new facility in downtown Birmingham is bordered by Interstate 65 to the west. It has a fenced-in parking area with a gate and security cameras.\u201cSecurity is our number one concern,\u201d Luttrell said. \u201cWe want our staff to feel safe and secure. We want our patients to feel safe and secure.\u201dDuring the construction of the new building, protesters including Sarah Howell Neely, who works for CEC Life, a pro-life ministry of the Charismatic Episcopal Church, have picketed on the sidewalk in front of the construction site.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a prayer presence the whole time they\u2019ve been building it,\u201d Neely said.The new high-profile clinic is likely to attract its share of protests and pickets.\u201cWe are absolutely used to having anti-abortion protesters,\u201d Luttrell said. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing new.\u201dConstruction on the new facility began in January 2019. Soon after, the Alabama Legislature passed the Human Life Protection Act to make abortion illegal in Alabama except when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Gov. Kay Ivey signed the nearly complete ban on abortion into law in May 2019. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued to stop the law from taking effect.U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the ban with a preliminary injunction in October 2019, staying it was unconstitutional.\u201cThat law was deemed unconstitutional, which we would knew it would be,\u201d Luttrell said.\u201cWe want to make sure that abortion is safe, legal and available in Alabama,\u201d she said.At the time the abortion ban was passed, only three clinics in Alabama were offering abortion, in Huntsville, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa. This clinic will be the fourth.\u201cAlabamians have access to abortion now in the state,\u201d Luttrell said.Since 1973, when abortion was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade, Planned Parenthood has offered abortion services in addition to birth control and reproductive health services.\u201cWe were always committed to providing abortion to the full extent of the law, return it to what it once was,\u201d Luttrell said.Planned Parenthood Southeast, based in Atlanta, covers Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.\u201cBirmingham was our first location,\u201d Luttrell said. \u201cWe have been in Birmingham since 1930.\u201dLawyer who wrote abortion ban lays out plan to overturn Roe vs. WadeA Birmingham attorney who has drafted more than 12 anti-abortion laws for Alabama including a near-total ban passed earlier this year, said today his plan to overturn Roe vs. Wade is right on schedule.Reaction to abortion ban: some activists waited decades for thisFor more than three decades, religious anti-abortion activists in Alabama have tried to shut down abortion clinics and get Roe vs. Wade overturned. They are now closer than ever to that goal.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
