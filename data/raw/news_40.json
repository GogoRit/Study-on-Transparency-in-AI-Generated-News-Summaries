In Poland, Behemoth frontman Nergal is making sure a piece of legislation in Poland doesn't go unnoticed, calling attention to his country's government attempting to push an abortion ban through amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.The \"Stop Abortion\" bill is scheduled to be read on April 15 and 16 and if passed it would restrict the reproductive rights of women in Poland. This comes as the country is currently under self-isolating practices that ban large gatherings, thus keeping assembly of protests from happening and hurting the chances that the bill might be denied.\"Polish government is using isolation restrictions to enact the complete abortion ban in my home country. I\u2019m speechless and terrified to see how shameless they are on the way to utter victory... to turn Poland into next North Korea or Belarus. Utterly disgusting. I honestly hate the fact I breathe the same air,\" bemoans the musician.The singer has not been one to keep quiet, especially when it comes to the Polish government. In 2010, he famously faced blasphemy charges in Poland for ripping up a bible onstage during a performance and calling it \"a book of lies.\" The charges against him were later dropped.In 2017, he butted heads with Polish authorities again, this time being\u00a0summoned by Polish prosecutors over the sale of a piece of merchandise that resembled Poland's official coat of arms. The next year he emerged victorious in his legal battle with the Polish government.Behemoth's most recent album was 2018's I Loved You at Your Darkest.See Behemoth in the 66 Best Metal Albums of the Decade: 2010 - 2019Filed Under: Behemoth, NergalCategories: Metal, NewsCommentsLeave A CommentMore From Loudwire10 Times Bands Lied to Their Fans10 Times Bands Lied to Their Fans27 Rock + Metal Bands That Played Over 150 Shows in One Year27 Rock + Metal Bands That Played Over 150 Shows in One Year10 Years Ago: Behemoth Release Their Masterpiece, \u2018The Satanist\u201910 Years Ago: Behemoth Release Their Masterpiece, \u2018The Satanist\u201920 Important Rock + Metal Albums Turning 20 in 202420 Important Rock + Metal Albums Turning 20 in 2024More Than 20 Big Rock + Metal Albums Turning 10 in 2024More Than 20 Big Rock + Metal Albums Turning 10 in 202413 Rock + Metal Artists Who Were Banned From Countries13 Rock + Metal Artists Who Were Banned From Countries25 Legendary Extreme Metal Albums With No Weak Songs25 Legendary Extreme Metal Albums With No Weak Songs10 Most Terrifying Live Bands10 Most Terrifying Live BandsThe Best Album by 30 Legendary Metal BandsThe Best Album by 30 Legendary Metal BandsInformationContact UsAdvertisePrivacyExercise My Data RightsFollow UsVisit us on InstagramVisit us on YoutubeVisit us on FacebookVisit us on Twitter2024 Loudwire, Townsquare Media, Inc.
