Steve Toth would also make it a felony to help someone pay for an abortion in states where abortion is legal.By Bess LevinMarch 1, 2023The Plan C website on a laptop computer arranged in the Brooklyn borough of New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2022.

It is also a felony to perform the medical procedure in the state, and those who do so face life in prison. With such draconian laws on the books, you might think even the most anti-choice champions in the state, who can\u2019t stand the idea of pregnant people being able to make their own decisions about their own bodies, would ease up on the crusade against reproductive freedom. That they would say to themselves, Okay, abortion is banned here and providers can go away for life over it\u2014we\u2019ve done enough. But, of course, it\u2019s never enough, hence a new bill trying to (1) make it a felony to help someone pay for an abortion outside the state and (2) force internet providers to block websites containing information about obtaining an abortion.Yes, websites. Late last week, Texas lawmaker Steve Toth introduced HB2690, which would require internet service providers to \u201cmake every reasonable and technologically feasible effort to block Internet access to information or material intended to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain an elective abortion or an abortion-inducing drug.\u201d Text of the legislation specifically names Plan C, Hey Jane, and Aid Access, among others. The bill would also allow individuals to sue people who maintain such sites and criminalize abortion funds that help people obtain abortions in other states\u2014even if abortion is legal in those places. In the \u201ccriminal offenses\u201d section, the bill notes:A person that knowingly pays for or reimburses the costs associated with obtaining an elective abortion performed on a pregnant woman commits an offense. An offense under this subsection is a felony of the second degree, except that the offense is a felony of the first degree if an unborn child dies as a result of the offense. The prohibition\u2026applies regardless of: (1) the individual on whom the elective abortion is performed; (2) the location at which the elective abortion is performed; (3) the law of the jurisdiction in which the elective abortion is performed; and (4) whether the payment or reimbursement is provided directly or through an intermediary.This obviously raises a lot of questions, the biggest one being: What the f--k is wrong with Texas? But also: Do \u201ccosts associated with\u201d strictly relate to the procedure, or do they include travel? What about people who simply offer up a place to stay to anyone getting an abortion outside the state without money being exchanged? The Pentagon announced last year that it would cover travel fees for members of the military if abortion is banned where they are stationed\u2014is Texas going to prosecute the federal government?As The New Republic notes, medication abortions, i.e., abortions that can be performed outside of a doctor\u2019s office using pills, represent more than half of all abortions in the United States. So it\u2019s not really that surprising that antiabortion zealots in Texas, who have effectively banned all surgical abortions in the state (except in rare instances to save the life of the mother), are now setting their sights on them. And while it\u2019s not clear if HB2690 will ultimately pass, the abortion pill is under grave threat on another front, thanks to a forthcoming ruling from a Texas judge that could effectively ban the drug nationwide.The Ultimate Guide to the 2024 OscarsThe Biggest Moments From the Oscars 2024Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee Every Look From the Oscars Red CarpetFrom Emma Stone to LeBron James, Stars Collided at the 2024 VF Oscar PartyOppenheimer\u2019s Golden Night at the OscarsBillie Eilish, Lily Gladstone, and More Stars of Mark Seliger\u2019s 2024 Oscar Party PortraitsAll the Glam From the Oscar Party Red Carpet11 Spectacular Stars Unite for the 30th Annual Hollywood IssueStay in the know and subscribe to Vanity Fair for just $2.50 $1 per month.Most PopularPhotos From Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee the Glam in Motion on the Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2024 Glam CamBy Kase WickmanBarry Keoghan, Charles Melton, and Hunter Schafer Kick Off Oscar Week in Style at Vanity Fair and Instagram\u2019s Vanities PartyBy Kara WarnerBess LevinPolitics CorrespondentBess Levin is a politics correspondent at Vanity Fair.
