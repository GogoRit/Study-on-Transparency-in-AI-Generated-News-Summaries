But on Wednesday it unexpectedly published the law enforcing the court\u2019s ruling, which states that abortions may only be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is in danger and bars the termination of pregnancies with fetal defects. \n    \n\n            The Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling marked the first change to Polish abortion law since 1993, but came after a years-long effort from the country\u2019s right-wing government to curtail access to abortions. The ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) has placed anti-abortion rhetoric at the heart of its socially conservative agenda, and attempted to pass a bill banning abortions due to fetal defects in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic.\n    \n\n            Wednesday\u2019s move prompted demonstrators in the capital, Warsaw, and other cities \u2013 including Krakow, Bydgoszcz, Opole, Szczecin, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Wroc\u0142aw \u2013 to defy a pandemic-related ban on gatherings of more than five people and take to the streets again.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate worker Eliza carries a placard saying \"This is war\" at Friday's protest.\n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n            A rights group known as Women\u2019s Strike has led the opposition to the new law, as abortion has emerged as one of the most divisive issues since the PiS came to power in 2015. \n    \n\n            Those who marched in central Warsaw on Friday carried placards declaring \u201cAbortion without borders,\u201d \u201cAbortion is my right\u201d or \u201cYou will not burn these witches.\u201d Banners bearing the lightning bolt emblem of the Women\u2019s Strike movement fluttered overhead, along with the red and white of the Polish flag.\n    \n\n            Some spoke to CNN about why they had turned out despite the pandemic restrictions, extended Thursday until mid-February, and a heavy police presence.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s very important to be here, because women\u2019s rights are being trampled,\u201d said 17-year-old high school student Zuzia. \u201cI\u2019m showing support for the movement.\u201d\n    \n\n            Corporate worker Eliza, 46, who carried a placard saying \u201cThis is war,\u201d said: \u201cI think all women are here for freedom for Polish women. We are protesting here. A group of women saying \u2018no\u2019 to our government and their decisions.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtester Julia, 23, carries a banner at the protest. \n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology student Dagmara, 25, believes in respect for all.\n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n            \u201cWe are here because the new abortion law\u2019s verdict came into force and women became live incubators,\u201d said Julia, 23. \u201cThe matter is simple to me: I want to have my rights and choice and I think everybody thinks similarly here and we have to support one another.\u201d\n    \n\n            Psychology student Dagmara, 25, carried a sign saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a right, not an ideology.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my duty as a citizen to be here and fight for freedom. It\u2019s the 21st century and respect and tolerance for everybody is a must.\u201d\n Dagmara, student, aged 25\n\n\n\n            Police were deployed in significant numbers in central Warsaw. Loudspeakers on police cars broadcast the message that the gathering was illegal and called for those gathered to disperse. Video of the protest showed what appeared to be tear gas being used.\n    \n\n            But the crowds of demonstrators remained defiant as, wrapped in thick coats and scarves and wearing face masks as a precaution against Covid-19, they walked toward the official residence of PiS chief Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski in the city\u2019s northern \u017boliborz district.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen's Strike leader Marta Lempart rallied the protesters as they marched on Friday.\n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice blockades prevented the demonstrators reaching the official residence of PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.\n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n            The protesters, galvanized by Women\u2019s Strike leader Marta Lempart, took detours down back streets to avoid police blockades. But a large police presence prevented them from getting close to the residence and the protest eventually broke up after midnight.\n    \n\n            Kaczy\u0144ski, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister, is widely seen as the de facto decision maker in Poland and the driving force behind the new abortion law. Even before it came into force, the staunchly Roman Catholic country had some of the strictest abortion rules in Europe.\n    \n\n            Abortions due to fetal defects comprised approximately 98% of all legal abortions carried out in Poland in 2019, according to data from the Polish Ministry of Health.\n    \n\n            Further restricting abortion is seen by the law\u2019s critics as the latest attack on social freedoms by a right-wing government that openly disdains Western liberal values, uses homophobic rhetoric and has eroded protections for the LGBTQ community. Pride flags have been a common sight among the crowds of protesters.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents Antek and Aneta are opposed to the government's stance on LGBTQ rights.\n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeronika, 22, holds a banner with the Women's Strike symbol.\n\nKuba Kaminski for CNN\n\n\n\n            \u201cThis verdict is despicable,\u201d said 25-year-old student Antek. \u201cWe are LGBT people and the government hates us,\u201d said fellow student Aneta, also 25. The pair carried a rainbow flag and the red lightning bolt symbol of the Women\u2019s Strike movement as they walked. \n    \n\n            Weronika, 22, said: \u201cI\u2019m here in solidarity with all the women and all the men who stand with women, with all non-binary people and all the people that have had enough.\u201d\n    \n\n            Neither the PiS nor President Andrzej Duda, who is backed by the PiS, have commented publicly on the fresh round of protests. CNN has reached out to the offices of the President and Prime Minister for comment.\n    \n\n            Kaczynski in October described people protesting over the abortion ruling as criminals and warned that their actions in the middle of a pandemic would cost lives.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARSAW, POLAND - JANUARY 27: Pro-choice protesters light flares during a protest on January 27, 2021 in Warsaw, Poland. A Constitutional Court ruling in October determined that abortions are only legal in cases of rape and incest, and when the mother's life is in danger, but the decision had not yet been officially published until now, three months after the ruling sparked widespread protests.

The guest responsible for the destruction of the state, for setting Poland on fire, for unleashing hatred. Disgrace,\u201d he tweeted late Friday.\n    \n\n            Warsaw Police tweeted Friday night that its aim was to secure the protest while minimizing inconvenience to other people. \u201cWe evaluate the situation only through the prism of ensuring safety. Also the safety of other inhabitants of our city,\u201d the force said.\n    \n\n            Meanwhile, Urszula Sara Zieli\u0144ska, an MP from the Green Party, tweeted that each of those who had turned out in protest \u201cdespite the frost, pandemic and fear of police repression\u201d represented \u201chundreds of thousands of others who do not want to live in a sick country.\u201d\n    \n\n            It\u2019s unclear whether the latest protests will persuade the governing coalition to pursue a different course.\n    \n\n            But the dispute over women\u2019s reproductive rights has once again laid bare the cultural, moral and political divisions that run deep through Polish society.\n    \n\n  Journalist Kuba Kaminski reported from Warsaw and CNN\u2019s Antonia Mortensen
