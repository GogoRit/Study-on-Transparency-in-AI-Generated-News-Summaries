We also compared judicial\u00a0precedents, legislations, and the political discourse on\u00a0abortions across the US and Europe, to look at whether the SC will recognize\u00a0abortion\u00a0as a fundamental right.\nThis month, we will list out some critical scholarship which looks at the historical underpinnings of Indian\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws and the accommodation of liberalized\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws within existing jurisprudence on fundamental rights.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Siddhivinayak S. Hirve.\u00a0Abortion\u00a0Law, Policy and Services in India: A Critical Review\u00a0[Reproductive Health Matters, Vol 12, Issue 24, 2004]\u00a0\nHirve\u2019s paper first critically reviews the history of\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws and policy in India to trace the changes that have taken place over 40-odd years. It also examines barriers to\u00a0abortion\u00a0access, which is the primary cause of unsafe\u00a0abortion and highlights the impact of poor\u00a0awareness\u00a0of the law. It also addresses the relationship between\u00a0abortion\u00a0and sex determination, concluding that these must be treated as distinct practices to ensure that women are not unduly victimized by laws on the latter.\nThis paper provides a useful overview of how\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws and policy has changed over the years and also gives us insight into the misconceptions that have shaped both proposed and enacted laws. Crucially, it also engages with the under-regulation of\u00a0abortion\u00a0providers (versus the overregulation of women seeking\u00a0abortions) to demonstrate that there are a number of concrete and attainable steps the State can take to ensure safe and affordable access to\u00a0abortions.\n\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dipika Jain and Payal K. Shah.\u00a0Reimagining Reproductive Rights Jurisprudence in India: Reflections on the Recent Decisions on Privacy and Gender Equality from the Supreme Court of India\u00a0[Columbia Journal of Gender and Law, Vol 39, Issue 2, 2020]\u00a0\nThis article analyses recent Supreme Court decisions on the rights to privacy, sexual autonomy and equality \u2013 namely\u00a0Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,\u00a0Joseph Shine v UOI,\u00a0and\u00a0Puttuswamy v UOI \u2013\u00a0\u00a0to argue that the Court has provided a legal foundation for the recognition of\u00a0abortion\u00a0as a fundamental right and the liberalization of India\u2019s\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws. Jain and Shah examine the legal reasoning in these cases to argue that the judicial recognition of a right to\u00a0abortion\u00a0must be grounded both in privacy and equality.\u00a0\nThis paper presents a clear-eyed view of how existing jurisprudence supports the liberalization of\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws. By highlighting the legal gaps that remain when reproductive rights are grounded only in privacy, the authors demonstrate the importance of equality law in reaffirming the right to access\u00a0abortions.\u00a0\u00a0The international and comparative perspectives used in the paper also are a useful starting point to understand\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws across the globe.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ravi Duggal and Vimala Ramachandran.\u00a0The\u00a0Abortion\u00a0Assessment Project \u2014 India: Key Findings and Recommendations\u00a0[Reproductive Health Matters, Vol 12, Issue 24, 2004]\nThis paper summarizes the key findings of the\u00a0Abortion\u00a0Assessment Project, a project which conducted surveys, policy reviews, and studies of\u00a0abortion\u00a0providers across India. Duggal and Ramachandran base their recommendations to improve access to and quality of\u00a0abortions in India on these findings, which can be summarized as lack of government action to ensure safe\u00a0abortions; and a dearth of licensed and affordable\u00a0abortion\u00a0providers.\nThe paper is useful to understand State attitudes towards\u00a0abortion\u00a0access, which co-relate with its failure to prioritize access to safe\u00a0abortions. At present, the right to access\u00a0abortions is treated as a negative right, wherein the State does not interfere with or enact barriers to\u00a0abortions. By highlighting State inaction which impacts the right to health and reproductive autonomy of women, the paper lends support to practical considerations for recognizing\u00a0abortion\u00a0as a positive, fundamental right.\n \nTAGS: Abortion, Abortion access, Medical Termination of Pregnancy, Right to privacy, Sexual Autonomy\n\nResources\n\nThe Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 | \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nThe Supreme Court\nTeam\nCareers\n\n \n\nConnect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinkedIn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwitter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFacebook\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInstagram\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\nExplore\n\nCases\nJudges\nAnalysis\nChannel\nCourt Data\n\n \n \n\n\u00a9 Legal Observer Trust 2024|\nPrivacy Policy|\nTerms of Use\n\nD4, Dona Cynthia Apartments, 35, Primrose Road, Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru \u2013 560025, India\nA20, Lower Ground Floor/Basement, Nizamuddin East, New Delhi - 110013, India\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
