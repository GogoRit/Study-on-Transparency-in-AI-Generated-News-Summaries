Kirsten Gillibrand's comments on abortion Planned Parenthood of New York\u2019s decision to remove\u00a0Margaret Sanger's name from one of its clinics\u00a0fell short since the organization continued to carry out the eugenicist's \"racist\" mission, several Black pro-life leaders told Fox News.    \u201cFor me, this was kind of like changing the name of Auschwitz,\u201d said Roland Warren, the CEO of Care Net, on Wednesday.Planned Parenthood of Greater New York [PPGNY]\u00a0claimed it made the move \u201cas a public commitment to reckon with its founder\u2019s harmful connections to the eugenics movement.\u201d  But, Warren and several other Black leaders accused the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider of making a largely \u201cpointless\u201d change while disproportionately ending the lives of\u00a0large portions of their population.  Christina Bennett, an anti-abortion speaker, likened Tuesday\u2019s move to an organization removing a slave owner\u2019s name while their employees participate in human trafficking.\u00a0And given the expanded access to abortion later in pregnancies, Bennett said PPFA has taken Sanger\u2019s intentions to another \u201clevel.\u201d  \u201cThis blatant game of \u2018genocide-lite\u2019 by Planned Parenthood is both deeply troubling and false-hearted,\u201d said Angela Stanton-King, who\u2019s running for John Lewis\u2019 congressional seat in Georgia. \u201cTheir solution to this truth is to erase her name off of a building to \u2018erase\u2019 generations of harm. Margaret Sanger historically wanted to do harm to people and populations of color. Her original fundamentals remain intact and endemic to this day.\u201d VideoThe Planned Parenthood Federation of America [PPFA] fired back.\u00a0\u201cBlack women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available. Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantliziling. The real threat to Black communities\u2019 safety, health, and lives stems from lack of access to quality, affordable health care, police violence and the criminalization of reproductive health care by anti-abortion opposition. At Planned Parenthood, we trust and we stand with Black women who have, and continue to lead the charge when it comes to the health, rights, and bodily autonomy of those in their communities,\u201d said Nia Martin-Robinson, the group\u2019s director of Black leadership and engagement.  PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S NEW YORK CHAPTER DISAVOWS FOUNDER MARGARET SANGER OVER RACIST EUGENICSAs activists repeatedly have noted, Black babies have long been disproportionately aborted in comparison to their share of the population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed this trend last November when it released its most recent report, which covered abortion trends in 2016.  Despite their lower population levels, non-Hispanic Black women accounted for the largest percentage of abortions (38 percent), while on-Hispanic white women accounted for 35 percent. And out of 1,000 live Black births, 390 Black children were aborted in 2016, according to the CDC.    The pro-choice Guttmacher Institute, which previously functioned as the research arm of Planned Parenthood, similarly reported that Black, non-Hispanic women saw the highest abortion rate (27.1 per 1,000 women aged 15-44) in 2014, compared to other racial groups. That was nearly three times the rate of white abortions (10 per 1,000 women aged 15-44).It\u2019s important to note that while Planned Parenthood has been the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, reporting has indicated the group performs less than half of all abortions in the U.S. For example, Guttmacher estimated that a total of 862,320 abortions were performed in 2017. Planned Parenthood, which reports based on fiscal year, claimed in its 2016-2017 report that it performed 321,384 abortions. That number was 332,757 in its 2017-2018 annual report.Planned Parenthood hasn\u2019t elaborated\u00a0on how many of its 300,000-plus abortions every year are performed on Black mothers, which is likely why the Susan B. Anthony List requested that information in the wake of the New York affiliate\u2019s recent decision. Regardless, several analyses\u00a0have shown that Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics in general tend to disproportionately find their way in or around\u00a0black neighborhoods.    Some 39 percent of Planned Parenthood patients are people of color, with Latinos outnumbering people who identify as Black, according to the organization.A Life Issues Institute report\u00a0indicated in\u00a02017 that a spate of new PPFA \u201cmega-centers\u201d\u00a0targeted women of color. \u201cOur research revealed that an alarming\u00a088 percent (22 of 25)\u00a0target women of color.\u00a0Disturbingly, 80 percent target Black communities, 56\u00a0percent target Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods and 80 percent target one or more colleges.\u00a0In total,\u00a096\u00a0percent (24 of 25)\u00a0of the mega-centers target women of color, college women, or both,\u201d\u00a0it claimed.'BABY LIVES MATTER' MURAL PAINTED IN FRONT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC  Abortion in the U.S. has lopped millions of potential years off Black life, according to one study. A 2016 report examined the top causes of death among Black, White, and Hispanic Americans, and measured how much that cost individuals assuming their life expectancy was 75. Using data from 2009, the authors found that induced abortion siphoned 25,431,750 years of potential life from Black people compared to 22,721,475 from Whites and 15,479,100 from Hispanics.    Racial disparity was also observed when examining the ratio between the impact of induced abortions and other major causes of death. While Whites died more from an aggregate of other causes, Blacks died more from induced abortion. However, induced abortion took more years off the lives of every racial group when compared to a collection of other top causes of death.\u00a0 Whites saw a difference of roughly 9 million years between those deaths resulting from abortion and those other causes. For Blacks, it was around 21 million. The authors noted that abortion deaths outranked those from homicide, which was one of the leading causes of death in the Black community.Although Sanger focused her efforts on birth control, Warren told Fox News that she seemed to seek the same result as Planned Parenthood has been achieving in the 21st century -- namely, a reduction in Black population growth.  Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201cthe first of many organizational shifts to address Sanger's legacy and system of institutional racism, which negatively impacts the well-being of patients, staff and PPGNY\u2019s broader communities,\u201d according to the group.Its recent \u201cReviving Radical\u201d program has been designed to \u201creckon with Planned Parenthood\u2019s legacy and contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color.\u201d Part of that included \u201cdetermin[ing] [an] outreach plan to reach target communities.\u201d Its appeal to racial equality generally has focused on expanding health services in Black communities in order to address disparities in access. Video  TESTIMONY FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, TISSUE PROCURER SHEDS LIGHT ON BABIES BORN ALIVE, WITH BEATING HEARTS  \u201cStudies have shown that a lifetime of systemic discrimination takes a significant toll on the health of Black people,\u201d a PPFA document on \u201cstand[ing] with Black women\u201d read. It proposed the organization\u2019s \u201cpreventative services\u201d as a way to help \u201cclose\u201d health disparities. But several Black women indicated to Fox News that PPFA\u2019s minority outreach efforts reinforce the systemic racism attributed to the group\u2019s founder. The group has also defined abortion as a form of health care, which is not how anti-abortion advocates view it.\u201cProviding access to the marginalized is what they kind of grab ahold of because it\u2019s feel-goody,\u201d said Cherilyn Holloway, who founded Pro-Black Pro-Life.\u00a0She added that \u201cthere are liquor stores,\u201d along with other services \u201cseen as predators\u201d in the Black community.\u00a0Referring to abortion clinics, she said: \u201cWe have to start looking at it from that point of view.\u201d  Although the national office backed the New York affiliates decision, it seemed to paint Sanger\u2019s admittedly racial motivations in a positive light. A 2016 fact sheet quoted an article that claimed, \u201cit would have been more racist, in Sanger\u2019s mind, to ignore African Americans in the South than to fail at trying to raise the health and economic standards of their communities.\u201d    The fact sheet also acknowledged that Sanger spoke to the Ku Klux Klan -- something PPFA \u201cstrongly disagrees with\u201d -- in New Jersey but suggested: \u201cSanger\u2019s passion to spread and mainstream birth control led her to speak to any group interested in learning how to plan their reproduction.\u201dMARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S NIECE REBUKES GILLIBRAND ON ABORTION: 'CIVIL RIGHTS BEING IN THE WOMB'That positive portrayal of Sanger\u2019s racialized intentions may be reflected in\u00a0PPFA\u2019s focus on expanding into the Black community.\u00a0Live Action, a pro-life group, also has\u00a0documented how the group has posted job and internship opportunities specifically for Black people. And, PPFA\u2019s\u00a0latest annual report touted how it opened 18 of its 81 new campus chapters at Historically Black Universities and/or Minority Serving Institutions.  Issues surrounding employment came to a head\u00a0last month when Planned Parenthood of Greater New York fired its chief executive, Laura McQuade, amid complaints about abusive behavior toward Black staff. A few weeks later,\u00a0a letter from 350 current and former staffers accused PPFA of \u201cinstitutional racism.\u201d  Back in June, PPFA issued a lengthy statement on allegations of abuse and racism. It read: \u201cOur country is in the middle of a racial justice reckoning \u2014\u00a0one that includes Planned Parenthood. We know we cannot address structural racism or white supremacy in this country without addressing our own. It spills out in the ways we have not yet successfully and publicly reckoned with our history, adequately supported the staff who make our work possible, and in the make-up of our leadership at national and affiliate levels. It ultimately stands in the way of fulfilling our mission.\u201cOur work demands that we hold ourselves to high standards. We must ensure that Planned Parenthood workplaces are safe and supportive environments for patients, volunteers, and staff at all levels. This includes reckoning with and addressing directly our own internal and structural racism \u2014 both historic and current \u2014 which harms Planned Parenthood staff, our Black staff in particular. Every person in leadership, including in the national office and affiliate CEOs, must take this responsibility seriously.    KANYE WEST GETS EMOTIONAL ON PRO-LIFE CAUSE AT FREEWHEELING EVENT: 'NO MORE PLAN B. PLAN A.'\u201cThis is the work we must do. As we take steps to address this situation, we reaffirm our commitment to ending implicit bias and structural racism within our organization at all levels. We owe this to all Planned Parenthood staff and the people and communities we serve.\u201d  Bennett and Holloway indicated a more sinister impact, though, suggesting that PPFA branded itself as pro-Black while feeding them disinformation about their bodies. \u201cYou\u2019re still dismembering children \u2026 lying to [Black women] about fetal development, saying it\u2019s a clump of tissue, and not giving them the care that they need, then you\u2019re doing exactly what Sanger wanted,\u201d Bennett said. Marcia Lane-McGee, a member of the board of New Wave Feminists, similarly suggested PPFA should \u201chelp to actually plan for parenthood instead of suppressing and terminating it.\u201d  Guttmacher has pushed back on the claim that abortion clinics targeted minority neighborhoods by publishing data showing that most abortion providers (6 in 10) have been located in majority-white neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the proportion of majority Black neighborhoods was much smaller (6 percent).A study from the anti-abortion group Life Dynamics Corporation claimed Planned Parenthood and other family planning facilities \"targeted\" minority\u00a0communities. \u201cNot only is this racial targeting widespread, its scale is often enormous,\u201d the 2011 study read.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    \u201cWe found 42 states with family planning facilities in ZIP codes where the Black and/or Hispanic populations exceeds 200\u00a0percent of the state\u2019s overall percentage. More telling is that these percentages routinely go far beyond even this level.
