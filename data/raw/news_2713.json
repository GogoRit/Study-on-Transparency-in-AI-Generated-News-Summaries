The decision is being appealed to UNI President Mark Nook.Some\u00a0members of the student Supreme Court issued a dissenting opinion,\u00a0which\u00a0says that members of the legislative branch of the student government knew they were breaking school policy by denying the student group's right to form.\"The majority opinion has predicted actions of UNI Students for Life \u2014 sowing unrest on campus and depriving others of their rights \u2014 that go far beyond the logical scope of this case,\" the dissenting opinion reads.The UNI administration issued a statement last week saying that it would\u00a0not uphold decisions that violate the First Amendment and university policy.\u00a0\"The University of Northern Iowa is committed to protecting our students\u2019 First Amendment rights and is concerned that recent actions by the student government violated UNI policy by rendering a decision that was not content-neutral,\" the statement reads.Students for Life organizers\u00a0have\u00a0contacted legal counsel.\u201cDespite the school\u2019s own rules that viewpoint discrimination is not acceptable, student government leaders attacked fellow students for their pro-life views and denied a request for a new club based on their personal support of abortion,\u201d reads a statement released Friday by Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins.Students for Life of America is a national nonprofit advocating\u00a0to end abortion through youth activism. There are more than 1,250 chapters in all 50 states, mostly on college campuses, with some chapters at high schools and middle schools.The majority decision of the\u00a0student Supreme Court says that Students for Life's application lacks a\u00a0\"good faith\" policy requirement needed to form a student\u00a0group.\u00a0UNI\u00a0policies say that registration of a student organization does not imply that the student government endorses the viewpoints or activities of the organization.Students for Life\u00a0is intertwined in\u00a0a national debate over whether\u00a0colleges are discriminating against conservative viewpoints. Students for Life of America has\u00a0praised President Donald Trump's 2019 Executive Order\u00a0on free speech on college campuses and taken part in an Evangelicals for Trump campaign event.\u00a0UNI is one of three public universities governed by Iowa's\u00a0Board of Regents. The two other universities are already enmeshed in skirmishes about free speech.The University of Iowa is in the midst of a legal battle after a Christian student group banned a gay man from leadership based on religious values.\u00a0In\u00a0BLinC v. University of Iowa, the student group is asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to side with the group's\u00a0decision to bar the student from the group.Iowa State University took\u00a0\u201ccorrective action\u201d in August after a professor\u2019s syllabus prohibited students from submitting material that opposed Black Lives Matter, gay marriage, abortion\u00a0and other topics.\u00a0UNI's student Supreme Court argued in its majority decision that Students for Life's proposed student group constitution was vague. It also said that\u00a0its ties to the national organization have the potential to create a hostile environment.\u00a0\"The University has spent the last year advocating for diversity on campus, (and) allowing this organization will not support the progress that has been made through the efforts of other students and campus organizations,\" the Supreme Court majority decision reads. \"The national chapter for Students For Life does not uphold the morals/standards nor policies when it comes to equity, diversity, inclusion, and social justice that are found here at the University of Northern Iowa.\"\u00a0In reference to a school policy that mandates\u00a0all students should be treated with dignity and respect, the student Supreme Court wrote\u00a0that\u00a0\"Allowing this organization that openly disregards the rights of women and other subsequent groups is not demonstrating or upholding this policy.\"UNI's policy on discriminatory harassment defines a hostile environment as \"one that unreasonably interferes with, limits, or effectively denies an individual's educational or employment access, benefits, or opportunities. This discriminatory effect results from harassing verbal, written, graphic, or physical conduct that is severe or pervasive and objectively offensive.\"\u00a0Cleo Krejci covers education for the Iowa City Press-Citizen.
