An express bill. Tell me if this is not genocide? When they don\u2019t want to show what an abortion is! This is it\u00a0 and they don\u2019t want to show it. They are hiding the truth, we are not foolish people,\u201d Mariana Ledger, an anti-abortion activist, told Al Jazeera.\nThe initiative includes a parallel bill which will face a separate vote to assist women who want to continue with their pregnancies and face severe economic or social difficulties.\nArgentine law currently only allows the voluntary interruption of pregnancy when there is a serious risk to the mother or in the event of rape, although activists say many women often do not receive adequate care.\n\u201cEvery year thousands are hospitalised because of complications with clandestine abortions and that\u2019s why President Alberto Fernandez says it\u2019s a matter of public health,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Teresa Bo, reporting from Beunos Aires, said.\n\u201cFor these women legalising abortion is a major step towards achieving equality, not only in Argentina but in Latin America as well.\u201d\nWhile the current government is strongly behind the bill, that was not the case in 2018 during the conservative administration of Mauricio Macri.\nArgentine law currently only allows the voluntary interruption of pregnancy when there is a serious risk to the mother or in the event of rape [Victor R.
