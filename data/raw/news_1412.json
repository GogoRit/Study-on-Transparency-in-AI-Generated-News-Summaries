(Whitney Downard / Indiana Capital Chronicle)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Owen County judge issued a preliminary injunction Thursday in a lawsuit that seeks to strike down Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban \u2014 halting the state\u2019s new abortion law that officially took effect Sept. 15.\u00a0\nJudge Kelsey Blake Hanlon, a Republican, said in her ruling that the ban \u201cmaterially burdens the bodily autonomy of Indiana\u2019s women and girls by significantly and arbitrarily limiting their access to care.\u201d\nShe added that the \u201cpublic interest will be disserved\u201d without the injunction. \nStory continues below.\nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe public will continue to be subject to the previous abortion regulation regime that was significantly influenced by the United States Supreme Court juris prudence that identified and expressly reaffirmed privacy right that included abortion for nearly 50 years,\u201d Hanlon wrote in her motion, adding that a temporary pause on enforcement of the ban will last \u201clong enough for the court to address the issue on the merits.\u201d\nThe court challenge up for debate was filed in Monroe County Circuit Court last month by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center.\nThey argue that the abortion ban blocks patients from exercising a \u201cfundamental right to privacy,\u201d which the Indiana Constitution protects as an individual liberty. The Supreme Court of the United States in June ruled that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee abortion rights.\n  Indiana Solicitor General Tom Fisher speaks to reporters from outside the Monroe County Circuit Court in Bloomington, Indiana, on Sept. 19, 2022. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)\nOral arguments in the case were heard Monday in Monroe County. ACLU of Indiana Legal Director Ken Falk said the state legislature had overstepped the Indiana Constitution. He argued the constitution endows people with certain inalienable rights, including the right to privacy.\nIndiana Solicitor General Tom Fisher, arguing on behalf of the state, emphasized that the state constitution does not explicitly ensure that right: \u201cThere just isn\u2019t enough there to one, identify a right to privacy or two, translate it over to the abortion right.\u201d\nThe ban outlaws most abortions except in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly or serious health risk to the mother. One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime. Rape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also strips abortion clinics of their state medical licenses, and provides that only hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers can provide abortions.\nUnder the injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law will stand \u2014 allowing abortion up to 20 weeks. It also means abortion clinics can again perform the procedure.\nStill, the pause on the ban only applies to Marion, Monroe, Hendricks, Lake. St. Joseph, Tippecanoe and Warrick Counties. Local prosectors in those counties are defendants in the ACLU of Indiana lawsuit.\nHanlon\u2019s ruling prohibits them \u2014 or the state Medical Licensing Board \u2014 from enforcing the new law. In those counties, physicians can continue to offer abortions, as previously allowed in the state, prior to Sept. 15.\u00a0\nAs such, Planned Parenthood will resume abortion care in Indiana starting Thursday, Katie Rodihan, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.\u00a0\nRepresentatives at \u200b\u200bPlanned Parenthood previously said they would keep their four Indiana clinics open, but only to provide contraception, sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment, and cancer screenings.\n\u201cIn recent months, Indiana has become an important regional hub to provide abortion care to patients in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and beyond. As so many nearby states have banned abortion, we have seen an influx in out of state patients coming to Indiana for care,\u201d Rodihan said. \u201cThis makes today\u2019s preliminary injunction even more important \u2013 every day that we can provide abortion care, is a day that the people of Indiana have control over their bodies and their future. This is a win for the entire state.\u201d\n  Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (Photo from National Association of Attorneys General)\nBut Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said his office plans to appeal the preliminary injunction and \u201ccontinue to make the case for life in Indiana.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOur office remains determined to fight for the lives of the unborn, and this law provides a reasonable way to begin doing that,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday.\nIn its appeal, the state is likely to request that Hanlon\u2019s ruling be suspended while the lawsuit continues to play out in court. That means the near-total abortion ban would take effect again.\nHanlon, of the Owen County Circuit Court, accepted an appointment as special judge earlier this month. That was after two elected Democratic judges in neighboring, liberal-leaning Monroe County declined to take on the case. They did not give any reasons as to why they recused themselves.\nFollowing the ruling, the ACLU of Indiana said in a statement on behalf of the plaintiffs that the groups \u201care grateful that the court granted much needed relief for patients, clients and providers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut this fight is far from over,\u201d the plaintiffs said Thursday. \u201cIndiana lawmakers have made it abundantly clear that this harm, this cruelty, is exactly the reality they had in mind when they passed SB 1. There are 1.5 million people of reproductive age in the state of Indiana, and every single one of them deserve the right to make their own decisions about their bodies, families, and futures.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Indiana Right to Life president and CEO Mike Fichter emphasized that the blockage of Indiana\u2019s new law \u201cmeans over 161 unborn children will continue to lose their lives to abortion every week this injunction stays in effect.\u201d\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the judge\u2019s acknowledgement of the state\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting unborn babies and are hopeful the blockage will be brief,\u201d Fichter said in a statement Thursday.\nGOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, who signed the ban into law, will \u201cclosely follow this court case as it unfolds,\u201d said Erin Murphy, a spokesperson for the governor\u2019s office.\n\u201cLaws, especially ones that carry with them significant change in policy, are frequently challenged in court and SEA 1 is no different,\u201d she said in a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.\nRepublican legislative leaders who helped push the ban through did not provide statements on the preliminary injunction, despite saying previously they were confident the ban would hold up in court.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXJudge issues preliminary injunction, pausing Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle September 22, 2022\nJudge issues preliminary injunction, pausing Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle September 22, 2022\n An Owen County judge issued a preliminary injunction Thursday in a lawsuit that seeks to strike down Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban \u2014 halting the state\u2019s new abortion law that officially took effect Sept. 15.\u00a0\nJudge Kelsey Blake Hanlon, a Republican, said in her ruling that the ban \u201cmaterially burdens the bodily autonomy of Indiana\u2019s women and girls by significantly and arbitrarily limiting their access to care.\u201d\nShe added that the \u201cpublic interest will be disserved\u201d without the injunction. \nStory continues below.\nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe public will continue to be subject to the previous abortion regulation regime that was significantly influenced by the United States Supreme Court juris prudence that identified and expressly reaffirmed privacy right that included abortion for nearly 50 years,\u201d Hanlon wrote in her motion, adding that a temporary pause on enforcement of the ban will last \u201clong enough for the court to address the issue on the merits.\u201d\nThe court challenge up for debate was filed in Monroe County Circuit Court last month by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center.\nThey argue that the abortion ban blocks patients from exercising a \u201cfundamental right to privacy,\u201d which the Indiana Constitution protects as an individual liberty.
