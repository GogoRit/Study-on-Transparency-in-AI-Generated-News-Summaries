Among those with questions are the nation\u2019s future doctors. \n    \n\n            Morgan Levy, a medical school student at the University of Miami, said the impacts of the ruling immediately became a point of discussion among her peers. She\u2019ll be applying to residency training programs this fall, and now has to assess whether the new laws will affect what she\u2019s taught and how. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new medical terms glossary is part of a broader, ongoing effort to make conception and pregnancy language more humane. \n\nShutterstock/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n36% of US counties are 'maternity care deserts,' raising risks for women and babies, new report finds\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cMore than ever, I recognize the importance of good, comprehensive, evidence-based reproductive health care,\u201d said Levy, who plans to train as an ob/gyn. In some states, though, it has become \u201call but impossible\u201d to get formal family planning training, including abortion practices. \n    \n\n            \u201cThere is definitely a consideration of making sure that the training programs that I\u2019m applying to are going to be able to provide the kind of training that I\u2019m going to need in order to be able to do that for my patients,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            And new data suggests that these restrictions are having an impact on where \u2013 and what \u2013 future doctors plan to practice. \n    \n\n            The number of medical school students who applied to residency training programs ticked down last year, and applications to programs in states with abortion bans dropped the most, according to a new analysis from the Association of American Medical Colleges. \n    \n\n            Interest in the ob/gyn speciality took a notable dip, with applications dropping 5% nationwide and twice as much in states where abortion is banned. Emergency medicine also saw a significantly large drop in applications. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan Levy is a medical school student at the University of Miami.\n\nCourtesy Rebecca Barnett\n\n\n\n            Despite the decline in applications, all ob/gyn residency positions and most others were filled. So while there\u2019s no immediate shortage of physicians in-training, experts say the shift is reason for concern. \n    \n\n            \u201cI worry about exacerbating these maternal health care and abortion deserts that already exist. We already have a gap,\u201d said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn in New Jersey and chair of the board of directors for Physicians for Reproductive Health. \u201cBecause of that, we need more ob/gyns to join the field to help build up practice in places where we\u2019re losing providers for other reasons.\u201d\n    \n\n            More than a third of US counties have limited or no access to maternity care, according to a recent report \u2013 and there\u2019s notable overlap between maternity care deserts and states where abortion access is limited.\n    \n\n            Most physicians stay in the area that they trained. If programs in states with abortion bans shift to less desirable training plans, more and more students could prioritize being in less restrictive states for residency \u2013 and eventually to practice.\n    \n\n            Long-term, that could create a \u201ctiered system of health care,\u201d Brandi said. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nMaternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road   \n\n\n\n\n            However, experts say it will be important to track the preferences for medical school students in the years to come. Last year\u2019s graduating class applied to residency programs just months after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. They had to make decisions before seeing exactly how the programs would react and adjust. \n    \n\n            \u201cFor the next year or two, things are gonna be really uncertain for people. And I think that many people didn\u2019t want to engage in that uncertainty, not knowing what they were signing up for,\u201d Brandi said. \n    \n\n            For Levy and others, perhaps more important than the specific location of a program is evidence that there is a strong and well-established commitment to training around family planning.\n    \n\n            \u201cThat\u2019s really a green flag to me when programs have a really formal plan in place,\u201d Levy said.  \n    \n\n            The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell has long participated in the Ryan Residency Training Program that offers a specific focus on abortion and family planning. \n    \n\n            Dr. Nagaraj Gabbur, who is the director of the ob/gyn residency program there, said that this specialized curriculum is usually one of the top reasons applicants give for why they want to practice there \u2013 and especially in the latest round of interviews. \n    \n\n            For programs outside of \u201chaven states\u201d like New York, this could involve an out-of-state rotation.\n    \n\n            But for Brandi, rotational programs are just a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d that don\u2019t address the underlying issues challenging reproductive health care \u2013 and don\u2019t consider the livelihood of the individual trainee.\n    \n\n            Also, most of the physicians in the ob/gyn field are women. Even if certain training programs suffice, there might be personal concerns about living in states where abortion is banned, she says. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis may impact not only the care that they want to provide as physicians, but also the care they can receive themselves,\u201d Brandi said. \n    \n\n            As Levy and her peers consider a major step forward for their lives and career, discussions on the topic are constant \u2013 and complicated.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s not a black or white or red versus blue kind of issue,\u201d Levy said. \n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n  \n\n\n\n\n            There are a lot of mixed emotions as people weigh many different factors, including clinical interests, logistics of the role, personal preference for location and broader implications. \n    \n\n            Some feel strongly that they should train in a state that has preserved access to abortion, while others, like Levy, feel that there may be opportunity for advocacy in more restrictive environments.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s almost less so about the state itself and more so about the program\u2019s attitudes and responses to the decision and the ways in which they\u2019ve affirmed their commitment to making sure great care is provided in their states,\u201d Levy said.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
