Wade, pro-abortion activists have unrelentingly attempted to silence and scare pro-life Americans, directing their violent rage at pro-life organizations that assist mothers and families with unplanned pregnancies, churches, and even direct attacks on individuals. Meanwhile, pro-abortion\u202flegislators have touted barbaric policies \u2013 including abortion up until birth \u2013 while gaslighting many into thinking these proposals are mainstream.\u202fThese attacks should only motivate pro-lifers to trust their convictions and continue fighting for\u202flife.\u00a0    Thankfully, pro-life leaders are already boldly standing up for the unborn. Just recently, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-SC, introduced the\u202f\"Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act,\" which would protect unborn babies from abortions after 15 weeks, a point by which science shows they can feel the excruciating pain of abortion. The bill is just one step toward modernizing our nation\u2019s laws as we advance our mission to ensure every unborn life is protected under the law.\u00a0Acting on the will of the people in their states, pro-life legislators at the state level have the opportunity to enact even stronger protections for the unborn. Georgia\u2019s recently enacted heartbeat law, for example,\u202fwill protect\u202fthousands of\u202funborn children in the state from abortions after the point their heartbeat can be detected, typically around five-six weeks. The law also allows parents to\u202fclaim their unborn children as\u202fdependents on state income taxes and offers child support to expecting mothers. \u00a0  TOP DEMS SILENT AFTER KATIE HOBBS SUPPORTS NO LEGAL LIMITS ON ABORTION  Similarly, in Indiana,\u202fGov. Eric Holcomb\u202frecently signed a new policy into law that protects the unborn from abortion throughout the entire pregnancy with some exceptions.\u202f  Pro-abortion politicians, like Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman, no longer hide their radicalism. Fetterman, lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania and Democratic senate candidate, speaks during an abortion rights rally at Montgomery County Community College in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, on Sunday, Sept. 11, 2022.\u00a0 (Michelle Gustafson/Bloomberg via Getty Images)  Thanks to courageous leaders around the country who haven\u2019t given way to pro-abortion fearmongering, misinformation and intimidation tactics, potentially 200,000 lives\u202fa year will be saved nationwide.\u00a0Meanwhile, pro-abortion radicals in Congress, backed by the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain Planned Parenthood, as well as extremist groups like NARAL and EMILY\u2019s List, are\u202fworking to bring about an even more pro-abortion status quo than existed under Roe. The deceptively named \"Women\u2019s Health Protection Act\" would nullify new and existing state protections for the unborn around the country, including the most modest measures like parental notification and informed consent, and force all states to allow abortion on demand, up until birth, performed by non-doctors. Taxpayers would, of course, be forced to foot the bill \u2013 regardless of their objections. Democrats in Congress have now had four votes on this extreme legislation, leaving no doubt of their priorities if they gain enough Senate seats in November to do away with the legislative filibuster.\u00a0\u00a0  Pro-abortion politicians no longer make an attempt to hide their radicalism on this topic. Candidates like Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Ohio Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan,\u202fand\u202fPennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman\u202fhave repeatedly refused to name a single protection that they would support for the unborn child;\u202frejecting proposals to limit late-term abortion, even when the baby feels pain or is viable outside the womb. Most Americans reject this position\u202f\u2013 in fact, polling shows that 90% of Americans\u202foppose abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, and that 72% support protecting the unborn after 15 weeks. \u202fCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\u00a0It is not enough for pro-abortion Democrats to support so-called \"choice,\" they have made it clear the only choice they support is abortion. Vice President Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have repeatedly called for a \"crackdown\" on pregnancy care centers, popular community-based organizations that exist to serve women who want alternatives to abortion. The FBI just recently raided the home of a pro-life activist father of seven, as if he were a serial killer.\u202fUnder the direction of the Biden administration, the FBI and DOJ have done practically nothing to protect the victims of the more than 150 incidents of firebombing, vandalism and attacks against pro-life organizations and churches around the country. That\u2019s why our respective organizations and other pro-life groups have recently sent a Freedom of Information Act request to learn what the Biden-Harris-Garland Justice Department has discussed doing about such horrific violence.

Our view that unborn children possess equal dignity under the law and are worthy of protection is rooted in basic justice\u202fand our country\u2019s founding documents, which unequivocally promise all Americans the inalienable right to life. \u00a0We\u2019ve both spent the bulk of our lives fighting to protect the defenseless and urge our fellow pro-life Americans to thank God for the victory in Dobbs and recognize that now\u202fis not the time to slow down. We must continue advocating for the unborn more boldly\u202fthan ever.\u00a0CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MIKE PENCE\u00a0    CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARJORIE DANNENFELSERFormer Vice President Mike Pence is the Chairman of the issue advocacy organization, Advancing American Freedom.\u00a0  Mike Pence served as the 48th vice president of the United States.                  \n\n\n\n\nGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.\nArrives Daily\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n     \n          U.S.\n         \n            Crime\n          \n            Military\n          \n            Education\n          \n            Terror\n          \n            Immigration\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Personal Freedoms\n          \n            Fox News Investigates\n          \n            Digital Originals\n          \n          Politics\n         \n            Executive\n          \n            Senate\n          \n            House\n          \n            Judiciary\n          \n            Foreign Policy\n          \n            Polls\n          \n            Elections\n          \n          World\n         \n            U.N.\n          \n            Conflicts\n          \n            Terrorism\n          \n            Disasters\n          \n            Global Economy\n          \n            Environment\n          \n            Religion\n          \n            Scandals\n          \n          Opinion\n         \n          Media\n         \n            FOX Nation Coverage\n          \n          Entertainment\n         \n            Celebrity News\n          \n            Movies\n          \n            TV News\n          \n            Music News\n          \n            Style News\n          \n            Entertainment Video\n          \n          Sports\n         \n            NFL\n          \n            College Football\n          \n            MLB\n          \n            NBA\n          \n            NHL\n          \n            Golf\n          \n            Tennis\n          \n            Soccer\n          \n            UFC\n          \n            WWE\n          \n          Lifestyle\n         \n            Health\n          \n            Food & Drink\n          \n            Auto\n          \n            Travel & Outdoors\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            House & Home\n          \n            Fitness + Well-being\n          \n            Style & Beauty\n          \n            Family\n          \n            Faith\n          \n          FOX Business\n         \n            Personal Finance\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Markets\n          \n            Watchlist\n          \n            Lifestyle\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            Tech\n          \n          Science & Tech\n         \n            Air & Space\n          \n            Security\n          \n            Innovation\n          \n            Video Games\n          \n            Military Tech\n          \n            Planet Earth\n          \n            Wild Nature\n          \n          Watch Live\n         \n            FOX News Shows\n          \n            Programming Schedule\n          \n            On Air Personalities\n          \n            Full Episodes\n          \n            Show Clips\n          \n            News Clips\n          \n          About\n         \n            Contact Us\n          \n            Careers\n          \n            Fox Around the World\n          \n            Advertise With Us\n          \n            Media Relations\n          \n            Corporate Information\n          \n            Compliance\n          \n          Apps & Products\n         \n            FOX News Go\n          \n            FOX Weather\n          \n            FOX Nation\n          \n            FOX News Shop\n          \n            FOX News Radio\n          \n            Outkick\n          \n            Newsletters\n          \n            Podcasts\n           Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Flipboard LinkedIn Slack RSS Newsletters Spotify iHeartRadio Fox News New Terms of UseNew Privacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesClosed Caption PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility Statement \n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.
