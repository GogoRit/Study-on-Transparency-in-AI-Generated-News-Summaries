Eurocat also found that 205 babies with clubfoot were aborted in England and Wales in the same period.Abortion is classed by government as a matter of conscience, with politicians allowed to vote according to their moral, ethical or religious beliefs.\u00a0Explore more on these topicsAbortionDisabilityWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMPs\u00a0to get free vote on decriminalising abortion in England and Wales23 Feb 2024Abortion investigations causing women \u2018life-changing harm\u2019, says UK expert27 Jan 2024Abortion prosecutions are never in the public interest, says royal college22 Jan 2024Women still being harassed at abortion clinics despite buffer zone law 18 Oct 2023Telling health staff not to report women for suspected illegal abortions has firm legal basis22 Jan 2024Home Office delay on abortion clinic buffer zones leaves council to act alone15 Sept 2023Ministers accused of watering down rules around abortion clinic buffer zones 17 Jan 2024Why\u00a0UK campaigners fear drive to decriminalise abortion may stall18 Jul 2023Judge\u2019s reduction of sentence for abortion shows how law must change, say campaigners18 Jul 2023England and Wales abortion law has been settled, minister tells Commons15 Jun 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
