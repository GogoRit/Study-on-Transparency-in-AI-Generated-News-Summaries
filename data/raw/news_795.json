Wade in June, abortion access in Michigan was protected by an injunction placed on the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban in May by Court of Claims Judge Elizabeth Gleicher.\nSome Republican county prosecutors argued that the injunction prohibits them from doing their job and took the issue to the state Court of Appeals, which ruled earlier this month that county prosecutors are exempt from the injunction. That same day the ruling was made, Whitmer asked the Oakland County Circuit Court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent county-level decisions on abortion access. By evening, Circuit Judge Jacob Cunningham then granted that request and later ruled to keep the TRO in place.\u00a0\nAbortion providers argue in court to keep injunction on Michigan abortion ban\u00a0\n\nThe defense\u2019s witnesses, Priscilla Coleman, a researcher on the mental health impacts of aborton on women, and Dr. Gianina Cazan-London, an OB-GYN at McLaren Health Hospital System, fielded long cross examinations from Whitmer\u2019s legal team, questioning their credibility and how their personal beliefs affect their care as medical providers.\u00a0\nColeman, who was the first witness to take the stand, argued that her research and findings show that there is an 81% increased risk of mental health problems for women who have abortions. Her work has been widely discredited.\nAttorney Jonathan Miller, representing Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, who said he would not prosecute doctors for performing abortions in his county, asked Coleman is she believes abortion \u201cis never the right decision, no matter the personal circumstances of the woman, except when her life is in question.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBased on the data, I believe that is true,\u201d Coleman said.\u00a0\nColeman said she has been on 20 abortion-related cases as an expert witness, but has never been asked to testify against abortion restrictions.\u00a0\nMiller asked Coleman about a number of cases in other states where she testified and judges found her research to be \u201cuncompelling\u201d or \u201cunconvincing.\u201d\nColeman denied that any judge has ever said her research is not credible\u00a0 and none of her peer-reviewed publications have ever been retracted. She added that it is \u201cnot surprising\u201d when people who\u00a0 support abortion rights criticize her findings.\u00a0\n\u201cIt comes with the territory,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re publishing research, and you analyze and research objectively, and it doesn\u2019t align with a political mission, there\u2019s going to be attacks. It\u2019s just part of the process. I mean, I don\u2019t take it personally anymore. I take it as a compliment sometimes.\u201d\nCazan-London also faced a slew of questions during her cross examination after explaining why she does not perform abortions as a doctor who specializes in high-risk pregnancies.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve testified that women should enjoy all their pregnancies, is that right? What about the woman who was brutally attacked and raped? Should she enjoy the pregnancy?\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorney asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cazan-London replied.\u00a0\nFollowing this, there was a line of questioning about specific incidents in which a woman or girl was raped, incestually or otherwise.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my entire life, I have had the right to choose to make decisions about my own body. I've had reproductive freedom for 50 years. To say that somehow that's not status quo is \u2026 ridiculous. Of course it is. But it's more than that. All over the state women are outraged. We have our minds and our hearts to tell us what's right for us, to decide what to do with our own bodies, to decide whether we want to become mothers. I urge you not to take that away.\n\n\n\u2013 Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald\n\n\nAttorney David Kallman, who is representing prosecutors who want an abortion ban in Michigan, objected the questions, calling it harassment of the witness. Cunningham overruled the objection.\u00a0\nAfter referencing a statement put out by Sparrow Hospital, who previously employed Cazan-London, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney told Cunningham he wants to \u201cimpeach\u201d Cazan-London\u2019s status as a witness qualified to give any kind of medical statement.\nThe statement from Sparrow came after Cazan-London spoke at a school board meeting in 2021, where she fought against masks in schools and stated masks are dangerous, a claim that many medical experts debunked during the pandemic.\u00a0\nSparrow wrote in the statement, which was read by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that Cazan-London is not \u201ca medical expert in infectious disease or treating kids.\u201d\nKallman argued in his closing arguments that enforcing the 1931 abortion ban would be returning to the status quo.\u00a0\n\u201cThey want you to accept their request for a new constitutional right and to make it up \u2026 and then give an injunction on something that\u2019s not the law,\u201d Kallman said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.
