Wade, which is the ruling that gave people the federal right to an abortion before fetal viability. Because of this, abortion is illegal in many states. In states where abortion is legal, restrictions and rules vary greatly. The information in this article was accurate and up to date at the time of publication, but it\u2019s possible the information has changed since. To learn more about your legal rights, you can message the Repro Legal Helpline via a secure online form or call 844-868-2812.How to use this guideWe recommend searching this article for your state, as well as any state you\u2019re considering traveling to. To do this, find the Control key (the Command key on a Mac) and press it down. While holding that key down, also press the F key.Locating all mentions of your state will help you familiarize yourself with any and all applicable restrictions. States where abortion is bannedThe following states have banned abortion for people of all ages with very limited exceptions:Alabama, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomalyArkansas, unless your life is at riskIdaho, unless your life is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incestKentucky, unless your life or physical health is at riskLouisiana, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomalyMississippi, unless your life is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rapeMissouri, unless your life or physical health is at riskNorth Dakota, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape (up to 6 weeks, 0 days of pregnancy) or incest (up to 6 weeks, 0 days of pregnancy) Oklahoma, unless your life is at risk South Dakota, unless your life is at risk Tennessee, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomalyTexas, unless your life or physical health is at risk West Virginia, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incestWisconsin, unless your life is at risk Some states, such as Mississippi, no longer have a dedicated clinic that provides surgical abortion services. It\u2019s unclear whether telemedicine abortion is the only option for people who are eligible for an abortion in these circumstances.Wisconsin is currently debating the legality of an old law \u2014 predating the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 that would ban most abortions. Unless an abortion is necessary to save your life, all services are suspended until a resolution is reached. Other states have attempted to ban or further restrict access to abortion but have been blocked from doing so. Abortion is still legal in the following states:IndianaIowaOhioSouth CarolinaWyomingStates that allow abortion without restrictions on length of pregnancySeveral states don\u2019t have bans or limits on abortion based on how far along the pregnancy is. They also don\u2019t have mandated counseling, waiting periods, or ultrasounds.This includes:AlaskaColoradoNew JerseyNew MexicoOregonVermontWashington, D.C.Restrictions up to 6 weeks pregnantYou can get an abortion in Georgia until 5 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy. After that, you can only get an abortion in Georgia if:your life or physical health are at riskthe fetus has a lethal anomalythe pregnancy is a product of rape (up to 20 weeks of pregnancy) or incest (up to 20 weeks of pregnancy)Other states with so-called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d have effectively banned all abortions, no matter how early in the pregnancy, with limited exceptions.Restrictions at 12\u201320 weeks pregnantThe following state only allows abortion until 12 weeks, 0 days of pregnancy:Nebraska, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incestNorth Carolina, unless your life or physical health is at riskThe following states only allow abortion until 15 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy:Arizona, unless your life or physical health is at riskFlorida, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomalyThe following state only allows abortion until 18 weeks, 0 days of pregnancy:Utah, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incestRestrictions at 21\u201326 weeks pregnantThe following states only allow abortion until 21 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life or physical health is at risk:IndianaIowaKansasOhioThe following state only allows abortion until 21 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomaly:South CarolinaThe following state only allows abortion until 23 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life, physical health, or mental health is at risk:MassachusettsThe following state only allows abortion until 23 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life or physical health is at risk:PennsylvaniaThe following state only allows abortion until 23 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life or physical health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomaly:New HampshireThe following state only allows abortion until 25 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life, physical health, or mental health is at risk:NevadaThe following state only allows abortion until 26 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy, unless your life, physical health, or mental health is at risk:VirginiaMany states allow abortion until \u201cviability,\u201d which occurs when a fetus has developed enough to live outside the uterus without medical support. This typically occurs between 24 and 26 weeks of pregnancy, but it can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy.The following state only allows abortion until fetal viability, unless your life is at risk:Rhode IslandThe following states only allow abortion until fetal viability, unless your life or physical health is at risk:MaineMichiganMontanaThe following states only allow abortion until fetal viability, unless your life, physical health, or mental health is at risk:CaliforniaConnecticutHawaiiIllinoisMinnesotaNew YorkWashingtonWyomingThe following states only allow abortion until fetal viability, unless your life, physical health, or mental health is at risk or the fetus has a lethal anomaly:DelawareMarylandParent or legal guardian consent, notification, or bothMany states require people under the age of 18 to have some degree of parental involvement when seeking abortion services.

Learn more about the parental involvement laws in your state here.State-mandated counseling and waiting periodMany states require that you undergo counseling designed to discourage you from having an abortion before you can receive abortion services.Healthcare professionals are often required to provide false information about fetal pain, breast cancer risk, or negative psychological effects. An in-person appointment is usually required, and there\u2019s usually a lengthy waiting period afterward. The waiting period may be waived if your health is at risk, but this isn\u2019t a guarantee.The following state requires at least 18 hours to pass between the time of counseling and the time of your abortion appointment:IndianaThe following states require at least 24 hours to pass between the time of counseling and the time of your abortion appointment:Arizona FloridaGeorgiaIowaKansasMichiganNebraskaOhioPennsylvaniaSouth CarolinaWisconsinThe following states require at least 72 hours to pass between the time of counseling and the time of your abortion appointment:North CarolinaUtahState-mandated ultrasoundSeveral states require that you receive an ultrasound \u2014 usually during in-person counseling \u2014 before you can have an abortion. Although an ultrasound can help your clinician figure out how far along the pregnancy is, this requirement is often coupled with tactics designed to make you change your mind about abortion.The following states require clinicians to perform an ultrasound, show you the image, and verbally describe the image:ArkansasKentuckyLouisianaTennesseeTexasWisconsinThe following states require clinicians to perform an ultrasound and offer you the opportunity to view the image:AlabamaArizonaFloridaIndianaIowaKansasMississippiOhioThe following states require clinicians to perform an ultrasound but do not require that they offer you the opportunity to view the image:North CarolinaOklahoma The following states do not require clinicians to perform an ultrasound but do require that they present the option to receive an ultrasound to you:MissouriNorth DakotaSouth DakotaUtahWyomingThe following states do not require clinicians to perform an ultrasound but do require that they offer you the opportunity to view the image if one is performed:GeorgiaIdahoMichiganMontanaNebraskaNew HampshireSouth CarolinaUtahWest VirginiaStates that explicitly prohibit telehealth or telemedicine abortionArizona has explicitly banned the mailing of abortion pills. Montana has attempted to follow suit, but the ban has been temporarily blocked by a court order and isn\u2019t in effect.Some states have restrictions, such as the need for in-person counseling, that effectively prohibit the use of telehealth or telemedicine for medication abortion:IndianaNebraskaNorth CarolinaSouth CarolinaKansas, Montana, and Ohio have also attempted to enact restrictions on accessing medication abortion without an in-person visit with a physician. These restrictions have been temporarily blocked by court orders and aren\u2019t in effect.Where to learn moreYou have many different options for support, no matter where you live.
