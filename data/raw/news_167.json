The signs face both north and south so drivers traveling in [\u2026]\nSusan Dunlap  \n A grassroots advocacy group launched a billboard campaign Monday to promote keeping abortion safe and legal and to spark conversations about abortion access. \nThe two billboards, from ProgressNow New Mexico*, will be on I-25 near the Budagher Drive exit, between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. The signs face both north and south so drivers traveling in either direction will be able to see the message. \nThe two highway billboards both say, \u201cRape is about power and control. So are abortion bans.\u201d\n The second billboard will be on the side of a truck driving around the state Capitol building and downtown Santa Fe Tuesday. On one side of the truck, the billboard will say, \u201cVoted against abortion access? We didn\u2019t forget.\u201d The opposite side of the roving signage will say, \u201cKeep abortion safe and legal.\u201d \nProgressNow New Mexico supported the effort last year to repeal the state\u2019s law that would effectively ban abortion in the state of New Mexico if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. As long as Roe v. Wade remains in place, New Mexico\u2019s decades old ban stays dormant. But Marianna Anaya, communications director for ProgressNow, said that with the high court hearing a Louisiana case on abortion access in March, \u201cwe don\u2019t have time.\u201d She said there is potential for the landmark 1972 decision to be changed or overturned completely as early as this spring. \n\u201cRoe v. Wade is being chipped away at,\u201d Anaya said. \nAnaya equates the efforts of anti-abortion foes to overturn abortion laws with the same control and abuse of power of perpetrators of sexual assault, rape and domestic violence. \n\u201cFor any of us who are survivors of rape, sexual assault and domestic violence, we\u2019ve been told over and over that these forms of abuse take place because the abuser wants to assert power and control over our bodies,\u201d Anaya told NM Political Report. \u201cSo in the same vein we know that politicians and anti-abortion extremists are trying to assert control over our bodies by banning abortion.\u201d \nAbortion rights activists say that since President Donald Trump appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, anti-abortion groups have been working relentlessly to try to seize what they see as an opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade by launching highly restrictive gestational bans on abortion in several states. The anti-abortion groups and lawmakers openly hope the new regulations, which have all been challenged in court, will be heard at the highest court and reverse Roe v. Wade. \nIf that happens, the abortion ban still on the books in New Mexico would go into effect and would block abortion access in all cases, including rape and incest. New Mexico, which is currently one of the least restrictive states for abortion access in the country, would have one of the most restrictive laws in the land. \nAbortion rights advocates say that even rural New Mexicans, who are often thought of as conservative and in favor of restricting or abolishing abortion, support a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about abortion. \nAccording to the nonprofit advocacy group Forward Together, 74 percent of rural New Mexicans are in favor of women having the right to make their own abortion decisions. \nThe latest Pew Research Center survey on the issue found 61 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. \nProgressNow New Mexico hopes that the billboards will mobilize citizens who support reproductive freedom. \n\u201cThese billboards are part of our work to mobilize the overwhelming majority of New Mexicans who support the right of all people to access reproductive health care. 2020 will be a decisive year for the future of abortion access, and it\u2019s critical that we defeat the agenda of anti-abortion groups and lawmakers and expose them for what they are \u2014 extreme, violent and cruel,\u201d Anaya wrote in a statement. \nAnaya said the advocacy organization is prepared to \u201ccarry out this campaign as long as it takes in order to repeal the (New Mexico) abortion ban.\u201d \nSo far, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has not added another attempt at repeal of the old ban to her list of legislative priorities yet. However, she can add issues that can be discussed by the Legislature at any time during the legislative session.  \n* ProgressNow New Mexico helps find funding for NM Political Report.
