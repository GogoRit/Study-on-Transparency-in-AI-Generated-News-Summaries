Wade was overturned, Dr. Grace Ferguson treated a woman whose water had broken halfway through pregnancy. The baby would never survive, and the patient\u2019s chance of developing a potentially life-threatening infection grew with every hour. By the time she made it to Pittsburgh to see Ferguson, the woman had spent two days in a West Virginia hospital, unable to have an abortion because of a state ban. The law makes an exception for medical emergencies, but the patient\u2019s life wasn\u2019t in danger at that moment.\u201cShe was just kind of standing on the edge of the cliff,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwaiting for an emergency to happen or for the baby to pass away.\u201dIn Pennsylvania, at the hospital a four-hour drive away, Ferguson was able to induce labor to end the pregnancy. A growing number of physicians and families tell similar stories as a post-Roe fear comes to pass: Pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions are showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some doctors in states with restrictive abortion laws say they\u2019ve referred or suggested more patients go elsewhere than ever. Some women are facing harmful, potentially deadly delays.\n\nDoctors say they\u2019re forced to balance medical judgment with potential punishments, including prison time. Although even the strictest laws allow abortion to save a mother\u2019s life, a weighty question lingers: How close to death must the patient be?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t automatically go from living to dead,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cYou slowly get sicker and sicker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say when that line is crossed, said Dr. Alison Haddock, who\u2019s on the board of the American College of Emergency Physicians. \u201cThere\u2019s just no moment where I\u2019m standing in front of a critically ill patient where I know: OK, before their health was just in danger. But now, their life is in danger,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts say it\u2019s hard to pinpoint data on abortion denials when serious complications arise. Employers often discourage health care workers from speaking about them, though The Associated Press reached more than a dozen doctors and patients who shared stories of such denials.And many doctors and researchers agree that evidence, even if largely anecdotal, shows a widespread problem. In Texas, for example, a doctors\u2019 association sent a letter to the state\u2019s medical board saying some hospitals refused to treat patients with major complications because of the state\u2019s abortion ban.And at the University of California, San Francisco, researchers who invited health care workers nationwide to anonymously send examples of poor-quality care caused by abortion restrictions say they were surprised by the initial volume of responses. Twenty-five submissions came in the first six weeks. Among them were descriptions of patients sent home after their water broke in the second trimester who later returned with serious infections. One told of an ectopic pregnancy that was allowed to grow on a scar left by a previous cesarean section \u2013 which can cause uterine rupture, hemorrhage and death.\n\n\u201cThe legislators are playing with fire,\u201d said Dr. Dan Grossman, the project\u2019s leader.Dr. Cara Heuser, a maternal-fetal specialist in Utah, recalled one patient denied an abortion in Idaho despite developing a serious heart condition midway through pregnancy. The woman had to be transported to Utah for the procedure.Dr. Lauren Miller, a maternal-fetal specialist in Boise, said she regularly sees patients whose water breaks at 15 through 19 weeks\u2019 gestation, and all doctors can do is help them make the tough decision: \u201cDo they stay here for their care and just wait until something bad happens, or do we facilitate them finding care out of state?\u201dDr. David Eisenberg, an associate professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said Missouri doctors and hospitals are regularly \u201cpunting that responsibility for care\u201d when people show up with serious complications. They wind up at the university-affiliated medical center where he works \u2014 one of the few in Missouri that performs abortions in such cases. \n\nHe said patients in crisis are told: \u201cI\u2019ve got to call the lawyer for the hospital before I can figure out what I can do. \u201cThat\u2019s just totally insane and totally inappropriate and really unfortunate.\u201dThe stories are similar when pregnancy is complicated by cancer \u2014 diagnosed in about 1 in 1,000 pregnant women each year.Dr. Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said some oncologists are confused about treating pregnant cancer patients, particularly when therapies may induce miscarriage. Dr. Kristina Tocce, medical director for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said she\u2019s seen patients with life-threatening diagnoses forced to drive 10 hours or more, or fly out of state, to get abortions so they can begin chemotherapy or radiation treatment. \n\nTocce said she recently treated a Texas woman whose cancer had gone into remission but came back aggressively after she became pregnant with her second child. She sought an abortion to resume the cancer treatment that promised to keep her alive for her toddler. During the visit, she thanked Tocce repeatedly.\u201cI finally told the patient: \u2018You can\u2019t thank us anymore. We are doing our jobs,\u2019\u201d Tocce said. \u201cI said, \u2018I am so disturbed that you had to travel so far with your family and the hurdles you have had to overcome.\u2019\u201dSome abortion opponents say doctors may be unnecessarily denying abortions in life-threatening situations out of fear. Dr. Patti Giebink, a former abortion doctor who described changing her views in her book \u201cUnexpected Choice: An Abortion Doctor\u2019s Journey to Pro-Life,\u201d said it comes down to intent. If you intend to save the mother and not end the life of the fetus, she said, \u201cyou\u2019re doing good medicine.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re sort of in a period of time where all these questions come up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe legislatures are going to be working to solve some of these problems.\u201dDr. Paul LaRose, a member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he thinks the issue is overstated and those raising concerns are exaggerating.\u201cOr they may be they misinformed,\u201d he said. \u201cMost pro-life physicians would take care of the mother and do what\u2019s necessary without purposely taking the life of the unborn baby.\u201d But some women say restrictive abortion laws have put them in danger. Kristina Cruickshank of Rosenberg, Texas, thought her life was in jeopardy after a diagnosis of a nonviable \u201cpartial molar pregnancy,\u201d in which the fetus has too many chromosomes and develops incompletely. Cruickshank, 35, had thyroid problems and massive cysts around both ovaries. She was vomiting, bleeding and in pain.It was early June, shortly before Roe fell, when Texas banned nearly all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. She endured three days of agony in one hospital before her doctor could find another that agreed to the termination procedure. She thought: \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, just lay here and die?\u2019\u201dMylissa Farmer of Joplin, Missouri, faced similar delays in August. Her water broke at 17 1/2 weeks\u2019 gestation, sending her to the emergency room. Tests showed she\u2019d lost all her amniotic fluid. The fetus she and her boyfriend had named Maeve wasn\u2019t expected to survive. Despite risks of infection and blood loss, she couldn\u2019t get an abortion. The fetus still had a heartbeat. Doctors told her Missouri law superseded their judgment, medical records show. She tried for days to get an out-of-state abortion, but many hospitals said they couldn\u2019t take her. Ultimately, an abortion helpline connected Farmer with a clinic in Granite City, Illinois. She drove 4 \u00bd hours from home \u2014 while in labor \u2014 and had the procedure. After news outlets covered Farmer\u2019s story and she appeared in a political ad, the Missouri health department started an investigation into whether the Joplin hospital, which declined to comment on the case, violated federal law. The state has shared its preliminary findings with the federal government .Farmer said the experience was so traumatic that she took a permanent step to ensure nothing like this happens to her again.She got her tubes tied.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
