They weaved\u00a0their way between their counterparts with signs reading\u00a0\"I vote pro-life first\" and \"I am the pro-life generation.\"\u00a0Capitol Police separated the two groups and cordoned them to opposite sides of the rotunda. Officers also told them to stop shouting\u00a0when\u00a0the Senate went into a floor session at 3 p.m.The Senate had been scheduled to\u00a0take up\u00a0Stargel's bill on\u00a0Tuesday, but consideration\u00a0of the measure was moved to\u00a0Thursday.\u00a0Before the anti-abortion activists gathered, one woman stood along the fifth-floor railing of the rotunda, above the Planned Parenthood organizers,\u00a0in her own\u00a0silent counter-protest.\u00a0Pam Stenzel held a sign reading \"conceived in rape ... thanks, mom for my life,\" as she listened to the group chant.\u00a0Stenzel, who spent most of her life in Minneapolis but now lives in Tampa, said she supports the bill. She believes parents should be involved in a decision that is life-changing for a minor.\u00a0\"My life has value; I matter,\" she said. \"My body matters. And I don't believe I deserved the death penalty for the crime of my father.\"Contact Tori Lynn Schneider at tschneider@tallahassee.com or on Twitter @photoriphy.
