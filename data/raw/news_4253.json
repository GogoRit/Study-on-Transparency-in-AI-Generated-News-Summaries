health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08 March 2020\n\nDuring this year\u2019s International Women's Day, the world is celebrating the occasion under the theme \u201cI am Generation Equality: Realizing\u00a0Women's\u00a0Rights\u201d. It is an opportunity to reflect on progress made, call for change and celebrate women who are playing a critical role in their communities and in the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe feature two women, one from Cote d\u2019Ivoire and another from Zimbabwe, who are doing remarkable work in helping young people gain access to critical health information and services. Vimbai, a young woman from Zimbabwe\u2019s eastern Marondera city, is working with adolescents living with HIV to ensure they receive care. Nearly 1.5 million (89%) of the 1.6 million adolescents living with HIV globally live in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn Cote d\u2019Ivoire, 28-year-old Ephrasie Coulibaly Kambou heads a network of youth activists who were part of a campaign that has led the country\u2019s Ministry of Health to issue a directive on free family planning services to adolescents. Adolescent pregnancy and birth is associated with very high mortality and morbidities.\u00a0\u00a062% of unsafe abortion-related deaths occur in Africa.\nHere are the portraits of the two champions.\n\n\n \nVimbai, 21, HIV Fighter\nAIDS remains one of the leading causes of death among adolescents in most of the countries hardest hit by the epidemic. In Zimbabwe, an adolescent-friendly health service called Zvandiri, which means \"as I am\" in Shona is a peer-to-peer programme of Africaid, a non-profit organization, helping to improve the quality of adolescent health care in the country. To help HIV-positive adolescents manage their health care, Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters (CATS), see them at home, in clinics, in support groups and through SMS platforms. Vimbai is one of the CATS.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9WHO/AFRO\nTwenty-one-year-old Vimbai works full-time as a Zvandiri peer counsellor. She knows only too well the challenges of being a teenager living with HIV: \u201cMy dad died when I was three years old, then my brother died when I was seven years old. When I was nine years old, my mom also died. I'm not sure about my dad, but my brother and my mother died of AIDS-related illnesses. I was put on treatment when I was 11. No one told me \u2013 they thought I was very young and wouldn't understand I was HIV-positive. When my status was disclosed, I lost every friend around me \u2013 the people I thought were my friends then didn't want to be associated with me. For many teenagers, it's very hard.\u201d\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9WHO/AFRO\nVimbai makes home visits. She uses a counselling card game to explain Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and links people to the services they need. She provides ART and adherence counselling to adolescent\u2019s parents at home and counsels young people during routine clinic visits. She works in partnership with health facility staff to plan, monitor and evaluate the health services available for adolescents. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9WHO/AFRO\nVimbai and the other CATS of Zvandiri are participating in a life-changing peer-to-peer programme that is helping to improve adherence to antiretroviral medication among young people. The end of the AIDS epidemic will only be attained with the meaningful implication of adolescents in programmes and policies, ensuring that none of them is left behind. \n\n\n \nEphrasie, 28, youth sexual and reproductive health advocate\nIn 2019, Cote d'Ivoire\u2019s Minister of Health issued a directive to offer free family planning services to adolescents aged 15\u201324 in all school and university health centres as well as public centres. This directive follows campaigns by several organizations working on sexual and reproductive health in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Among them is the \u201cR\u00e9seau des jeunes ambassadeurs pour la sant\u00e9 reproductive et le planning familial\u201d which Ephrasie Coulibaly Kambou head since 2016.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9Ephrasie personal collection\nMs Kambou advocates policy change on sexual and reproductive health issues, specifically on access to sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents and young people. She also campaigns for better information and access to family planning services.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9Ephrasie personal collection\nTogether with her association members, they focus on young girls, especially on menstrual hygiene and prevention of early pregnancy. They provide public health information in communities. They have organized summer camps in the past three years, gathering 200 young people who are educated on family planning and sexual and reproductive health. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9Ephrasie personal collection\n\u201cThe difficulties we face are the taboos on issues about sexuality in our communities,\u201d says Ms Kambou, who is from a family where sex is a taboo subject. After several years of campaigning, she says there is a gradual change in communities\u2019 attitude towards sexual and reproductive health education. \u201cToday, the vision of people in my community is changing. Not only for me but also for the other young people who work in my organization. We are no longer seen as people who are encouraging their friends to have sex, but rather as people who have been able to get information and are giving good information to their peers. Today we can bring parents together in one place to discuss sexuality issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\n\n\n\nBakano Otto\n\n\nSenior Editor/Writer\nEmail:\u00a0ottob [at] who.int\n\n\n\n\n\nAmeyo Bellya S\u00e9kpon\n\n\nCharg\u00e9e de communication en appui aux pays francophones\nBureau r\u00e9gional Afrique de l\u2019OMS\nEmail :\u00a0asekpon [at] who.int\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp and services\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nGeneral inquiries\n\n\nWHO country offices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO Offices\n\n\nWHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\n\n\nWHO European Region\n\n\nWHO Headquarters\n\n\nWHO Region of the Americas\n\n\nWHO South-East Asia Region\n\n\nWHO Western Pacific Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRss Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
