Kevin Stitt has signed the Texas-style abortion ban prohibiting people from obtaining the procedure after six weeks. The law, which went into effect immediately, will also allow private citizens to sue individuals who \u201cperform or induce an abortion.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the Oklahoma House passed\u00a0a bill that\u00a0would ban abortions after six weeks. The bill, which was already approved by the state Senate,\u00a0would take effect immediately after being signed by the governor.\u00a0\nThe legislation is just the latest attack on abortion rights in Oklahoma, which also recently passed a bill that would make it a felony to perform an abortion starting in August. But abortion providers in the state say they\u2019re even more concerned about this new\u00a0legislation\u2014both because it would take effect immediately and because it will be more likely to survive a legal challenge. In an interview before the bill passed,\u00a0Dr. Christina Bourne, the medical director of Trust Women, which operates abortion clinics in Oklahoma and Kansas, described it as \u201ctruly terrifying.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Oklahoma Heartbeat Act is a copycat version of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which allows private citizens to sue anyone who performs an abortion after six weeks. Like the Texas Heartbeat Act, the Oklahoma version allows anyone to bring a suit against any person who \u201cperforms or induces an abortion\u201d or \u201cknowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.\u201d The Texas bill, which went into effect last September, has so far\u00a0stood up to legal challenges and drastically curtailed abortion access in the state. (At the six-week mark, many patients aren\u2019t even aware that they are pregnant.)\u00a0\nSince last fall, as many as 45\u00a0percent of the patients who have been unable to seek abortions in Texas have been coming to Oklahoma, according to the University of Texas at Austin. Trust Women, one of only four abortion clinics in the state,\u00a0has been fielding more than 100 calls an hour since September.\u00a0\nThat surge has caused wait times at Trust Women to go up from a few days to four weeks, and the clinic has even had to turn away some patients. Trust Women has also had to eliminate services like STI testing and gender-affirming care due to the high demand. But Bourne emphasized that, just as abortion providers have adapted to the influx of patients from Texas, they will do their best to adapt to the Oklahoma bill. Trust Women\u2019s Kansas clinic is already doing construction to expand its capacity for an anticipated influx of patients from Oklahoma and other states in the region that may continue to restrict access. The clinics are \u201cnot letting these restrictions win,\u201d Bourne said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s what makes folks in abortion so unique, is our deep flexibility and creativity, and we\u2019re in this to keep doing this work.\u201d\nThe Oklahoma Heartbeat Act is part of a wave of new anti-abortion legislation that has\u00a0passed this year in anticipation of a major Supreme Court decision that could gut or overturn Roe v. Wade. But even with\u00a0Roe still in place, the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act will be devastating to access in Oklahoma\u2014and, because Oklahoma has been a hub for people from Texas seeking abortions, the entire region. \u201cIn these areas, Roe\u00a0is no longer offering us protection,\u201d Bourne said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially working in a post-Roe era here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for news you can trust?\n\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n\nAN IMPORTANT UPDATEWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming up short on donations month after month.
