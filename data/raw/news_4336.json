(Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Petrice Sams-Abiodun\nOn Tuesday, November 3, we will have the final opportunity to vote on Constitutional Amendment 1, which seeks to add anti-abortion language to the Louisiana State Constitution.\nThis amendment is dangerous, and confusing. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, Amendment 1 would make court challenges to abortion restrictions extremely difficult in Louisiana. It would essentially shut down any legal avenue to overturn these kinds of restrictions. With nowhere to challenge these laws, people could lose access to abortion overnight in our state.\n  Petrice Sams-Abiodun\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the amendment\u2019s confusing language. This measure is being pushed by politicians working with coordinated opposition groups to force their anti-abortion agenda on everyone. While it\u2019s true that a majority of Louisiana residents say that they\u2019re opposed to abortion, we shouldn\u2019t let the majority overrule the rights of the individual woman.\nRestrictions on comprehensive health care like Amendment 1 harm all Louisianans, but we know that they most harm marginalized communities \u2014 people who already face barriers to accessing health care: Black people and other people of color, LGBTQ+ folks, people with low incomes, and young people. In our current reproductive landscape, we are already experiencing poor health outcomes and indicators for Black, Latinx and low-income women. If there are forced pregnancies, there will be a disproportionate increase in maternal mortality rates and poor child health outcomes.\nThe passage of Amendment 1 will have future implications for the people of Louisiana. We have seen how state policies and legislation can influence the national landscape of reproductive rights and justice. If passed, it could lead to efforts that block, criminalize or eliminate abortion services. It also could also have the potential for increased levels of criminalization against Black, low-income and other marginalized women.\nAccess to abortion \u2014 and all comprehensive health care \u2014 should not depend on who you are, where you live, or how much money you make. As this pandemic rages on and more Louisianans struggle to survive, we \u2014 and our elected officials \u2014 should be focused on expanding peoples\u2019 rights and access to health care, not taking them away.\nEven more than abortion, this is about personal freedom and bodily autonomy: No matter how you feel about abortion, politicians should not have any say in what you can or cannot do with your own body. They have no place in private health care decisions. We trust Louisianans to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. If these extremist politicians succeed in stripping Louisianans of their bodily autonomy, what\u2019s next? What rights will be limited, restricted, or outright stripped of us if Amendment 1 passes and sets this dangerous precedent?\nI am a Black woman, a mother and a native of Louisiana that has watched elected officials over\u00a0the course of my lifetime slowly pass restrictive laws that marginalize people\u2019s access to a range of reproductive healthcare services, including medically accurate sexual education and safe and legal abortions. The people of Louisiana and our children deserve better\u2026 and that is why we must vote NO on Constitutional Amendment 1.\nPetrice Sams-Abiodun is\u00a0Vice President of Strategic Partnerships for Louisiana with Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAccess to abortion should not depend on where you live\nby Guest Contributor, Louisiana Illuminator November 1, 2020\nAccess to abortion should not depend on where you live\nby Guest Contributor, Louisiana Illuminator November 1, 2020\n By Petrice Sams-Abiodun\nOn Tuesday, November 3, we will have the final opportunity to vote on Constitutional Amendment 1, which seeks to add anti-abortion language to the Louisiana State Constitution.\nThis amendment is dangerous, and confusing.
