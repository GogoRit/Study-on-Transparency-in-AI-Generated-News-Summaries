For some, the changes are joyful, a protection of human life. For others, they are terrifying, pushing them to consider scenarios that would have been unthinkable just months ago, such as having to drop out of school if they became pregnant.For this story, The Washington Post partnered with student journalists in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, Indiana and D.C. to help solicit voices from across the country.Their responses were nuanced and widely varied, reflecting the diversity of the student population and the tremendous legal uncertainty.One of the students elated by the ruling said she wept at the prospect of so many babies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives being saved. Some students spoke of their intensified fears of rape. Many were furious and said they would focus their energy on protests and politics. Students in medical fields wondered how their education might shift. Some worried about the possibility of reprisals for speaking out. In those cases, The Washington Post abbreviated the last names.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they said:Press Enter to skip to end of carouselCOLLEGE & CAMPUS LIFESEX & PREGNANCYSAFETY & SECURITYPOLITICSTHE FUTUREEnd of carouselCOLLEGE & CAMPUS LIFE\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Helena Woroniecka, 24, University of Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u009cI honestly feel like I cannot catch a break. Graduating high school in 2020 in the midst of a pandemic and trying to navigate coming of age within it was difficult enough. Now, having to worry about having my bodily autonomy taken from me and millions of other people makes me feel sad and fearful for the new school year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Lindsey Gonzalez, 20, University of Central Florida\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, it feels daunting. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lucky that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m attending a school in a state where abortion is still accessible and will likely remain. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing: I am lucky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Lizz Murray, 18, Mt. Holyoke College, Massachusetts\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing back to campus this year was more difficult than I anticipated. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d known the decision that was coming, and I still felt like the ground had been ripped out from underneath my feet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Molly Kaspar, 24, Boise State University, Idaho\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sucks. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard anyone who thinks, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is awesome. This rocks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nick Escue, 19, Collin College\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Frisco Campus, Texas\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very excited to be able to go to school in a post-Roe America. No one has been able to do this for 50 years, so I am very happy about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sara De Rosa, 19, Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was extra hard coming back to school here this fall. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy how a two-hour plane ride can take you back 50 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gwyneth Corrales, 21, Arizona State University\u00e2\u0080\u009cI go to school in Massachusetts, but my home is Arizona. This year, going back to college means I can escape to a state where I know my reproductive rights will be upheld.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Piper Corey, 19, Smith College, MassachusettsRhianna San Soucie. (Family photo)\u00e2\u0080\u009cPanic set in\u00e2\u0080\u009d after the ruling, said Rhianna San Soucie, 20, a junior at the University of New Orleans. Some students have been posting QR codes in the bathrooms with information about how to order contraceptives and how to get an abortion despite Louisiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ban, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey keep trying to hide them in the trash cans and the stalls and stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, but the stickers keep getting removed. She faults the government for that.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt feels like there is a war on women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand no one knows exactly how to fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementSEX & PREGNANCY\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jacob Ferns, 20, Concordia University, Michigan\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am lucky enough to have a strong support system to help me if I were to become pregnant. Myself and my female roommates have made a point to always have contraceptives in the home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Izzy Knight, 20, University of Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to have sex now. It seems too dangerous; the stakes are too high for me to be in a sexually active relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Italia Caro, 19, Arizona State University\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am pro-life and waiting until marriage. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I decided long ago that if I got my girlfriend of over 2\u00c2\u00bd years pregnant, I would marry her immediately and do whatever it takes to provide for her and our child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mark P., 21, University of Texas at Austin\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs soon as Roe was overturned, I booked an appointment for an IUD (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m writing this right now in the waiting room for my follow-up appointment!). College is stressful enough without having to worry about an unwanted pregnancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 McKinley Lettre, 20, Davidson College, North CarolinaYuri Singletery with her son, Midas. (Allison Lee Isley for The Washington Post)Yuri Singletery was a freshman when she became pregnant. She never considered leaving college. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was always determined I was going to finish no matter what,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was born when my mom was 19 years old. No one encouraged her to go to school. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a cycle within my family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Singletery said.Singletery got an abortion, an experience she said was traumatic.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think many people have a misconception of abortion and think people do it for selfish reasons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I felt I was treated as a number and not as a person. ... I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel like anybody actually cared about my mental well-being.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an easy thing to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo when she got pregnant again while still in school, she chose to give birth.She was determined to finish her degree. She started her final semester at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University virtually this fall because she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find affordable child care in Greensboro for her 1-year-old son, Midas. She and her partner have an apartment outside Charlotte, where he works and they have family support while they take care of Midas and she juggles school and a part-time job. She is on long-term birth control, but she worries about another pregnancy.With ongoing shortages of formula, child care and affordable housing, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty outrageous to force women to have children, and they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even find formula to feed their babies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementSAFETY & SECURITY\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Alison Turner, 20, Drew University, New Jersey\u00e2\u0080\u009cHonestly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling scared. I just transferred to this school and am still getting to know my surroundings. It makes me nervous to go to social events with the risk of being sexually assaulted. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to have to sacrifice my social life because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m scared someone will rape me and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any choice in my future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Leah B., 19, University of Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel unsafe and unimportant. If I were choosing what university I would attend again, I would not choose a school in a place where I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get an abortion if needed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Erica Kahn, 22, Emory University, Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel uncomfortable considering I know so many people who pay for college themselves. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the funds to even pay for doctors visits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ruby Maderafont, 21, Arizona State University\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have very much retracted from the scene and have been having conversations with friends who are continuing about what the \u00e2\u0080\u0098game plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially if one of our friends is assaulted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Alex Gustafson, 19, University of Idaho\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy partner and I are pretty nervous about our sexual health. He is a transgender man without hormone replacement therapy or surgeries because he cannot afford them. Thus, we are extremely careful when it comes to our sexual health. But if something bad happens and we get pregnant, there will be little that we will be able to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kay S., 18, Arizona State University\u00e2\u0080\u009cSexual assault is always a possibility no matter how careful I could be. Without the choice to make my own decision about my reproductive health, it makes me even more afraid for if something were to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Maia Witte, 20, University of Missouri-ColumbiaKiana Hawley. (Jessica Gratigny for The Washington Post)                  This summer, after the ruling, Kiana Hawley, 18, got an IUD. It was painful, she said, but it is reassuring to have it for her first year at the University of Georgia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHopefully it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep me protected and safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe ruling is constantly on her mind. It made her angry and upset \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but most of all scared.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt felt like a big takeback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, one that would disproportionately harm people with fewer options. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was definitely an attack on women of color \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially, I think, those of lower classes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut most of all, the ruling left her feeling much more vulnerable, especially as she moved at 18 to an unfamiliar place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I go out, I have mace. I also have a knife I keep on me, that my father gave me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m planning on getting a taser. Whenever I go out downtown with my friends, we always go in groups, share our locations on Life360 to make us feel safe because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all girls. So I want to make sure everyone is okay and safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementPOLITICS\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hannah Breslau, 19, University of Maryland, School of Public Policy\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs someone who is pro-life and thrilled that Roe was overturned, I am looking forward to having discussions with pro-choice students about this issue and how the pro-life movement helps pregnant women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 James George, 21, College of William & Mary, Virginia\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile living in Colorado I know my right to an abortion is protected, but I go to school in a very conservative area. I am worried about how the community will view my school and its response to this situation. I am also anxious to voice my opinions on this issue because of how conservative the area is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Caitlin Loughry, 21, University of Northern Colorado\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel the same because at the end of the day, the states can decide. They gave us the option, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly rule it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jimmy Cornette, 21, Morehead State University, Kentucky\u00e2\u0080\u009cPregnancies by younger mothers are common in this state, and our legislature and government do not reflect the values that young women desperately need. We need an empathetic voice to stand up for us, as we are barely adults ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hannah Crouch, 22, University of Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the original Roe v. Wade decision was a gross misinterpretation of the Constitution that has led to an organized genocide of literally tens of millions of humans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kara Moran, 18, University of AlabamaNoah Slayter outside the Supreme Court in D.C. (Students for Life of America/SFLAction)Noah Slayter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents hosted about 10 foster kids over several years at their home in Manassas, Va. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of people that will say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, we should just abort the kids because they might end up in foster care,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I always say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about the people that I saw that slept in the room across the hall from me that, you know, I woke up and went to school with, and all of those things \u00e2\u0080\u0094 those are real people. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying that their life should be ended because they could end up in the situation they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that as correct.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe 20-year-old started with Students for Life of America at his high school, and he is a student spokesperson with the organization as a sophomore at Catholic University.He felt a lot of energy from other students on campus this fall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a different attitude \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a higher rate of engagement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One of our clubs at school prays weekly at the local Planned Parenthood. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had an uptick in people who have gone to pray with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d People keep asking him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I help? How can I do something?\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe hopes that is the start of a real change in awareness of the options for people during and after pregnancy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be huge. We have all these states now that are banning abortion, and that will definitely leave people feeling like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the depths. They feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we really need to make sure that they know they are not alone and that they have resources.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementTHE FUTURE\u00e2\u0080\u0094  Mattheus Wardle, 18, Utah State University\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am in the process of applying to graduate schools, and I feel like my options are increasingly limited due to my unwillingness to move to a state where my reproductive rights are not protected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Alexis Hogan, 23, California State University at Los Angeles\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing how I think about graduate school. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to move to a state where my rights are restricted. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a factor I ever thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to consider.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Isabel Long, 21, University of Colorado at Boulder\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy partner and I have a plan. We will do a surprise trip to California on the down low and get an abortion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heartbreaking, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we gotta do to stay in school and continue the path we both want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Emily Radics, 20, Arizona State University\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my field, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to pursue graduate degrees.

(Family photo)When she was deciding which law school to go to this spring, Maggie Crain was convinced by the child care available at the University of Mississippi for her three-year-old son, Munro.But she was also nervous about the idea of moving to Mississippi, because she had seen the leaked draft opinion of the landmark Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was scared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery scared.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt 28, her thinking on abortion had changed dramatically from her evangelical Baptist childhood in Pensacola, Fla., where a doctor who provided abortions was fatally shot in the 1990s and protesters carried signs plastered with gruesome images. As she got older, she came to think of abortion as essential health care, not violence.She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how she could get through law school if she got pregnant again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I have another kid, it would completely derail what I could possibly do in my legal career,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.She hopes to become a federal public defender, and perhaps a judge someday.And she wondered how abortion bans could change criminal defense \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially for low-income women who would be more likely to rely on a public defender and might have fewer options with an unexpected pregnancy. In her University of Mississippi School of Law classes, law-review journals and the news, she planned to watch whether women who miscarried would be accused of illegal abortions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a woman who wants to do that kind of law, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m paying close attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore they moved from Florida, she got a 10-year IUD inserted.She told her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel comfortable going to Mississippi without one.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementcorrectionAn earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Yuri Singletery began her final semester of college virtually because she could not afford housing and child care.
