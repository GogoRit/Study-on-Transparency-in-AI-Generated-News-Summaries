Wade had been overturned, I had just completed a Vanderbilt admissions tour. I am 19 years old and very concerned about the short- and long-term effects of this Decision.\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson will impact youth and adults from conservative areas most due to the \u201ctrigger bans\u201d which provide each state the ability to enact restrictions on abortion. This will have a bearing on my college peers and in other Southeast states.\u00a0I decided to interview pro-choice students from red states which have enacted strict restrictions on abortion to learn more.\u00a0\u00a0Hear from Tennessee's Black voices: Get the weekly newsletter for powerful and critical thinking columns.Living a post Roe V. Wade worldJenesis, 17, a rising senior from Montgomery, Alabama, said she \u201ccan\u2019t quite understand why in 2022 decisions limiting rights of citizens in what is nicknamed the 'land of the free'\u00a0are still being made.\u201d As a Christian young woman, she believes this topic is \u201cone of heavy self-conflict.\u201d Jenesis does not think she would decide to have an abortion but believes every person should have a choice.\u00a0\u00a0S.I., 17, a rising college freshman from Atlanta, Georgia, was shocked with the Decision as, in her mind, Roe v. Wade \u201cwas essentially permanent.\u201d The Decision impacts almost all of her friends residing in Georgia. She thinks that advocating is how \u201c[her generation] can create the strong, nonstop pressure\u201d to push politicians.\u00a0\u00a0Faye, 24, is a recent college graduate from Sweden currently living in Nashville, Tennessee. She cannot use most forms of birth control due to the interference with other medications. She wishes the court had considered her situation as well as other similar ones. This ruling is making her reconsider how long she will remain in Tennessee.\u00a0Hear more Tennessee Voices:Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.Kaylynn Steen, 21, a rising college senior at the University of Mississippi from Brandon, Mississippi, said that \u201cthe precedent that this is setting gives an eerie feeling that this is only the beginning.\u201d She said, \u201cBlack women and the Black LGBTQ+ community who sit at the intersections of oppression\u201d will be affected most. Her commitment to Mississippi has increased, and she asked \u201cHow can I look at the state of this community and turn my back on it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Belle Gage, 19, is a rising sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis and from St. Louis, Missouri. They recognize how difficult obtaining an abortion in Missouri has been for multiple years and that the trek to Illinois \u201cwill just be more risky now. Even helping someone with transportation or financial matters on their trip to Illinois or Kansas is illegal now (although certain organizations have found loopholes).\u201d As a social activist, Belle said this must be a gender-inclusive, accessible, and anti-racist fight.\u00a0\u00a0Ranen Miao, 21, a rising senior at Washington University in St. Louis,\u00a0was previously an intern with Pro-Choice Missouri and worked at the ACLU. He said, \u201cWe're already seeing the grotesque impacts of this as people worry about losing IVF treatments, are being denied miscarriage care, and as children who survive rape are forced to cross state lines for the abortion care they need \u2013 harms that will be disproportionately felt by people who are already marginalized.\" Frustrated with his University's apolitical statement, he plans to work with his student government and regional organizations to continue protecting abortion access while centering the voices of impacted students.\u00a0Julie Edwards is the Patient Advocacy Programs Manager and Community Engagement Coordinator with Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi in Nashville.Tennessee is one of 13 states that has a\u00a0Trigger Ban, which was implemented in August, banning abortions in the State.This decision means that Southerners will travel to North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, and Illinois, despite how some of these states have bans not permitting abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. They shared that Planned Parenthood is here to support all Tennesseans.\u00a0\u00a0Ilana Drake is a sophomore at Vanderbilt University whose writing has appeared in Ms. Magazine, PBS NewsHour, and The 74.\u00a0\u00a0Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
