Image by (Peter Keegan/Keystone/Getty Images)\n\n\nBy Felicia Kornbluh\nMarch 5, 2020\n\n\nYesterday morning, I filed into the Supreme Court, took my seat, and watched history unfold: I was there to observe the oral argument for the first big abortion case of the high Trump era \u2014 June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo.\nThis case has the potential, thanks to Trump appointees Neal Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to green-light harsh new restrictions on abortion access that would make the procedure virtually inaccessible to pregnant people in huge swaths of the country \u2013 more inaccessible than it is right now. This case will not lead to an immediate revoking of the nearly half-century-old precedent that is Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion in Roe v. Wade, but if the Supreme Court upholds the Louisiana statute at issue here, state-level politicians will be far more empowered than they already are to legislate major blocks to abortion access.\nAs I sat there, trying to keep up with the constitutional back-and-forth while admiring the tenacity of the squad of New York female Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Ginsburg, I couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother, a tireless reproductive rights advocate based in New York City. What would she, and the Jewish feminists of her generation, think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForwarding the News\n\n\nThoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day. \n\n\n\nTerms(Required)\n\nI agree to the Forward's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nEmail(Required)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, what would my late mother, Beatrice Cogan Riedl Kornbluh Braun, pioneering Jewish woman lawyer and reproductive rights diehard, make of it all? Would she be shocked by the seemingly endless reversal of momentum in the feminist movement for reproductive rights, at least as it appears in opinions from the federal courts? Or would she find it par for the course, yet more evidence of the tenacity and brutality of sexism \u2013 beyond the evidence of her mother\u2019s economic struggles as she raised four children on her own and my mother\u2019s own slog through a misogynist workplace and experiences of sexual victimization?\nMy mother, who received her J.D. years before Justice Ginsburg more famously enrolled at a sexist Harvard Law School, was a passionate advocate for legal abortion. Throughout my childhood, whenever I raised the subject, she would say, with what I remember as clenched fists and a flushed face: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Felicia! They\u201d \u2013 the illegal abortionists \u2013 \u201cwere butchers! Butchers!\u201d She played a role in the landmark decriminalization of the procedure in New York State that has been remembered by one of its architects as \u201cperhaps only a footnote in history, but one that should be read.\u201d\n\nThe law Mom helped pass was a decriminalization of abortion in New York State through the twenty-forth week of a pregnancy. Her role was lobbying our local state Assemblyman, Austrian Jewish refugee Franz Leichter, who became the law\u2019s lead cosponsor.\nThat law was far more than a \u201cfootnote\u201d in history. By eliminating criminal sanctions for doctors and patients over such a long period, and imposing no residency requirement upon seekers of abortion procedures, New York became the most liberal abortion jurisdiction in the continental United States above the municipal level. Thanks to the law, pregnant people from across the country found their way to doctors in New York. Often, they were helped by the Clergy Consultation Service, a network of clergy members that included several Reform rabbis, who risked prosecution for their willingness to help patients locate safe and affordable procedures. The data from New York were unambiguous: women from out of state arrived by the thousands. The cost of abortion declined. Maternal mortality dropped dramatically, especially for African American women. As Stanley Katz, a leading legal historian and alumnus of feminist battles in Illinois, said: \u201cWe all [in the movement for decriminalization of abortion] looked to New York\u201d as a leader in legislative reform, which they understood as the most promising approach to legal change. \u201cWe never expected the Supreme Court to bail us out.\u201d\nMy mother did not have much of a Jewish education, but her views on abortion mirrored those of most Reform and Conservative Jews in the U.S., and reflected what many authorities consider to be the Jewish legal position, with its roots in Exodus 21:22: That the life of the fetus is less important than the life of the mother carrying it, and the fetus is something less than a full human.\nCountless times, my mother would interrupt conversations about healthcare with all three of her daughters with a warning to \u201cnever go to a Catholic hospital! All they care about is the fetus,\u201d she railed. \u201cNever the mother!\u201d\nMy mother was only one of a group of Jewish feminists who played vital roles in reproductive politics in the era just before and after Roe v. Wade.\n\nAs I study reproductive politics in New York, I have found a rich history of Jewish feminist activism on the issue.\nAmong fierce advocates for the decriminalization of abortion were Jewish \u201cliberal feminists\u201d such as National Organization for Women cofounder Betty Friedan and the leading attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Harriet Pilpel. Ginsburg herself strongly favored legal abortion, although her ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project did not litigate on decriminalization.\nOther leaders on the issue were so-called \u201cradical\u201d feminists who were more comfortable with public demonstrations than my mother was. These included writer Susan Brownmiller, \u201cpro-sex\u201d journalist Ellen Willis, and Ms. Magazine founder Gloria Steinem, who has dated her feminist awakening to a 1969 \u201cspeak-out\u201d on abortion in support of decriminalization in New York. Distinct from the \u201cliberals\u201d and the \u201cradicals\u201d were socialist feminists, who worked in interracial groups for legal abortion and for a wider reproductive agenda \u2014 women like attorneys Karen Stamm and Nancy Stearns, historian and novelist Meredith Tax, activist Sarah Schulman, political scientist Rosalind Pollack Petchesky, novelist Alix Kates Shulman, and historian Atina Grossman.\nIt seems that Jewish women were overrepresented in reproductive rights everywhere in the U.S., even in places where their numbers weren\u2019t as overwhelming as they were in New York.\nWhy? Perhaps, like my mother, they learned or intuited a Jewish legal preference for the mother\u2019s life over that of the fetus. And perhaps they felt the immediacy of challenges to reproductive autonomy as a result of Nazism, an object lesson in what can happen when ideas about good and bad bodies, including reproductive bodies, are weaponized by an intrusive and powerful state.\nAs the June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo case heads toward a resolution, I remember and honor all of these Jewish women activists \u2014 and I hope their hard work was not for naught.\nRelatedOur Time: A new monthly newsletter by and for Jewish women\nFelicia Kornbluh is a writer and historian, a Visiting Research Fellow in Law and Public Affairs and Visiting Professor at Princeton in 2019-2020 and Professor of History and Gender, Sexuality, and Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Vermont.\nRelated\u2018My dark secret\u2019: Orthodox women reveal their abortion stories\nFelicia Kornbluh, Ph.D. is a professor of history at the University of Vermont and also teaches in gender, sexuality, and women\u2019s studies and Jewish studies.
