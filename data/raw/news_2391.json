The abortion industry isn't willing to prioritize patient safety.I was pro-choice for decades. I performed abortions and had an abortion myself. Can't we all at least agree on importance of safety in the industry?Kathi AultmanOpinion contributorI\u2019ve killed more people than Ted Bundy.Coming to terms with the fact that I was a professional mass murderer was devastating, but it compelled me to speak the truth.I began my medical career believing the modern cliche\u0301s that women must have total control over our bodies, and that it\u2019s irresponsible and unethical to bring unwanted children into an overpopulated world. During my OB-GYN residency in Florida in the late 1970s, I went above and beyond the usual first-trimester abortion requirement and asked to learn to perform second-trimester dismemberment abortions. When faced with my own unwanted pregnancy before\u00a0entering medical school, I chose abortion.Abortions, I soon discovered, can be very profitable.\u00a0When I got my medical license in Florida in\u00a01978, I moonlighted as an abortionist on the weekends, making more money than I would have made working in the emergency room. I was amazed by the perfect little fingers and toes but treated fetal remains like any other medical specimen \u2014\u00a0with no emotion. I even performed abortions while I was pregnant. The difference was clear to me at the time: My baby was wanted;\u00a0my patients' babies weren't. I saw no contradiction in that.The only time I questioned my line of work was during my neonatal rotation, when I realized I was trying to save babies in the neonatal intensive care unit who\u00a0were the same age as some of the babies I was aborting.The path to lifeThree patients changed my professional trajectory.I was preparing to perform an abortion on the first when I realized I had already performed three on her in the past \u2014\u00a0she was using abortion as birth control. I protested doing the fourth, only to be told by my boss that I had no right to deny it to her. \u201cEasy for you to say, you\u2019re not the one doing the killing,\u201d I snapped back. I did the killing, but my response startled even me.A sad choice, but the right one:I had a later abortion because I couldn't give my baby girl both life and peaceThe second patient was a young woman there with a friend. Her friend asked whether\u00a0she wanted to see the tissue when I was done, and she replied angrily\u00a0that no, she\u00a0just wanted to kill it. \u201cWhat did this baby ever do to you?\u201d I wondered, again surprised by my reaction. I don't think I had ever thought of them as babies before.But it was a mother of four who felt she just couldn\u2019t manage another child who brought me to tears. She wept before, during\u00a0and after the procedure. It was the grief of a woman who knew the moral gravity of what she was doing that ended my abortion career.I stopped doing abortions, but I remained pro-choice. Over time, I saw in my OB-GYN practice young girls\u00a0flourish who had chosen not to abort, and older, more educated patients who had aborted struggle psychologically. Gradually, I began to see the feminist narrative that abortion empowers women as increasingly flimsy.Ultimately, I could not shake the realization that the only thing that decided the fate of the baby was whether he or she was wanted or not. The former was born. The latter was killed. The life or death of a human being should not be so arbitrarily decided.I became pro-life.Shoddy, dangerous careI now give expert testimony on the realities of abortion, like the testimonies\u00a0the Supreme Court will soon consider in the case of June Medical Services LLC v. Gee.For years, many abortion clinics have gotten away with shoddy practices\u00a0that no surgery center would be likely to get away with. This is surely\u00a0because abortion workers, legislators\u00a0and law enforcement fear that they will be accused of restricting access to abortion if they hold abortion clinics accountable.Loving abortion clinic workers, too:Pro-life movement should follow Abby Johnson's lead, turning abortion workers into alliesA former manager of an abortion clinic told me that she was instructed to use dish washing liquid to clean their instruments when their sanitizer broke down so they wouldn\u2019t have to close while it was repaired.\u00a0Inspection reports in multiple states\u00a0have found clinics not properly sanitizing their instruments.\u00a0A patient who came to me for complications from a late-term abortion said she was kept in a cold room overnight without a blanket during an induction abortion. She was forced to give birth in a toilet\u00a0the next morning, only to watch her still living baby drown.As a gynecologist on call in the emergency room, I personally treated women experiencing severe complications, including life-threatening hemorrhage and infection from abortions, because no one at the abortion clinic had admitting privileges. No abortion clinic personnel ever called to give me information on a patient they were sending to the ER.\u00a0This is not a safe way to practice medicine.When it comes to abortionists being required to have local hospital admitting privileges, the issue the court will consider in Gee, the fact is that many\u00a0physicians on staff at ambulatory surgical\u00a0centers are required to have hospital privileges\u00a0to ensure that patient care is not compromised in the event of a complication.Helping patients fight for their lives, and their rights:We met as doctor and patient, but a life-saving abortion was the start of our friendshipOne of\u00a0the reasons we are told these safety standards aren\u2019t needed is\u00a0because abortion is so safe,\u00a0but we don\u2019t know the true percent of women who experience complications.Only 28 states require abortion providers to report post-abortion complications, and states are not\u00a0required to submit abortion data to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0Abortion clinics don't want this information to come out, and\u00a0providers have taken states to court to try to avoid reporting.\u00a0Recently, a former\u00a0Arizona abortion clinic employee won millions of dollars in a wrongful termination lawsuit after she was fired for noting serious health and safety violations at her clinic.Yet Americans\u00a0were horrified when the unsanitary conditions and unsafe medical practices of convicted\u00a0Dr. Kermit Gosnell\u2019s abortion clinic were uncovered, and shocked when news\u00a0broke about Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, an abortionist who, day after day, walked out of his office with bags of aborted fetal remains, accumulating thousands, and violating endless ethical, medical\u00a0and legal standards. These are hallmarks of an unsafe industry.I was pro-choice for decades. I performed abortions and had an abortion. I understand in a deep and personal way where the fault lines of disagreement over abortion in America lie. But can\u2019t we at least all agree on the importance of safety in the abortion industry?\u00a0Dr. Kathi Aultman is an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and a member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u00a0Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
