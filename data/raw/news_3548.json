Last session, Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the Legislature by a margin of 32-17. It takes 33 votes to overcome a filibuster and vote on a bill. Last session, proposals backed by Republicans to ban abortion and loosen gun laws fell just two votes short of that margin. This year\u2019s election, featured 13 races which pitted an abortion-rights  Democrat against an anti-abortion Republican. There was also one race with a pro-choice, nonpartisan candidate running against a pro-life Republican, based on endorsements and campaign statements. Here are those races, along with the party affiliations of the candidates, and the percentage of vote each had as of 1:05 a.m. Wednesday:District 2: Rob Clements (R) 57 v.
