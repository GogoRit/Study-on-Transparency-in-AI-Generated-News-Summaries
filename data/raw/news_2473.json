After a member of the state House of Representatives, Isaac Robinson, died from suspected COVID-19, those leaders insisted it was safe to meet in large groups, calling more than 150 lawmakers and staff back to Lansing to pass frivolous bills attacking Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\u00a0\nCourt says Arizona company doesn\u2019t have to make invitations for same-sex weddings\n\nHow\u2019s that for pro-life?\nMeanwhile, anti-abortion groups were livid that Planned Parenthood of Michigan health centers remained open, allowing people who needed basic reproductive health care, including\u00a0 abortions \u2013 safe, legal medical procedures \u2013 to access them. \n\nThey issued press releases demanding we shut down and deny people essential medical care, including the birth control, STI testing and treatment, and other crucial health services.\nLet\u2019s be clear: Reproductive health care is essential. There is no more critical time for the care we provide than during a public health crisis. For many patients, our health centers are their only source for health care; the unfortunate reality is the pandemic has made existing barriers to care worse for many of the communities Planned Parenthood serves.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken every possible action to keep as many of our health centers open as possible while protecting the safety of our patients and employees alike. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve rapidly begun offering telehealth services, including birth control, UTI treatment, and emergency contraception so our patients can access the urgent care they need without leaving home.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood offers telehealth services for birth control, UTIs\n\nYet, we all know that no matter what the totality of our work is, for the \u201cpro-life\u201d movement, it\u2019s always about abortion.\u00a0\nI\u2019d argue that to be truly pro-life means to give everyone access to the tools they need to live healthy, happy lives \u2013 equal pay for equal work, paid sick time off, safe workplaces, high quality health care, basic civil rights. The services and care we provide are essential to helping Michiganders live healthy, happy lives of their choosing.\u00a0\nThere is an undeniable public and personal health benefit to diagnosing and treating an STI before it causes cervical cancer. I look around at anti-abortion groups and the conservatives in the Legislature, and I struggle to see how they\u2019re living out their self-professed commitment to protecting the sanctity of life in the midst of this unprecedented health emergency.\nIt\u2019s plain to see what they didn\u2019t do \u2013 a single thing to make the lives of Michiganders easier as we worked to stop the virus tearing through our most vulnerable communities.\u00a0\nI couldn\u2019t be prouder of what Planned Parenthood of Michigan has been doing to protect the lives of the people in the communities we serve.
