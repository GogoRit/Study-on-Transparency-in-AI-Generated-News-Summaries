The President has dramatically altered the judiciary to try to dismantle hard-fought rights and progress secured over decades \u2013 LGBTQ rights, voting rights, reproductive rights and more. Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell has sycophantically installed Trump\u2019s extreme judicial nominees and is now seeking to push the balance of the Supreme Court even further to the fringes. If she is nominated and confirmed, Coney Barrett would work to dismantle all that Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for during her extraordinary career. An appointment of this magnitude must be made by the president inaugurated in January. The Human Rights Campaign fervently opposes Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination, and this sham process.\u201d \nBarrett currently serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and earlier in her career was a law clerk and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to Antonin Scalia, one of the most steadfast opponents of LGBTQ rights. \nConey Barrett has demonstrated hostility toward LGBTQ rights in her words and rulings. She defended the Supreme Court\u2019s dissenters on the landmark marriage equality case of Obergefell v. Hodges, questioning the role of the court in deciding the case. She said Title IX protections do not extend to transgender Americans, claiming it\u2019s a \u201cstrain on the text\u201d to reach that interpretation. She misgendered transgender people, referring to a transgender women as \u201cphysiological males,\u201d while casting doubt on transgender rights. Coney Barrett has also consistently demonstrated opposition to reproductive rights, calling Roe v. Wade an \u201cerroneous decision.\u201d She also refused to rehear a racial segregation case, raising significant concerns about her approach to Civil Rights law.\nShe has criticized the ruling which upheld the Affordable Care Act\u2014which has helped millions attain quality, affordable healthcare\u2014and expressed opinions that suggest she would strike down the law. Days after the election, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an argument in a case that could undermine this transformative piece of legislation, and with it the healthcare security of tens of millions of people, including a disproportionate number of LGBTQ people. \nThe day after Election Day, the Court will hear Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which considers whether governments must allow taxpayer-funded organizations to discriminate against LGBTQ people when providing critical services. A ruling hostile to equality in this case could have staggering consequences for American social safety net programs including services for veterans, people experiencing homelessness, runaway youth, refugees, and those needing emergency shelters and services. \n \nHer hostility towards many of society\u2019s most marginalized, victimized and vulnerable groups raises serious concerns about her ability to be impartial and fairly consider the rights of all who come before the Court, including LGBTQ people; therefore, the Human Rights Campaign opposes her nomination in the strongest terms and will work steadfastly against it. Today, HRC is launching a \u201cWe Dissent\" campaign, with an ask to members and supporters to sign a pledge to \"dissent\" to this process and to Coney Barrett.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nTo make a general inquiry, please visit our contact page.
