Wade, abortion bans from the 1800s became legal matters in these states Bill KeveneyUSA TODAYA 158-year-old abortion ban became a present-day fact of life in Arizona last week when a state judge ruled it could be enforced in the wake of the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court overturning constitutional protection of abortion rights in June.In other states, long-dormant, sometimes century-old abortion restrictions passed by all-male legislatures during a time of limited scientific knowledge\u00a0are also shaping abortion policy.\u00a0\u00a0Some of those laws, which generally call for imprisonment for providers and don't allow for abortion even in the first\u00a0weeks of pregnancy,\u00a0have influenced the availability of abortion. Some are now in litigation. Others\u00a0have been superseded by more recent bans.\u00a0The bans were\u00a0invalidated by the Supreme Court's 1973\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision but weren't repealed and remained on the books in nine states when\u00a0the court rescinded Roe.\u00a0Their mere existence has\u00a0influenced\u00a0policy and health care access in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia and\u00a0Wisconsin.\u00a0The ramifications of the old laws are \"huge, enormous,\" said Jenny Higgins, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor and director of the school's Collaborative for Reproductive Equity (CORE).In Wisconsin, \"health care systems are putting their services on ice because they can\u2019t risk having their providers or patients commit felonies,\" Higgins told USA TODAY. \"It\u2019s amazing that these laws that are this old are suddenly coming back to have\u00a0an effect.\"Here are some of the decades-old abortion laws shaping the\u00a0debate on reproductive health care access.Old law prevails:Arizona's 1864 law banning nearly all abortions is in effect, judge rulesHistoric decision:Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, eliminating constitutional right to abortionSeeking constitutional protection:Michigan Supreme Court: Abortion amendment must appear on ballotWhat is the abortion law in Arizona?At the request of Arizona's Republican attorney general,\u00a0a\u00a0judge\u00a0ruled Sept. 23 that the state could enforce an abortion ban passed by the territorial legislature in 1864 and recodified in 1901, years before Arizona became a state in 1912. Abortion providers canceled appointments after the decision.A separate ban\u00a0at 15 weeks of pregnancy, signed into law this year, was to take effect the next day, but state Attorney General Mark Brnovich\u00a0said the stricter decades-old\u00a0law, which allows no time frame to attain an abortion early in a pregnancy, should take\u00a0precedence. There is confusion in the state regarding the\u00a0two different abortion laws.\"The attorney general\u00a0is arguing that the old ban trumps everything\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I think there are a lot of people who believe that that doesn't reflect the legislative consensus that there are exemptions built into the laws at this point,\" said Barbara Atwood, law professor emerita at\u00a0the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law.The judge who ruled that the 1800s ban remains in effect Friday rejected a\u00a0Planned Parenthood request to stay that\u00a0order while her Sept. 23 decision is appealed in court.The 1800s law\u00a0calls for two to five years in prison for anyone providing an abortion. As with some of the other older bans,\u00a0the only exception is the life of the pregnant woman.\u00a0Advance planning:Abortion 'trigger' bans to take effect in multiple states this week. What do they change?How is an 1849 ban affecting abortion access in Wisconsin?\u00a0The legal status of Wisconsin's 1849 ban remains murky\u00a0since a judge hasn't yet ruled on the Democratic state attorney general's effort to stop its enforcement. What is clear is that elective abortions stopped in the state after the Supreme Court decision\u00a0left providers uncertain about whether the 173-year-old\u00a0law was\u00a0in effect.\"Even though the actual enforceability of the ban is unclear, the reality of abortion care here is that it is unavailable,\" the University of Wisconsin's Higgins\u00a0said. \"That to me is the most important thing, what actually is happening on the ground.\"Beyond the direct effect on abortion access, the uncertainty caused by the ban is keeping abortion front and center in one of the swing states that will help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.\"Abortion as an issue is looming\u00a0large in\u00a0campaign ads, especially in the governor's race, but also in the U.S. Senate race,\" Higgins said.What is the old ban's status\u00a0in Michigan?In September, a\u00a0state judge issued a permanent injunction to keep Michigan's 1931 ban\u00a0from taking effect, stopping efforts by some county prosecutors to enforce a law that criminalizes all abortions except in life-saving situations.\u00a0Both Michigan's Democratic governor and attorney general oppose the 91-year-old law, which has lain dormant since the 1973 Roe ruling.The judge's ruling still can be appealed.In an effort to pre-empt enforcement of the 1931 law and other potential bans, abortion rights advocates are pushing for voters to back a state constitutional amendment protecting reproductive freedom, including abortion, that will be on the fall ballot. Advocates had gained enough signatures to qualify the referendum but needed a court to overturn a move by Republican state canvassers to disqualify the ballot question.Which law banned\u00a0abortion in West Virginia?After Roe was\u00a0overturned in June, it wasn't clear whether an 1870\u00a0West Virginia abortion ban\u00a0would\u00a0take effect. Abortion care stopped temporarily, but it started again after a judge issued a temporary injunction against the ban on July 18.With the ban's ultimate fate uncertain, Republican\u00a0Gov. Jim Justice, asked the state Legislature to \"clarify and modernize\" the century-old law in a special session in late July.The House and Senate failed to come to an agreement\u00a0then, but they returned this month to pass a stringent ban, which has exceptions for medical emergencies and, for limited time frames, rape and incest (eight weeks of pregnancy for adults, 14 for minors, with victims required to report the assault at least 48 hours before the procedure.) Justice signed the bill into law Sept. 16.Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
