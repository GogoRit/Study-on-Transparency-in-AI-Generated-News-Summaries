Idaho is one of 13 states that already effectively ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy. It\u2019s also one of a handful that already have laws that could penalize those who help people of any age obtain abortions.\n\nOne of the GOP sponsors, Rep. Kevin Andrus, told The Associated Press that the focus of the bill is parental rights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho considers a ban on using public funds or facilities for gender-affirming care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to know about developments impacting LGBTQ+ rights across the US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers expressed concern over bowed beams, structural issues before Idaho hangar collapse killed 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that parents have a say in the life choices of their children,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will do a lot to save lives.\u201dOrganizations across the country that advocate for the right to abortion portray it as an unneeded effort to make legal abortion even harder to access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, said the ban would create a chilling effect if it\u2019s adopted. \u201cThat would mean people who might otherwise be really important supports would ask, \u2018Can I be the supportive auntie or sister or friend in a situation where I want to be a support to this person?\u2019\u201d Miller said. The measure has been passed already by the state House and is now up for consideration in the state Senate. If it passes in the GOP-controlled chamber, it would still need the approval of the governor, Republican Brad Little, to become law.\n\nMack Smith, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said the bill will likely become law but that the dispute over it won\u2019t end there.\u201cIf it\u2019s passed,\u201d she said, \u201cthere will absolutely be a legal battle.\u201dA relatively small number of the abortions in the U.S. are obtained by minors. Among the 47 states that reported 2019 abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fewer than 9% people who received abortions were 15 to 19 years old. Idaho had a higher proportion than most states; about 1 in 8 people to obtain abortions there were 15 to 19.Advocates for access say most teens who have abortions involve their parents in the decision and that those who do not often have a good reason, such as an abusive relationship.Andrus, the sponsor, said he does not know how often Idaho minors have had abortions without their parents\u2019 consent. \u201cI just know that it has happened,\u201d he said.Kelsey Pritchard, spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, expects other states to consider following Idaho\u2019s approach, which she says is important to ensure that its protections for parents\u2019 rights to be involved in abortion decisions aren\u2019t flouted.\u201cThat kind of proposal is definitely something that states should be looking at,\u201d she said. \u201cIdaho\u2019s kind of thinking ahead here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN HANNA\n\n\n                Hanna covers politics and state government in Kansas for The Associated Press.
