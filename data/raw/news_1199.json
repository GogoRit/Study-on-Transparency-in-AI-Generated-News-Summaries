Months later, after Oklahoma\u2019s new ban, Planned Parenthood Great Plains has stopped scheduling surgical and medical abortions in the state altogether. For Alsaden, it\u2019s now the patients she\u2019s no longer seeing that worry her the most.\n\u201cPatients should not have to leave their communities to get health care,\u201d Alsaden said. \u201cAnd providers should not have to leave their communities to provide basic health care.\u201d\nClinics across the state, including Alsaden\u2019s, are rethinking how to connect patients seeking abortions to the care they need in other places, a situation clinics in other states may soon face if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\nTrust Women Clinic in Oklahoma City, one of two clinics not operated by Planned Parenthood in the state, said it will continue to offer abortions up to the six-week cut off. Planned Parenthood Great Plains is still offering health services including general health care, emergency contraception, birth control and HIV services. All of the clinics in Oklahoma have stopped taking appointments and are rescheduling patients, many of whom need to make long trips to other states for care.\nA state ban does not end abortion, but increases the burden and hardships on women seeking that care, said Tamya Cox-Tour\u00e9, co-chair for the Oklahoma Call for Reproductive Justice.\n\u201cJust like in Texas, the impact of this ban will fall hardest on people\u202fstruggling to make ends meet, people of color, and those living in rural areas,\u201d Cox-Tour\u00e9 said.\nIn this December 2021 photo, medical instruments are prepped prior to a surgical abortion at Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma City. Photo by Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\nNeighboring Kansas currently allows abortions up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, putting it in the position Oklahoma once held of providing care for nearby states, for now.\nState residents will vote on Aug. 2 on an amendment that would overturn abortion protections in the state constitution. If approved \u2013 and if Roe is overturned by the high court in June \u2013 then the Kansas state legislature, where Republicans lawmakers currently hold with a supermajority, could pursue new abortion restrictions, including bans similar to those seen in Oklahoma and Texas.\nKansas is the only of four states covered by Planned Parenthood Great Plains that does not have an automatic \u201ctrigger law\u201d to ban abortion should Roe be reversed.\nRebecca Tong, co-executive director of Trust Women, which has another clinic in Kansas, said the clinics were seeing a 50 percent increase in patients in recent months because of the Texas ban. Now, Tong said the Oklahoma City clinic is preparing to comply with the new state laws, while the Wichita clinic in Kansas, a five-hour round trip from Oklahoma City, is looking to expand ahead of an anticipated increase in patients from both Oklahoma and Texas.\n\u201cWe plan to provide abortion care up to the legal limit,\u201d Tong said. \u201cWe are incredibly aware of the need because our phones do not stop ringing.\u201d\nNancy Northup, president and CEO for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said \u201cthis is just a preview of what\u2019s to come if Roe is overturned.\u201d\n\u201cStates are already working together to create enormous \u2018abortion deserts\u2019 that many people will not be able to cross.\u201d\nA new reality\nSusan Braselton said the Tulsa Women\u2019s Clinic, which still offers ultrasound screenings and medication abortions, had 22 scheduled appointments for the day after the new law went into effect. But after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill, only five women were able to be seen. Braselton said those numbers continue to decrease as patients from Oklahoma and Texas now have to turn to states even farther away for care after six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe Oklahoma Senate is expected to vote on House Bill 4327 this week, which would effectively end all abortions in Oklahoma upon Stitt\u2019s signature. The bill makes exceptions for medical emergencies and pregnancies resulting from sexual assault and incest, but only if those incidents were reported to law enforcement. It will likely be challenged in court.\nBraselton, who coordinates a group of escorts who help walk patients and staffers to and from the clinic, said she wants patients to feel safe and secure while seeking care.\n\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s feeling more impossible to do by the day,\u201d she said.\nDays before the leaked Supreme Court opinion, the parking lot for the Trust Women\u2019s Clinic in Oklahoma City was filled with patients\u2019 cars, many with Texas license plates.\nA spokesperson for the clinic said staff were scrambling to help patients with scheduled abortions keep those appointments by helping them secure travel to other states, while still working to see people who still fit into the six-week window as well as non-abortion appointments for general reproductive health care.\nPatients are often only learning of the ban when calling the clinic to schedule an appointment, said the clinic spokesperson, sparking shock, fear and anger at the thought of having to travel for the procedure.\nAbortion advocates hold up signs outside the Oklahoma State Capitol in a May 4 protest after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a 6-week ban into effect in the state. Photo by Adam Kemp/PBS NewsHour\nAbortion rights advocates have held several rallies since the new restrictions went into effect, including one on Mother\u2019s Day at the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City.\nJennifer Chancellor, a professor at the University of Oklahoma, stood outside the capitol wearing a \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d shirt in the shape of a uterus, while her daughter slept in her stroller. Chancellor held a sign that read, \u201cI made my choice, now let my daughter make hers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here to protect a woman\u2019s choice to make her own decisions regarding her body,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are supposed to be going forward, not backwards. It\u2019s embarrassing for us as a state, and it\u2019s embarrassing for us as a country that we are going backward.\u201d\nFrom her home in Tulsa, Morgan Kline, 23, shared her frustrations on social media.\nAt 19, Kline had gotten engaged and bought a house with her fiance when she discovered she was pregnant. Ultimately, she and her partner decided to keep the baby, but Kline said her perspective was forever changed.\n\u201cAs someone who did have children early on, I couldn\u2019t imagine not having the choice,\u201d Kline said. \u201cKnowing that you couldn\u2019t even have any choice at all would be horrifying. You should choose the path that you would like to go down, whether it\u2019s motherhood or it\u2019s not.\u201d\nKline created a Discord server \u2013 an invitation-based chat app \u2013 to plan rallies, list resources and share funding opportunities for helping others continue to find care.\nWhat lies ahead\nAnti-abortion groups have long pointed to adoption and foster care as alternatives to abortion, and they and state leaders have been asked in the wake of new restrictions how those alternatives would be supported.\nLess than five miles away from the Tulsa Women\u2019s Clinic is Birthright of Tulsa, a nonprofit clinic that pledges to offer \u201cnon-judgemental\u201d support to pregnant women no matter age, race, circumstances, religion, marital status or financial situation.\nConnie Sullivan, executive director for Birthright, said the clinic does not offer abortion options but instead offer support from clinic staff and volunteers from the first call or visit throughout a pregnancy and after.\n\u201cWe love both woman and child,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThe Birthright motto is that every woman has a right to give birth and every child has a right to be born. We are not political.\u201d\nBirthright of Tulsa offers pregnancy tests, parenting classes, diapers, wipes, toys, clothing and select utility assistance. Sullivan said her clinic believes women need more options than the \u201cquick solution\u201d that an abortion provides and believes abortion is a \u201clonely, fear-based and always destructive\u201d solution.\n\u201cMost human struggles require and are resolved through the involvement of caring people who are willing to invest time in life-affirming solutions that do not harm either mother or baby, two separate persons,\u201d Sullivans said. \u201cBeing wanted is not a criteria for one\u2019s right to exist and be fully protected under the law.\u201d\nThe Hope Pregnancy Center in Oklahoma, which is operated by the Oklahoma Baptist Homes for Children, also advertises itself as an alternative to abortion. Hope Pregnancy Center has created billboards asking, \u201cAre you considering an abortion?\u201d The Hope Pregnancy Center says it offers \u201cabortion clinic alternatives\u201d on its website. The pages labeled as \u201cabortion education\u201d and \u201cabortion information\u201d are directed to pages about open adoption and the \u201cemotional risks\u201d involved with having an abortion.\n\u201cAn abortion is a medical procedure that cannot be undone,\u201d the site reads. \u201cWe offer after abortion counseling in Oklahoma to assist you during the healing process.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood has called these pregnancy centers \u201cfake clinics\u201d that attempt to \u201ctrick\u201d or influence a patient\u2019s decision regarding sex and pregnancy.\n\u201cCrisis pregnancy centers don\u2019t provide abortion or offer a full range of health care, and they won\u2019t give you honest facts about sexual health and your pregnancy options,\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s website reads.\nThe Hope Pregnancy Center did not respond to a request from the PBS NewsHour for more information about what services will be provided to pregnant people who are carrying unwanted pregnancies.\nGov. Stitt\u2019s office and several state lawmakers who authored anti-abortion legislation also did not respond to the NewsHour\u2019s questions about how Oklahoma could handle the increase of potentially thousands of children in its adoption and foster care systems. Nearly 4,800 abortions were performed in Oklahoma in 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\nIn a May 15 appearance on Fox News Sunday, Stitt was asked how Oklahoma planned to handle possibly thousands of more children in its adoption and foster care systems.\n\u201cWe want the churches, we want all the services, we want the state and nonprofits to come around with adoption services and that is super, super hard, and we are going to do everything we can to help them,\u201d Stitt said. \u201cBut aborting that child is not the right thing to do.\u201d\nStitt was then asked how Oklahoma planned to help women carry through with a pregnancy, noting how the state is ranked 42nd in the nation for childhood wellbeing, according to a 2021 report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\n\u201cIs the answer to the socialist Democrat left to abort poor kids?\u201d Stitt countered. \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous to quote those types of stats. We have a free market in Oklahoma. We believe that God has a special plan for every single life and every single child and we want everybody to have the same opportunities in Oklahoma.\u201d\nThe escorts Braselton oversees often try to comfort and guide patients to the door as anti-abortion protesters yell or berate them. Braselton said she\u2019s been called a sinner, had her children threatened by name, and repeatedly told she\u2019s going to hell for the nine years she\u2019s worked at the Roe Fund, a statewide organization that provides emotional support and financial assistance for patients seeking reproductive services while also helping connect people to other health resources.\nThe fund, which is operated by the Oklahoma Religious Coalition for Reproductive Rights, has seen a huge boost in donations since the new state law and leaked Supreme Court draft opinion suggesting a majority of justices support overturning Roe. The organization received more than 800 donations in one day after Stitt signed the six-week abortion ban.\nThe Roe Fund has also been talking with Texas abortion advocates to learn how they helped people there seeking abortions with the ban in place and are trying to implement similar strategies by helping organize trips out of Oklahoma and into other states who can provide services.\nWhen Oklahoma\u2019s own ban went into effect, the anti-abortion protesters have only increased outside the Tulsa clinic. But Braselton said she\u2019ll be there for the long haul.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be working for this until my dying breath,\u201d Braselton said. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing whatever I can to help from now until my end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Two women from Texas talk to each other about their travel to Oklahoma as they wait in the recovery room following their abortions at the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma City.
