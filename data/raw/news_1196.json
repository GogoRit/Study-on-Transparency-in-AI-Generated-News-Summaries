(Watch the briefing on YouTube.)\nHere are excerpts:\nON ABORTION AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM\nDr. Jonas Swartz, assistant professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology\n\u201cAbortion is an incredibly safe and effective procedure as it\u2019s practiced across the United States today. It\u2019s essential health care and gives people the right to autonomy over their own bodies. When I think about the loss of that right, the loss of access to that safe and effective care, it worries me for my patients, and it worries me for my kids.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cPregnancy is a wonderful thing. It is also a time in a person\u2019s life when they can face significant health risks. For people who have an unwanted pregnancy, often abortion can be a much safer option.\u201d\n\u201cPeople should have the freedom to make decisions about their own health risks and not to have to face those risks because they\u2019re carrying an unwanted pregnancy.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we take away the right to safe and legal abortion, that doesn\u2019t take away abortion overall. It just means people try to access through means that are less safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE REAL IMPACT OF AN ABORTION BAN\nDr. Beverly Gray, founder, Duke Reproductive Health Equity and Advocacy Mobilization team\n\u201cFor a lot of folks in our country, they\u2019re already living in a post-Roe existence. We\u2019ve already seen many patients who have limitations on their access to care based on where they\u2019re born, where they live, what type of insurance coverage they have, how much money they have saved in the bank.\u201d\n\u201cThese are real-life impacts on ordinary people seeking abortion care. We care for many patients who have life-threatening medical conditions in which abortion saves their lives.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stigma around abortion in our country, so people don\u2019t talk about their abortion. But we know that by the time women reach menopause, around 1 in 4 of those women will have had an abortion.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON IMPLICATIONS OF AN ABORTION BAN\nDr. Richard Shannon, chief quality officer, Duke Health\n\u201cThere could be a whole host of implications, most of which have not been carefully thought out. What does this mean for the concept of individual rights? What does this mean for the growing public health crisis of maternal morbidity and mortality? What does it mean to the child welfare state? What does it mean to foster care? There are broad implications.\u201d\n\u201cIf the federal statute is overturned and states are given the opportunity to choose on behalf of individual women, I think we have to recall (how) this nation was founded; this nation engaged in a revolution, fighting against such tortious government interference. The idea that a monarchy could reach across and interfere in individual rights was the founding principle of the nation. How does this differ?\u201d\n\u00a0\nON AN ABORTION BAN AND ALREADY HIGH U.S. MATERNAL MORTALITY\nDr. Jonas Swartz\n\u201cThe maternal mortality crisis in the United States is a real challenge. It\u2019s not just that we have the highest rates of maternal mortality among industrialized countries, it\u2019s also that we have significant health disparities in terms of who suffers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe know low-income people, people of color are more likely to die during pregnancy and have major morbidity during pregnancy.\u201d\n\u201cI regularly see patients who make the very rational choice for them and for their families about what the best time is for them is to have a pregnancy, or to carry a pregnancy, or not have a pregnancy. Often times that is made because of the health of the mothers. We regularly care for patients who need to focus on their own health, and the pregnancy significantly puts that health at risk. They need to be free to make the choice to end the pregnancy in that situation.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON A SPILLOVER EFFECT FROM STATE TO STATE\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cThis will impact care for North Carolinians, for people in Durham, if other states have bans. We\u2019re already seeing an increase in cases from the spillover effect. Bans in Texas and Oklahoma influence where those patients can get care, so they\u2019re going to surrounding states. Those folks in surrounding states are getting delays in care ... and they come to other states. We\u2019re seeing this tidal wave effect of folks seeking care. The vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester; if you have delays in care due to access, that is going to shift.\u201d\n\u201cStates are already thinking about how they\u2019re going to care for patients who have severe medical illnesses and other complications to their health. I think people are really, really worried about the impacts this is going to have immediately and then down the road.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON PRENATAL CARE AVAILABILITY\nDr. Richard Shannon\n\u201cYou could be looking at 600,000 to 800,000 more births a year. We don\u2019t have enough obstetricians and medical care in general to attend to the women who come to us today. There are about 4 million live births a year. There are 21,000 obstetrics and gynecology specialists. It\u2019s estimated we need about 8,000 more obstetricians today. That\u2019s before we consider the impact of bringing 600,000 to 800,000 live births forward.\u201d\n\u201cWe already experience a shortage of trained professionals. More importantly, this falls disproportionately on women of color and in this particular case, rural women. Access to care for rural women right now is very significantly limited. Fifty percent of women that live in rural areas are at least a 30-minute distance to the closest prenatal care.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about increasing all the stresses on the existing system -- a system that today yields the highest maternal mortality rate in the civilized world -- stressing that system further with as much as 20 to 25 percent additional births. No planning in place to do that, no guarantee that care will be provided free of cost, yet an imposition of the state government\u2019s will that you must do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE IMPACT OF A BAN ON OB-GYN TRAINING\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cOne of my concerns is training the next generation of physicians to care for women who have complicated pregnancy, who are experiencing miscarriage, who are presenting for abortion care. The impact this legislation could have on training is huge. The next generation of physicians may not be adequately trained to care for miscarriage, for abortion, for complications of pregnancy that arise in the mid-trimester. That\u2019s definitely a concern.\u201d\n\u201cIt will influence where some of our best applications for OB-GYN apply for residency. For medical students who want to train and have the skills to provide comprehensive OB-GYN care, they\u2019re going to be looking at states that can provide comprehensive OB-GYN care, and that includes abortion care. I definitely see how that can have a downstream effect as well.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE FREQUENCY OF PREGNANCY MISHAPS\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cEvery single week, we\u2019re caring for patients who have an emergency, who have a medical condition where pregnancy will put their lives in grave risk.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing those cases every week. We receive referrals, we have patients who are transferred in, and these are hard cases. Luckily, we have skilled providers. If you walk in the doors of Duke Hospital and you have an emergency in pregnancy, we are skilled to take care of that. I do worry about the impact over time if people aren\u2019t able to access care when it\u2019s safest.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON HURDLES FACING DOCTORS\nDr. Jonas Swartz\n\u201cAlready, in North Carolina, we have seen the requirements that the state imposes on how we declare a medical emergency to perform some abortions impedes care. Policy will require that you get two doctors to sign there\u2019s sufficient medical risk to supercede the state\u2019s 72-hour waiting period. Just for context, North Carolina has a three-day waiting period, which is among the longest in the nation, where women have to receive counseling and then can receive an abortion.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we want to perform an abortion for someone whose health is highly at risk before that three-day window, we need the certification of two doctors. Those sorts of restrictions make people scared to practice good medicine.\u201d\nDr. Beverly Gray\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a provider, when they\u2019re put into this very difficult situation where there\u2019s vague language around the law that says a person\u2019s life has to be \u2018imminently\u2019 at risk.\u201d\n\u201cAnything that gives a provider pause in providing life-saving treatment will end in death. And that, unfortunately, is what we will see. Patients\u2019 lives are on the line here.\u201d\nDr. Richard Shannon\n\u201cI am very concerned about some of the stories we\u2019re beginning to hear in states that are considering these restrictions. Individuals are advocating that abortion be considered homicide. Not only might a provider find themselves at risk of some civil litigation but potentially some criminal litigation.\u201d\n\u201cOne begins to see this process moving more and more to that way of thinking, and it\u2019s been articulated by some state governors.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea that providers might be faced with criminal liability is going to further erode a doctor\u2019s ability to act in the best interests of his or her patients. This is a step far, far, far too far for a government to go in insinuating itself in these incredibly complicated circumstances.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON MYTHS, CONFUSION ABOUT ABORTION\nDr. Jonas Swartz\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t aware of regulations about abortion in their state. What that tells us is that people don\u2019t necessarily understand what\u2019s at stake here, and the rights they\u2019re losing. Or what people already have to go through if they end up needing an abortion.\u201d\n\t\u201cMany people believe abortion to be less safe than childbirth. In fact, abortion is safer than childbirth. There are several states, including North Carolina, that have mandated scripts abortion providers are required to read to patients before performing an abortion. North Carolina\u2019s does not, but some states do perpetuate myths within those scripts. So for example, some states suggest there\u2019s an increased risk of infertility or an increased risk of breast cancer related to abortion. Both of those are myths.\u201d\n\u201cThe other common thing we hear is this discussion of fetal pain. Abortions are not occurring at a time in the pregnancy, after 28 weeks, when fetuses can feel pain. That is well scientifically established. Pain is a really complex neurologic response. Unfortunately, because that myth is perpetuated, we often see our patients worry about that. They care deeply about their bodies, they care deeply about these pregnancies.\u201d\n\u201cThe final myth that is often perpetuated about abortion is that it causes depression or causes adverse mental health outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s denial of access to abortion that causes people to have adverse mental health outcomes, not abortion itself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON THE IMPACT OF AN ABORTION BAN ON SOCIAL SAFETY NET\nDr. Richard Shannon\n\u201cThis will place enormous social burdens on our society. Important societal structures like foster care, which just provides incredibly important services to nearly 425,000 children across America, will be further stressed at a time when we really need to focus our efforts on meeting the fundamental needs of foster care today.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea that we could do much better if we focused on helping children who are born to live their full life is, to my mind, a more compelling social obligation than this tortious interference in the privacy of a woman and her decision whether or not to carry a fetus to term. There\u2019s ample work but you can be certain these social safety nets will be further stressed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nON A BAN\u2019S IMPACT ON ACCESS TO CARE\nDR. Beverly Gray\n\u201cI worry about access to care for my patients, for my community, for those in surrounding states. And I worry about the suffering these laws will cause. If you have a uterus in this country, the rights of the potential life that uterus holds seem to be greater than the vessel that carries it. I\u2019m more than a vessel. My daughter is more than a vessel. The patients I care for in my community are more than vessels.\u201d\n\u201cWe see what the potential ramifications of these legal changes are. I think it\u2019s really important for people to understand what is real medical knowledge. What is fact, what is fiction. We need to dispel these myths.\u201d\nDr. Jonas Swartz\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think that people are going to die. People are going to get sick. People are going to die because they potentially attempt unsafe abortions. People are going to die because they have complications of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, and people are going to get sick from both of those things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible to think, in a time when we have this well-developed and safe technique that also helps people exercise their reproductive autonomy, that we\u2019re just going to take away those best, evidence-based tools and expose people to higher risks.\u201d\nThe Experts:\nBeverly Gray, M.D.\nDr. Beverly Gray\u00a0is an obstetrician and gynecologist, an associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and founder of the Duke Reproductive Health Equity and Advocacy Mobilization team.\u00a0\n\tContact: sarah.avery@duke.edu\nRichard Shannon, M.D.\u00a0\u00a0\nDr. Richard Shannon\u00a0is chief quality officer for Duke Health.
