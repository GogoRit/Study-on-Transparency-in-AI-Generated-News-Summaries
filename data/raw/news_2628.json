Instead of gaining seats in the U.S. House, they lost several to pro-life Republican women who promise to support protections for babies and mothers.\n\u201cMany on the liberal left were talking about a complete takeover of the House, claiming even more Democratic Party seats, pushing back on the GOP majority in the Senate, and then obviously taking the White House,\u201d Jessica Anderson of Heritage Action for America, told the conservative news outlet. \u201cBut that tsunami from the left \u2026 just flat-out fizzled.\u201d\nAdditional races have yet to be decided, and pro-life leaders hope the number will expand even more. Pro-abortion Democrats still control the U.S. House, but their majority is thinning.\nHere\u2019s more from the report:\nIn a story about the upcoming 117th Congress, which convenes Jan. 3, The Christian Post reports the GOP will nearly double its pro-life lawmakers from 13 to 24. All of those freshman GOP lawmakers are women.\nPro-life group Susan B. Anthony List told CP the wave of pro-life women is a \u201cstunning blow to Nancy Pelosi and her pro-abortion agenda.\u201d\n\u201cThese are all strong women that reject the left\u2019s version of feminism,\u201d Anderson reports. \u201cThey support having a family, love of country, they\u2019re pro-life, and they\u2019re eager to lead \u2026 in Washington.\u201d\nWyoming elected pro-life Republican Cynthia Lummis to join re-elected incumbent Sens. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito, of West Virginia, and Cindy Hyde-Smith, of Mississippi, and other pro-life female senators in 2021. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, of Georgia, is facing a run-off race in January; if elected, she will make seven pro-life women in the Senate.\nIn U.S. House races, eight pro-life Republican women flipped Democrat-held seats on Nov. 3, including Maria Salazar, of Florida, Yvette Herrell, of New Mexico, Michelle Fischbach, of Minnesota, Nancy Mace, of South Carolina, Stephanie Bice, of Oklahoma, Ashley Hinson, of Iowa, and Nicole Malliotakis, of New York.\nSBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said their victories mean the number of pro-life women in the House will double.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of these women who will be a bold voice for moms and unborn babies on Capitol Hill and we look forward to working with them to save lives!\u201d her organization said.\nHere is the full breakdown:\nU.S. Senate\nCynthia Lummis (R-WY) won election\nSens. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) won re-election\nSen.
