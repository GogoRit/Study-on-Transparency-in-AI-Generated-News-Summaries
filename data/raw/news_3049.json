Ron DeSantis over former President Donald Trump in the 2024 GOP primary, according to new Vanderbilt University polling that showed support Trump has declined over the past year.Meanwhile, Tennesseans support for increased abortion access in certain cases appears to be on the rise after the state this fall implemented one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, with no specific legal exceptions for any circumstances.The statewide poll is co-directed by Vanderbilt University dean and political science professor John Geer and\u00a0professor Josh Clinton. The poll, conducted at regular intervals, surveyed 1,180 registered Tennessee voters in November. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.DeSantis outpaced Trump with 54% favorability to 41%, mirroring national trends that show roughly two-thirds of Republicans favor the Florida governor over the former president. The poll found 36% of surveyed voters wanted Trump to run again, down 8 percentage points from December 2021. President Joe Biden remains unpopular in the state, with only 22% respondents indicating they would like to see the president run for reelection.Trump in trouble:Republican support for his 2024 bid falls amid political, legal setbacksThe Vanderbilt poll also probed divides within the GOP, with 34% of polled Republicans agreeing they are \u201cmore of a supporter of the Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement\u201d than they are are of the Republican Party. Among respondents who identified as \"MAGA\" supporters, 88% want Trump to run again, versus 50% of respondents who identified as \"non-MAGA\" supporters.\u201cTrump\u2019s support has waned, but there\u2019s still a clear path for Trump to win the nomination,\u201d Geer said. \u201cThe differences between MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA Republicans also pose a problem for Republicans as they try to govern over the next two years.\u201dTennesseans favor more abortion access than state law allows, poll findsThe Vanderbilt poll also tracked shifting trends on abortion policy, with more respondents identifying as \"definitely pro-choice\" than \"pro-life\" overall.The poll found 36% of respondents identifying as \"definitely pro-life,\" down from 46% in 2012, while \"definitely pro-choice\" respondents rose 15 percentage points over the last decade to 37% this year.Respondents identifying as \"definitely\" or \"somewhat\" pro-choice held a slight majority overall at 51%. The poll indicates a large partisan split on the issue.The majority of those polled could not correctly identify the details of Tennessee's current abortion law, which contains no legal exceptions for any circumstances. Doctors who perform procedures to save the life of a pregnant patient are afforded a certain legal defense under the law, but prosecutors could charge anyone for performing any abortion under the current law as written.In contrast to the law, the poll shows a large majority of Tennesseans support legal exceptions in instances of rape or incest: 72% of \"non-MAGA\" Republicans, 45% of \"MAGA\" Republicans, 93% of Democrats and 78% of independents support the exceptions.Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.comStaff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
