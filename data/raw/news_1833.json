Kim Reynolds at an anti-abortion rally in February 2023. (Photo courtesy of Reynolds\u2019 Twitter feed)\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Iowa Republicans reacted quickly on June 16 after the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s\u00a0split decision\u00a0kept abortion legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks.\nIn a\u00a0joint news release, Gov. Kim Reynolds, Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, and House Speaker Pat Grassley promised to work together on what they called \u201cpro-life policies to protect the unborn.\u201d But they did not indicate whether a new law might differ from the near-total abortion ban\u00a0passed in 2018, which remains permanently enjoined after the Supreme Court deadlock.\nThe statements also did not clarify whether Republicans plan to convene a special legislative session before lawmakers are scheduled to return to Des Moines next January. Communications staff working for the governor and House and Senate leaders did not respond to Bleeding Heartland\u2019s questions.\nAny new abortion ban would be challenged immediately, and two years might pass before the Iowa Supreme Court rules on whether that law violates the state constitution. So anti-abortion advocates will want the legislature and governor to start the process sooner rather than later.\nBut even with the large House and Senate majorities Iowa Republicans now enjoy, it may not be easy to draft a bill that can get through both chambers.\nThe fine print matters more now\n\n\n\nThe Iowa Legislature did not consider any abortion restrictions during the 2023 session, while leaders awaited the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the effort to reinstate what proponents call the \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill. That 2018 law would ban almost all abortions after fetal cardiac activity (not technically a heartbeat) could be detected, which usually occurs around six weeks after the last menstrual period.\nRepublicans hastily drafted a long amendment\u00a0to pull the bill over the line\u00a0in the Iowa House during the closing days of the 2018 session. As Bleeding Heartland\u00a0discussed in more detail here, the law\u2019s few exceptions for medical emergencies or \u201cmedically necessary\u201d terminations would not cover many situations where continuing a pregnancy could endanger someone\u2019s health, or a person became pregnant due to rape or incest. And of course, the vast majority of pregnant Iowans would have no ability to make their own medical decisions, because by the time they became aware of a pregnancy, it would be too late to terminate.\nWhen the Legislature debated this bill in 2018, its proponents knew it was unconstitutional under longstanding precedent, and\u00a0characterized the bill as a vehicle for overturning\u00a0Roe v. Wade. So they didn\u2019t sweat the details.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court tossed its\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0precedents in last year\u2019s\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision,\u00a0more than a dozen states have banned abortion in nearly all cases. Now we regularly hear horror stories from those states. Patients have been forced to continue pregnancies \u2014 sometimes for months \u2014 despite fetal anomalies incompatible with life. Patients have been\u00a0denied care following a miscarriage, some\u00a0left bleeding for more than a week, some\u00a0nearly dying of infection or hemorrhage.\nDoctors\u00a0are leaving some states\u00a0to avoid the risk of criminal prosecution \u201csimply for saving someone\u2019s life.\u201d Iowa is\u00a0already one of the worst states\u00a0for access to OB/GYNs, and severe restrictions on abortion\u00a0would likely worsen the problem.\nSome House Republicans may prefer broader exceptions\nRepublicans now hold 34 of the 50 Iowa Senate seats and 64 of the 100 Iowa House seats. Getting an abortion ban through the Senate should not be challenging. For whatever reason, Republicans in that chamber rarely dissent from what leadership wants. No GOP senator voted\u00a0against the 2018 abortion ban. In addition, 29 current state senators signed on to one of the two amicus briefs lawmakers submitted to the Iowa Supreme Court this year supporting the effort to lift the injunction (see\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here).\nThe House GOP caucus is more fractious. Republican holdouts kept several of the governor\u2019s priorities from advancing\u00a0in 2021\u00a0and\u00a02022. Even though the chamber did approve almost everything Reynolds asked for during this year\u2019s session, House leadership had to work much harder to marshal support for some of those proposals. Bills limiting liability for trucking companies and relaxing child labor regulations were substantially modified before final passage. Other high-profile bills cleared the House with a surprising number of GOP \u201cno\u201d votes; nine Republicans\u00a0opposed the governor\u2019s school voucher plan, and 12 opposed limits for medical malpractice awards.\nWith many GOP-led states now\u00a0banning abortion at six weeks or earlier, it\u2019s hard to imagine Reynolds agreeing to anything less strict than the 2018 law.\nNo Democrats will vote for new abortion restrictions, which means House leaders can afford to lose at most 13 GOP members.\nState Rep. Jane Bloomingdale voted against the 2018 bill\u00a0and against the\u00a0proposed state constitutional amendment\u00a0that would open the door to a total abortion ban. So she will likely oppose any severe restrictions on reproductive rights.\nWho else might hesitate to support a ban with few meaningful exceptions? It\u2019s hard to guess. The\u00a0Iowa Supreme Court opinion authored by Justice Thomas Waterman, which explained why he and two other justices opposed lifting the injunction on the 2018 law, noted that 15 House Republicans did not sign on to an amicus brief urging\u00a0the court to allow the abortion ban to go into effect.\nTo be clear, legislators may choose not to join\u00a0an amicus brief submitted by The FAMiLY Leader\u00a0for any number of reasons. That does not prove they wouldn\u2019t vote for a new six-week ban. Maybe they didn\u2019t want to be linked to that organization. Maybe they preferred different legal arguments for lifting the injunction.\nThen again, maybe some would favor broader exceptions than those outlined in the 2018 law. With that caveat, here is the list of House Republicans who didn\u2019t join that amicus brief:\n\nMichael Bergan\nJane Bloomingdale\nJacob Bossman\nTom Determann\nChad Ingels\nMegan Jones\nBobby Kaufmann\nBarb Kniff McCulla\nBrian Lohse\nAnn Meyer\nGary Mohr\nMatthew Rinker\nDavid Sieck\nMike Vondran\nHans Wilz\n\n\n\n Some House Republicans may insist on fewer exceptions\n\n\n\nThe 2018 bill included\u00a0limited exceptions for rape, incest, and certain medical emergencies. They were drafted narrowly; for instance, rape or incest victims who had never reported the assault would be ineligible for an abortion. As weak as those exceptions were, they may be a bridge too far for a faction in the Iowa House.\nTwenty House Republicans introduced a bill this year that would go further than the 2018 ban.\u00a0House File 510\u00a0would declare, \u201cThe state of Iowa has a fundamental and compelling interest in protecting the life of every human being from the moment of fertilization.\u201d It would ban all \u201celective abortion\u201d and any actions to assist someone in getting an abortion.\u00a0Its enforcement mechanism was modeled on a Texas law\u00a0that empowered private citizens to file lawsuits. It contained no rape or incest exceptions and only narrow exceptions for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriage care.\nHouse Judiciary Committee chair Steven Holt never assigned the bill to a subcommittee. He\u00a0told the Des Moines Register in February:\n\u201cI believe absolutely 100% in life at conception,\u201d Holt said. \u201cBut there are a number of us, and legal experts, who believe we need to wait and see what the Supreme Court decision is on the heartbeat bill.\u201d\nThe ball\u2019s back in the Legislature\u2019s court now. Even if the Texas approach does not represent a consensus view among Iowa House Republicans, 20 co-sponsors is a sizable group \u2014 larger than the number who co-sponsored various personhood bills Iowa House members introduced during the 2010s.\nI\u2019m not saying every lawmaker who co-sponsored House File 510 would refuse to vote for a less severe abortion ban. But some in this group might balk at exceptions favored by the majority of the GOP caucus.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s the list of lawmakers who signed onto a bill that wouldn\u2019t even allow abortion up to six weeks and had no rape or incest exception:\n\nSteven Bradley\nKen Carlson\nZach Dieken\nJon Dunwell\nDean Fisher\nThomas Gerhold\nMartin Graber\nStan Gustafson\nHelena Hayes\nRobert Henderson\nTom Jeneary\nCraig Johnson\nAnne Osmundson\nBrad Sherman\nJeff Shipley\nLuana Stoltenberg\nMark Thompson\nPhil Thompson\nCharley Thomson\nSkyler Wheeler\n\n\n\n Constitutional amendment may become bargaining chip\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Iowa House and Senate Republicans\u00a0took the first step toward amending the state constitution\u00a0to declare there is no right to an abortion. Both chambers would need to approve identical language again to get the proposal on a statewide ballot. Then, if a majority of Iowa voters approve, the following section would be added to the constitution.\nSec. 26.\u00a0Life.\u00a0To defend the dignity of all human life and protect unborn children from efforts to expand abortion even to the point of birth, we the people of the State of Iowa declare that this Constitution does not recognize, grant, or secure a right to abortion or require the public funding of abortion.\nThe obvious purpose of the amendment was to allow the GOP-controlled Legislature to ban abortion. But Republicans drafted the proposal to create the illusion\u00a0that the goal was to \u201cprotect unborn children from efforts to expand abortion even to the point of birth,\u201d and prevent public funds from paying for abortions. Polling commissioned by The FAMiLY Leader\u00a0informed the wording.\nWhen the Legislature began working on this amendment, the Iowa Supreme Court had not yet overturned its 2018 precedent declaring abortion to be a fundamental right\u00a0protected under the state constitution. But a conservative majority\u00a0ditched that precedent last year, raising questions about whether the amendment was needed.\nThe Iowa Supreme Court opinions published on June 16 made clear that Justice Waterman, Justice Edward Mansfield, and Chief Justice Susan Christensen lean toward evaluating abortion regulations using an \u201cundue burden\u201d standard. As Waterman\u2019s\u00a0opinion explained, \u201cThe undue burden test balances the state\u2019s interest in protecting unborn life and maternal health with a woman\u2019s limited liberty interest in deciding whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.\u201d\nNothing resembling a six-week ban could be upheld under that standard. Anti-abortion advocates need the Iowa Supreme Court to use the \u201crational basis\u201d standard, which considers only whether the state has some legitimate reason to restrict abortion. The bodily autonomy of pregnant Iowans would count for nothing.\nThe\u00a0opinions published this week\u00a0confirm Justices Christopher McDonald, Matthew McDermott, and David May favor using rational basis review, which would allow any abortion ban to be upheld.\nIowa Supreme Court justice Dana Oxley recused herself from this case, so we don\u2019t know how she would approach this question. In the 2022 abortion case, Oxley\u00a0joined the plurality opinion\u00a0that left the undue burden standard in place while the court considered other options, rather than the concurring opinion that would have established a rational basis standard immediately.\nIn this context, anti-abortion advocates have valid reasons to keep pushing for the constitutional amendment. If voters approve it, the Iowa Supreme Court would presumably acknowledge in future cases that there is no state constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy under any circumstances.\nInfluential groups including The FAMiLY Leader and Iowa Right to Life will be lobbying Republican lawmakers to advance the amendment a second time, putting the measure on a statewide ballot. Some House Republicans may demand a vote on the constitutional amendment as a condition of voting for an abortion bill that doesn\u2019t go as far in banning the practice as they would like.\n\n\n Leaders may not want to let Iowans vote on abortion\n\n\n\nBut trying to amend the constitution would be risky. The most recent\u00a0Iowa Poll by Selzer & Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom, taken in March 2023, indicated that 61 percent of Iowa adults believe abortion should be mostly or always legal. A\u00a0Selzer poll from 2021\u00a0found that only 31 percent of Iowa adults supported amending the state constitution \u201cto say it does not recognize a right to abortion or require public funding of abortion.\u201d\nSimilar proposals have failed in the post-Dobbs world. In the 2022 general election, Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment with wording much like Iowa\u2019s\u00a0by\u00a052.3% to 47.7 %.\nWhat if Iowa Republicans schedule a referendum on an abortion amendment at some other time in 2024, to avoid a high-turnout November election? Their counterparts in Kansas tried that tactic last year. But even though\u00a0the wording was confusing, and the vote was held during the first week of August, the proposed amendment went down in a landslide:\u00a059% to 41%.\nWorth noting: Iowa\u2019s\u00a0partisan voting index is R+6, meaning this state\u2019s electorate voted about 6 points more Republican than the country as a whole in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Kansas and Kentucky\u00a0are much more GOP-leaning, with PVIs of R+10 and R+16, respectively.\nA decisive popular vote against the GOP-backed amendment would show the Iowa Supreme Court that the majority of Iowans believe our state\u2019s constitution protects bodily autonomy to some degree. That might tip the scales toward a balancing test like the undue burden standard, even though the U.S. Supreme Court majority rejected the undue burden standard in\u00a0Dobbs.\nI suspect Reynolds and legislative leaders will not want to roll the dice on putting a constitutional amendment directly before Iowa voters. Lots of people who generally support Republican candidates also think the government shouldn\u2019t interfere in personal medical decisions. In a normal election, they aren\u2019t single-issue voters on abortion; Selzer\u2019s\u00a0Iowa Poll from October 2022\u00a0found, \u201cAmong Iowans who plan to vote for Reynolds, 33% say most or all abortions should be legal.\u201d\nLast year\u2019s results from Kansas and Kentucky suggest that given a chance to vote up or down on reproductive rights, such voters would reject a ballot measure like Iowa\u2019s proposal.\nThe FAMiLY Leader\u2019s staff\u00a0told me in 2021, \u201cIowans overwhelmingly do NOT support the taxpayer-funded abortion or expansion of abortion to the point of a baby\u2019s birth that the 2018 [Iowa Supreme Court] decision paves the way for.\u201d But even before our state\u2019s high court\u00a0overturned that ruling, Iowa was not on the cusp of expanding abortion \u201cto the point of a baby\u2019s birth.\u201d Third-trimester abortions have been illegal here for decades.\nIn the post-Dobbs\u00a0world, anyone paying attention can see that Republicans ban abortion in every state they control. It would be harder to\u00a0trick Iowans into believing the amendment would make the constitution \u201cneutral\u201d on abortion.\nIf Whitver and Grassley can lock down enough votes for a new abortion ban without putting a constitutional amendment on a statewide ballot, I suspect they will take that route, and Reynolds will call a special session in the coming months. If negotiations get bogged down between the House and Senate, or within the House caucus, the Legislature may not act on this issue before January 2024.\n\n\n\nThis commentary\u00a0first appeared at Bleeding Heartland\u00a0and has been shared on\u00a0Iowa politics with Laura Belin on Substack\u00a0as part of\u00a0the Iowa Writers\u2019 Collaborative.\nEditor\u2019s note: Please consider subscribing to collaborative members\u2019 blogs to support their work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWhy Iowa Republicans may struggle to agree on new abortion ban\nby Laura Belin, Iowa Capital Dispatch June 22, 2023\nWhy Iowa Republicans may struggle to agree on new abortion ban\nby Laura Belin, Iowa Capital Dispatch June 22, 2023\n Top Iowa Republicans reacted quickly on June 16 after the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s\u00a0split decision\u00a0kept abortion legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks.\nIn a\u00a0joint news release, Gov.

The bodily autonomy of pregnant Iowans would count for nothing.\nThe\u00a0opinions published this week\u00a0confirm Justices Christopher McDonald, Matthew McDermott, and David May favor using rational basis review, which would allow any abortion ban to be upheld.\nIowa Supreme Court justice Dana Oxley recused herself from this case, so we don\u2019t know how she would approach this question. In the 2022 abortion case, Oxley\u00a0joined the plurality opinion\u00a0that left the undue burden standard in place while the court considered other options, rather than the concurring opinion that would have established a rational basis standard immediately.\nIn this context, anti-abortion advocates have valid reasons to keep pushing for the constitutional amendment. If voters approve it, the Iowa Supreme Court would presumably acknowledge in future cases that there is no state constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy under any circumstances.\nInfluential groups including The FAMiLY Leader and Iowa Right to Life will be lobbying Republican lawmakers to advance the amendment a second time, putting the measure on a statewide ballot. Some House Republicans may demand a vote on the constitutional amendment as a condition of voting for an abortion bill that doesn\u2019t go as far in banning the practice as they would like.\n\n\n    Leaders may not want to let Iowans vote on abortion\n\n\t\n\n\nBut trying to amend the constitution would be risky. The most recent\u00a0Iowa Poll by Selzer & Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom, taken in March 2023, indicated that 61 percent of Iowa adults believe abortion should be mostly or always legal. A\u00a0Selzer poll from 2021\u00a0found that only 31 percent of Iowa adults supported amending the state constitution \u201cto say it does not recognize a right to abortion or require public funding of abortion.\u201d\nSimilar proposals have failed in the post-Dobbs world. In the 2022 general election, Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment with wording much like Iowa\u2019s\u00a0by\u00a052.3% to 47.7 %.\nWhat if Iowa Republicans schedule a referendum on an abortion amendment at some other time in 2024, to avoid a high-turnout November election? Their counterparts in Kansas tried that tactic last year. But even though\u00a0the wording was confusing, and the vote was held during the first week of August, the proposed amendment went down in a landslide:\u00a059% to 41%.\nWorth noting: Iowa\u2019s\u00a0partisan voting index is R+6, meaning this state\u2019s electorate voted about 6 points more Republican than the country as a whole in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Kansas and Kentucky\u00a0are much more GOP-leaning, with PVIs of R+10 and R+16, respectively.\nA decisive popular vote against the GOP-backed amendment would show the Iowa Supreme Court that the majority of Iowans believe our state\u2019s constitution protects bodily autonomy to some degree. That might tip the scales toward a balancing test like the undue burden standard, even though the U.S. Supreme Court majority rejected the undue burden standard in\u00a0Dobbs.\nI suspect Reynolds and legislative leaders will not want to roll the dice on putting a constitutional amendment directly before Iowa voters. Lots of people who generally support Republican candidates also think the government shouldn\u2019t interfere in personal medical decisions. In a normal election, they aren\u2019t single-issue voters on abortion; Selzer\u2019s\u00a0Iowa Poll from October 2022\u00a0found, \u201cAmong Iowans who plan to vote for Reynolds, 33% say most or all abortions should be legal.\u201d\nLast year\u2019s results from Kansas and Kentucky suggest that given a chance to vote up or down on reproductive rights, such voters would reject a ballot measure like Iowa\u2019s proposal.\nThe FAMiLY Leader\u2019s staff\u00a0told me in 2021, \u201cIowans overwhelmingly do NOT support the taxpayer-funded abortion or expansion of abortion to the point of a baby\u2019s birth that the 2018 [Iowa Supreme Court] decision paves the way for.\u201d But even before our state\u2019s high court\u00a0overturned that ruling, Iowa was not on the cusp of expanding abortion \u201cto the point of a baby\u2019s birth.\u201d Third-trimester abortions have been illegal here for decades.\nIn the post-Dobbs\u00a0world, anyone paying attention can see that Republicans ban abortion in every state they control. It would be harder to\u00a0trick Iowans into believing the amendment would make the constitution \u201cneutral\u201d on abortion.\nIf Whitver and Grassley can lock down enough votes for a new abortion ban without putting a constitutional amendment on a statewide ballot, I suspect they will take that route, and Reynolds will call a special session in the coming months. If negotiations get bogged down between the House and Senate, or within the House caucus, the Legislature may not act on this issue before January 2024.\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nThis commentary\u00a0first appeared at Bleeding Heartland\u00a0and has been shared on\u00a0Iowa politics with Laura Belin on Substack\u00a0as part of\u00a0the Iowa Writers\u2019 Collaborative.\nEditor\u2019s note: Please consider subscribing to collaborative members\u2019 blogs to support their work.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n    \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n Iowa Capital Dispatch is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
