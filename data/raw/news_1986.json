Henry McMaster to continue work on Senate Bill 474, known as the \u201cFetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,\u201d which bans most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, which can commonly be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.\n    \n\n            The bill will now head to the Republican-controlled state Senate, where lawmakers will consider changes made by the House. The Senate passed the initial version of the bill back in February. \n    \n\n            Even if approved by the Senate, it remains to be seen whether the law would survive a court challenge. The state Supreme Court earlier this year struck down a similar six-week ban over privacy concerns. \n    \n\n            But were the new legislation to go into effect, it would mean that the entire US South, with the exception of Virginia, has moved to significantly curtail abortion rights since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.\n    \n\n            The state House voted 82-33 to advance the amended bill, with two Democrats joining Republicans in the chamber, but not before debate on the legislation dragged on for hours over multiple days.\n    \n\n            Democratic lawmakers had filed more than 1,000 amendments to the legislation and vowed to make fellow legislators consider all of them, while Republicans said they would stay to work on the bill for as long as it took. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe have no intention of pulling any amendments. We are going to make it hurt if they are going to force this on us,\u201d Democratic state Rep. Beth Bernstein said.\n    \n\n            Asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Wednesday whether the Democrats were \u201cdelaying the inevitable\u201d passage of the measure, Bernstein conceded that \u201cunfortunately\u201d they were but that they also sought to raise awareness around it.\n    \n\n            \u201c[T]he reason these amendments are being filed is so we can have that voice and so people can understand what we\u2019re doing at the statehouse is we\u2019re effectively banning abortion,\u201d Bernstein said on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \n    \n\n            South Carolina passed a similar 6-week abortion ban in 2021, but the state Supreme Court struck it down earlier this year, concluding that the state constitution\u2019s privacy protections require limits on the procedure to allow women sufficient time to end a pregnancy. \n    \n\n            Recent efforts to pass further restrictions on abortion also faltered in April when the state Senate failed to pass the \u201cHuman Life Protection Act,\u201d which would have banned most abortions in the state, in a 22-21 vote with five women voting against it \u2013 including three Republicans. The bill had previously passed in the state House and included exceptions for incidents of rape or incest. \n    \n\n            Consideration on South Carolina\u2019s latest abortion bill came as lawmakers in neighboring North Carolina moved on Tuesday to ban most abortions after 12 weeks after the state\u2019s Republican-led General Assembly overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. \n    \n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\n\n  CNN\u2019s Tina Burnside, Sara Smart, Devon Sayers and Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.
