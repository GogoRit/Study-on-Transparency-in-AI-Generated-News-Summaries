Minnis and Catholic Healthcare International founder and president Jere D. Palazzolo sign an agreement to start plans for a new Catholic medical school.\n\nBenedictine College\n\n\nOfficials at Benedictine College, a private Catholic institution in Atchison, Kan., recently announced plans to house a new, independent Catholic medical school on its campus. Part of the goal of the institution is to train physicians in an environment steeped in Catholic values related to contraception, abortion and end-of-life issues.\nThe initiative, which is expected to cost $120 million, is a partnership with Catholic Healthcare International, an organization that aims \u201cto be a model of Christian healthcare delivery\u201d based on the work of Padre Pio, a Catholic priest and saint who opened a historic hospital in Italy. Catholic Healthcare International signed a collaboration agreement with Benedictine in early September to start planning the proposed medical school, dubbed the St.\u00a0Padre Pio Institute for the Relief of Suffering, School of Osteopathic Medicine. It will be independently run and financed.\nThe hope is for the medical school to gain accreditation and open its doors by 2026; it hopes to eventually enroll about 180 students annually who will earn a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree and take coursework in and potentially earn master\u2019s degrees in Catholic bioethics.\nStephen D. Minnis, president of Benedictine, said he believes \u201cthis will be one of the most faithful Catholic medical schools in the world.\u201d\n\u201cIt is vital to train future doctors at a place like Benedictine College that understands the essential role of faith and morality in the sciences,\u201d Minnis said in a press release. \u201cThe campus culture of community, faith, and scholarship that we have worked so hard to create will be the perfect home for the proposed Padre Pio medical school at Benedictine College.\u201d\nThe announcement comes not long after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this past summer, ending federally protection for abortion rights and prompting student protests across the country. The decision elicited statements from campus leaders that ranged from denunciatory to celebratory to carefully neutral, and it plunged colleges and universities into uncharted legal waters on how to serve students who may want to terminate pregnancies while adhering to a patchwork of new state laws. The University of Idaho, for example, advised faculty members to refrain from sharing public opinions on the issue to avoid possible legal problems.\nThe people behind the new medical school, however, are clear about where the school\u2019s policies will stand on abortion and forms of contraception, such as the morning-after pill, which Catholic doctrine views as a method for ending a life.\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s in 24 hours, if it\u2019s preventing the implantation of a fertilized ovum, under the Catholic doctrine, that\u2019s considered a person,\u201d said George Mychaskiw, the founding president and CEO of the future of the school. \u201cAnd you can use whatever euphemism you want, whether you say\u2014it\u2019s a clump of cells, an embryo, a fetus or a baby\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s undeniably two things under the Catholic view: It\u2019s undeniably alive. It\u2019s undeniably human. It\u2019s not kittens. It\u2019s not chicken eggs.\u201d\nMychaskiw, who is currently professor and vice chair of anesthesiology and director of perioperative services at the Oschner Louisiana State University Health Science Center, said there are nine Catholic medical schools in the United States, but they\u2019re \u201cnominally Catholic,\u201d essentially secular institutions under a religiously affiliated college or university.\nThe St.\u00a0Padre Pio Institute will be the first medical school in the country to adhere to \u201cEx corde Ecclesiae,\u201d an ordinance issued by the late pope Saint John Paul II that governs what\u2019s expected of Catholic colleges and universities. As a result, the medical school will have a majority Catholic faculty, Catholic lay leaders and a Catholic Board of Directors. Instructors will also be required to sign a \u201cpledge of loyalty to Catholic principles,\u201d which includes \u201clife issues,\u201d such as continuing to give nutrition and fluids to terminal patients as part of palliative care and not performing abortions.\nHe noted that these restrictions don\u2019t mean students won\u2019t be taught about abortion from a scientific perspective, but they\u2019ll also be taught the Catholic perspective on the subject and taught to counsel patients on carrying pregnancies to term and considering options such as adoption. Students will also learn Catholic doctrine on which contraceptive methods are acceptable and which are not.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll understand what abortion is, how they\u2019re done, what medical issues are around abortion and complications,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the school will also have the firm moral, Catholic position on the acceptability of abortion and any instances where it\u2019s involved. So, it does take a moral position on that, but it doesn\u2019t shy from actually teaching about the science and technology.\u201d\nCarol Hogue, professor emerita of epidemiology and Jules and Uldeen Terry Professor Emerita of Maternal and Child Health at Emory University, expressed concern that training physicians in a rigid Catholic approach to medicine could contribute to maternal mortality.\n\u201cFrom the public health perspective, maternal mortality is the sixth leading cause of death among women\u00a0age 16 to 34, and much of what Catholic doctrine forbids in Catholic hospitals speaks directly to saving women\u2019s lives who are pregnant and to avoiding pregnancy with effective contraceptives when they don\u2019t want to be pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to prevent lives from being lost, and they do not. Abortion is only a small part of it.\u201d\nHogue pointed out that there have been lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for not providing timely abortions to women with ectopic pregnancies and other potentially fatal pregnancy complications.\nDaniel Sulmasy, director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics and a professor of medicine and philosophy at Georgetown University, a Jesuit institution, said he sees the new medical school as a positive development. He believes a faith-based medical education can foster a \u201creal sense of calling and mission\u201d in future doctors and train them to pay more attention the spiritual beliefs and needs of patients.\nHe also noted that the student body at St.\u00a0Padre Pio Institute will likely differ from most Catholic medical schools, which tend to attract high percentages of nonreligious students and hold a range of perspectives on issues like abortion. He said medical students at these institutions often train in Catholic teaching hospitals that adhere to Catholic principles and are taught Catholic perspectives on medical issues, but they\u2019re also presented with secular perspectives, and robust discussions frequently happen in the classroom.\nFor example, Sulmasy teaches a medical ethics course that includes the philosophy of Peter Singer, a bioethics scholar who argues that abortion is ethical. Sulmasy sees Georgetown as a place where students who are both in favor of and opposed to abortion rights can comfortably air their views and have a \u201cdialogue that\u2019s actually refreshing and open, where people are actually talking respectfully in ways I think can\u2019t happen about abortion in secular institutions.\u201d\nHe believes even for a mostly antiabortion student body, Catholic medical ethics has to be taught \u201cin dialogue with opposing viewpoints, if for the only reason that if you want people to believe it, they have to be able to defend it,\u201d he said.\nMychaskiw hopes to train physicians to work at Catholic hospitals across the country that would benefit from having doctors who are \u201cculturally comfortable\u201d in Catholic settings and familiar with the restrictions they follow. But he also foresees some of the students going on to work in secular hospitals. He believes training medical professionals, with a focus on \u201chigh-quality\u201d academics but also Catholic philosophical underpinnings, is its own form of religious outreach.\n\u201cOur view of evangelization is that our physicians and their practice through the care and respect of every human life and dignity of life will then, through their work, serve as an example of how physicians in the Catholic tradition care for human beings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to stand on the street corner and preach. We\u2019re here to take care of the sick and suffering, and through that, demonstrate, live out our faith.\n\u201cHealth care is short all over,\u201d he added. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, whatever hospital I\u2019m in, I want a physician that really cares for me as a human, as a patient, and respects my life and dignity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWant articles like this sent straight to your
