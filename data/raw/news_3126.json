Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Over 200 members of the House and Senate signed a brief, including U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Congressmen Steven Palazzo (MS-04), Trent Kelly (MS-01), and Michael Guest (MS-03).\n\u201cWe are so thankful for all our friends in the Her PLAN network, the pregnancy center movement, Attorney General Fitch and the people of Mississippi for boldly leading the charge to build a pro-life America that truly supports babies and mothers,\u201d said Anja Baker, Mississippi state coordinator for Her PLAN.\n\n\n\n\nHer PLAN (Her Pregnancy and Life Assistance Network) facilitates collaboration between assistance providers and their communities to empower women and families through comprehensive medical, social, and material support.\u00a0It currently operates nationally and in Georgia, Mississippi, Virginia and West Virginia.\nTo participate in the \u201cEmpower Women Promote Life Donation Drive,\u201d you can click HERE to view all 21 pregnancy center wish lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout the Author(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne Summerhays\n\nAnne Summerhays is a recent graduate of Millsaps College where she majored in Political Science, with minors in Sociology and American Studies. In 2021, she joined Y\u2019all Politics as a  Capitol Correspondent. Prior to making that move, she interned for a congressional office in Washington, D.C. and a multi-state government relations and public affairs firm in Jackson, Mississippi. While at Millsaps, Summerhays received a Legislative Fellowship with the Women\u2019s Foundation of Mississippi where she worked with an active member of the Mississippi Legislature for the length of session. She has quickly established trust in the Capitol as a fair, honest, and hardworking young reporter. Her background in political science helps her cut through the noise to find and explain the truth.
