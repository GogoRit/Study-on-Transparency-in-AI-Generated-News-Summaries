(Peter Keegan | Keystone | Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee listened to public testimony on five abortion bills and a constitutional amendment last week.\nOne bill (HB 1181) would allow any male to claim to be the biologic father of an unborn child and petition the court for an injunction prohibiting the woman from having an abortion. The claim would be made prior to any scientific evidence of paternity and with no penalty for a false claim. It would delay a termination of pregnancy four to six weeks, making the procedure more complicated and less safe. Rep. Majorie Smith importantly asked if the bill guarantees the father\u2019s support of the baby and mother. It does not.\nA second bill (HB 1625) would repeal the \u201cbuffer law\u201d prohibiting protesters from entering or remaining on a public way adjacent to a reproductive health facility. This law has been in effect since 2014, protecting patients and their providers. It also protects the facility. Attacks on reproductive health clinics continue to escalate. A Planned Parenthood in Knoxville, Tennessee, was destroyed by arson two months ago.\nFinally, on Feb. 9, Judiciary heard testimony on HB 1477, prohibiting abortions after detecting a \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d A vaginal ultrasound can identify an electrical impulse (not a heartbeat) five to six weeks following the first day of a woman\u2019s last menstrual period or three to four weeks after conception, a time when women do not know they are pregnant. This bill is similar to the Texas abortion law that essentially bans all legal abortions.\nThe next day, there was testimony on a bill (HB 1673) that would fully repeal the controversial 24-week abortion ban law, enacted Jan. 1. The ban passed and was signed by our governor as an amendment to our state budget HB 2. Representing New Hampshire obstetricians on the general council of our New Hampshire Medical Society, I can tell you no physician in this state terminates normal, healthy pregnancies at 24 weeks. The law serves no purpose.\nUnfortunate consequences of this law prohibit women from terminating a pregnancy when there is death of the baby (intrauterine fetal demise) or when there is the diagnosis of a lethal fetal anomaly made after 24 weeks. In these tragic circumstances, obstetricians are able to provide an early termination of the pregnancy. A woman carrying a dead baby can develop a serious coagulation disorder (disseminated intravascular coagulation) resulting in the death of the mother. It is unsafe and inhumane that New Hampshire has a law prolonging these pregnancies, which are extremely difficult situations.\nThe law also criminalizes physicians (Class B felony) with a fine of $10,000 to $100,000 and incarceration up to seven years. Criminalization has the potential of dismantling our state\u2019s superb maternal-fetal medicine health care system by creating an environment deterring obstetricians and, in particular, maternal-fetal medicine and neonatology sub-specialists from practicing in our state. New Hampshire has had the second lowest perinatal mortality rate in the country for years.\nFinally, the law mandates that a woman have an ultrasound prior to an abortion. Ultrasounds are expensive, invasive, and unnecessary. For all these reasons the \u201c24-week ban on abortion\u201d law does no good and has potential to create great harm.\nAlso, on Feb. 10, there was testimony on a bill (HB 1674) and a state constitutional amendment (CACR 18) that would ensure women in New Hampshire have access to safe, legal abortions, regardless of what happens nationally. The amendment would prohibit the state from \u201cinfringing upon or inconveniencing the right to reproductive medical decisions.\u201d If adopted, the right to make personal reproductive medical decisions would be guaranteed by the New Hampshire Constitution. It was a long and grueling, but important, two days of testimony.\nBefore closing, let me share one short story: Years ago as a third-year medical student at St. Paul Ramsey County Hospital, I admitted a young woman who presented with vaginal bleeding, fever/chills, and hypotension. She confessed to having had a botched back-alley abortion days before. We gave her IV fluids and the best antibiotics we had at the time and then took her to the operating room, where we removed a perforated uterus full of infection. That day, I witnessed a classic septic abortion, so common in the era prior to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.\nThis young woman was an honor student and star of her high school basketball team. To this day, I can clearly see her face. When I asked if she had informed her parents, she confided that her father was responsible for the pregnancy. She said she would rather die than tell her mother she was pregnant. Unfortunately, she died two days later.\nIn almost 40 years of practice, I never saw another woman with an illegal septic abortion. During this time, women had access to legal, safe, elective terminations of pregnancy. We cannot go back. Lawmakers, who know nothing of a woman\u2019s life, should not have a voice in her health care decisions, particularly when it comes to her pregnancy. Let us not substitute politics for compassionate care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCommentary: We cannot go back\nby Oge Young, New Hampshire Bulletin February 17, 2022\nCommentary: We cannot go back\nby Oge Young, New Hampshire Bulletin February 17, 2022\n The House Judiciary Committee listened to public testimony on five abortion bills and a constitutional amendment last week.\nOne bill (HB 1181) would allow any male to claim to be the biologic father of an unborn child and petition the court for an injunction prohibiting the woman from having an abortion.
