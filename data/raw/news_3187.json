Wade\u2014the Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal throughout the United States,\u201d said a Jan. 12 statement from the USCCB.\u00a0\nThe novena begins Jan. 19 and is sponsored by the conference\u2019s Committee on Pro-Life Activities. The first 9 Days for Life novena was prayed in 2013, in observance of the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. In the decision, the justices found that a woman had a legal right to an abortion throughout the entirety of her pregnancy.\u00a0\nEach day, participants in the novena will pray for a specific intention related to ending abortion, and will be provided with \u201ca reflection, educational information, and suggested daily actions.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan. 22 is the USCCB\u2019s annual \u201cDay of Prayer for the Legal Protection of Unborn Children.\u201d That date marks the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the case Roe v. Wade, and is a day of penance in the dioceses of the United States.\nThose seeking to participate in the novena can sign up for text or email reminders at 9daysforlife.com.
