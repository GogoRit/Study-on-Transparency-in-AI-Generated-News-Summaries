In that case, Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the court\u2019s four more liberal justices in concluding that the law made it harder for women to obtain abortions while not doing anything, despite the state\u2019s argument to the contrary, to protect the health of pregnant women. Today the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a similar law from Louisiana. But with Kennedy now retired, the law\u2019s fate seemed likely to hinge on the vote of Chief Justice John Roberts or perhaps Kennedy\u2019s successor, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\nJulie Rikelman at lectern arguing for petitioners (Art Lien)\nThe dispute before the court this morning centered on the constitutionality of a 2014 law known as the Louisiana Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, which requires doctors who perform abortions in Louisiana to have the right to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of the place where the abortion is performed. In 2018, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to the law, concluding that it did not \u201cimpose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women.\u201d\nThe challengers \u2013 doctors who perform abortions and an abortion clinic \u2013 went to the Supreme Court last year, asking the justices to temporarily bar the state from enforcing the law until they could file a petition for review of the lower court\u2019s decision. A divided court agreed to stay the lower court\u2019s ruling, with Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 a dissenter in the Texas case \u2013 joining the court\u2019s four more liberal justices in voting to stay the 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling. In April, the challengers filed their petition for review; the Supreme Court granted that petition, as well as a related petition filed by the state, in early October.\nArguing on behalf of the abortion providers, lawyer Julie Rikelman told the justices that \u201cthis case is about respect for the court\u2019s precedent.\u201d The Louisiana admitting-privileges requirement, Rikelman emphasized, was \u201cexpressly modeled on\u201d the Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 and \u201cwill do nothing for women\u2019s health.\u201d \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Rikelman continued, \u201cthat would justify such a legal about-face\u201d from the court\u2019s 2016 ruling.\nRikelman quickly faced a barrage of questions from Justice Samuel Alito regarding whether her clients had a legal right to challenge the Louisiana law, known as \u201cstanding,\u201d at all. Should a plaintiff be able to sue to protect the rights of others, Alito asked, when there is a conflict between the plaintiff\u2019s interests and the interests of the individuals whose rights the plaintiff seeks to protect? When Rikelman responded that a plaintiff should be able to sue when she is \u201cdirectly regulated\u201d by the law at issue, Alito was incredulous. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d he told Rikelman.\nRikelman pushed back, arguing that the state had waived its ability to challenge her clients\u2019 right to sue. She received an assist from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who observed that the state hadn\u2019t raised the issue until its cross-petition in the Supreme Court. The abortion providers \u201cmight have joined a patient or two\u201d if the state had flagged the question earlier, Ginsburg indicated.\nJeffrey B. Wall, Principal Deputy Solicitor General (Art Lien)\nJustice Stephen Breyer was also uninclined to agree that the abortion providers lacked standing to sue on behalf of their patients. Breyer announced that he had found at least eight cases in which the Supreme Court had allowed abortion providers to sue on behalf of their patients. Why, he asked Jeffrey Wall, the deputy U.S. solicitor general who argued on behalf of the federal government as a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d supporting Louisiana, should we \u201cdepart from what was pretty clear precedent?\u201d Wall answered that the Supreme Court has \u201cnever signed off on\u201d the right to sue for abortion providers who, like the providers in this case, have an actual conflict of interest.\nSignificantly, although Justices Clarence Thomas (who argued in his dissent in the Texas case that the abortion providers lacked a right to sue) and Neil Gorsuch did not ask any questions, neither Roberts nor Kavanaugh seemed to express any interest in the standing question, suggesting that there may not be five votes to dismiss the case on this ground.\nRoberts repeatedly returned to the question of how the justices should apply their 2016 decision in the Texas case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, to this case. Is the inquiry under Whole Woman\u2019s Health, he first asked Rikelman, a factual one that has to be conducted state by state? For example, Roberts posited, the district court would examine the availability of doctors and clinics in a particular state, so that the results could be different in different states. Roberts\u2019 view on this question could be important: If he concludes that the Whole Woman\u2019s Health inquiry is a factual one that is conducted state by state, it could allow him to find some daylight between the Louisiana law and the Texas law that the court struck down four years ago.\nRikelman acknowledged that the burdens of a law may vary according to the law at issue, but she stressed that an admitting-privileges law has no benefits and is therefore more likely to be a burden in every state.\nKavanaugh then pressed Rikelman as well. If the admitting-privileges law did not have any effect \u2013 that is, if all the doctors could get admitting privileges \u2013 would the law still be an undue burden and therefore unconstitutional? Rikelman conceded that such a case would be very different, but she reiterated that there would still be no benefit to the law.\nElizabeth Murrill, Louisiana Solicitor General (Art Lien)\nRoberts had a similar question about how to apply Whole Woman\u2019s Health for Elizabeth Murrill, Louisiana\u2019s solicitor general. Do you agree, he asked Murrill, that a court\u2019s inquiry into the benefits of an abortion law will be the same in each state? Murrill disagreed. A state could show that a law has more benefits depending on the state, she answered.\nMuch of the rest of the argument was spent discussing whether Louisiana\u2019s admitting-privileges law actually has any benefits, and whether the state\u2019s abortion providers had really made an effort to obtain privileges at nearby hospitals. Ginsburg described the requirement that an abortion provider obtain privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where she performs abortions as \u201codd.\u201d Most abortions don\u2019t result in any complications, she suggested, and even if a woman who has had an abortion needs to go to a hospital, she will go to the hospital that is closest to her home, not the hospital closest to the abortion clinic. \u201cThese laws,\u201d Ginsburg asserted, \u201cwill always put barriers to abortion\u201d while serving no benefit.\nWall resisted Ginsburg\u2019s contention that the 30-mile requirement serves no purpose. All admitting-privilege requirements have some geographical limit, he began. And even if there was no evidence in the Texas case that women who needed to be hospitalized were transferred to the hospital from the clinic, there is such evidence in this case \u2013 \u201ceven if we don\u2019t know how often it happens,\u201d Wall said.\nJustice Elena Kagan, who asked relatively few questions, posited that the admitting-privileges requirement does not necessarily guarantee that doctors who perform abortions are qualified to do so. In Whole Woman\u2019s Health, she told Murrill, the court held that the state cannot say it is imposing an admitting-privileges requirement for credentialing reasons if hospitals are denying applications for admitting privileges for other reasons \u2013 for example, because doctors don\u2019t admit enough patients to the hospital or because doctors perform abortions.\nBut Wall countered that in a case like this, when the law has not yet gone into effect, all the challengers \u201cought to have put their applications where their mouths are\u201d: They should have at least applied for admitting privileges before going to court to block the law from being enforced, so that the court could know for certain \u201cwhether they really can\u2019t get\u201d admitting privileges. And Murrill was even stronger, telling the justices that there was evidence that the challengers who had applied for admitting privileges had \u201csabotaged their own applications.\u201d\nAlito appeared sympathetic to this argument. Referring to one doctor, known only as \u201cDoe #2,\u201d Alito suggested that it would be against the doctor\u2019s own interests to make a \u201csuper effort\u201d to get admitting privileges, \u201cbecause he\u2019d be defeating his own claim.\u201d Doe #2 has previously had admitting privileges at a hospital in Shreveport, Alito noted, but he didn\u2019t apply for privileges again because it was a Catholic hospital (and he presumably believed that he wouldn\u2019t obtain them), but another doctor, known as \u201cDoe #3,\u201d did obtain admitting privileges at that hospital.\nAt one point, Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to throw up his hands. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve this at oral argument,\u201d he told Murrill. But the justices will meet to vote on the case later this week, and a decision is expected by summer.\nThis post was originally published at Howe on the Court.\n\n\n\n\nPosted in Merits Cases\n\n\nCases: June Medical Services LLC v.
