But a new lawsuit argues that such legislation violates the state constitution by combining \u201ctwo distinct and unrelated subjects\u201d into one bill.\u00a0\nThe bill, originally focused on restrictions for gender-affirming care for transgender youth, was amended to include a 12-week abortion ban with exceptions for rape and incest. That abortion ban went into effect immediately upon the bill\u2019s signing, while limits on gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old are set to go into effect in October.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national ACLU and the ACLU of Nebraska are suing to block enforcement of Nebraska\u2019s law. Their lawsuit lists two plaintiffs:\u00a0Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and Sarah Traxler, an obstetrician and gynecologist who provides reproductive services to Planned Parenthood patients.\u00a0\nNebraska\u2019s attorney general has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday morning. The ACLU is seeking immediate injunctive relief that could be granted by a judge prior to that 30-day time period.\nChelsea Souder, founder and director of Nebraska Abortion Resources (NEAR), a state abortion fund, told reporters Tuesday that the new law has exacerbated challenges for Nebraskans seeking abortion services. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, Nebraskans have been grappling with a lack of health care providers and limited appointment availability; some have been waiting three to six weeks to get care.\u00a0\nThis new law has made it worse, she said. In the first week after the bill was passed, NEAR worked with Planned Parenthood and Chicago Abortion Fund to help nine people leave the state to get reproductive care, Souder said. These were patients who had been scheduled to get abortions in Nebraska before the bill passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe impact of the 12-week ban has been immediate, Traxler told reporters Tuesday. Nebraskans are confused about whether they can receive an abortion in the state and afraid to tell those closest to them if they are seeking an abortion, she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More LGBTQ+ coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Anti-trans laws are targeting autistic youth and those with mental health conditions\n                \n\n\n\n                    Testosterone access for transgender people could be limited as COVID public health emergency ends\n                \n\n\n\n\nThe new law outlaws abortions after 12 weeks except in cases of sexual assault or incest or when the patient is at risk of dying or suffering major impairment. The law also bans all surgeries for transgender youth, though they typically do not undergo surgery procedures. It\u00a0 would allow trans youth to continue taking puberty-blocking drugs or hormone therapy if treatment began before the law goes into effect and still allows trans youth to seek treatment if they meet requirements that are already standard for most practitioners, like experiencing persistent gender dysphoria.\u00a0\nHowever, the law places the state\u2019s chief medical officer \u2014 an ear, nose and throat doctor appointed by the governor \u2014 in control of setting further rules for how minors can access care.\nRuth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference that Nebraska\u2019s legislature used \u201cunprecedented\u201d tactics to pass a 12-week abortion ban. Within the lawsuit, the ACLU lays out a timeline of how the bills came to be combined: a Nebraska bill to ban abortion after approximately six weeks of pregnancy stalled. Meanwhile, a bill to restrict gender-affirming care continued to advance.\u00a0\nThe gender-affirming care bill was amended with language that resembled the previous abortion ban \u201cin nearly every respect, except it banned abortion at 12 weeks,\u201d the lawsuit says \u2014 requiring lawmakers to either vote for or against both proposals simultaneously.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More abortion coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Abortion bans are unpopular. Republicans are passing them anyway.\n                \n\n\n\n                    South Carolina House passes six-week abortion ban\n                \n\n\n\n                    Abortion bans are barring people from life-saving pregnancy care, medical groups warn\n                \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn my time here, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a bill like this,\u201d said Jane Seu, legal and policy counsel who has been with the ACLU of Nebraska for two years. To combine these issues \u201cin one bill in order to gain passage on both issues is an unconstitutional maneuver,\u201d she said Tuesday.\u00a0\nFights for abortion access and gender-affirming care are seen by many advocates of those procedures as inherently linked campaigns for bodily autonomy. In the fight over Nebraska\u2019s new law, those viewpoints are reversed \u2014 as proponents of the law argue that banning abortion and targeting gender-affirming care both serve to protect children.\u00a0\nThe law\u2019s passage comes after Democratic lawmakers stonewalled the state\u2019s legislative session for weeks in response to efforts to ban gender-affirming care. State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, the driving force behind the effort, has continued her filibuster even after the governor signed the new law and as Republicans in the state\u2019s unicameral legislature have been able to advance more bills.\u00a0\nDr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine doctor based in Omaha, spoke to The 19th this month about the strain of providing gender-affirming care in Nebraska right now \u2014 and how watching political attacks on medical care has been the worst moment of his career.\u00a0\n\u201cThe amount of pure hatred and animus towards a vulnerable marginalized community, and also the amount of hate directed at doctors like me \u2026 it hurts differently than the other things I\u2019ve been through,\u201d said Dworak.\u00a0\nHelping patients through the early days of the pandemic felt like fighting a natural disaster \u2014\u00a0something that couldn\u2019t be controlled. Now, trying to protect patients means going to the capitol to testify against anti-trans bills \u2014\u00a0and watching \u201chuman cruelty\u201d hurt his patients.\u00a0\nTwo of Dworak\u2019s adult transgender patients, a couple, have already moved to Illinois to escape Nebraska\u2019s increasingly anti-trans political environment. He\u2019s written a reference letter for one family of a young trans patient in case they decide to leave the state and try to find a new doctor.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nLawmakers in blue states are linking protections for abortion and gender-affirming care\n\n\n\n\nIdaho and Oklahoma expected to be first states to pass Texas-inspired six-week abortion bans\n\n\n\n\nIowa lawmakers pass six-week abortion ban in one-day special session\n\n\n\n\nHealth care for transgender adults becomes new target in 2023 legislative session\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
