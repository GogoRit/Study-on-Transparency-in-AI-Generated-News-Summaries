Denying or delaying health care places an immediate burden on patients, their families, our communities, and the health system, and can have profound and lasting consequences.\u00a0 Abortion is an essential, time-sensitive medical procedure, as medical experts like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology have recognized.\u00a0\n\u201cReproductive health providers are committed to the health of their communities. What matters most, even in a pandemic, is that providers are able to provide essential health care without barriers, while also flattening the curve in the community.\u201d\nStatement from Heather Gatnarek, ACLU-KY Staff Attorney:\n\u201cIt is outrageous that Attorney General Cameron and Kentucky politicians are trying to take advantage of a public health crisis to push their anti-abortion agenda.\u00a0 As trusted health organizations like the\u00a0American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u00a0have made clear, politicians should not push \u2018COVID-19 responses that cancel or delay abortion procedures.\u2019 These national medical experts further explained that \u2018abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible.\u2019 Everyone\u2019s situation is different and it is critical that people be able to make their own decisions about continuing or ending a pregnancy, in consultation with their loved ones and their health providers. These politicians should listen to medical experts and stop playing politics with Kentuckians\u2019 health.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEMW's top priority is their patients\u2019 safety and care.\u00a0 During this unprecedented time, EMW is following all guidance from public health experts to ensure that patients\u2019 risk of coming into contact with COVID-19 are minimized, including instituting measures that allow for social distancing and screening patients for common COVID-19 symptoms prior to their receiving care.\u201d\n\n\n###\n\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky\u00a0(PPINK) provides high-quality health care to over 45,000 people each year at our health centers across two states.
