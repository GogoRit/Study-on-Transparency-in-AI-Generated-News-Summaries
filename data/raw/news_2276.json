(Photo: Allyson Escobar)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With a handmade sign \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m smiling because my birthmother chose life!\u201d \u2014 and a big smile on her face, Natanya Stark, 18, proudly walked with her family during the annual national March for Life on Jan. 24 in Washington.\n\u201cI find the pro-life movement very compelling. My birth mother was very young when she had me, and I was very inspired by her courage,\u201d Natanya, the adopted daughter of Adam and Marisa Stark, said.\n\u201cI wanted to show people my [activism], and to talk about supporting adoptions, because I have a lot of siblings who are also adopted. I want to spread the word that adoption is an option and the best thing to do.\u201d\nThe Starks, who live in Pound Ridge in Westchester County, have seven children, six of them adopted, including three from China. The family\u2019s story shows another facet of the pro-life movement: adoption. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for them to see that there are lots of people who share our beliefs and to know they\u2019re not alone,\u201d said Adam Stark, the father, who\u2019s a real estate manager. \u201cGoing to the March for Life was very important for our kids, especially for our kids who are adopted and even our biological son. It\u2019s the whole idea that there are no unwanted children. There are always families these children belong to.\u201d \nOver the course of almost 15 years, the Starks, who are Jewish, adopted three children from the United States \u2014 Natanya, David and Maya \u2014 and then three from China \u2014 Jessica, Ella and Celia. \nAdam Stark, who married his wife, Marisa, in 1998, said the couple \u201cjust always knew\u201d that they would adopt.\n\u201cWe wanted to create a big, special family, and it\u2019s the best thing we\u2019ve ever done. We have the means to give a child in need a family. I wouldn\u2019t have done it any different way. To benefit from having that child as part of your family, it\u2019s created a very special dynamic for us,\u201d he said.\n\nMy children wouldn\u2019t be here if their birth mother decided against life.\n\u2013 Marisa Stark\n\n\nNatanya, their first child, was adopted from an agency the couple found in Kansas. After doing the routine paperwork and social worker home study, they were paired with the birth mother, a teenager who \u201cwasn\u2019t able to support her baby\u201d but who wanted the child to \u201cgrow up with a good life and a good family,\u201d Adam said.\nAdam and Marisa flew to Kansas and met Natanya on the night she was born: Jan. 21, 2002. Adam remembers the very first time he held his adopted daughter, and later taking her home to New York. \u201cShe was very tiny,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was the smallest baby ever on that plane.\u201d\nThe Starks knew that they wanted their child to have siblings of her own to play with, and in 2004, with the help of another agency, they brought home twins from Texas: David and Maya, who are now 15.\nElla, David, Celia, Natanya, Zachary, Jessica, Maya, and Marisa Stark at their home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. (Photo: courtesy of Marisa Stark)\nIn April 2007, their biological son, Zachary, was born, but for Marisa, four wasn\u2019t enough. She read articles about foster care and learned about abandoned children in orphanages in need of homes, especially in China. She saw a photo of Jessica, who was burned as a child and was only a couple of months younger than Natanya.\nThe process of international adoption took about 13 \u201cfrightening\u201d months, Marisa says. By the time the Starks completed the paperwork, Jessica was already seven years old when she came to live with the family in 2009.\n\u201cThere was this little girl on the other side of the world stuck in an orphanage; I was beside myself because of all the quarantines and delays,\u201d Marisa said. \u201cBut we brought her home, and I remember Natanya ran up to Jessica screaming, \u2018Jessie, I\u2019ve been waiting for you my whole life!\u2019 She was so happy to have a sister her own age.\u201d\nAfter Jessica, whom the parents describe as the \u201ceasy, artistic one,\u201d the Starks wanted to continue to add to their family. A little over a year later, in 2010, Natanya and Marisa went back to China to pick up their fifth toddler, Ella, who was born with one eye. \nThen five years later, Celia came along after the Starks participated in a Chinese government-led temporary host family adoptee program. Under the program, Celia went to live with the Starks in late 2015 for four weeks. She had cerebral palsy and \u201cthe biggest grin we\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Marisa said. \u201cWe always called her \u2018Ms. Happy.\u2019\u201d\nNatanya Stark attended her first March For Life in Washington D.C. on Jan. 24. She says she was excited to see young people her age marching for the cause. (Photo: Allyson Escobar)\nMarisa described Celia as \u201cthe sweetest, happiest, most cheerful kid in the whole world \u2026 Adam and I and the kids knew, we couldn\u2019t let her go.\u201d \nThey went through the adoption process once more and brought Celia, then 9, home in late 2016. Now 12 years old, she is enrolled in a special education program. \n\u201cShe has certain developmental challenges, but everyone knows and loves her,\u201d Adam says. \u201cCelia lights up a room.\u201d\n\u201cMy kids are all so different, and it\u2019s so nice to be a part of that,\u201d Marisa says. \u201cOne day I can be in the theater with Maya, to watching debates with Zachary, or cheering David at cross-country meets. Or Jessica, who came into the States not speaking any English, and now she\u2019s a top student and into photography. \n\u201cMy children wouldn\u2019t be here if their birth mother decided against life. All of them understand that,\u201d she said. \n\n\nTags: adoption, Catholic News, March for Life, New York, pro-life Login here to comment\nShare this article with a friend.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername or Email\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nRemember Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue with GoogleContinue with Facebook\n\n \n\n\nPrevious New York News Story Next New York News Story\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tablet Headlines Delivered Daily\n\n\n\nCatholic Headlines Widget Signup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\r\n        *\n\n\n\n\nYour email will be used to send you The Tablet newsletter.
