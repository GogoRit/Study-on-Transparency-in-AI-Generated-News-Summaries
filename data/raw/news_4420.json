But for decades it has been a case study in contradictions when it comes to aid and foreign policy, and in no area is this more evident than reproductive health and rights, particularly abortion.\u00a0\nReproductive healthcare, including abortion, is a\u00a0critical need, and is\u00a0essential. It is time-sensitive and cannot be delayed without profound consequences for pregnant people and their families.\u00a0\nUS policies restrict access to safe abortion not just by attaching anti-abortion conditions to foreign aid. The United States also imposes its rules on how medical providers and non-profits spend their own funds, and on how they care for and advise their clients.\u00a0\nMore than\u00a035 million people around the world have unsafe abortions each year, and tens of thousands die. The global pandemic has exacerbated the gender, racial, and economic inequities in healthcare systems \u2013 and in emergency settings \u2013 making safe access to abortion an urgent matter of life and death for even more people.\nRecent research suggests a 10 percent decline in contraceptive use would affect 49 million women and lead to an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies over just one year. And, the researchers say, if 10 percent of safe abortions become unsafe amid lockdowns and clinic closures, there would be an increase of 1,000 more maternal deaths each year.\nA problem exported by law\nThe United States has recently been rolling back access to abortion care domestically, but US foreign policy has for decades also harmed the health and well-being of pregnant people in the Global South.\u00a0\nThe anti-abortion, anti-rights, anti-woman position held by so many American leaders and policymakers \u2013 exaggerated by the current administration \u2013 puts the United States at odds with much of the rest of the world and diminishes its historical leadership on global health and human rights issues.\nSuccessive US policies have restricted access to comprehensive and often lifesaving, reproductive healthcare.\nIn 1973, the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act was enacted \u2013 effectively banning all US international funding for abortion-related activities. The Helms Amendment remains in force and applies to any foreign assistance, including bilateral support for governments and humanitarian relief.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUS foreign policy has for decades also harmed the health and well-being of pregnant people in the Global South.\n\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan introduced the Mexico City Policy, later referred to as the Global Gag Rule. This executive order \u2013 rescinded by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republican ones since Reagan \u2013 goes further: It restricts foreign NGOs that receive US global health funds from using their own resources to engage in abortion-related work.\nThat rule has been expanded under President Donald Trump to cover all types of global health assistance, including for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning and reproductive health. In effect, US government agencies are now directed to apply an unprecedented global anti-abortion policy, impacting about\u00a0$12 billion in aid.\u00a0\nBoth the Helms Amendment and the Global Gag Rule export American abortion policies and, as conditions on assistance, reflect a neo-colonialist ideology that has only grown in the last several years.\u00a0\nThe United States has also sought to recruit others into its campaign. In July 2020, the Trump administration released a report attempting to\u00a0redefine the global human rights framework and undermine the UN. And last year, US diplomats \u2013 led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2013 urged UN member states to oppose \u201charmful\u201d policies that promote\u00a0sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nThe campaign even includes an attempt to restrict the use of language. Unbelievably, in May \u2013 during the continued spread of COVID-19 \u2013 the acting director of the US government department that oversees foreign aid, USAID, sent a\u00a0letter to the UN asking it to remove references to \u201csexual and reproductive health\u201d from its global response plan for the pandemic, and to drop references to the provision of abortion as an essential service.\nInequality and colonisation\nBefore the pandemic struck, the UN estimated that 48 million women, girls, and young people,\u00a0including four million pregnant people, would need reproductive healthcare in emergency settings.\nWhen health systems collapse, women and girls are disproportionately affected. They are more likely to be subject to rape, prostitution, trafficking, forced pregnancy, and forced marriage.\nMaternal mortality is an indicator of inequality between and within countries. Women die from pregnancy-related causes because they don\u2019t have access to information, to healthcare, to education. The lives of poor women, who are predominantly Black or brown, and those who are caught in crisis situations, are valued less than others.\nThe United States can and should adopt policies that support and defend the rights of all people, instead of undermining the human rights framework and continuing racist and colonial policies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe lives of poor women, who are predominantly Black or brown, and those who are caught in crisis situations, are valued less than others.\n\nAs they look ahead, Americans should recall that their history is full of examples of their compatriots truly leading \u2013 both in reproductive health and in support of decolonisation.\u00a0\nThe Nixon administration opposed the Helms Amendment, saying it stood against decolonisation efforts, and restricted \u201cdeveloping country governments and individuals in the matter of free choice\u201d.\nMany African, Asian, and Latin American countries had colonial abortion laws on the books well into the twentieth century, yet activists in the Global South have successfully advocated for reforms, and governments have taken steps to ensure reproductive freedom. Indeed, since 2000*,\u00a028 countries have expanded legal grounds to allow abortion. America can and should support them.\nOne simple yet incredibly effective way to do so would be to pass the\u00a0Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act. Introduced in Congress in July and co-sponsored by 115 members of Congress and 117 partner organisations, it calls for the repeal of the Helms Amendment and a positive role for the United States in sexual and reproductive healthcare, including abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nAmerica can \u2013 and should \u2013 reshape its role in the humanitarian sector, and the world.\nWhat\u2019s at stake if it doesn\u2019t take up this charge? Ultimately, people\u2019s lives, the reputation of the United States in the eyes of the world, as well as the causes of human rights and social justice.\nAmericans believe that people in developing countries deserve the safety and dignity of basic healthcare. That must include comprehensive reproductive healthcare.\nAmericans also believe the United States\u00a0plays an important role in making the world a better place by addressing poverty, disease, and injustice. Their politicians must listen.\n(*An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that 28 countries had expanded legal grounds to allow abortion \"since 2008\". The story was updated to say \"since 2000\" on 3 November, 2020.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about...\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nAid and Policy\n\n\nPolitics and Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nShare via WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\nShare via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAid and Policy\nCheat Sheet\n\n15 March 2024\n\n\n\nRafah\u2019s civilians, Mozambique\u2019s storms, and finding joy in Malawi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAid and Policy\nCheat Sheet\n\n1 March 2024\n\n\n\nGaza convoy massacre, Sudan aid challenges, and Shell\u2019s oil legacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAid and Policy\nCheat Sheet\n\n23 February 2024\n\n\n\nGaza aid \u2018illusion\u2019, Ukraine two-year, and who are the Houthis hurting?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\nPodcasts\n\n22 February 2024\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Unsaid | Is the politicisation of health workers getting worse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAid and Policy\nCheat Sheet\n\n16 February 2024\n\n\n\nGaza hospital raid, aid sector budget cuts, and soaring arms sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the day\u2019s top headlines in your inbox every morning\nStarting at just $5 a month, you can become a member of The New Humanitarian and receive our premium newsletter, DAWNS Digest.\nDAWNS Digest has been the trusted essential morning read for global aid and foreign policy professionals for more than 10 years.\nGovernment, media, global governance organisations, NGOs, academics, and more subscribe to DAWNS to receive the day\u2019s top global headlines of news and analysis in their inboxes every weekday morning.\nIt\u2019s the perfect way to start your day.\nBecome a member of The New Humanitarian today and you\u2019ll automatically be subscribed to DAWNS Digest \u2013 free of charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the latest humanitarian news, direct to your inbox\n\n\nSign up to receive our original, on-the-ground coverage that informs policymakers, practitioners, donors, and others who want to make the world more humane.\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a member of The New Humanitarian\n\n\nSupport our journalism and become more involved in our community.
