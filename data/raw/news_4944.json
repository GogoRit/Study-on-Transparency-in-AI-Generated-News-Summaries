Wade, lawmakers have attempted to both shore up abortion rights and to overturn the decision \u2014 all while abortion transformed national politics.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Becker\n Washington Correspondent \n\n\n\n\n \n\nPublished\n\n \n\n2022-01-26 09:40\n9:40\nJanuary 26, 2022\nam\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour trusted source for contextualizing politics news.\u00a0Sign up for our daily newsletter.\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court in September left Texas\u2019 restrictive six-week abortion ban in place, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly responded that the conservative majority\u2019s \u201cdark-of-night decision\u201d was \u201cflagrantly unconstitutional\u201d and would be met with swift congressional action.\nIt was. Three weeks later, the House passed by a 218-to-211 vote the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would prohibit states from passing most abortion restrictions prior to fetal viability. It was opposed by all House Republicans, along with Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, the chamber\u2019s last anti-abortion Democrat.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate has yet to act. Even if it did, the bill is unlikely to pass the evenly divided 100-seat chamber, where nearly all legislation needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster. So even as Republican state lawmakers introduce copycat bans based on the Texas law, and the Supreme Court weighs a case that could upend abortion rights, the chance of federal legislation making it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by November, when Democrats could lose control of the House, the Senate or both, is basically nonexistent.\nForty-nine years have passed since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade established the constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. There have been congressional attempts to pass a constitutional amendment overturning Roe, as well as efforts to codify the decision. All have failed. Along the way, abortion has transformed national politics and created a gulf between voters and party leaders to the extent that by 2019, as many as 3 in 10 Democrats and Republicans did not agree with their party on abortion, according to the Pew Research Center.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Happening Now:\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    What we know about the Supreme Court draft opinion \u2014 and what it could mean for abortion access\n                \n\n\n\n                    Impacts of leaked Supreme Court draft decision could have a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on abortion access\n                \n\n\n\n\nCalls from Democrats to \u201ccodify Roe\u201d have intensified in recent months, with Roe\u2019s 49th (and potentially last) anniversary last week, several intermediary decisions on the Texas law, and a separate case \u2014 Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2014 before the Supreme Court concerning a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. Last month during oral arguments in that case, a majority of justices indicated that they are willing, at minimum, to weaken the viability standard set by Roe at approximately 24 weeks pregnancy.\nA Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs is expected by summer, and it has the potential to cap a decades-long effort by conservative abortion opponents to gut the Roe ruling and leave the issue up to the states.\u00a0\nHow the two parties arrived at this pivotal moment for abortion access involves the emergence of a new wedge issue, a realignment of the political parties, and decisions they made along the way about when and how to push for abortion regulations and to what extent.\u00a0\nAnd it all happened within the past 50 years.\n\nCecile Richards, president of the reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood and its affiliated political arm from 2006 to 2018, bristles when she hears the word \u201ccontroversial\u201d used to describe abortion. Public opinion has shown a majority support for abortion access that has remained remarkably consistent, she said.\u00a0\nA June 2021 survey of U.S. attitudes about abortion rights and Roe from public opinion polling firm Gallup, for example, showed that 58 percent of Americans opposed overturning the 1973 ruling and 32 percent favored it \u2014 mirroring public opinion in 1989.\u00a0\n\u201cI think some people have a hard time wrapping their head around two different ideas: One is that people have their own personal feelings about abortion, their own experience with it, what they feel like they would do, what they would want their daughter to do,\u201d Richards told The 19th. The other is that they \u201cabsolutely do not want the government to make these decisions.\u201d\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changed is the politics of the Republican Party and frankly, the Democratic Party,\u201d she added.\u00a0\nIn 1975, when abortion was a newly established constitutional right, 19 percent of Democrats told Gallup that abortion should be legal in \u201call or most cases,\u201d 51 percent said it should be legal in certain cases, and 26 percent said it should be illegal in all cases. Among Republicans, the numbers were strikingly similar: 18 percent said abortion should be legal in \u201call or most cases,\u201d 55 percent said it should be in some and 25 percent said it should be illegal in all.\u00a0\nThe same poll taken in 2021 showed more Democratic voters supporting abortion in \u201call or most cases\u201d and more Republicans supporting it in none, with sizeable majorities in both parties \u2014 91 percent of Democrats; 69 percent of Republicans \u2014 continuing to support abortion access in at least some cases.\u00a0\nBut the parties in Congress are less nuanced. In the House, Texas\u2019 Cuellar is considered the only reliably anti-abortion Democrat and, as of 2019, there are no Republicans who support abortion rights. In the Senate, Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania both self identify as \u201cpro-life,\u201d though they have at times supported forms of abortion access, and Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have both embraced some abortion rights.\u00a0\nAs political scientists Scott Ainsworth and Thad Hall write in the 2010 book \u201cAbortion Politics in Congress\u201d: When it comes to abortion, \u201cthe increasingly partisan nature of abortion politics represents a case of issue evolution driven by party elites and filtering down to the masses.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

She said one key to understanding abortion politics in 2021 is knowing that just several decades ago it was not considered a political issue at all.\nVon Hagel recalled a student who told her about a conversation with their grandmother and several others from that generation about studying the politics of reproductive rights. \u201cThese older ladies were just like: Why in the world is this a political issue? We never talked about it like that in the past,\u201d Von Hagel remembers the student relaying.\u00a0 \u201cI can still picture her face, thinking: \u2018How is this possible?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a very, very purposeful realignment that happened,\u201d Von Hagel added.\n\nHeading into the 1970s, political affiliation was not an accurate predictor for whether an individual supported abortion rights \u2014 for voters or elected officials. But over the next 20 years, a political party realignment around abortion would begin to take shape.\u00a0\nBrother John of the Holy Faith kneels facing a group from Catholics for Choice during a morning of demonstrations outside the Supreme Court on June 29, 1989.\n (Kevin Larkin/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe term \u201cpro-life\u201d was not even in the political lexicon in 1972, when Republican Richard Nixon adopted anti-abortion positions during his presidential reelection campaign in a successful bid to win over Catholic voters, who had traditionally backed Democratic presidents, including the two before Nixon.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade energized the anti-abortion coalition of evangelical as well as Catholic voters that began to emerge during Nixon\u2019s presidency and still exists in politics today. Privately, Nixon told top aides that while he feared the ruling could encourage sexual promiscuity, he believed abortions should be available in certain circumstances, such as for pregnancies resoluting from incest or interracial relationships.\u00a0\nMary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies abortion, believes that the Senate probably had a bipartisan majority that supported abortion rights when Roe was decided, but advocates did not feel a pressing need to pass legislation.\u00a0\n\u201cIt seemed to be kind of like overkill, because at the time, the abortion rights movement trusted the courts to protect abortion rights for some time,\u201d Ziegler told The 19th.\u00a0\nDuring the 1976 presidential campaign, both Republican Gerald Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter opposed abortion in some cases. That year Congress for the first time approved the Hyde Amendment, which bars using federal dollars for most abortions, including in the government\u2019s Medicaid health insurance program.\u00a0\nMore Democrats than Republicans voted for for it, handing abortion rights opponents their first post-Roe victory. But some of those Democrats did so because it seemed like abortion rights were settled law and the Supreme Court would step in when it was challenged, according to Ziegler.\n\u201cThere were some Democrats and progressives who voted for the Hyde Amendment in part because they thought the Supreme Court would invalidate it \u2014 it was part of an appropriations bill, so if you liked other stuff in the appropriations bill, that was fine, because the Supreme Court would take care of it,\u201d Ziegler said.\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment in 1980.\u00a0\nMarchers protesting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe fill Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Capitol on January 22, 1981.\n (Herbert K. White/AP)\nIt was around this time that \u201cabortion started to become linked to ideology and party in ways that had not occurred before,\u201d according to Ainsworth and Hall. Republican Ronald Reagan \u2014 who had relaxed abortion restrictions as California\u2019s governor \u2014\u00a0called for the appointment of anti-abortion judges during his 1980 White House campaign. By the late 1980s, he had nominated more federal judges than any president before or since, and abortion rights groups began to realize \u201cwe can\u2019t really rely on the courts anymore, we need to find a way through the political process to protect access to abortion,\u201d Ziegler said.\u00a0\nWhen Democrat Bill Clinton campaigned for the White House in 1992, he did so with the message that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201d At the time, that was the most forceful support for abortion rights from a post-Roe president, but it has since become outmoded in Democratic politics. When Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii repeated it during the 2020 presidential primary, abortion rights advocates said she was out of step with a movement that believed \u201crare\u201d was a concession to their opponents.\u00a0\nOnce president, Clinton marked the 20th anniversary of the Roe decision by reversing abortion restrictions put in place by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. But legislation proved harder. Though Clinton began his presidency with Democrats in control of both the House and Senate \u2014 and with a majority that backed abortion rights, according to Ziegler \u2014 disagreements in his own party remained over how to handle the Hyde Amendment and other specifics.\nAbortion rights demonstrators at the March for Women\u0092s Lives rally in Washington, D.C., on April 5, 1992.\n (Mark Reinstein/Corbis via Getty Images)\nIn 1992, the Supreme Court had affirmed the right to an abortion in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which challenged restrictive Pennsylvania laws. But the ruling also said states had some leeway to add some limits to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. So Democrats revived the Freedom of Choice Act \u2014 that era\u2019s attempt to codify Roe. When it failed in 1993, Democratic leaders turned their focus to health care legislation.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen it starts to take too long, you see the Democratic Party essentially saying: Well, we\u2019re not going to worry about this, we\u2019ll get to this later,\u201d Ziegler said.\u00a0\nAccording to Michele Swers, a government professor at Georgetown University, the \u201cmost aggressive Democrats got\u201d on abortion rights during this time period was the FACE Act, a law that protected clinic entrances. The window for any broader effort closed when Democrats lost control of both chambers of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections.\n\nIn 1994, the Republican Party ran on its newly released Contract with America. Though by that time the party\u2019s candidates and lawmakers were increasingly aligning with the anti-abortion movement, the contract focused on \u201c60 percent issues\u201d that had broad support from the electorate like slashing welfare programs and a balanced budget amendment. Overturning Roe was not one of them, so it was silent on abortion. The contract fueled Republican victories in the House and Senate, putting them in control of both congressional chambers for the first time since the 1950s.\u00a0\nIn early 1995, the Christian Coalition, a group founded in 1987 by religious conservative and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson that became emblematic of the Christian right, released its own \u201ccontract with the American family\u201d at a news conference alongside then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of the authors of the party\u2019s 1994 platform. That \u201ccontract\u201d did not propose a constitutional amendment to ban abortion outright due to practical concerns, political analysts said at the time, but it did call for restrictions on late-term abortions. Even still, intraparty divides over abortion existed. Then-Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who was considering a Republican presidential bid based on curbing religious influence on the party, told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that he would not support it because \u201cit opposes a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat followed was a period when increasingly socially conservative Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents became more tenacious in supporting incremental restrictions. Republicans attached abortion-related riders to appropriations bills and repeatedly introduced what would become known as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which the Republican-controlled Congress passed twice only to be vetoed by Clinton, then eventually signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush in 2003.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban will stay in effect indefinitely after Supreme Court decision to allow legal delays\n                \n\n\n\n                    Abortion rights groups tie their fight to voting rights\n                \n\n\n\n                    Abortion rights advocates want to hear more from Joe Biden\n                \n\n\n\n\nIt was during debate over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which banned abortions by \u201cdilation and extraction\u201d in the second trimester of pregnancy, that public opinion about an absolute right to legal abortion began to shift, according to tracking polls and Ziegler\u2019s research \u2014 and reproductive rights advocates worried they were losing the messaging battle. Even the name of the law, which adopted a term not used in medicine to describe late-term abortions, was seen as a victory for abortion opponents. In the House, the final version of the legislation was backed by 218 Republicans and 63 Democrats; in the Senate, 47 Republicans and 17 Democrats. Its constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007.\nRichards said that when she got to Planned Parenthood in 2006, the Democratic Party was still recruiting congressional candidates who did not support abortion rights. The organization \u201creally worked hard to establish that it was a fundamental right, and that it was something that the Democratic Party needed to lead on.\u201d\nAbortion rights advocates found an ally in then-Sen. Barack Obama, who told Planned Parenthood early in his Democratic White House bid that \u201cthe first thing I\u2019d do as president\u201d would be to codify Roe by signing the latest iteration of the Freedom of Choice Act. But four months into his presidency, Obama said it was \u201cnot my highest legislative priority\u201d and suggested energy would be better spent reducing unintended pregnancies.\u00a0\nBut Democratic differences on abortion threatened to derail Obama\u2019s namesake health care law. With Republicans united in opposition, Democrats could not afford to lose a single senator, and Ben Nelson, an anti-abortion Democrat from Nebraska, was the final holdout. To win his support, party leaders included a version of an amendment that does not mandate Affordable Care Act plans cover abortion, which was originally offered by another anti-abortion Democratic representative, Bart Stupak of Michigan. To appease opponents, Obama also issued an executive order reiterating that federal money would not be used to pay for abortions. Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates tried to take solace in the fact ACA plans would cover contraception.\nAnti-abortion activist stage a \u201cdie-in\u201d in front of the White House in on January 21, 2015.\n (Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images)\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans picked up more than 60 House seats to retake control of that chamber and added seven in the Senate as part of the tea party wave. Republican efforts picked up to \u201cdefund\u201d Planned Parenthood by denying the organization state and federal money throughout the rest of Obama\u2019s presidency, many of them spearheaded by then-Rep. Mike Pence. In 2015, Republican House Speaker John Boehner resigned in part due to repeated battles with the conservative Freedom Caucus over their desire to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood funding.\u00a0\n\nIn January 2016, Planned Parenthood, under Richards\u2019 leadership, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House bid. It was the first time the organization had made an endorsement in a presidential primary, but as Richards told the New York Times: \u201cEverything Planned Parenthood has believed in and fought for over the past 100 years is on the ballot.\u201d When Clinton accepted the endorsement and announced that she supported repealing the Hyde Amendment, the Guardian called it \u201ctruly surprising\u201d and Salon said it was a \u201cgame changer.\u201d Hyde Amendment repeal ended up in the Democratic Party\u2019s official policy platform \u2014 a move polling showed was popular with the party\u2019s base but less so with the broader electorate.\u00a0\nClinton went on to lose the November 2016 election to Republican Donald Trump, who said he was running to be a \u201cpro-life president\u201d and had taken a number of anti-abortion stances during his campaign. He was the first sitting president to attend the annual March for Life rally and appointed three Supreme Court justices \u2014 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 who cemented the court\u2019s conservative anti-abortion majority.\u00a0\nBy the time the 2020 Democratic presidential primary got underway, the sizable field of contenders all supported some version of Roe codification and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, citing the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to curb abortion access and restrictive laws recently enacted in Georgia and Alabama. To run for president as a Democrat in 2020 meant unequivocally supporting abortion rights \u2014 and for Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, it necessitated an evolution.\nAfter Biden joined the Senate in 1973, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to overturn the court\u2019s Roe ruling. In a Washingtonian magazine interview at the time, he said of Roe: \u201cI think it went too far. I don\u2019t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.\u201d But times changed, and so did he. In a 2007 book, Biden said he had arrived at a \u201cmiddle-of-the-road position on abortion.\u201d In 2008, he described Roe as \u201cclose to a consensus that can exist in a society as heterogeneous as ours.\u201d As Obama\u2019s vice president, Biden said the government had no \u201cright to tell other people that women, they can\u2019t control their own body.\u201d\u00a0\nBy the 2020 presidential primary, his abortion politics matched the party\u2019s base.\u00a0\nBiden went on to drop the Hyde Amendment in his first budget proposal. Early in his presidency, he also rescinded the Mexico City Policy, known as the global gag rule, which requires foreign organizations to certify they will not promote abortion as a condition for receiving U.S. aid for reproductive health care. In October, his administration reversed a Trump-era regulation that barred health care providers receiving Title X family planning funds from mentioning abortion care to patients as an option.\u00a0\nPeople attend this year\u2019s March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington on January 21.\n (Susan Walsh/AP)\nBiden has emphasized codifying Roe as a proxy for his larger abortion messaging and has said he would sign the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act if it were to make it to his desk. But, with anti-abortion conservatives anticipating judicial victory, it is unclear what, if anything Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 or Democrats in Congress \u2014 can deliver legislatively.\nSince Democrats lack a legislative path to head off the Dobbs decision, they have turned to making the case that voters should reinforce their congressional majorities in the 2022 midterms, believing the party\u2019s support for abortion access will benefit their candidates up and down the ballot.\n\u201cWe are in a total stalemate in Congress and it would take extraordinary leadership by this president and frankly, by the Democrats in the United States Senate, to do anything legislatively to codify Roe,\u201d Richards said.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people, unless they live in the state of Texas, know what is potentially coming,\u201d she added.\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats see a winning midterm message: Vote, or Texas-style abortion laws are \u2018coming to a state near you\u2019\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats call statehouse races \u2018the last line of defense\u2019 for abortion rights\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats\u2019 abortion bill fails \u2014 again \u2014 and they turn to November elections\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats\u2019 abortion bill fails \u2014 again \u2014 and they turn to November elections\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
