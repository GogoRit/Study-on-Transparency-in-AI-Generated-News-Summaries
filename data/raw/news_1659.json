adults are satisfied with abortion policies; 69% dissatisfied\n46% of Americans are dissatisfied and want less strict laws\n15% of U.S. adults are dissatisfied and want more strict laws\n\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans are more dissatisfied with U.S. abortion policies now than they have been at any point in Gallup\u2019s 23-year trend, and those who are dissatisfied are three times as likely to prefer less strict rather than more strict abortion laws.\nThe record-high 69% of U.S. adults dissatisfied with abortion laws includes 46% who prefer that these laws be made less strict, marking a 16-percentage-point jump in this sentiment since January 2022. In addition, 15% of Americans are dissatisfied and favor stricter laws, and 8% are dissatisfied but want them to stay the same. Meanwhile, 26% of Americans are satisfied with the nation\u2019s abortion policies, similar to last year\u2019s 24% record low.\n###Embeddable###\nBetween 2001 and 2021, the percentage of Americans dissatisfied with U.S. abortion policies ranged from 43% (in 2002 and 2008) to 58% (in 2020). During this time, those who expressed dissatisfaction were significantly more likely to do so because they typically didn\u2019t think the laws were strict enough rather than too strict.\nDissatisfaction with abortion laws increased in 2022, even as it switched to being driven more by a desire for the laws to be less strict. This shift likely reflects two events in late 2021 -- when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a restrictive Texas abortion law to stand and when the conservative-leaning high court heard oral arguments in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case challenging the constitutionality of abortion.\nThe latest data, from a Jan. 2-22, 2023, Gallup poll, reflect the public\u2019s reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision in June that overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion and subsequent changes to abortion laws in a number of states.\nDemocrats\u2019 Dissatisfaction and Desire for Less Strict Laws Up Sharply\nFor much of the period between 2001 and 2021, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to express satisfaction with abortion laws. However, in January 2022, dissatisfaction and a preference for less strict abortion laws increased by 15 points among Democrats to 43%, 14 points among independents to 31% and 12 points among Republicans to 14%.\nRecord percentages in all party groups are now dissatisfied and call for less strict abortion laws, but the 74% of Democrats with these attitudes is up the most -- 31 points in one year. The same response rose 13 points among independents to 44%, and it was statistically unchanged and far lower, at 17%, among Republicans.\nRepublicans are currently three times as likely as Democrats to express satisfaction with the nation\u2019s abortion policies, 39% versus 13%.\n###Embeddable###\nHalf of Women Now Dissatisfied and Want Less Strict Abortion Laws\nThe percentage of women who are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion policies and support less strict laws has risen 18 points this year to 50%, compared with a 13-point increase among men to 41% over the past year. Both readings are the highest on record for those groups.\n###Embeddable###\nDissatisfied Catholics and Protestants Increasingly Support Less Strict Laws\nFor the first time in Gallup\u2019s trend, pluralities of Catholic (38%) and Protestant (37%) Americans and a majority of those with no religious identity (69%) express dissatisfaction with abortion policies and a preference for less strict laws.\nLast year, the percentages of Catholics and Protestants who were dissatisfied and wanted stricter laws, or less strict laws, were roughly equal. And the largest percentage of Catholics, 28%, were satisfied with abortion laws.\n###Embeddable###\nBefore 2022, dissatisfied Catholics and Protestants were typically more likely to favor stricter rather than less strict abortion laws.\nBottom Line\nAbortion policy in the U.S. has changed drastically after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. With individual states now having more leeway in making abortion policy, 12 states have bans in effect, and more have restricted the availability of abortions.\nThe abortion issue was on the ballot in 2022, including in several states where legislators tried unsuccessfully to change their state constitutions to restrict abortion rights. Even in states where abortion was not on the ballot in 2022, Gallup polling and exit polls suggest that it played a significant role in the election and was at least partially responsible for Republicans\u2019 net loss of one Senate seat and failure to gain as many House seats as they had hoped.\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on Twitter.\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Methods\n\n\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-22, 2023, with a random sample of 1,011 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.\nEach sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 75% cellphone respondents and 25% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.\nIn addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics Include:\n USA Abortion All Gallup Headlines Ethics and Morals Political Parties Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Front Page newsletter for weekly insights on the world's most pressing topics.\n(*) Required\n\r\n               \r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                    \u00a0\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \n\n* Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Country or Region\n\nSelect One\nUnited States of America\nAfghanistan\nAland Islands\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerican Samoa\nAndorra\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArgentina\nArmenia\nAruba\nAustralia\nAustria\nAzerbaijan\nBahamas\nBahrain\nBangladesh\nBarbados\nBelarus\nBelgium\nBelize\nBenin\nBermuda\nBhutan\nBolivia (Plurinational State of)\nBonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana\nBouvet Island\nBrazil\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory (the)\nBrunei Darussalam\nBulgaria\nBurkina Faso\nBurundi\nCambodia\nCameroon\nCanada\nCape Verde\nCayman Islands (the)\nCentral African Republic\nChad\nChile\nChina\nChristmas Island\nCocos (Keeling) Islands (the)\nColombia\nComoros\nCongo (Kinshasa)\nCongo Brazzaville\nCook Islands (the)\nCosta Rica\nCote d'Ivoire\nCroatia\nCuba\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea\nDenmark\nDjibouti\nDominica\nDominican Republic\nEcuador\nEgypt\nEl Salvador\nEquatorial Guinea\nEritrea\nEstonia\nEthiopia\nFalkland Islands (the) [Malvinas]\nFaroe Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nFrench Guiana\nFrench Polynesia\nFrench Southern Territories (the)\nGabon\nGambia\nGeorgia\nGermany\nGhana\nGibraltar\nGreece\nGreenland\nGrenada\nGuadeloupe\nGuam\nGuatemala\nGuinea\nGuinea-Bissau\nGuyana\nHaiti\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands\nHoly See\nHonduras\nHong Kong S.A.R. of China\nHungary\nIceland\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran\nIraq\nIreland\nIsle of Man\nIsrael\nItaly\nJamaica\nJapan\nJersey\nJordan\nKazakhstan\nKenya\nKiribati\nKuwait\nKyrgyzstan\nLao People's Democratic Republic\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLesotho\nLiberia\nLibya\nLiechtenstein\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMacao S.A.R. of China\nMadagascar\nMalawi\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nMali\nMalta\nMarshall Islands\nMartinique\nMauritania\nMauritius\nMayotte\nMexico\nMoldova\nMonaco\nMongolia\nMontenegro\nMontserrat\nMorocco\nMozambique\nMyanmar\nNamibia\nNauru\nNepal\nNetherlands (Kingdom of the)\nNew Caledonia\nNew Zealand\nNicaragua\nNiger\nNigeria\nNiue\nNorfolk Island\nNorth Macedonia\nNorthern Mariana Islands\nNorway\nOman\nPakistan\nPalau\nPalestinian Territories\nPanama\nPapua New Guinea\nParaguay\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPitcairn\nPoland\nPortugal\nPuerto Rico\nQatar\nReunion\nRomania\nRussia\nRwanda\nSaint Barth\u00e9lemy\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\nSaint Lucia\nSaint Martin (French part)\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSamoa\nSan Marino\nSao Tome and Principe\nSaudi Arabia\nSenegal\nSerbia\nSeychelles\nSierra Leone\nSingapore\nSint Maarten (Dutch part)\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSolomon Islands\nSomalia\nSouth Africa\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\nSouth Korea\nSouth Sudan\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nSudan\nSuriname\nSvalbard and Jan Mayen\nSwaziland\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nSyria\nTaiwan (Province of China)\nTajikistan\nTanzania\nThailand\nTimor-Leste\nTogo\nTokelau\nTonga\nTrinidad and Tobago\nTunisia\nT\u00fcrkiye\nTurkmenistan\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nTuvalu\nUganda\nUkraine\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States Minor Outlying Islands\nUruguay\nUzbekistan\nVanuatu\nVenezuela\nVietnam\nVirgin Islands, British\nVirgin Islands, U.S.\nWallis and Futuna\nWestern Sahara\nYemen\nZambia\nZimbabwe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n                            This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\r\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\nPoliticsFeb 2, 2023\nAmericans Still Glum About State of the Union in Most Areas\nWhether reflecting the remnants of the pandemic or the difficulty of inflation, Americans remain sour about the state of the union.\n\n\n\n\nEconomyJan 30, 2023\nMore Cite Gov't as Top U.S. Problem; Inflation Ranks Second\nMentions of the government as the nation's most important problem have risen in the past month.
