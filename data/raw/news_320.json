You sent appeals via Pocket Protest, wrote your own letters, posted solidarity photos or\u00a0supported our global Twitter action. \u00a0\nDue to your overwhelming support, Beatriz was never alone in her struggle to access the medical care she wanted and needed. Beatriz and the Agrupaci\u00f3n Ciudadana, the NGO in El Salvador working tirelessly on her behalf, particularly wish to thank everyone who took action in support of Beatriz and the campaign to protect her life and health.\nAs this case shows, by raising our voices together we can prevent injustice, and give strength and protection to the most vulnerable. When a brave young woman known as 'Beatriz' spoke out because her life was being being endangered unnecessarily by authorities in El Salvador, we stood beside her. And when her call was finally heard, it was the cries of thousands around the globe that were answered too. Together we are powerful.\n\n\tIf you would like us to send you urgent actions like this in future,\u00a0text URGENT and your full name to 70505\u00a0to join our SMS network, Pocket Protest. Over 14s only please*.\u00a0See terms and conditions\n\nAlready a member of Pocket Protest?\u00a0If so, please ask your friends and family to join too (provided they are over 14 years old).\u00a0Text FRIEND to 70505\u00a0and we\u2019ll send you a text message you can forward onto contacts in your address book.\u00a0\nAll of you who took action helped make possible the one thing that Beatriz wanted all along \u2013 to return home to her family. We wish her a full recovery and hope she is well enough to go home soon.\u00a0\nYet it should never should have come to this.\nWhile we are thankful that Beatriz\u2019s life is now safe, she should not have been forced to suffer in this way for weeks on end, wondering if her young son would be left without a mother.\nOn the advice of her doctors, Beatriz asked for a termination two months ago when it became clear that continuing with the pregnancy would almost certainly have killed her. She has serious medical conditions including kidney disease and lupus.\nHowever, the authorities refused permission for her to have the life-saving treatment, even though the foetus was not expected to survive either. As predicted, when born by caesarean on Monday it was missing large parts of its head and brain and survived only a few hours.\nHad the abortion gone ahead, both Beatriz and the doctors who treated her would have faced long prison sentences. For in El Salvador - as in many other countries \u2013 there is a total ban on abortion, even when a woman or girl\u2019s life is at risk or she is a survivor of sexual abuse. Such laws effectively amount to torture, discrimination and the denial of some of the most basic human rights to life and to dignity.\nWe call on El Salvador to end its total ban on abortion\u00a0and bring its laws in line with human rights law and standards so that no woman is denied medical treatment necessary to save their life or health.\nNo more women or girls must be forced to suffer as Beatriz has.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          18 May 2020, 05:50pm\n        \n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While you\u2019re here\u2026\nLike you, we are horrified by the violence and the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We\u2019re calling for an immediate ceasefire by all parties in the occupied Gaza Strip and Israel to prevent further loss of civilian lives.
