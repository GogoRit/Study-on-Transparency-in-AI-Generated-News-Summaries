Wade. These bills go far beyond that.\u00a0\u201cH.R. 8296, the Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act nationalizes abortion for all nine months of pregnancy, making America just as radical as China and North Korea.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt legalizes discriminatory abortions based on sex, race, and disability\u2014what used to be plainly and clearly called eugenics.\u00a0\u201cIt overrides state laws that protect women from coercion, and overrides laws designed to give parents accurate information about the pre-natal diagnoses of a disability, including Down syndrome.\u00a0\u201cAll of this has nothing to do with protecting the health of women, and everything to do with forcing an extreme agenda on the American people.\u201d\u00a0LOOPHOLES FOR CHILD TRAFFICKERS\u00a0\u201cWe are also assessing all the potential consequences of Ms. Fletcher\u2019s new\u00a0bill. This bill, as currently written, clearly has had no committee process or work just like the Abortion on Demand bill.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI have many questions and concerns, the biggest around human trafficking, minors, and also parental consent.\u00a0\u201cFirst, it stops health care professionals, social workers, and schools in every state from reporting instances of child abuse and neglect because that could be seen as delaying or hindering access to abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis hurts law enforcement\u2019s ability to keep children safe and hold sexual abusers and human traffickers accountable. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt also undermines parental consent. Parents can be targeted by the federal government and sued for wanting to help their child and asking them to delay out-of-state travel to get an abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFinally, this bill stops states from preventing abortion pill mills and gives traffickers and abusers more direct access to chemical abortions in all 50 states.\u201d\u00a0NO LIMITS ON ABORTION FOR ALL NINE MONTHS\u00a0\u201cOverall, this is America\u2019s future under the Democrats\u2019 extreme agenda. \u00a0\u201cNo limits on abortion for all nine months of pregnancy.\u00a0\u201cAbortions for any reason including based on race, sex, and disability.\u00a0\u201cThe elimination of people with Down syndrome.\u00a0\u201cLoopholes for human traffickers to cross state lines and cover up their crimes by forcing victims to get an abortion.\u00a0\u201cThe destruction of pro-life pregnancy centers providing health care and helping women and their babies.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe denial of science and amazing medical achievements that allow us to treat both mothers and their babies in the womb as patients.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd, doctors and healthcare providers forced to violate their sincerely held beliefs and perform abortions to end a life.\u00a0\u201cThere is nothing about this agenda that celebrates human rights or the dignity of every person. This is not how I define a free and just society for my daughters and my son.\u201d\u00a0THE LEFT\u2019S FEARMONGERING\u00a0\u201cBoth of these bills are designed to present abortion at any stage of pregnancy as a woman\u2019s only option.\u00a0\u201cHowever, 76 percent of women seeking an abortion say they would choose life if their circumstances were different.\u00a0\u201cInstead of promoting ways to lift more women up with better health care, education, and financial stability and change their circumstances,\u00a0Democrats, including President Biden, are spreading fear, anxiety, and misinformation.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a disservice to women everywhere, and also creating uncertainty for their health care providers.\u00a0\u201cThese are the facts. Regarding miscarriages, the medical care for these tragedies is not the same as an induced abortion.\u00a0\u201cFor any woman who has experienced the loss of a baby, we grieve with them. I\u2019ve experienced their pain too.\u00a0Pro-life laws do not prevent women from getting care they need in cases of miscarriage.\u201cIn addition, it\u2019s a fear tactic to say that women will have to choose between jail or death if they have an ectopic pregnancy. No law in any state prevents lifesaving treatment for women with ectopic pregnancies and other life-threatening conditions.\u00a0Planned Parenthood itself says treating an ectopic pregnancy isn\u2019t the same as getting an abortion. In a similar way, state laws currently in effect have exemptions to save the life of the mother.\u00a0\u201cRegarding IVF, even the Washington Post has confirmed that state legislators are including explicit exemptions for fertility treatments.\u00a0\u201cAnd finally, the pro-life movement does not support and has always rejected criminalizing and punishing women, period.\u00a0PROTECTING PREGNANCY CENTERS HELPING WOMEN\u00a0\u00a0\u201cRather than prey on their vulnerabilities and fears to promote abortion for all nine months, we should be coming together to make sure women have the love and support they need at every stage of pregnancy and beyond.\u00a0\u201cThere are more than 2,700 pregnancy centers in all 50 states. They outnumber Planned Parenthood by more than 2,000 facilities.\u00a0\u201cThese pregnancy centers\u2014which are right now under violent attacks by pro-abortion groups\u2014provide medical care, resources, education, and mentoring to women. Their work should be protected, not undermined and threatened.\u00a0DEFINING THE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR GENERATION\u00a0\u201cThe Supreme Court has affirmed American people\u2019s right to speak through their elected officials to enact laws that protect unborn children.\u00a0\u201cThe question is upon us. How do we want to define the human rights issue of our generation?\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs it by dehumanizing life and promoting a culture that destroys the most vulnerable among us?\u00a0\u201cOr is it by making abortion unthinkable by leading a new era where every person\u2019s God-given unalienable human rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all?\u00a0\u201cOur greatest challenges at every stage of life can\u2019t be solved if we don\u2019t get this right.\u201d\u00a0LIVES WORTH LIVING\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI think about the youth suicide crisis in America today. We all know parents, teachers, doctors, and therapists who are hearing from children and young adults in despair. They are searching for purpose and meaning in their lives.\u00a0\u201cSurely, we all agree that to rescue them from despair, we tell them the truth that their lives are worth living.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t double down on the lie that the value of their life can be in dispute. We surround them with community, love, support, and compassion. We help them find hope again.\u00a0\u201cWe help them revive meaning in their lives by celebrating what makes them unique, and reminding them that no one is meant to go through the harsh, heartbreaking, and challenging trials of life alone and afraid.\u00a0\u201cThe same goes for the teenager in danger of dying from a fentanyl poisoning, for the woman in a crisis pregnancy. For the person with a disability who has been told their life wouldn\u2019t amount to much, and for every person who has been marginalized and treated unjustly because of their race, sex, and ancestry.\u00a0\u201cEvery person\u2019s life is worth living. They can\u2019t just be thrown away or discarded.\u00a0\u201cEvery person\u2014born and unborn\u2014has human rights.\u00a0For America to be a more perfect union, our laws must reflect that.\u00a0\u201cHow do we help the most marginalized in society if the human rights of the weakest and most vulnerable aren\u2019t recognized or protected?\u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THE UNBORN\u00a0\u201cThis abortion agenda for all nine months of pregnancy will entrench a culture of fear, pain, and dehumanization.\u00a0\u201cIt cannot be our future. It\u2019s not the will of the American people.\u00a0\u201cI recognize all but one of my colleagues across the aisle in the People\u2019s House are already on the record for the Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act. My appeal today is for my colleagues to abandon this radical agenda for no restrictions on abortion.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s come together for human rights of the unborn. Let\u2019s come together around the reality that from the very beginning, every life has meaning and a purpose just like we have on behalf of people who are in search of security and a better life.\u00a0\u201cEvery life is worth living.\u201d\u00a0Share onEnergy & Commerce CommitteeOffice2125 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20515Main: (202) 225-3641Press: (202) 226-4972 Minority WebsitePrivacyAccessibility"
