Nearly all of them are in Texas, but Lubbock is the largest and the first that is home to an abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood, which opened a clinic to offer birth control and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections last fall. The clinic began providing abortions this month.\n\u201cThey\u2019re murdering babies here in our city,\u201d said Jim Baxa, with West Texas for Life, an anti-abortion organization. \u201cWe need to stop that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights advocates say the proposed ordinance amounts to an extreme ban that is out of step with the views held by a majority of polled Texans, who support some allowances for abortions, like in cases of rape or incest.\nBut the vote has also pit Lubbock\u2019s hardline conservative base and large churches against the City Council and a former GOP precinct chair, who say battles over abortion access are best fought at the state and federal levels. City Council members, several of whom have said they oppose abortion, say the proposed ordinance could be challenged in court, teeing up a costly legal fight.\n\u201cTaxpayers are being used as pawns essentially to have this legal battle at their expense,\u201d said Aurora Farthing, the former GOP precinct chair who started a political action committee urging residents to vote against the proposed ordinance.\nThe May election is unusual: Lubbock\u2019s citywide officials are typically voted on in even-numbered years, and the proposed abortion-related ordinance is the first citizen-led ballot item since a 2013 recall election, the city secretary\u2019s office said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the May election will cost, though recent elections have had tabs between $159,000 and $240,000.\nThe push to make Lubbock a \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d began in the last two years. Anti-abortion activists \u2014 led by state Sen. Charles Perry, from Lubbock, and others \u2014 rallied enough signatures to bring the measure to the City Council, which unanimously rejected the proposed ordinance, citing legal advice that it would conflict with state law. But the proposed ordinance will still be put to a public vote Saturday, under the city charter\u2019s rules.\nIn a letter demanding that the proposed ordinance be placed on the ballot, the activists said it was \u201cbecause we fear God, view the intentional shedding of the blood of unborn children to be an inconceivably wicked action, and we believe that we all have a responsibility to protect the lives of the smallest and most vulnerable humans among us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          A sign opposing a proposed city ordinance that would ban abortions inside Lubbock city limits outside of an early voting location on April 27.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nPerry said he was tied up with the Legislature but would have a comment after the election Saturday.\nThe proposed measure outlaws abortions within the city\u2019s limits, and allows family members of a person who has an abortion to sue the provider and those who assist someone getting an abortion, like by driving them to a clinic. It would not be enforced by the government unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision or made other changes to abortion laws.\nThere isn\u2019t an exception for people pregnant as a result of rape or incest.\nThe strategy of waging abortion fights at the local level has divided staunch anti-abortion activists, and several other Texas towns, including Mineral Wells and Omaha, have voted down similar ordinances or walked them back under advice from city attorneys.\nThe vote comes as the Texas Legislature and other Republican-led statehouses across the country are pushing to curtail abortion access and challenge Roe v. Wade before a newly conservative-leaning Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard D. Rosen, a constitutional law professor at Texas Tech University, said the proposed ordinance tries to make a \u201cclever end run around Roe.\u201d\nBecause local officials wouldn\u2019t enforce the prohibition if it\u2019s passed, ordinance proponents say there\u2019d be no one for abortion providers to sue to stop the ban from taking effect. Instead, Rosen expects a private citizen would sue Planned Parenthood and the legal fight would go from there.\nRosen expects the ordinance would be \u201cDOA\u201d \u2014 dead on arrival \u2014 in the courts, but it might cost a lot of money for abortion rights proponents to defend.\n\u201cAs long as Roe is good law, I think these suits will ultimately fail, but it [could make] abortion providers ... expend money for attorneys\u2019 fees, and it takes time,\u201d Rosen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProponents of the ordinance are confident they\u2019ll prevail in court and are deeply skeptical of a 17-page legal analysis posted on the city website and cited by the City Council that says the proposed ordinance is void under state law. They also have an attorney who has offered to work free of charge, but there could be other costs, like for the opposite side\u2019s attorneys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Trinity Church hangs a banner supporting a proposed measure which would outlaw abortions within the city\u2019s limits.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nGroundswell of activism\u00a0\nThe election \u2014 typically a low-turnout affair dominated by municipal issues \u2014 has sparked a groundswell of activism in Lubbock. The early voting turnout has already surpassed May elections going back to 2009, when voters of the formerly \u201cdry\u201d city allowed beer and liquor to be sold in Lubbock\u2019s stores.\nIn early April, several pastors and their wives gathered at the invitation of a group supporting the anti-abortion ordinance at a venue called Spirit Ranch. David Wilson, pastor at Southcrest Baptist Church, where Perry is a deacon, said the building was \u201ccompletely full,\u201d and that he\u2019d rarely seen that kind of unity and involvement across denominations.\n\u201cIf this was a tax issue, the churches wouldn\u2019t be involved in this, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut moral issue has to do with life, and we believe that life is a gift from God.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson said his church has set up tables to help parishioners register to vote and hung a banner declaring its support of the movement. The church has given out flyers and urged people to put pro-ordinance signs in their yards. After Easter, he told attendees of the church \u2014 which drew 3,000 to Sunday services before the pandemic, and draws around 2,300 now \u2014 about the coming election.\n\u201cWe try to make it very clear, we\u2019re not condemning anybody who\u2019s had an abortion,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, an anti-ordinance coalition that includes Planned Parenthood has organized block-walkers to knock on doors and call prospective voters \u2014 some of whom seem to not know much about what the proposed ordinance would do, said one 46-year-old campaign volunteer named Kim Gonzalez.\n\u201cOnce we start talking about the details, they don\u2019t like to hear that women who are victims of rape and incest aren\u2019t excluded from this,\u201d she said. \u201cA whole bunch of people are just like, you know, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m really glad that you called me and told me, I\u2019m going to get out to vote.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGonzalez, who said she worked in health care for 20 years, said it had long been apparent to her that \u201cwomen didn\u2019t have proper reproductive health care here in West Texas,\u201d where the nearest abortion clinics were 300 miles away in Fort Worth or New Mexico.\nSarah Wheat, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, said in a statement that the organization provides \u201crespectful, compassionate services\u201d for those seeking abortions and other health services, regardless of the patient\u2019s income level or insurance status.\n\u201cPolitical efforts underway in Lubbock and the Texas Legislature would create new barriers to abortion that disproportionately impact low-income patients and communities of color,\u201d Wheat said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Kiran Thompson holds a sign supporting Proposition A across from the Lubbock Planned Parenthood location on April 27.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nThe movement spreads\u00a0\nThe \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d movement has rippled through towns, often spurred by fears that abortion access will expand or frustration from conservatives that state lawmakers aren\u2019t doing enough to curtail the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Lee Dickson, the East Texas pastor behind the movement, said he approached the mayor of Waskom in 2019, out of concern that a Louisiana abortion provider might relocate across the border to the town.\nWaskom became the first in the nation to pass an ordinance outlawing abortions, he said. Since then, towns as far away as Nebraska have made similar moves.\n\u201cWe see abortion as the ending of human life. We see it as murdering little children,\u201d Dickson said in a phone interview from Florida, where there\u2019s a similar push for a \u201csanctuary city\u201d in Naples. \u201cThese are very conservative communities that are very God-fearing people, and they did not want to see something like that \u2026 just like some people wouldn\u2019t want to see a strip club in their community.\u201d\nDickson\u2019s activism was spreading in West Texas around the time Planned Parenthood was preparing to open a clinic in Lubbock, said Terisa Clark, a volunteer with a pro-ordinance group called Project Destiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the proposed ordinance reflects the beliefs of her conservative city and portrayed some of those fighting it as out-of-town outsiders, citing the source of donations received by organizations on different sides of the campaign.\nThat\u2019s partly why she likes the idea of putting the abortion ban to local voters.\n\u201cWe recognize that [the state Legislature has] a hard time getting things passed because there are a bunch of representatives that represent [a] diverse group of people,\u201d she said.\nState lawmakers earned the ire of hardline conservatives last session by focusing on bread-and-butter issues like property taxes and school finance. This year, they\u2019ve backed a slate of abortion restrictions that abortion rights advocates call the most \u201cextreme\u201d nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Baxa, with West Texas for Life, said lawmakers are still being too timid and have ignored a bill that that would criminalize abortion \u2014 and potentially open up doctors and women who get abortions to charges that carry the death penalty.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Texas \u2014 which sued Waskom and six other East Texas towns that declared themselves sanctuaries \u2014 is watching the vote closely. (The lawsuit was dropped; those cities aren\u2019t home to abortion providers and had differently worded ordinances.)\nDrucilla Tigner, a policy and advocacy strategist with the group, said the proposed ordinance is structured to \u201cundo our natural checks and balances\u201d in an attempt to let \u201cunconstitutional laws ... go into effect.\u201d It\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s been replicated in abortion restrictions now before the state Legislature.\n\u201cWhether or not they\u2019ll be successful is certainly still an open question,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do absolutely think that this is the new strategy from the \u2026 anti-abortion movement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas and Texas Tech University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
