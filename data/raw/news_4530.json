Sue SerinoShow Caption of ExpandBy Paul Kirby | pkirby@freemanonline.com | Daily Freeman and Paul KirbyPUBLISHED: September 21, 2020 at 11:25 a.m. | UPDATED: July 21, 2021 at 5:11 a.m.Abortion has become a hot-button issue in the race for New York\u2019s 41st Senate District seat.\nChallenger Karen Smythe, a Red Hook Democrat, says incumbent Sue Serino, R-Hyde Park, was wrong to vote against New York\u2019s Reproductive Health Act (S240), which was approved by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo last year. Serino\u2019s campaign defended the senator\u2019s vote.\n\u201cSerino\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 vote shows that, for all her small-government GOP posturing, she wants to curtail women\u2019s rights and their ability to control their own bodies,\u201d Smythe said in a prepared statement.\nThe Democrat said the act \u201cwould not have passed, or even gotten to the floor for a vote, if Senate Democrats hadn\u2019t won the majority in 2018.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to sustain and build this majority to make sure New Yorkers\u2019 reproductive freedoms are protected no matter what happens at the federal level,\u201d Smythe said. \nThe Serino campaign, also in a prepared statement, said the senator \u201cdid the right thing in voting against this dangerous legislation and focusing instead on advocating for policies that actually help women: fighting to make our community more affordable for families, securing unprecedented funding for our schools, standing against policies that erode public safety, and advocating for legislation to expand professional opportunities for women across the state.\u201d \n\n\nSmythe said the death on Friday of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg means the court \u201ccould overturn Roe v. Wade (the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide) in the very near future. That is why I am calling out Senator Sue Serino for her \u2018no\u2019 vote on New York\u2019s Reproductive Health Act.\u201d\n\u201cSue Serino has proved, time and again, that she is not a woman who supports women,\u201d Smythe said. \n\n\nThe Republican\u2019s campaign responded that, as the first woman to represent the 41st Senate District, \u201cno one has fought harder for women in this community than Senator Serino.\u201d\nNew York\u2019s 41st Senate District encompasses all of Dutchess County (except the towns of Pawling and Beekman) and the Putnam County towns of Kent, Philipstown and Putnam Valley.\nSerino is seeking a fourth two-year term representing the district. The race between her and Smythe is a rematch of the 2018 election, which Serino won by a slim margin.\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window) \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularMan, 74, pleads guilty to sexually abusing child under age of 11 in Ulster CountyMan, 74, pleads guilty to sexually abusing child under age of 11 in Ulster CountyUlster County Jail had millions in overtime in 2023, database showsUlster County Jail had millions in overtime in 2023, database showsNoVo Foundation gave out at least $34.5 million to Kingston, Mid-Hudson organizations in 2022, tax records showNoVo Foundation gave out at least $34.5 million to Kingston, Mid-Hudson organizations in 2022, tax records showMid-Hudson Valley arrests report: March 18, 2024Mid-Hudson Valley arrests report: March 18, 2024Mid-Hudson Valley arrests report: March 17, 2024Mid-Hudson Valley arrests report: March 17, 2024Hochul announces over $20M in tax credits for three Mid-Hudson housing projectsHochul announces over $20M in tax credits for three Mid-Hudson housing projectsRobert Joseph Clark, of Kingston, celebrates 100th birthdayRobert Joseph Clark, of Kingston, celebrates 100th birthdayOrpheum Theatre in Saugerties unveils renovated screening room with high-tech sound systemOrpheum Theatre in Saugerties unveils renovated screening room with high-tech sound systemKingston Planning Board OKs seven apartments and retail space in long-vacant Broadway buildingKingston Planning Board OKs seven apartments and retail space in long-vacant Broadway buildingLetter: Setting themselves up for failureLetter: Setting themselves up for failure \n\n\n\nTrending Nationally\nCalifornia\u2019s largest new reservoir project in 50 years gains momentumUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesMarch Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentSocial media influencer arrested in Irvine on suspicion of joining the attack on the US CapitolInvestigators hunted one of Florida\u2019s most prolific serial rapists for decades.
