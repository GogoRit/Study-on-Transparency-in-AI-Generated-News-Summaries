But one social media post makes the false claim that the popular pastries represent controversy.A Feb. 4\u00a0post\u00a0on Facebook says Girl Scouts support \"Planned Parenthood and pro-abortion politicians.\" It shows the Planned Parenthood logo superimposed on a\u00a0Trefoil\u00a0cookie, which normally has the Girl Scouts\u2019 logo.\"Our family will not be buying Girl Scout cookies this year,\" the post reads. \"Until the Girl Scouts stop supporting Planned Parenthood and pro-abortion politicians, this pro-life family won\u2019t be buying their cookies.\" It ends with the hashtag #cookiecott, and has the name \"Pro-Life Action League\" at the bottom.Fact-check:Was Texas veteran denied mail-in ballot because of 1950s registration number?The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.The claims are unfounded. Girl Scouts of the USA does not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood, according to its\u00a0website. The national organization also has\u00a0not endorsed\u00a0any person or organization, according to the website for Girl Scouts of Southwest Texas.Most of the misinformation about the organization originated in Texas, some of it nearly two decades ago.One part of the claim dates to 2004 and is centered on one Girl Scout council \u2014 the\u00a0organization's term\u00a0for groups that develop and manage scouting in a geographic region \u2014 in Texas. The Waco-area council had put its name and logo on Planned Parenthood brochures that advertised sex-education programs, and also had given a \"woman of distinction\" award to a Planned Parenthood executive.Fact-check:Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say she doesn't need truckers?The council did not contribute money or send children to the sex-ed program, which never mentioned abortion, the Associated Press\u00a0reported\u00a0at the time.A Waco anti-abortion group ran advertisements alleging a \"cozy relationship\" between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood and urging a Girl Scout cookie boycott, according to the AP. After the ad campaign began, the Girl Scout council said it would no longer be affiliated with the sex-ed program.During a \"Today\" show segment about the issue,\u00a0comments\u00a0from Kathy Cloninger, who was chief executive of the national Girl Scouts at the time, seemed to muddy the waters. She said the Girl Scouts \"tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the things that girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls.\"The Girls Scouts\u2019 official stance,\u00a0then\u00a0and\u00a0now, is that the organization does not take a position on or develop materials about human sexuality, birth control and abortion.Fact-check:Are some books being banned from Texas schools, while 'Mein Kampf' is allowed?The issue roared back to life a decade later in 2014, when the national Girl Scouts organization\u00a0shared stories\u00a0on its social media accounts from the Huffington Post and the Washington Post about women who made a difference in 2013. One of the stories featured Wendy Davis, who\u00a0delayed\u00a0an abortion bill through filibuster,\u00a0 and the other included then-Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius, who supports abortion rights.The Girl Scouts of Southwest Texas\u00a0website says\u00a0the sharing of the article \"was not to endorse any of the women featured, but to highlight the source's acknowledgement of women who made a mark in 2013.\"That\u2019s also when Pro-Life Action League, a Chicago-based group whose name is on the image in this Facebook post,\u00a0got involved\u00a0in the cookie boycott.Our rulingA Facebook post says Girl Scouts support \"Planned Parenthood and pro-abortion politicians.\"Girl Scouts of the USA has no relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood, and has not endorsed any person or organization.Nearly two decades ago, a single Girl Scout council in Texas put its name and logo on a Planned Parenthood brochure for a sex-ed program that did not have anything to do with clinical services such as abortion. The council later terminated its affiliation with the sex-ed program.Then, in 2014, the national Girl Scouts organization shared news stories on its social media accounts about women who made a difference in 2013. Those stories \u2014 written by news organizations, not by the Girl Scouts \u2014 included some politicians who support abortion rights. The Girl Scouts said sharing the stories did not represent an endorsement of any person.We rate this claim False.SourcesAssociated Press, \"Girl Scout cookies, and troops, crumble in Texas,\" March 4, 2004Daily Beast, \"The Mothers Behind The Girl Scout Cookie Boycott,\" Feb. 7, 2014Facebook\u00a0post, Feb. 4, 2022Girl Scouts, \"Meet the Cookies,\" accessed Feb. 10, 2022Girl Scouts, \"Social Issues FAQ,\" accessed Feb. 10, 2022Girl Scouts of Southwest Texas, \"What we stand for,\" accessed Feb. 10, 2022Pro-Life Action League, \"LEAGUE JOINS NATIONAL BOYCOTT OF GIRL SCOUT COOKIES,\" Jan. 30, 2014The Texas Tribune, \"Waco Anti-Abortion Group Calls for Boycott of Girl Scout Cookies,\" Jan. 31, 2014USA Girl Scouts Overseas, \"Girl Scout Lingo - What Does it Mean?\" May 29, 2021YouTube, Pro-Life Waco. \"Video Today Show,\" March 4, 2004Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Austin American-Statesman Store Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.statesman.com.
