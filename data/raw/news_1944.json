He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n      \n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, a judge in the deep-red state of Wyoming temporarily blocked a state law that would make performing nearly any abortion in that state a felony. She relied on a 2012 amendment to the state constitution that was intended to spite then-President Barack Obama.\nObama\u2019s early years in office were marred by a scorched-earth political campaign Republicans wielded to try to thwart what became the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare\u2019s opponents warned of a \u201cgovernment takeover of health care\u201d that would strip many Americans of their ability to make their own health decisions. \nMany of these allegations were downright ludicrous, such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s (R) false claim that Obama\u2019s health bill would require \u201cmy baby with Down Syndrome ... to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u2018death panel\u2019 so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u2018level of productivity in society\u2019 whether they are worthy of health care.\u201d \nThese attacks did not succeed. The bill became law, and Obamacare is popular now that it has been in full effect for nearly a decade without anyone being forced to stand before a death panel. But there is at least one lasting legacy of these attempts to characterize the Affordable Care Act as an attack on patients\u2019 right to decide whether and when to seek health treatments.\nIn many states, opponents of Obamacare effectively took the GOP\u2019s talking points and turned them into state constitutional amendments protecting patients\u2019 ability to obtain health care that the government might not want them to have. Wyoming\u2019s amendment, for example, provides that \u201ceach competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.\u201d\nAccording to Quinn Yeargain, a law professor at Widener University, similar amendments are on the books in several other states.\nIt remains to be seen whether the highest courts in these states, some of which are extremely conservative, will ultimately agree that these anti-Obamacare amendments prohibit abortion bans. And, in at least some cases, the amendments contain language that could mitigate their impact. Wyoming\u2019s amendment, for example, also provides that, under certain circumstances, the state legislature may \u201cdetermine reasonable and necessary restrictions on the rights granted\u201d by the health care amendment.\nBut abortion advocates have had two early successes: the Wyoming judge\u2019s order temporarily blocking that state\u2019s abortion ban, and a similar decision by a trial judge in Ohio.\nThe Wyoming abortion rights litigation, briefly explained\nWyoming district court Judge Melissa Owens\u2019s Wednesday decision temporarily halting her state\u2019s abortion ban is the second time she intervened to prevent this ban from going into effect. Wyoming\u2019s abortion ban is quite strict, although it does provide exceptions for rape, incest, or when either a pregnant patient or the fetus has certain medical conditions.\nLast summer, shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overruling Roe v. Wade, an array of patients, doctors, and nonprofit groups brought a suit arguing that Wyoming\u2019s abortion ban violated the state\u2019s constitutional provision protecting each adult\u2019s right to individual health care decisions. That case is known as Johnson v. Wyoming. \nJudge Owens handed down a decision in August halting the law. Among other things, she rejected the state\u2019s argument that the health care amendment was \u201conly adopted to push back against the Affordable Care Act,\u201d and should not be construed to protect abortion rights.\nRegardless of the political circumstances that led to this amendment being written into the state constitution, Owens reasoned that the amendment \u201cunambiguously provides competent Wyoming citizens with the right to make their own health care decisions,\u201d and she was bound by that unambiguous text. \u201cA court,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis not at liberty to assume that the Wyoming voters who adopted\u201d the amendment \u201cdid not understand the force of language in the provision.\u201d\nJust as significantly, Owens construed the amendment to give people in Wyoming a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to make their own health care decisions, including the decision to seek an abortion. This designation matters because fundamental rights can only be abridged when the state seeks to advance a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d and when it uses the \u201cleast intrusive\u201d means to do so.\nThus, even though the amendment permits the state legislature to impose \u201creasonable and necessary restrictions\u201d on individual\u2019s health choices, Owens concluded that Wyoming\u2019s broad ban on abortion access sweeps too far because it intrudes into pregnant patients\u2019 health care decisions even when a \u201cfetus has a genetic abnormality that is incompatible with life.\u201d (The state has since amended its law to permit abortions when \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood that the unborn baby has a lethal fetal anomaly,\u201d a change that could undermine Owens\u2019s legal reasoning.)\nThere is precedent for Owens\u2019s conclusion that this Wyoming health care amendment establishes a fundamental right that the legislature may only abridge under very limited circumstances, even though that same amendment gives the legislature some authority to enact laws. The US Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment has long been construed to protect many fundamental rights, such as the right to marry or the right to choose your own sexual partners. But the 14th Amendment also contains language permitting Congress to enforce its provisions \u201cby appropriate legislation.\u201d\nNevertheless, the fact that the 14th Amendment permits Congress to enact laws it deems \u201cappropriate\u201d typically does not permit Congress to abridge the fundamental rights it guarantees.\nIn response to Owens\u2019s August decision blocking the state\u2019s abortion ban, the state legislature enacted a new law decreeing that abortion \u201cis not health care\u201d and thus is not protected by the state constitution. Owens\u2019s Wednesday order blocked that law as well, declaring that \u201cthe legislature cannot make an end run around\u201d around a constitutional amendment, and that it is up to the courts to decide whether abortion meets the state constitution\u2019s definition of \u201chealth care.\u201d\nYet, while the state legislature appears eager to restore the state\u2019s abortion ban, the Wyoming Supreme Court has thus far resisted the urge to rush in and overrule Owens. Last December, after a case reached the state Supreme Court that it could have used to reject Judge Owens\u2019s reading of the state constitution, Wyoming\u2019s justices chose instead not to decide that case. That left Owens\u2019s August order in effect.\nSo, while there are plausible legal arguments on either side of this dispute, there appears to be a real chance that the state\u2019s highest court will agree with Owens if and when they weigh in on whether the state constitution protects abortion. If the state Supreme Court shared the legislature\u2019s view that abortion must be banned in Wyoming, it could have intervened last winter.\nCould anti-Obamacare amendments protect abortion rights in other states?\nAt least one other state court, in Ohio, relied on that state\u2019s anti-Obamacare amendment in an opinion temporarily blocking a law that bans nearly all abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy. That 2022 decision, in a case known as Preterm-Cleveland v. Yost, argued that a few provisions of the state constitution, including the state\u2019s health care amendment, work together to protect abortion rights.\nLast December, a state appeals court decided that the trial court\u2019s order in Preterm-Cleveland may remain in effect, at least for now.\nOhio\u2019s amendment provides that no state law \u201cshall prohibit the purchase or sale of health care or health insurance.\u201d Nor may it \u201cimpose a penalty or fine for the sale or purchase of health care or health insurance.\u201d Thus, as long as a patient seeking an abortion pays for that treatment, the Ohio amendment appears to provide very robust protection to abortion rights.\nLike the Wyoming amendment, Ohio\u2019s permits the legislature to enact some restrictions on the right to purchase health care but the Ohio amendment uses less expansive language to describe when such restrictions are allowed \u2014 though one provision of the Ohio amendment does permit state laws that are \u201ccalculated to deter fraud or punish wrongdoing in the health care industry.\u201d An abortion opponent would no doubt argue that abortions are themselves a form of \u201cwrongdoing.\u201d \nIn any event, the Ohio Supreme Court has a 4-3 Republican majority. So there\u2019s no guarantee that the state\u2019s justices will agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling and allow abortion to remain legal in Ohio. \n(Until recently, the swing vote on the Ohio Supreme Court was held by Chief Justice Maureen O\u2019Connor, a relatively moderate Republican. But O\u2019Connor recently retired and the Court\u2019s new majority hasn\u2019t developed much of a record. So it is difficult for a lawyer to assess with certainty how it is likely to rule on a case like Preterm-Cleveland.)\nBut what about other states that enacted health care amendments as a statement of defiance against Obamacare? The short answer is that a lawsuit seeking to protect abortion rights in these states would turn on the same questions that are in play in Wyoming and Ohio: What does the state\u2019s health care amendment actually say? And who controls the state Supreme Court?\nAlabama\u2019s amendment, for example, is unlikely to help abortion advocates very much, even setting aside the fact that Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court is dominated by Republicans. That\u2019s because Alabama\u2019s amendment primarily prohibits the state from requiring \u201cany person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system.\u201d That language cannot reasonably be construed to protect abortion rights.\nOther states, including Arizona, Missouri, and Oklahoma, enacted similar amendments preventing the state government from compelling individuals to \u201cparticipate in any health care system.\u201d These amendments are also unlikely to help proponents of abortion rights.\nSo this largely forgotten legacy of a failed Republican effort to spite Obamacare is only likely to matter in a very small number of states. And it may not even have a lasting impact in Wyoming and Ohio, depending on how their state Supreme Courts rule on whether the state constitution protects abortion.\nFor the moment, however, the Obama-era amendments writing anti-Obamacare talking points into two state constitutions have proved to be a thorn in the side of Republicans who hope to ban abortions. Let that be a lesson that a state constitution is a foolish thing to change for the sake of a political stunt.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
