Wade might be turning 49, but we won\u2019t see it turn 50 as it is,\u201d said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins. \u201cStudents for Life of America was founded as a Post-Roe organization, ready to protect life in law and in service in all 50 states. We\u2019ve got a post-Roe plan, and we\u2019re training the next generation of Pro-Life leaders to ensure that the children who will be born will have all our support.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWashington D.C. (01-03-2021)\u2014Following what may be the last pro-life march mourning\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0as it has been, national leaders in the Pro-Life movement\u00a0will hold a strategy and training conference \u2013 the\u00a0National Pro-Life\u00a0Summit\u00a0titled\u00a0All In For Life \u2014 to prepare for a post-Roe\u00a0America. The\u00a0world\u2019s largest pro-life\u00a0conference\u00a0will be held on the actual 49th\u00a0anniversary of the\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision: Saturday, January 22nd, 2022, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST at the Omni Shoreham Hotel at 2500 Calvert Street Northwest, Washington,\u00a0D.C.\u00a020008. SFLA is expecting to train approximately 2,000 students from across the country, preparing them to be active, single-issue voters. SFLA/SFLAction is joined by partners Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the Heritage Foundation, and Support After Abortion, in welcoming an all-star lineup of pro-life experts and activists.\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who founded\u00a0Advancing American Freedom, will be the keynote, featured along with SFLA\u2019s Kristan Hawkins, Michael Knowles of the Daily Wire, Dr. Alveda King, OANN\u2019s Liz Wheeler,\u00a0Heritage Foundation\u2019s new president Dr. Kevin Roberts,\u00a0Cissie Graham Lynch of the Billy Graham Association and Samaritan\u2019s Purse, ADF\u2019s Tyson Langhofer, Dr. Brent Boles and many others.\u00a0The Speaker\u2019s list can be accessed here.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAs Hawkins noted in her recent op-ed at Fox News,\u00a0America needs to get ready for a world after\u00a0Roe.\u00a0She observed, \u201cIt will take time to confront the abortion mindset that turned babies into disposable commodities,\u00a0telling a nation to eliminate those who might suffer rather than addressing the suffering. In a Post-Roe\u00a0America, we must renew our commitment to helping those in crisis around us. But many like me are already hard at work, knowing that one day,\u00a0Roe\u00a0will be no more.\u201d\nSFLA has trained more than 130,000 students nationwide, preparing single-issue voters to get to work. Click\u00a0HERE\u00a0to watch a recap video of the 2020\u00a0Summit.\n\u201cOur line-up of breakout\u00a0training\u00a0sessions and\u00a0national\u00a0speakers promises to be like no other\u00a0Summit\u00a0before,\u201d said Hawkins. \u201cWe have handpicked influential changemakers in the pro-life movement with the goal of turning our students into influential changemakers. Our student activists grow up to become lawmakers, influential news commentators, organizational leaders, faith leaders \u2014and right now, they will be the best grassroots activists possible.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nNEW THIS YEAR:\u00a0During the Summit, students will participate in a straw poll examining key issues for the Pro-Life Generation.\u00a0SFLAction engaged in extensive Get-Out-The-Vote (GOTV) activity in the last Presidential cycle, motivating new voters, and as\u00a0Pew reported, a record number of voters engaged in the last cycle, up about 7 percent from 2016.\nAs\u00a0Time reported\u00a0on the 2020 cycle, \u201cYoung voters also had record turnout: roughly 50%, according to the\u00a0Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University, a jump of 11 percentage points from 2016 and\u00a0likely the highest youth voter turnout since the voting age was lowered to 18. According to\u00a0Harvard\u2019s annual Institute of Politics poll,\u00a036% of young people now consider themselves politically active, up from just 24% in the year after Barack Obama was elected in what was supposed to be a watershed moment for young Americans.\u201d\nThat\u2019s significant as Millennials and Gen Z \u2013 the Pro-Life Generation \u2013 are now\u00a031 % of the electorate.\nStraw Poll results will be available to media for a first look at the issues motivating activated, young voters before the conclusion of the event.\nClick\u00a0HERE\u00a0to register for the Summit\u00a0as a student or adult.\u00a0\nMedia must be credentialed and\u00a0registered\u00a0to attend the event.

Under the leadership of SFLA/SFLAction\u202fPresident Kristan Hawkins, who was recruited to build\u202fthe organization, SFLA has grown over the last 15 years into a $15 million organization preparing for a\u00a0Post-Roe America.\n\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,344\n\nShare this postKristi HamrickVice President of Media & Policy\nKristi Stone Hamrick, a well-known media consultant, strategist, writer, and commentator, is chief media strategist and spokesperson for Students for Life of America & Students for Life Action.BlogBlogrollUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
