F***ing gone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron lasered in on a bill that's apparently about to be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom that would put a doctor's license in jeopardy if he/she promotes COVID \"misinformation.\" He asked, \"What standard of information.\" \u00a0FYI ... this is exactly the worry doctors have over vague restrictions on abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMZ/Getty\n\n\n\n            Aaron Rodgers Explains Vaccination Controversy on Joe Rogan's Podcast\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of ... Aaron says, \"I don't believe the government should have any control over what we do with our bodies.\" He went on to say, \"As much as I might lean pro-life, I don't want the government to tell me I can't smoke a cigar, I can't have a drink of alcohol, I can't choose my own medical decisions. And if I'm a woman, don't f**king tell me what do.\"\n\n\nAnd then the key point ... \"Like whether or not I agree with what you decide to do, who cares, and the government should not have a decision that infringes upon my own personal freedoms.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRogers agrees with Bill ... Donald Trump is like a sore loser on the football field. Bill says, \"You take it like a man. You don't go, 'We won that game.' That's what Donald Trump does. We won that game. You didn't. You lose it. It happens. You lose sometimes. Be a f**king man and just own up like every other president has ever done.\"\n\n\nAaron gets a lot of criticism, but you gotta say ... he's a pretty consistent libertarian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe podcast drops Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              related articles\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Aaron Rodgers Has Nicolas Cage Bust In Locker, Shows It Off To Reporters\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Aaron Rodgers Balks At COVID Death Joke, 'I Don't Find That Part Funny'\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Aaron Rodgers\n              \n\n                Bill Maher\n              \n\n                Donald Trump\n              \n\n                Green Bay Packers\n              \n\n                TMZ Sports\n              \n\n                Politix\n              \n\n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n\n                Football\n              \n\n                NFL\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Old news is old news!
