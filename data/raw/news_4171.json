[Elvis Ogina, Standard]\n\nMuslim leaders have rejected the Reproductive Health Bill which provides that all individuals should attain and be able to make informed decisions on sexual and reproductive health.\nThe Muslim heads said the statements allowing \u201call individuals\u201d to make reproductive health decisions could easily be abused by people who want to corrupt the country\u2019s social and moral fabric.\nSpeaking at a press briefing yesterday at Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, the leaders cited the recently released findings on teenage pregnancies across the country as one of the major reasons they were against the proposed law, along with what they termed as legal grounds, vague definitions and religious grounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Bill provides for a blanket reproductive rights to everybody, including minors, without the input or consent of their parents or guardians,\u201d said Alhajji Hassan Ole Naddo, the SUPKEM (Supreme Council Of Kenya Muslims) national chairman.\nRoom for misuse\nThe Muslim clerics also said the Bill left room for misuse of the right to life law by presuming that a pregnancy may be terminated if there is substantial risk that the foetus may suffer from severe physical and mental abnormality that is \u201cincompatible with life outside the womb\u201d..Keep Reading Uhuru's cousins fight to reclaim Sh3 billion land in 15th attempt Supkem leadership wrangles persist SUPKEM resolves leadership dispute, promises integrity and inclusivity Kenya signs 2024 Hajj season protocols with Saudi Arabia\n\u201cThis severe abnormality that is incompatible with life outside the womb is not defined and opens the door for abuse. Unless you are a prophet, how would one tell that this physical abnormality is incompatible with life?\u201d reads part of a statement by the religious leaders.\nThey further said the provision of Section 28(2) within the Bill, which allows for persons with mental illness to make decisions regarding pregnancy termination, goes against the constitution which states that a person of unsound mind has no such capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn religious grounds, the clerics said surrogacy, which is in the Bill, is not allowed in Islam due to confusion over lineage and inheritance issues as provided for in Shariah.\n\u201cThere are also many legal and ethical concerns on surrogacy which require greater public engagement and participation,\u201d said Ole Naddo.\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\nReproductive Health Bill\n\n\nJamia Mosque\n\n\nSUPKEM\n\n\nSupreme Council Of Kenya Muslims\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\nKU bus accident: Seven airlifted to Nairobi for treatment\n\n\n\n\nAll PSV drivers to undergo re-testing amid road carnage\n\n\n\n\nJournalist Rita Tinina died of severe pneumonia- Autopsy\n\n\n\n\nIts now payback time for Raila the kingmaker as stars align for him\n\n\n\n\nUhuru's cousins fight to reclaim Sh3 billion land in 15th attempt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nPopular this week\n\n\n\n\n\nUhuru's kin make 15th attempt to reclaim Sh3 billion land auctioned by KCB\n\n\n\n\nUhuru's kin make 15th attempt to reclaim Sh3 billion land auctioned by KCB\n\n\n\n\nIts now payback time for Raila the kingmaker as stars align for him\n\n\n\n\nWife battering claims cannot stop Ngugi from winning coveted prize\n\n\n\n\nHousing scheme: The billions that government cannot afford to lose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. \n\nLatest Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture of work: Navigating market shifts, going digital\n\n\n\n Enterprise\n\n\n\n\nBy\nEsther Dianah\n\n\n\n34 mins ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKU bus accident: Seven airlifted to Nairobi for treatment\n\n\n\n National\n\n\n\n\nBy\nStephanie Wangari and Hezron Kimari\n\n\n\n41 mins ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll PSV drivers to undergo re-testing amid road carnage\n\n\n\n National\n\n\n\n\nBy\nMate Tongola\n\n\n\n41 mins ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournalist Rita Tinina died of severe pneumonia- Autopsy\n\n\n\n National\n\n\n\n\nBy\nStephanie Wangari\n\n\n\n51 mins ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nThe Standard\nInsider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\nHarold Odhiambo and Anne Atieno\n\n51 mins ago\n\n\n\nPremium\nIts now payback time for Raila the kingmaker as stars align for him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\nKamau Muthoni\n\n51 mins ago\n\n\n\nPremium\nUhuru's cousins fight to reclaim Sh3 billion land in 15th attempt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\nNjahira Gitahi\n\n51 mins ago\n\n\n\nPremium\nWife battering claims cannot stop Ngugi wa Thiong'o from winning coveted prize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\nNdung\u2019u Gachane\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n\n\nPremium\nInside Kalonzo's charm offensive in Mt Kenya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nDigger\nClassified\n\n\n\n\n\nDIGGER\nMOTORS\n\n\n\n\nDIGGER JOBS\n\n\n\nDIGGER REAL\nESTATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET OUR NEWSLETTER\nSubscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special\noffers!\n\n \n\nSUBMIT\n\n\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE LATEST JOB ADVERTS\n\n\njoin Digger Classifieds telegram\nchannel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate\nContact Us\nRate Card\nVacancies\nDCX\nO.M Portal\nCorporate Email\nRMS\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\n THEME \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024.
