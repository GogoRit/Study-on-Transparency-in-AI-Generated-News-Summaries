She was pregnant with twins when one of the foetus\u2019 heartbeat stopped and doctors refused to carry out an abortion. In a statement, her family accused the government of having \u201cblood on its hands\u201d. Further protests are planned in Cz\u0119stochowa, the city in southern Poland where the mother-of-three was from.\u201cWe continue to protest so that no one else will die,\u201d Marta Lempart, organiser of the protests, told Polish media. \u201cThe Polish abortion ban kills. Another person has died because the necessary medical procedure was not carried out on time.\u201d All-Poland Women\u2019s Strike has called on people across the country to picket the offices of the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) and organise road blockades in the coming days.Agnieszka was first admitted to the Blessed Virgin Mary hospital in Cz\u0119stochowa with abdominal pain on 21 December. She is said to have been in the first trimester of a twin pregnancy when she arrived and was in \u201ca good physical and mental shape\u201d, according to her family, who said her condition then deteriorated.Polish state has \u2018blood on its hands\u2019 after death of woman refused an abortionRead moreOn 23 December the heartbeat of one of the twins stopped and, according to Agnieszka\u2019s family, the doctors refused to remove it, quoting the current abortion legislation. They waited several days until the second foetus also died. A further two days passed before the pregnancy was terminated on 31 December, according to the family.A priest was then summoned by hospital staff to perform a funeral for the twins, the family said.The family say that the doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy earlier, citing Poland\u2019s abortion legislation. \u201cHer husband begged the doctors to save his wife, even at the cost of the pregnancy,\u201d Agnieszka\u2019s twin sister, Wioletta Paciepnik, said on Tuesday.After the termination, Agnieszka was moved from the gynaecological ward and her health continued to deteriorate. Her family suspect that she died of sepsis but the cause of death was not identified in a statement released by the hospital.Shortly after her death, a statement by her family accusing the hospital of neglect was published on Facebook, alongside a distressing video of Agnieszka\u2019s last days.Agnieszka\u2019s death marks the first anniversary of the 2021 ruling that declared abortion due to foetal abnormalities illegal. Abortion can now only be carried out in cases of rape, incest or if the mother\u2019s life and health are in danger.Her death comes after that of a woman known as Izabela last September, who died after being denied medical intervention when her waters broke in the 22nd week of her pregnancy. Her family claim the 30-year-old was refused an abortion or caesarean section and that the hospital cited the country\u2019s abortion laws. An investigation found that \u201cmedical malpractice\u201d led to Izabela\u2019s death and the hospital was fined. Soon after, an anonymous man from \u015awidnica in south-west Poland came forward to share that his wife, Ania, died in similar circumstances in June last year.Poland plans to set up register of pregnancies to report miscarriagesRead moreWhile \u201cselective abortion\u201d is possible in the case of a twin pregnancy, it is unclear whether aborting an unviable foetus to save its healthy twin is permitted by the new abortion legislation. The Polish court has not referenced the questions raised by this situation, presented by opposition senators last year, in the new legislation.\u201cWe want to honour the memory of my beloved sister and save other women in Poland from a similar fate,\u201d Paciepnik said in a video appeal. The case is now being investigated by the regional prosecutors in Katowice, who also investigated the case of Izabela.The family are represented by Kamila Ferenc, from the Federation for Women and Family Planning, who confirmed that an autopsy of Agnieszka\u2019s body has been ordered by the court.According to a statement from the hospital, Agnieszka tested positive for Covid before her death, although she tested negative twice when first admitted. \u201cWe stress that the hospital staff did all the necessary actions to save the patient,\u201d the statement read. The hospital has also denied that a termination was requested. This article was amended on 28 January 2022. The first foetal heartbeat stopped on 23 December, not 21 December as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsAbortionRights and freedomHealthWomenPolandEuropeShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMacron says battle for abortion rights is not over as France updates constitution8 Mar 2024MPs\u00a0and campaigners accuse Polish government of betrayal over abortion laws7 Mar 2024 France makes abortion a constitutional right in historic Versailles vote4 Mar 2024French move to make abortion a \u2018guaranteed freedom\u2019 gains big win in lower house30 Jan 2024Abortion rights will be in French constitution next year, Macron vows29 Oct 2023Woman in Malta charged in court for having abortion1 Jun 2023\u2018I will do the same again\u2019: activists continue fight against Poland\u2019s strict abortion laws 24 May 2023Japan approves abortion pill for the first time29 Apr 2023France moves closer to making abortion a constitutional right24 Nov 2022Malta drafts law allowing abortion if mother\u2019s life or health at risk21 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
