(FOX 2) - A pregnancy center in Macomb County was vandalized Saturday morning. Now, police are searching for the people responsible. Several spray-painted messages were left on the walls at Pregnancy Aid Detroit, the pro-life, crisis pregnancy center in Eastpointe.\u00a0   This is not the first time a pro-life pregnancy center was vandalized in metro Detroit. Back in September, a Southfield pro-life pregnancy center was also hit. A threatening message was left \"'If abortion is not safe neither are you.\"  A militant, extremist abortion rights group known as \"Jane\u2019s Revenge\" has been behind similar crimes around the country. It\u2019s being investigated by police if it is connected to the incident in Eastpointe.\u00a0 Police say the investigation is ongoing and are working on gathering surveillance footage from the non-profit center.\u00a0    BREAKING NEWS Breaking news delivered fast        By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.  \n      Top videos\n          video  Suspect torches Tesla in Detroit       video  Exploring this year's construction projects in downtown Detroit       video  Motion passes to demolish historic school building       video  Clinton Township residents attend meeting to voice blast concerns       video  Allen Park taxidermist gets tracked down by Rob Wolchek   Trending      Southgate drunk driver kills woman, injures 4      Man who said new clerk was going to sell him big winner wins $500K on Michigan Lotto ticket      'Outrageous': Rising gas, car insurance prices affect Michigan drivers      Elderly sisters beaten, raped in Dearborn home invasion; suspect in custody      Romulus nightclub temporarily shutdown after fatal shooting had host of other issues        News LocalNationalHall of ShameLet It RipCrimestoppersThe InterviewBusinessThings to DoFOX News SundayLive LiveNOW from FOXFOX SoulStream FOX 2 FOX LOCALFOX 2 News appWeather ClosingsWeather AppWeather AlertsTrafficAirport DelaysFox WeatherAnimal HouseMornings The NineThe NoonMug ContestHealth WorksCooking SchoolNosh with JoshGet FitMoney SaverDoctor is InWeekend MorningsPolitics Let It RipGretchen WhitmerJoe BidenSports First & NorthLionsWolverinesSpartansPistonsTigersRed WingsEntertainment FOX ShowsCriticLEE SpeakingTV ListingsContestsDeeper Than A CutAbout Us FOX 2 Staff75 years of WJBKContact UsWork at FOX 2FOX 2 News AppJob ShopCommunityFCC Public File FCC ApplicationsClosed CaptionsProblem Solvers ResourcesContests Wallside Windows Weather QuizGardner White Dream TeamMug ContestExposedMoney Personal FinanceCOVID-19 & The EconomyBusinessStock MarketSmall BusinessRegional News Chicago News - FOX 32 ChicagoMilwaukee News - FOX 6 NewsMinneapolis News - FOX 9 facebooktwitterinstagramemail  About UsNew Privacy PolicyTerms of ServiceYour Privacy ChoicesWork at FOX 2FCC Public FileEEO Public File This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX Television Stations\n\n\n\n"
