Wade. Texas, along with more than two dozen other states, is expected to ban all abortion, with only a narrow exception to save the life of the pregnant patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas Policy Evaluation Project, a research institute at the University of Texas that focuses on \u201cevidence-based, equitable reproductive and sexual health care,\u201d has been studying the impacts of Texas\u2019 abortion law and other policy changes.\nThe paper, which was authored by TxPEP researchers, maternal-fetal medicine specialists and abortion providers, highlights the experiences of 25 clinicians and 20 people who have experienced pregnancy complications.\nAlthough Texas\u2019 abortion law contains an exemption to save the life of the pregnant patient, doctors said it was unevenly and insufficiently applied.\n\u201cPeople have to be on death\u2019s door to qualify for maternal exemptions\u201d to Texas\u2019 current law, one maternal-fetal medicine specialist told the paper\u2019s authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors reported that they have postponed abortion care until a patient\u2019s health or pregnancy complication has deteriorated to the point that their life was in danger, including multiple cases where patients were sent home, only to return once they were in sepsis.\nAnd even when patients were able to qualify for an abortion under the life-saving exemption, some doctors report being unable to get nurses or anesthesiologists to assist on these procedures for fear that they will be seen as \u201caiding and abetting\u201d in an abortion, which is prohibited by the law.\nIn some cases, doctors said they have avoided standard abortion methods, like a dilation and evacuation, and instead used less common surgical methods or induction to avoid risking a lawsuit.\n\u201cPhysicians have said that they don\u2019t feel like they can offer the standard medical interventions that are the standard of care across the United States,\u201d said Whitney Arey, the lead researcher on the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s resulted in people using less common or outdated practices because it might not be construed as performing an abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the doctors interviewed said their hospitals have prohibited multifetal reduction, by which doctors preserve the health of the pregnancy by reducing the number of fetuses a patient is carrying.\nClinicians also reported confusion over whether they can even counsel patients on abortion as an option or direct them to out-of-state clinics.\nA 39-year-old woman told TxPEP that her doctor would not discuss abortion options with her after she received a significant fetal diagnosis.\n\u201cWhen you already have received news like that and can barely function, the thought of having to do your own investigating to determine where to get this medical care to arrange going out of state feels additionally overwhelming,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother patient whose water broke at 19 weeks of pregnancy had to decide between waiting to see if she could access care in Texas or getting on a plane to get an abortion elsewhere. She ended up taking the risk of flying out of state while experiencing a significant health emergency.\nSome of the doctors who spoke with TxPEP described the mental toll it takes on them to have to treat patients under these restrictions. Several said they were considering leaving the state but were weighing the impact on patients who will continue to need care for high-risk and medically complicated pregnancies.\nAnti-abortion advocacy organizations have pushed back against the idea that these restrictions endanger maternal health. Texas Right to Life argued in a blog post that \u201cmisinformation\u201d from the media and abortion advocates is the real problem.\n\u201cThe misinformation surrounding what Texas law actually entails could cause physicians to hesitate before performing any sort of procedure that may even look like abortion even if it is clearly not an elective abortion,\u201d the post said. \u201cUnfortunately, this could cause women who need that critical medical attention to be turned away.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these doctors and the patients they treat say it\u2019s the laws that are sowing confusion and fear \u2014 and having real-world impacts on health care.\n\u201cWe know in the post-Roe landscape, physicians and institutions are going to have really diverse interpretations of narrow exemptions,\u201d Arey said. \u201cAnd this is going to compromise pregnant people\u2019s ability to get evidence-based health care and support from the health care provider that they need.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see more patients that will be forced to wait until they\u2019re sick enough to receive care, or see patients traveling out of state,\u201d she said.\n\nJoin us Sept. 22-24 in person in downtown Austin for The Texas Tribune Festival and experience 100+ conversation events featuring big names you know and others you should from the worlds of politics, public policy, the media and tech \u2014 all curated by The Texas Tribune\u2019s award-winning journalists.
