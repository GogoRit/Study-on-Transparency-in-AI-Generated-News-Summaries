Here, women shout slogans and wave the Lebanese flag during a demonstration in down town Beirut on\u00a0October 19, 2019.\n\n\u00a9 Marwan Naamani/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images\n\n\n(Beirut) \u2013 Lebanese authorities are falling short of their international legal obligations to protect women and girls from violence and end discrimination against them, Human Rights Watch said today.\nHuman Rights Watch has submitted a report to the United Nations Committee reviewing Lebanon\u2019s compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which is tentatively scheduled for June 2021. The country has not made progress to carry out a number of recommendations from its previous review in 2015, including not creating a unified personal status code that would guarantee equal treatment for all citizens and amending the discriminatory nationality law to ensure that Lebanese women married to non-Lebanese men can pass on their citizenship to their children.\n\u201cAnother five years have passed, and Lebanon has done little to end discrimination against women and girls under its international obligations,\u201d said Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cLebanon\u2019s authorities should show that they are serious about women\u2019s rights by coming through on long-overdue reforms before they have to answer to the United Nations again for their failures.\u201d\nLebanon has not taken any steps to issue an optional civil code or to reform its 15\u00a0religion-based personal status laws and\u00a0the religious courts that apply them. These courts discriminate against women across the religious spectrum and do not guarantee their basic rights, especially in matters such as divorce, property rights, and responsibility for children after divorce.\nThe authorities have also not reformed the nationality law, which prohibits Lebanese women married to foreigners from passing citizenship to their spouses and children, while men who marry foreign nationals can pass on their citizenship. This prohibition affects almost every aspect of the children\u2019s and spouses\u2019 lives, including legal residency and access to work, education, social services, and health care. It leaves some children at risk of statelessness.\nLegal protections from domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment remain inadequate. In August 2017, Lebanon repealed article 522 of the penal code, which allowed rapists to escape punishment by marrying their victims, but left a loophole with regard to offenses relating to sex with children aged 15 to 17, and sex with virgin girls, with promises of marriage.\nThe current domestic violence law defines domestic violence narrowly and fails to specifically criminalize marital rape. Members of parliament have introduced multiple draft laws since 2017 on sexual harassment, but parliament has yet to take any action. A lack of coordination in the government\u2019s response to sex trafficking continues to put women and girls \u2013 especially Syrians living in Lebanon \u2013 at risk.\nHuman Rights Watch has documented how women and girls, especially trans women, sex workers, refugees, and asylum seekers, have experienced systemic violence from Lebanese authorities, particularly in detention centers. Trans women have described being placed in men\u2019s cells, being denied food and water, and being coerced to confess. Allegations of sexual violence, including rape, against women in custody are common. As an example, Layal al-Kayaje was arrested on September 21, 2015 for \u201charming the military\u2019s reputation\u201d after she alleged being raped and tortured by two soldiers in military custody in 2013.\nLebanon has consistently failed to properly investigate, prosecute, and punish those responsible for torture. In 2016, parliament\u00a0passed legislation creating a national body, the National Preventive Mechanism Against Torture, to monitor and investigate the use of torture, and in 2017 it adopted a new anti-torture law. The body\u2019s five members were named on March 7, 2019, but the government has still not allocated its funding.\nLebanon\u2019s economic crisis, compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic and the port explosion in Beirut on August 4, 2020, has made\u00a0life worse for marginalized populations, not least for migrant domestic workers, the majority of them women from African and Asian countries. Many have reported increased incidents of abuse by their employers during the lockdown, and at least seven have taken their own lives since March. Migrant domestic workers remain excluded from Lebanon\u2019s labor law protections provided to other workers, and their legal status remains tied to their employer under the kafala (visa sponsorship) system.\nOn October 14, 2020, Lebanon\u2019s State Shura Council, the country\u2019s top administrative court, delivered a sharp blow to migrant domestic workers\u2019 rights when it struck down a new standard unified contract adopted by the Labor Ministry on September 4. The new contract introduced new protections for migrant domestic workers, including vital safeguards against forced labor, and would have been an important first step towards abolishing the abusive kafala system.\u00a0\n\u201cFor the past year, women from all walks of life have taken to the streets to demand equality and an end to all forms of discrimination,\u201d Majzoub said. \u201cWhile the authorities have taken some steps, they need to heed calls for systemic change for equality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nMiddle East/North Africa Lebanon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights Exploitation, Forced Labor & Trafficking Women's Rights Domestic Violence Domestic Workers Gender Equality Sexual Violence and Rape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 1, 2019\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nLebanon\u2019s Women Have Fought for Change \u2013 and Should Get It \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay Video \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cMy Marriage was Mistake after Mistake\u201d\n\n\nThe Impact of Unregistered Marriages on Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Rights in Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nTrapped\n\n\nHow Male Guardianship Policies Restrict Women\u2019s Travel and Mobility in the Middle East and North Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 1, 2019\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nLebanon\u2019s Women Have Fought for Change \u2013 and Should Get It \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay Video \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
