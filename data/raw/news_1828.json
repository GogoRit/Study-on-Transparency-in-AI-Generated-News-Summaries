(Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office filed to appeal a superior court judge\u2019s decision to grant class action certification to a lawsuit that seeks to strike down Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban on the basis of the state\u2019s controversial religious freedom law.\nThe legal challenge in question was certified as class action on June 6 by a Marion County Superior Court judge.\u00a0\nThe underlying lawsuit was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of Hoosier Jews for Choice, as well as four anonymous women who represent a variety of faiths. The lawsuit argues that the new abortion law violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nThe class is defined as, \u201cAll persons in Indiana whose religious beliefs direct them to obtain abortions in situations prohibited by Senate Enrolled Act 1 (the abortion-restricting legislation) who need, or will need, to obtain an abortion and who are not, or will not be, able to obtain an abortion because of the Act.\u201d\n  Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (Photo from National Association of Attorneys General)\nBut attorneys with Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita\u2019s office maintained in a June 14 court filing that the trial court\u2019s order granting class certification \u201cintroduces new uncertainty as to how the preliminary injunction would apply to class members both now and, should the injunction be affirmed, in the future.\u201d\nThe state further questioned whether \u201cthe religious sincerity\u201d of class members or \u201cspecifics of their religious practices\u201d can be determined in a judicial setting.\u00a0\n\u201cThe trial court\u2019s class certification order not only overlaps significantly with the preliminary injunction ruling in several key areas, but also relies on the preliminary injunction order to arrive at several key conclusions,\u201d attorneys for the state said in their appeal request. \u201cThat interdependence, plus the trial court\u2019s multiple legal errors and manifest abuse of discretion in certifying the class, justify immediate appeal and consideration alongside review of the preliminary injunction.\u201d\nRokita\u2019s office appeals\nThe attorney general requested that the Indiana Court of Appeals accept an interlocutory appeal of class certification order.\nRokita\u2019s office said, too, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not \u201cripe,\u201d or timely, because they\u2019re contingent on future pregnancies.\nThe state additionally held that claims made in the underlying lawsuit by the plaintiffs \u2014 which include practitioners of Judaism, Unitarian Universalism, Episcopalianism and paganism, all belief systems that allow abortions under circumstances outside the ban\u2019s narrow exceptions \u2014\u00a0\u201cfail on the merits\u201d under RFRA.\nStory continues below.\nMotion for Interlocutory Appeal\n\u00a0\nAn interlocutory appeal is requested when a final order has not been issued, but one of the parties seeks an appeal anyway because they stand to suffer damages if not resolved before the entire case is over. Alternatively, an interlocutory appeals can be requested because an order involves a substantial question of law \u2014 that if answered early on in the case \u2014 will help bring the overall case closer to a resolution.\nThe state must get permission from the trial court and the Indiana Court of Appeals to proceed with the interlocutory appeal. The Court of Appeals has not yet decided if it will grant the request, however.\nAlready, Rokita\u2019s office filed an interlocutory appeal of a preliminary injunction granted in the case in December. State attorneys argued that plaintiffs \u201chave not demonstrated that an injunction will prevent any certain RFRA violation.\u201d\nAt issue in the preliminary injunction appeal is whether the trial court can make a RFRA determination \u201cmonths and years before a woman decides to get an abortion, when sincerity cannot be tested until the relevant circumstances come to pass and whether obtaining an abortion is itself a religious exercise.\u201d\nThat separate appeal of the preliminary injunction is set for oral argument in the Indiana Court of Appeals on Sept. 12.\nIn the meantime \u2014 while the appeals plays out \u2014 both parties in the case have requested for the underlying lawsuit to be stayed, or paused. The Marion County Superior Court granted that motion in a brief ruling on Wednesday.\nIndiana Supreme Court decision still to come\nThis is the second case involving the ban. In January, Indiana Supreme Court justices heard a case against the ban based on liberty and privacy rights. They have not issued a ruling.\nThe new abortion ban was in effect for just a week in September before a Republican judge in Owen County issued a first temporary injunction in a separate ACLU lawsuit, which challenges the constitutionality of the law based on liberty and privacy protections.\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nThe decision put the ban on hold while Indiana Supreme Court justices continue to weigh the case.\u00a0 Under that injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law stands \u2014 allowing abortions up to 20 weeks.\nThe Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly advanced the abortion-restricting measure during a heated, two-week special session that concluded in August. That made Indiana the first state in the nation to approve such legislation since the high court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe ban outlaws all abortions except in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly and cases of serious health risk to the mother. One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime. Rape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization.\nIt also strips abortion clinics of their state medical licenses, and provides that only hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers can provide abortions.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRokita\u2019s office files new appeal in RFRA-based lawsuit against Indiana abortion ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle June 21, 2023\nRokita\u2019s office files new appeal in RFRA-based lawsuit against Indiana abortion ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle June 21, 2023\n The state attorney general\u2019s office filed to appeal a superior court judge\u2019s decision to grant class action certification to a lawsuit that seeks to strike down Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban on the basis of the state\u2019s controversial religious freedom law.\nThe legal challenge in question was certified as class action on June 6 by a Marion County Superior Court judge.\u00a0\nThe underlying lawsuit was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of Hoosier Jews for Choice, as well as four anonymous women who represent a variety of faiths.
