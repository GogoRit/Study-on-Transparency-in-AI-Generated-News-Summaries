Wade in 2022, coming up again and again everywhere policy is decided: in legislatures, courts, the Oval Office and voting booths in Kansas, Ohio, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Republicans are struggling to adjust to a political environment in which an issue that motivated their base for decades has become a serious general-election liability.\n\n\n\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFormer President\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nHis Supreme Court appointees doomed Roe, and he has privately supported a 16-week ban.\nMore than perhaps any other Republican, former President Donald J. Trump is responsible for the current state of abortion access: He appointed three of the six Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and the judge who invalidated the approval of the abortion drug mifepristone. But he has been loath to talk about abortion, and when asked about it, he has given muddled and contradictory answers.\n\nRead full position\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nNikki Haley\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFormer Governor of South Carolina\n\t\t\t\t\tDropped out\n\nShe supports a 15-week national ban but also calls for more contraception access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to unmute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to talk about a federal law,\nlet\u2019s talk about consensus.\nLet\u2019s humanize the situation rather than\ndemonizing the situation.\nCan\u2019t we all agree that we don\u2019t want to see\nlate-term abortions?\nCan\u2019t we all agree that we should encourage\nmore adoptions and better-quality adoptions so\nthose kids feel more love and not less?\nCan\u2019t we agree there should be more access to contraception?\nCan\u2019t we agree that doctors and nurses who don\u2019t believe\nin abortion shouldn\u2019t have to perform them?\nAnd can\u2019t we agree that any woman that has an abortion\nshouldn\u2019t go to jail and get the death penalty?\nCan\u2019t we start there?\n\n\n\nRead full position\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGovernor of Florida\n\t\t\t\t\tDropped out\n\nHe signed a six-week ban in Florida and supports a 15-week national ban.\nAfter refusing for months to confirm whether he supported a national ban, Gov.

Where they declined to answer, we have noted in the text.\nProject Credits\nReportingMaggie AstorVideo productionAng LiRex SakamotoDesign and developmentNico ChillaRebecca Lieberman\nEditingMarie SolisJustin SwansonKaren WorkmanAdditional reportingNick CorasanitiLisa FriedmanMichael GoldDana GoldsteinAnjali HuynhNeil Vigdor\n\n\n\n\nShare full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation\u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
