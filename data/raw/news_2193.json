Or as my friend, Ivanka Trump, recently\u00a0put it, \u201cI am pro-life and unapologetically so.\u201d\nThat stance isn\u2019t a choice or a preference\u2014it\u2019s a conviction, and it\u2019s a conviction that takes genuine courage to hold in today\u2019s Washington, because it is under constant attack.\nThe pro-abortion left, which is a unanimous position of the progressive elites, seeks out every opportunity to force pro-life lawmakers to violate this sacred principle. The reason is simple, they want to force an impossible choice. When a pro-life lawmaker offers a proposal, the left will force them to either compromise on the pro-life stance in order to get most of the proposal passed, or do nothing.\nThe issue of life cannot be compromised. Numerical data or regulatory policy often has middle ground that is built-in or quite obvious. That type of compromise isn\u2019t available on the issue of life. To pro-life Americans, no amount of abortion or abortion funding is tolerable.\nKnowing this, liberals see every federal program and federal dollar as an opportunity for advancing their pro-abortion worldview. They believe all federal money must be available for abortion. Where they have the power, they force every conservative to answer the question: Do you support your proposal enough to violate your deeply held convictions?\nIn this way, progressives create a win-win for themselves. Either they have killed a good conservative policy idea, or they undermined the pro-life cause. This is a tried-and-true tactic that they will never abandon. I am a decades-long veteran of this war and I have seen it countless times.\nAmongst the cruelest way that they wield this weapon is on the issue of women\u2019s advancement. They have wrongly labeled abortion as a women\u2019s issue and incorrectly assert that \u201cabortion is health care.\u201d\u00a0\nNeither statement could be further from the truth, but as talking points, these statements build fences around conservatives. In Washington, they make sure you can\u2019t work on women\u2019s issues unless you also support abortion.\nIvanka Trump had the courage to challenge this stalemate, and more may follow her lead.\nIn 2019, under her leadership, the\u00a0Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative\u00a0was established. The Heritage Foundation is deeply supportive of the ideals and policy goals of this initiative, and we\u2019ve partnered with the White House to promote them.\nRecently, there was a proposal to include the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative within the\u00a0mandate of the State Department\u2019s Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues. However, discussions to incorporate the initiative as part of the annual Defense Authorization Bill hit a roadblock.\u00a0\nPro-abortion members of Congress, who\u00a0have thus far resisted any attempt to\u00a0allow a simple protection against abortion, prevented the proposal from being attached to this important legislation.\nThere is no conceivable reason for this stance unless they intend to use this office to promote abortion abroad. Additionally, they get the added benefit of\u2014once again\u2014challenging the pro-life commitment of someone on the right: this time, the very prominent and successful figure of Ivanka Trump.\u00a0\nI am proud of Ivanka Trump\u2019s commitment to protect life, and I will stand by her to support that conviction, come what may. This isn\u2019t the first time that conservative women have been treated this way in Washington, and it won\u2019t be the last. But, it is my sincere hope that it will be one of the times that conservative women stick together and succeed together.\u00a0\nThe Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative is a worthy initiative and deserves widespread support. But given the\u00a0history\u00a0of the Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues, that office should not be codified absent a guardrail in place to prevent it from promoting abortion.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
