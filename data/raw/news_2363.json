Watch the Entire Timelapse Video\u2026Brenna Lewis - 25 Jan 2020The 2020 National Pro-Life March\u00ae in Washington D.C. is a wrap! Just so you can get an idea of how BIG the event is, we made sure to capture our traditional time lapse from a nearby rooftop:\n\nThis March is the largest annual social demonstration in the entire world. No other cause, in no other country, brings together such a massive group of people on a yearly basis. Every pro-life organization nationwide, despite our little differences in how we like to go about our mission, comes together for this one day \u2013 to protest\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and let our legislators know that abortion is not, and never will be, okay.\nSome Noteworthy Numbers From the Day\u2026\n\nBased on this time lapse video, we estimate there were about 225,000 participants.\nStudents for Life passed out 15,000 \u201cI Am the Pro-Life Generation\u201d signs.\nThere were about 30 pro-abortion protestors in front of the Supreme Court.\n1 of those protestors threatened to kill a Students for Life student by \u2018slitting her throat.\u2019 She was subsequently arrested.\n\u00a0It\u2019s been 47 years since\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0was handed down, but this year was the first March attended by a U.S. President (watch and share it here).\nStudents for Life built and carried 6 large banners that conveyed the mission of the Pro-Life Generation loud and clear.\n\nSome Great Photos From the Day\u2026\nBut stay tuned for PLENTY more! This is just a sneak peek.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4 men telling the entire National Pro-Life March that abortion is great.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe aren\u2019t going ANYWHERE, folks.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured in the background: the worst pro-choice signs ever made.\n\n\n\n\n\nSFLA President Kristan Hawkins counter-protesting with Autumn Lindsey.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents for Life lives to counter-protest.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome our cheerful faces!\n\n\n\n\n\nHanding out signs!\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia\u2019s infanticidal governor is not real popular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA baby\u2019s not a baby \u2019til it comes out \u2013 that\u2019s what birthdays are all about!\u201d\n\n\nIf you joined us or participated at a local event in your community \u2013 thank you for standing for life today.
