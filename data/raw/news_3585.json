Anthony Pro-Life America, which oppose abortion rights, spent $3 million from October 1 to October 24, most of which has come from late spending from Women Speak Out, the super PAC affiliated with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen Vote has spent over $2.5 million in October and $22.8 million since the beginning of the 2022 campaign cycle.Women Speak Out has spent $2.2 million in October, out of $3.5 million spent this cycle.\u00a0Planned Parenthood Votes has spent over $426,000 in October and over $5.7 million total this cycle.\u00a0The National Right to Life Victory Fund has spent over $778,000 in October and over $919,000 overall.\nFederal law limits how much money regular political action committees can give directly to a candidate. But, thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in Citizens United vs. FEC, there are no legal limits on how much super PACs associated with those groups can spend on outside investments, like advertising and voter outreach, influencing the electorate.\n\n\n\nNearly all of Women Vote\u2019s October outside spending has gone to television and digital advertising. Most of Planned Parenthood Votes\u2019 reported expenditures in October have been spent on voter communications, canvassing and mailers.\u00a0\nThe National Right to Life Victory Fund and Women Speak Out are devoting most of their October spending to direct mailers and voter canvassing, in addition to some advertising. Women Speak Out, for example, dropped over $430,000 on digital ads in the Senate battlegrounds of Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in late October.\u00a0\nThese outside investments in congressional races, formally known as independent expenditures, make up only one piece of the puzzle of those groups\u2019 spending and involvement in the 2022 midterms. They also don\u2019t represent the totality of all campaign spending in 2022 midterm races by abortion-focused interest groups.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

The 37-year-old organization was founded on the idea that money \u2014 and lots of it \u2014 can propel Democratic women who support abortion rights to elected office and get them reelected cycle after cycle. (The name is an acronym for \u201cearly money is like yeast.\u201d)\n\u201cWe're sending it out as soon as it comes in,\u201d Reynolds said of the money the group is raising in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\nWhen accounting for independent expenditures cumulatively larger than $5,000 per candidate, Pennsylvania, Washington, Nevada, North Carolina and Michigan have seen the most outside spending in federal races from the four super PACs.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania leads the tally with over $5 million spent by all four groups during the entire 2022 cycle, as they shoveled money into the state\u2019s competitive U.S. Senate race between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz. Spending in the race especially ramped up in October:\nPlanned Parenthood Votes has spent $66,500 on mailers and ads in Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race and $56,000 in canvassing services in two House races for the 1st and 17th districts as of\u00a0 October 24.Women Speak Out has spent over $312,000 on canvassing services and digital advertising in the Pennsylvania Senate race in October and $13,370 in Pennsylvania House races.\u00a0\u00a0The National Right to Life Victory Fund has spent $200,000 on mailers supporting Oz and over $15,000 in House races.\nCompetitive Senate races in the Southwest and West Coast have also seen a crush of\u00a0 spending from both camps in the first three weeks of October:\u00a0\nWomen Vote, which has spent over $4.7 million in Washington\u2019s U.S. Senate race between incumbent Democrat Patty Murray and Republican Tiffany Smiley, dropped over $1 million on television advertising opposing Smiley from October 1 through Monday.\u00a0Women Vote has also spent $200,000 on mailers and radio ads opposing Republican U.S. Senate nominee Adam Laxalt and House candidate Mark Robertson in Nevada through October 24.\u00a0The National Right to Life Victory Fund and Women Speak Out have spent over $281,000 on mailers, canvassing and digital advertising in Arizona\u2019s Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican Blake Masters and over $163,000 in Nevada\u2019s Senate race.\u00a0Planned Parenthood Votes spent $93,000 on canvassing services and digital ads supporting Kelly and opposing Masters in Arizona\u2019s U.S. Senate race.\nAbortion shot to the forefront of the U.S. Senate race in Georgia after the Daily Beast reported that an ex-girlfriend of Republican nominee Herschel Walker said Walker, who is vocally opposed to abortion, had reimbursed her after she had an abortion in 2009.\u00a0\nThe National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America quickly stood by Walker, who has denied the allegations. And their super PACs have spent big in Georgia\u2019s Senate race.\nThe National Right to Life Victory Fund reported spending $53,000 on mailers supporting Walker in early October, a decision most likely made before the publication of the bombshell story.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    States passing abortion bans reflect what only a small minority of their constituents actually want\n                \n\n\n\n                    \u2018My body is not yours\u2019: How personal abortion stories are taking center stage in Democratic campaign ads\n                \n\n\n\n\nWomen Speak Out has spent over $854,000 in the Georgia Senate race alone since the allegations against Walker became public, campaign finance filings show. Its spending includes $625,000 on digital ads opposing incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, $227,000 in canvassing and mileage expenses, and $2,265 on door hangers.\nAll four organizations are also spending cash in the open U.S. Senate race in North Carolina between Democrat Cheri Beasley and Republican Ted Budd.\u00a0\nWomen Vote reported an $841,000 ad buy opposing Budd on October 18, following up on $64,000 in spending from Planned Parenthood Votes in the race in October. The National Right to Life Victory Fund and Women Speak Out spent over $346,000 in North Carolina\u2019s Senate race in the first three weeks of October.\u00a0\u00a0\nEmily\u2019s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Planned Parenthood pledged in May to collectively invest at least $150 million in the 2022 midterms.\u00a0\nIn addition to the money tallied here, those groups and their state-level affiliates are also placing independent expenditures in races for state-level offices, like governorships and state legislatures, that are key to the state of reproductive health care access in a post-Roe world.\u00a0\nA recent five-figure ad buy from NARAL in the Georgia governor\u2019s race, for example, links GOP Gov. Brian Kemp to extreme abortion bans and potential restrictions on contraception and fertility treatment. Women Speak Out also put $1 million behind a television ad attacking both Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and Warnock as radical and out-of-step on abortion.\nJust a few state legislative seats can make all the difference. In North Carolina, Emily\u2019s List is dedicating resources toward preventing Republicans from gaining a supermajority in the state legislature that would enable them to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto over bills including abortion-related legislation, Reynolds said.\u00a0\nThese groups\u2019 PACs also give funds directly to candidates, serve as conduits between individual donors and candidates, and engage in voter outreach and mobilization efforts. This cycle, the presidents of all three abortion-rights organizations have been out on the trail campaigning alongside Democratic candidates in key races.\nRepublican candidates aren\u2019t unified around a single message on abortion, and polls show that the overturning of Roe v. Wade and restrictive abortion bans are overwhelmingly unpopular among voters.\nRepresentatives for the National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America did not respond to requests for comment. But Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the latter group, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Republicans should take a clear stance supporting abortion restrictions, as Sen. Lindsey Graham did in introducing a federal 15-week abortion ban, and not cede that political ground to Democrats.\u00a0\nAll four groups are publicly betting on the potency of abortion as a winning issue as some recent polls show other issues, chiefly inflation and the economy, overshadowing abortion access as a top issue for voters.\u00a0\u201cIt's not that we're saying you should only run a race on abortion \u2013 none of our candidates are doing that,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt's that this is the most powerful negative against Republicans, full stop. And we see it in every poll.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily\u2019s List jumps into Wisconsin Supreme Court election with endorsement of liberal judge\n\n\n\n\nAbortion divides Democrats in House runoff in South Texas\n\n\n\n\nHow abortion became the central issue in Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court race\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats warn abortion access is on the line in key statehouse races\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
