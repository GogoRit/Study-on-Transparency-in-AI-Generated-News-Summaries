So, it\u2019s a good time for women to think about and discuss their reproductive health, says a women\u2019s health expert at Purdue University.\nEXPERT: For the past decade, Andrea DeMaria, an assistant professor in the College of Health and Human Sciences, has conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with women across the United States and internationally about their experiences and complications with contraception and family planning, postpartum sexual activity, menstruation and genital hygiene, among other reproductive health topics.\nQUOTE: \u201cWith the culture of love and intimacy around Valentine\u2019s Day, you can only imagine that women think more about their reproductive health, whether that\u2019s contraception, menstruation or genital hygiene and grooming.\u201d\nMORE INFORMATION: DeMaria\u2019s work is funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the College of Charleston and Purdue University.\nWriter: Joseph Paul, 765-494-9541, paul102@purdue.edu\nSource: Andrea DeMaria, 765-494-8300, ademaria@purdue.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch News\n\n\nView RSS feed\nMore Research News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication \n\n\n\n\nOneCampus Portal\nBrightspace\nBoilerConnect\nOffice 365\nOutlook\nmyPurdue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus \n\n\n\n\nFaculty and Staff\nHuman Resources\nCareers\nColleges and Schools\nDirectory\nCampus Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo for Staff \n\n\n\n\nPurdue Moves\nBoard of Trustees\nUniversity Senate\nAPSAC\nCSSAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources \n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\nCenter for Healthy Living\nInformation Technology\nEthics & Compliance\nCampus Disruptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN 47907, (765) 494-4600\n \u00a9 2015-22 Purdue University | An equal access/equal opportunity university | Copyright Complaints | Maintained by Office of Strategic Communications\nTrouble with this page?
