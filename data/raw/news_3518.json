Wade \nU.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today reiterated her strong support for the codification of abortion rights as established by Roe v. Wade (1973) and affirmed by Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). While urging the preservation of those important rights for women, Murkowski will vote against S. 4132, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which has been described as codifying Roe v. Wade, but in reality goes much further\u2014nullifying state and religious freedom laws across the country in the process.\n\u201cI strongly support women\u2019s reproductive freedoms, including the right to abortion established by Roe and Casey. I also believe in limited government and an individual\u2019s liberty to make choices about their own health.\n\u201cConsistent with Roe and Casey, I support reasonable limits on abortion services related to maternal health. I oppose late-term abortion, as long as there are clear and workable exceptions in the case of rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is threatened. I also oppose the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, and oppose any requirement for individuals to provide these services against their religious beliefs.\n\u201cCongress should codify the important protections from Roe and Casey into law as they currently exist. That\u2019s why, in February, Senator Collins and I introduced our Reproductive Choice Act, which would prevent women\u2019s reproductive choices from being weakened or eliminated. Our bill would reassure women that the rights they have relied on for almost 50 years will continue to be the law of the land.\n\u201cThe legislation before the Senate today, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, goes well beyond the precedent established in Roe and Casey. It does not include the Hyde amendment, which prohibits taxpayer dollars from being spent on abortions\u2014and has been the law almost as long as Roe. It does not include conscience protections for healthcare providers that refuse to perform abortions based on religious beliefs. It explicitly overrides the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for the first time. It also allows late-term abortions without any notable restrictions.\n\u201cInstead of taking yet another failed vote on a wholly partisan measure, I urge Democrats and Republicans alike to recognize that what Senator Collins and I have offered is in line with the views of a strong majority of Americans\u2014who support a woman\u2019s right to choose but believe that legal abortion should include reasonable limitations.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Alaska, courts have interpreted abortion rights as protected under the State Constitution, so the repeal of Roe v. Wade would have no immediate effect.\nDetails About S. 3713, the Reproductive Choice Act:\n\nWould prohibit states from imposing an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the ability of a woman to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability;\n\n\nWould continue to allow states to enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy, while clarifying that unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d to a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy constitute an \u201cundue burden\u201d;\n\n\nWould\u00a0continue to permit states to restrict the ability to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability, except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman as consistent with Roe and Casey; and\n\n\nWould not have any effect on laws regarding conscience protections, including laws that protect health care providers who refuse to provide abortions for moral or religious reasons.\n\n\u00a0\nRelated Issues:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHealth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Office Locations\n\n\n\n\n\nAnchorage\nFairbanks\nJuneau\nMat-su valley\nSoldotna\nKetchikan\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\nAnchorage\n510 L Street\n\t\t\t\t\tSuite 600\n\t\t\t\t\tAnchorage, AK  99501\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone: (907) 271-3735\n\t\t\t\t\tFax: (877) 857-0322\nGet Directions\u00a0\u25b6\n\nFairbanks\n\t\t\t\t\tFairbanks Federal Building \n\t\t\t\t\t101 12th Avenue Room 172\n\t\t\t\t\tFairbank, Alaska 99701\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone: (907) 456-0233\n\t\t\t\t\tFax: (877) 857-0322\nGet Directions\u00a0\u25b6\n\nJuneau\n800 Glacier Ave\n\t\t\t\t\tSuite 101\n\t\t\t\t\tJuneau, AK  99801\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone: (907) 586-7277\n\t\t\t\t\tFax: (877) 857-0322\nGet Directions\u00a0\u25b6\n\nMat-Su Valley\n851 E.
