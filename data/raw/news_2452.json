If not, he will run as an independent. Kanye said his party will be called 'The Birthday Party' \u201cbecause when we win, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s birthday\".\nHis chosen running mate is Wyoming-based pastor and life coach, Michelle Tidball.\u00a0\nWhile Kanye had previously touted a run for President in 2024, he says that God will decide if it's the right time to \"appoint\" him to the Oval Office earlier.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see if the appointing is at 2020 or if it\u2019s 2024\u2014because God appoints the president,\" he said. \"If I win in 2020 then it was God\u2019s appointment. If I win in 2024 then that was God\u2019s appointment.\n\u201cGod just gave me the clarity and said it\u2019s time.\"\u00a0\nOn the coronavirus, he said:\u00a0\u201cWe pray. We pray for the freedom. It\u2019s all about God. We need to stop doing things that make God mad.\u201d\nHowever, Kanye appeared much less keen on the development of a vaccine, insisting that \"children that are being vaccinated and [being]\u00a0paralysed\".\u00a0\n\"When they say the way we\u2019re going to fix Covid is with a vaccine, I\u2019m extremely cautious,\" he added. \"That\u2019s the mark of the beast.\" West went on to say that \"they want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things, to make it where we can\u2019t cross the gates of heaven\".\u00a0\nWhen asked about his position on abortion, the rapper said he was\u00a0pro-life because he is\u00a0\"following the word of the Bible.\u201d Kanye also said he was firmly opposed to capital punishment, even quoting scripture to back up his case:\u00a0\u201cThou shalt not kill. I\u2019m against the death penalty,\" he declared.\nThe multi-award-winning artist, who released a single called 'Wash Us In The Blood' at the end of last month, also insisted\u00a0that God had already started bringing reconciliation to\u00a0the nation following the death of George Floyd. \u201cWell, God has already started the healing. This conversation alone is healing and revealing. We all need to start praying and kneeling\u2026\" he explained.\u00a0\nKanye also said he wanted to see prayer being reintroduced to\u00a0America's schooling system. He argued: \"Reinstate in God\u2019s state, in God\u2019s country, the fear and love of God in all schools and organisations and you chill the fear and love of everything else, so that was a plan by the Devil to have our kids committing suicide at an all-time high by removing God to have murders in Chicago at an all-time high because the human beings working for the Devil removed God and prayer from the schools. That means more drugs, more murders, more suicide.\u201d\nHe said that his political priorities include cleaning\u00a0up the chemicals\u00a0\"in our deodorant, in our toothpaste\" because they\u00a0\"affect our ability to be of service to God\". On various other policy issues, Kanye said he would instruct the \"strongest experts that serve God\" to \"come back with the best solution\".\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA Monthly Gift Of $11\u00a0Makes A World Of Difference\nIn a world of fake news there\u2019s never been a greater need for quality Christian journalism.
