Johnson, a Democrat who supports abortion access, found an unlikely ally in state senator Bryan Hughes, the Republican who crafted Texas\u2019s infamous \u201cbounty hunter\u201d law, which allows citizens to sue abortion providers as well as anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d abortion care.Johnson and her fellow Texas Democrats welcomed the bill\u2019s passage as a small but important compromise to improve reproductive health in the state.But abortion rights advocates across the country said HB 3058 offers little help to Texas doctors treating high-risk pregnancies.\u201cThe exceptions in the bill are so narrow, and the penalties for violating the Texas ban are so high, that invariably, a lot of doctors are going to continue not to offer abortion in those situations because they don\u2019t want to get in trouble,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.Hughes\u2019 support of HB 3058 signals a new strategy by Republicans to insulate abortion bans from scrutiny by creating narrow exceptions for medical emergencies.\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that abortion rights supporters are using those medical cases to delegitimize abortion bans altogether,\u201d Ziegler said.HB 3058 was first introduced in the aftermath of an explosive lawsuit in which five women denied abortions in Texas, along with two doctors, sued the state after they were refused care despite suffering severe complications with their pregnancies.The horror stories that emerged from that lawsuit threatened public support of the Texas abortion ban.Republicans can now point to these new exceptions and say, \u2018Look, that kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen any more\u2019Mary Ziegler of the University of California, Davis\u201cRepublicans can now point to these new exceptions and say, \u2018Look, that kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen any more,\u2019\u201d said Ziegler.Johnson said that Texas Republicans genuinely wanted to address the problems raised by the lawsuit \u2013 even staunch abortion opponents do not want the state\u2019s ban linked to dangerous delays in medical treatment.\u201cThat\u2019s hard for people to politically justify,\u201d she said.Part of the problem seemed to arise from a misunderstanding of what constitutes an abortion. If a doctor terminates an ectopic pregnancy, some Republicans did not consider that an abortion.\u201cThere is a political terminology on the word \u2018abortion\u2019 that\u2019s different from the medical definition,\u201d she said.Johnson did not put the word \u201cabortion\u201d in HB 3058 in a bid for Republican votes, and her strategy seemed to succeed. In May, the Texas legislature overwhelmingly voted in favor of the bill.Dr Katie McHugh, an Indiana OB-GYN and board member of the group Physicians for Reproductive Health, is skeptical of Republican motivations for supporting HB 3058.\u201cThey are just now getting around to the treatment of ectopic pregnancies, more than two years after the first big restrictions went into effect?\u201d McHugh said.She added that Republicans have long known about the dire medical consequences of sweeping abortion restrictions.Before the US supreme court struck down Roe v Wade last year, a study of Texas\u2019s existing abortion restrictions found that the \u201cbounty hunter\u201d law left doctors afraid to care for patients whose water broke too early. The pregnant patients needed to be \u201cat death\u2019s door\u201d to receive pregnancy termination under the law.In a June interview with the National Review, Hughes brushed off the suggestion that Texas\u2019s abortion restrictions are unclear.\u201cBut because some doctors and hospitals were not following the law,\u201d Hughes told the publication, \u201cwe wanted to remove any doubt and remove any excuse for not giving the care that the moms need in these cases.\u201dTexas doctors accused of violating the state\u2019s abortion law face up to $100,000 in fines or even life in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tennessee previously had one of the harshest anti-abortion laws in the country, one that did not make explicit exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person.But Tennessee Republicans grew worried in February, when the Idaho supreme court temporarily blocked that state\u2019s abortion ban. Tennessee\u2019s attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, and Republican house speaker, Cameron Sexton, raised concerns that a similar legal challenge could threaten the future of Tennessee\u2019s ban.Sexton urged state lawmakers to add exceptions to the Tennessee law banning abortion at conception.The next month, Tennessee\u2019s governor, Bill Lee, an avowed abortion opponent, signed a bill allowing doctors to offer the procedure when patients have an ectopic or molar pregnancy.The Tennessee exceptions law is so narrowly tailored that it won the support of staunch abortion opponents.In an April statement, Tennessee Right to Life praised the final version of the exceptions bill, saying it will \u201cnot allow for more unborn children to be aborted in our state\u201d.Both the Texas and Tennessee laws are extremely limited in scope: ectopic pregnancies represent a small fraction of the medical emergencies that might require a doctor to terminate a pregnancy.Still, Johnson welcomes any Republican concessions on abortion access.The doctors in her district said the \u201cbulk of complications\u201d they were struggling to treat involved a patient\u2019s water breaking too early, one of two medical conditions addressed by the new Texas law.She added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we need to do.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionTexasGreg AbbottHealthRoe v WadeUS politicsTennesseenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
