Stock images that are most available often focus on poverty and need and reinforce gender stereotypes. We set out to create a global collection of images that more accurately depicts women as they are: in decision-making roles, working to earn income, providing and accessing reproductive health information and services, and caring for themselves and their families.\nToday, we are delighted to launch a new Images of Empowerment stock photography website that offers nearly 2,000 high-quality images of women in Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United States. The images are free of charge for nonprofits to use, and available for licensing to Getty Images\u2019 global customer base of creative agencies, news organizations, and editorial clients. We hope you\u2019ll browse the collection, view the images, and read the captions that tell you more about the individuals and organizations who opened their doors to us. Please share and use the images as you celebrate International Women\u2019s Day on March 8\u00a0 and the global push for gender equality and women\u2019s rights.\u00a0\nWhy was it created?\nImages of Empowerment was created in 2015 with a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation\u2019s Global Development and Population Program. Former Hewlett Foundation Program Officers Helena Choi and Margot Fahnestock were inspired by the award-winning partnership between Getty Images and LeanIn.Org to change women\u2019s portrayal in stock photos. Choi and Fahnestock managed Hewlett\u2019s grants to expand women\u2019s opportunities to earn an income and decide whether and when to have a family. They approached Getty Images to create a new partnership to tell the important story of women\u2019s lives in sub-Saharan Africa through powerful, positive images.\n\u201cThese high-quality images will help nonprofits working on women\u2019s issues to tell their story more effectively,\u201d said Choi when the collection was launched. \u201cAnd they will educate and inspire people who are accustomed to only seeing the challenges facing women in Africa.\u201d\u00a0 The first set of photographs were taken in Kenya, Senegal, and Uganda and show women accessing reproductive health information and services. A second set of photographs was created in 2017 with Getty Images and the nonprofit organization Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO). They focus on women\u2019s informal work \u2014 cleaning homes, collecting recyclables, sewing garments, and selling goods in local markets \u2014 in Colombia, Ghana, India, Peru, South Africa, and Thailand. The photographs were taken by Getty Images\u2019 photographers Jonathan Torgovnik, Paula Bronstein, and Juan Arredondo.\nBeginning in 2018, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation added hundreds of photographs to the collection from Bihar, India and from Louisiana and Mississippi in the United States, taken by documentary photographers Nina Robinson and Paula Bronstein in partnership with Getty Images. The organizations and individuals featured in these collections are at the nexus of quality reproductive health information and services, including family planning, contraceptive choices, safe abortion care, and sexual health education for women and youth.\n\u201cThese are images of strong, real women and girls, who are challenging society\u2019s perception of them and their abilities,\u201d said Tamara Kreinin, Director of Population and Reproductive Health at the Packard Foundation. \u201cThese photos show the world that women and girls from India to the U.S. are defining their own destiny, empowered to make choices that are best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s new?\nThe newest set of images is from Rwanda and shows organizations supported by the Packard Foundation that are working to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health information and services reach all who need them. The collection highlights the essential role of young people in defining, designing, and advocating for quality sexual and reproductive health information and services that meet their specific needs. It also captures the role of service providers and the importance of the client-provider relationship in ensuring that women and families receive accurate, unbiased information \u2014 as well as a variety of contraceptive method choices \u2014 in a private setting.\nThanks to creative digital design firm Visceral, Images of Empowerment also has a new website that functions much more effectively as a searchable and usable stock photography site. It allows users to search and download pictures from the collections by keyword, country, and whether the images depict women\u2019s work or reproductive health information and services. Each photo has detailed captions that identify the individuals in the pictures and provides additional context. The website has new tools to help share the images on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media. There are also videos that accompany each collection and share the photographers\u2019 experiences.\nWhat do the rest of the photographs show?\nThe images show the connection between women\u2019s economic opportunities and reproductive health in 11 countries around the world: Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United States. They show women as active participants in their communities, accessing and providing quality reproductive health information and services, and advocating for better working conditions.\nSeveral nonprofit organizations that receive grants from the Hewlett Foundation and the Packard Foundation are in the photographs. The most recent collections include the Health Development Initiative, Imbuto Foundation, Kasha, Medical Students for Choice, Youth Development Labs, Teen Health Mississippi, and Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO).\u00a0\u00a0\nHow can you use the photographs?\nAll photographs are available \u2014 free of charge \u2014 to non-commercial users thanks to Creative Commons licensing (CC-BY-NC 4.0). The photos are also available for licensing to Getty Images\u2019 global customer base of creative agencies, businesses, news organizations, and other editorial clients.\nSince the collection launched in 2015, we\u2019ve seen the images used by dozens of nonprofits, at major international conferences like Women Deliver, and by media including the New York Times, Vox, and the Guardian. We\u2019re excited that the new site makes it easier to find and use the images. And now there is a way you can tell us how you are using them directly: share your story here.\u00a0\n****\nWe are enormously grateful to Kristen Carriker at the Hewlett Foundation and Amanda Guslani and Sara Elkin at the Packard Foundation for helping these images reach a global audience so nonprofits working to advance women\u2019s rights and opportunities around the world can use them. Thanks, too, to all of our partners at Getty Images, Creative Commons, the nonprofit organizations whose work is shown in the pictures, and above all, to the individuals who agreed to be photographed and share their stories.\nWe hope you will take a moment to look through the photographs, learn about the people and the work they show, and use the images in your own efforts to tell the story of individual women, our common experiences, and our collective push to create a more gender equal world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\nGender Equity and Governance\n\n\nWomen's Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE STORIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gender Equity and Governance      \n\nAnnonce de notre nouvelle strat\u00e9gie d\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques fond\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es probantes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gender Equity and Governance      \n\nAnnouncing our new Evidence-Informed Policymaking strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gender Equity and Governance      \n\nLa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de la strat\u00e9gie de Gouvernance Inclusive : Questions et r\u00e9ponses avec Diakhoumba Gassama et David Sasaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Search Our Grantmaking\n\n\nBy Program\n\n\n\n        Education\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Environment\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Gender Equity and Governance\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Performing Arts\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        U.S. Democracy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Economy and Society\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Effective Philanthropy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Racial Justice\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        SF Bay Area\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Special Projects\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Keyword\n Search Keyword\n\n\n Search Year\n\nYear\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n2012\n2011\n2010\n2009\n2008\n2007\n2006\n2005\n2004\n2003\n2002\n2001\n2000\n\n\n\n Search Program\n\nProgram\nRacial Justice\nEconomy and Society\nEducation\nPerforming Arts\nEnvironment\nEffective Philanthropy\nGender Equity and Governance\nSF Bay Area\nCyber Initiative: 2014 - 2023\nSpecial Projects\nU.S. Democracy\n\n\nSearch Grants\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsroom\nCareers\nSitemap\nContact\nGrantee Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Sign Up For Email Updates \n\nConnect With Us\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n \u00a9 2024 William and Flora Hewlett Foundation Privacy Policy\nTerms and Conditions\nCreative Commons\n \n\n\n\n\n"
