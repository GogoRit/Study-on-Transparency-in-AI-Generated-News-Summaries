Mark E. Brennan, Bishop of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, state Treasurer Riley Moore, Secretary of State Mac Warner and numerous GOP state lawmakers.\nBrennan gave the invocation to the rally and said their movement cannot pit the woman against her child.\nMark Brennan\n\u201cWe have to support both. That doesn\u2019t mean supporting the killing of the child, that wouldn\u2019t be pro-child. It means pro-woman, pro-mother and providing the kind of help that may persuade a woman for pursuing an abortion,\u201d Brennan said to MetroNews.\nBrennan also advocated that those in the pro-life movement need\u00a0 not \u201cwrite off those who have had abortions.\u201d He spoke on his experience with Project Rachel, a ministry with those men and women involved in an abortion. He said there must be help given to women who need help with childcare.\n\u201cWe have to show that we truly regard them as fellow human beings made in God\u2019s image and likeness, and care for them as well,\u201d Brennan said.\nWest Virginians for Life members joined Brennan in the state House of Delegates and state Senate galleries when sessions began.\nTheir rally focused on two pieces of legislation currently in the statehouse including The Unborn Child with Down Syndrome Protection and Education Act (SB468/HB4377) and Health Care Decisions Act Amendments (SB470).\nWanda Franz, president of West Virginians for Life told MetroNews her organization supports SB468. The piece of legislation, sponsored by Senator Patricia Rucker (R-Jefferson), is currently in the Senate Health and Human Resources Committee.\n\u201cThe point is to put into law something that is against these eugenic abortions that are trying to eliminate the disease by eliminating the person who has the disease,\u201d Franz said.\nFranz said SB470 would correct sections of the WV Code, Sections 16-30-3 and 16-30-4, that have living will provisions and provide better-informed consent for people signing living wills.\nSigns that supported abortion circled the Upper Rotunda as pro-abortion supporters circled the rally from a level above.\nMargaret Chapman Pomponio, the CEO of West Virginia Free, was part of the demonstration in the Upper Rotunda and told MetroNews people should have access to unbiased healthcare in West Virginia.\nMargaret Chapman Pomponio\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling on legislators to reject all of these abortion restrictions. West Virginia has already gone far enough and we need to protect basic healthcare and abortion is part of that,\u201d Pomponio said.\nJust one day into the 2022 regular legislative session, state lawmakers started moving a bill that would ban abortions at 15 weeks. The 15-week ban, HB 4004, passed the House Health Committee and is currently in the House Judiciary Committee.\nPomponio further called it an \u201cextreme piece of legislation in this Capitol.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see the legislature focus on increasing access to healthcare and education rather than these regressive attempts to make abortion illegal and out of reach for West Virginians,\u201d she said.\nEmily Womeldorff, the Constituency Engagement Special for Planned Parenthood held a sign with the Women\u2019s Health Center that said \u201cNo Abortion Bans.\u201d\nShe shared the same feelings as Pompino on recent legislation moving through the dome. Womeldorff noted that since 2014, there have been abortion bans introduced every year.\n\u201cWe are not in the minority in our feelings. Enough is enough with the abortion bans that are medically unnecessary and restrict access for people in the state who need a healthcare service,\u201d Womeldorff said.\nWomeldorff was vocal in support of HB 4382: Relating to preserving a patient\u2019s right to abortion. Monongalia County Delegates Danielle Walker and Evan Hansen introduced the legislation on Jan. 29.\n\u201cIt repeals numerous provisions in state code that restrict a patient\u2019s right to abortion,\u201d Hansen said during the presser on Jan. 29. \u201cSo, we would be operating through what\u2019s allowed through Roe v. Wade.\u201d\nThe Roe v. Wade court decision said women have the right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. MetroNews previously reported that current West Virginia law requires a woman to receive counseling, a 24-hour wait and parental notification. The procedure cannot be performed after 20 weeks and can only be funded with public money under extreme circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMore News\n\nNews\n\n\nWood County becomes more aggressive in investigating sex crimes involving children\nThe latest case involved a Parkersburg middle school basketball coach who was charged last week.\nBy Carrie Hodousek\nMarch 19, 2024 - 12:41 pm\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nHuggins says he didn't drink every day\nFormer Mountaineer coach tells KDKA he was a social drinker. \nBy Jeff Jenkins\nMarch 19, 2024 - 12:01 pm\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nTrooper's wife thanks community for support after losing Nicholas County home in fire\nThe home of state Police Trooper Rick Wiseman and his wife Brittany Wiseman burned down on March 12.\nBy Carrie Hodousek\nMarch 19, 2024 - 11:48 am\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nRetired trooper named interim Monroe County sheriff\nMichael Miller chosen by Monroe County Commission. \nBy Jeff Jenkins\nMarch 19, 2024 - 11:47 am\n\n\n\n\n\n  View AllHoppy's CommentaryMarch 19, 2024Manchin v.
