Globally, COVID-19 continues to disrupt efforts to end harmful practices including averting GBV,\u201d said Ms Kadrykulova.\n\u201cIn Zimbabwe working with various partners and under the leadership of the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprise Development (MOWCSMED), UNFPA has identified current challenges within the COVID-19 context and tailored appropriate interventions.\u201d\n\n\n\nUNFPA is working with the MOWCSMED to ensure GBV services are among essential services and for survivors of GBV to access free services especially during Covid -19 lockdown.\nMinister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprise Development, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni said the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting everyone hence there is need for a holistic approach to support the vulnerable groups.\n\u201cWhile the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting everyone, everywhere, but the impact is not the same as the pandemic is deepening existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, particularly for women and girls,\u201d she said.\nUNFPA Executive Director, Dr Natalia Kanem, said \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 will likely hamper global efforts to achieve the three \u2018zeros\u2019 at the heart of our work at UNFPA \u2013 zero unmet need for contraception, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls \u2013 by 2030.\u00a0 UNFPA projects that the pandemic will cut global progress towards ending gender-based violence within this decade by at least one third.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn light of the impact of COVID-19, UNFPA has also reprogrammed its work to support continuity of lifesaving maternal health interventions.\nUNFPA is supporting the Ministry of Health and Child Care with infection prevention and control sundries, personal protective equipment for health workers, equipment and sundries to support emergency obstetric and neonatal care, water and sanitations facilities in the maternal wards.\n\u201cSexual and reproductive health care is a right, and like pregnancies and childbirth, human rights don\u2019t stop for pandemics. Together, let\u2019s put the brakes on COVID-19 and safeguard the health and rights of women and girls \u2013 now,\u201d she said.\nIn Zimbabwe, GBV and harmful practices are undoing a lot of gains made in development, and the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 8, 2020\n\n\nPfizer CEO: We\u2019ll Know By October Whether Covid-19 Vaccine Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n August 8, 2020\n\n\nPfizer CEO: We\u2019ll Know By October Whether Covid-19 Vaccine Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCORONA VIRUS WATCH\n\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\n\nMasks no longer mandatory\n\n\n\n\nBulawayo Bureau The Government has said it is no longer mandatory to wear face masks indoors, but highly recommended, a pronouncement that has seen education authorities saying pupils must continue to wear them.
