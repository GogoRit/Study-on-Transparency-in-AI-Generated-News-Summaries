Chris Sununu vetoed House Bill 1625, which would have repealed a law allowing abortion clinics to keep the public up to 25 feet from their entrances. (Dana Wormald | New Hampshire Bulletin)\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminating a pregnancy after 24 weeks for a fetus that cannot survive on its own was a crime last week that could have sent a physician to prison for 7 years and fined them up to $100,000. It no longer is.\nLate Friday afternoon, Gov. Chris Sununu announced via a press release that he had signed 29 bills into law and vetoed four. Among the 29 signed was House Bill 1609, adding a fatal fetal anomaly exception to the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban. It took effect Friday.\u00a0\nSununu vetoed House Bill 1625, which would repeal a law allowing abortion clinics to keep the public up to 25 feet from their entrances. No clinic has used the \u201cpatient safety zone\u201d law. But they told lawmakers they wanted to retain the option as anti-abortion protestors have become increasingly hostile and aggressive.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the eight years since this law was originally enacted, we know of no instance where an individual or group has been harmed by it,\u201d Sununu wrote in his veto message. \u201cAs a result, I am not looking to make any changes at this time.\u201d\nOther bills failed this year that would have added exceptions for rape and incest and dropped the criminal and civil penalties against physicians who violate the law.\nThe governor\u2019s action on both bills was expected: He had urged lawmakers to add the fatal fetal anomaly exception and told the Bulletin in early May he would veto the repeal of the patient safety zone if HB 1625 reached his desk.\nBut it was uncertain whether legislation adding the fatal fetal anomaly exception would make it to Sununu.\u00a0\nThe Senate rejected the measure in February and most House Republicans fought it until late March, when Rep. Jess Edwards, an Auburn Republican, urged his caucus to support it. In doing so, Edwards cited the stories from women who testified about making the \u201cimpossible decision\u201d to terminate late in their pregnancies after getting a fatal fetal diagnosis.\u00a0\nKayla Montgomery, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund, issued a tempered response to the passage of HB 1625.\n\u201cTo be clear \u2013 while this law restores options for families in complex circumstances, it does not expand access to abortion care. It fixes a problem created by anti-abortion lawmakers,\u201d she said in a statement.\u00a0\n\u201cReal Granite Staters were harmed by the Legislature and governor\u2019s refusal to listen to medical providers and patients last year and insistence on pushing through this abortion ban in the state budget process. The public outcry since this cruel abortion ban took effect has been deafening and all lawmakers should be listening as they consider future efforts to restrict access to abortion care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXSununu signs fatal fetal anomaly bill, rejects repeal of abortion clinic buffer zones\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin May 31, 2022\nSununu signs fatal fetal anomaly bill, rejects repeal of abortion clinic buffer zones\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin May 31, 2022\n Terminating a pregnancy after 24 weeks for a fetus that cannot survive on its own was a crime last week that could have sent a physician to prison for 7 years and fined them up to $100,000.
