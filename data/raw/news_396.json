The court said it was unconstitutional to terminate a pregnancy due to fetal congenital defects, effectively banning almost all abortions.Czarek Sokolowski/APWARSAW -- \u201cPoland is an example for Europe and the world\u201d, chanted the hundreds of pro-life activists gathered outside the Constitutional Court in Warsaw last Thursday. Their outburst of enthusiasm came after the court had ruled to almost completely ban abortions.But Tuesday, as yesterday, streets in large cities and small towns across Poland are blocked by not hundreds, but tens of thousands, mostly women, who are outraged by that restrictive court ruling.Today is the sixth day women came out with placards reading \u201cMy body\u2019s not an incubator\u201d, \u201cThis is war,\u201d and Poles are beginning to take this protest further, beyond the anti-abortion law -- to vent their anger at their rulers. Marta Lempart, one of the demos\u2019 leaders says, \"Now it\u2019s not about abortion alone, it\u2019s about freedom in general and abortion has become a symbol of it.\u201dMany in Poland are referring to the swelling protests as the Women\u2019s Revolution. Poland has not seen such a manifestation of nationwide solidarity in years. During Monday's protest, taxi drivers stopped their cabs and blocked road junctions, the so-called \u2018ultras\u2019 -- soccer fans who take pride in being macho stadium hooligans -- marched with the women. The town of Krakow was a scene of rare defiance -- riot police, there to contain the demo, changed sides and took off their helmets, dropped their shields and marched alongside the protesting women.It is common knowledge in Poland that it\u2019s not only the conservative, right-wing government that is behind the ban, but particularly bishops of the influential Catholic Church. On Sunday demonstrators took their anger to the churches across the country and disrupted services.MORE: The 22-year-old helping to lead Belarus' protests from behind a screen in PolandAngered women's rights activists and their supporters confront police and a far-right group on the fifth day of their nationwide protests against a recent court ruling that tightened Poland's restrictive abortion law, in Warsaw, Poland, on Monday, Oct. 26, 2020. The court said it was unconstitutional to terminate a pregnancy due to fetal congenital defects, effectively banning almost all abortions.Czarek Sokolowski/APMORE: UN climate conference meets in coal-focused PolandLaws imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 ban public gatherings of more than 10 people and provide authorities with a justifiable excuse to send in police to break up the swelling demos.Several dozen people have been detained and fined, but at least for now, police actions have been restrained. Helmeted, shield-wielding riot police control the demos, but seem to be there mostly to intimidate.Up until last Thursday, Poland\u2019s abortion law was a compromise that worked. Pro-abortionists saw it as too restrictive, pro-lifers considered it to be too liberal, but both accepted it ever since the law was passed in 1993.Abortion was allowed only if the pregnancy was a result of a criminal act, when pregnancy posed a serious threat to a pregnant woman\u2019s health or life, or when there was high probability of a serious and irreversible fetal malformation or an incurable lethal disease.Now the Polish Constitutional Court decided that terminating a pregnancy in case of serious fetal abnormalities was unconstitutional and violated an article that guarantees the right to life.The Polish government seems shocked by the scale of the protests and is visibly at a loss of how to deal with the unrest. Poland\u2019s rulers realize that these large-scale demos are not a one-off, localized protest -- they encompass the entire country and are growing. The ban on abortion has become a unifying factor bringing together people who have otherwise been on opposite extremes of the political spectrum.What is most worrying to the ruling authoritarian Law and Justice party is that the new abortion law has become only one of the reasons for protesters to take to the streets.Every day more people are joining in, furious how the government is drifting away from European Union values, how it mishandled preparations for the second wave of COVID-19, angry at how the ruling party is unashamedly taking over the judiciary and at how it imposes its conservative values on schools. The ripple effect stretched out far beyond abortion -- it even encouraged dissatisfied farmers to block streets with their tractors.With protests getting out of control, the Polish government has a dilemma of whether to backtrack and lose support of its hard-line, religious, electorate or to suppress the ongoing protests forcefully.MORE: Nuns in Poland show 'fighting spirit' in boxing video to raise funds for orphanageA protester with a sign of the women's rights campaign joins others on the fifth day of nationwide protests against recent court ruling that tightened Poland's restrictive abortion law, in Warsaw, Poland, on Monday, Oct. 26, 2020. The court said it was unconstitutional to terminate a pregnancy due to fetal congenital defects, effectively banning almost all abortions.Czarek Sokolowski/APMORE: Inspectors Begin Search for Nazi 'Gold Train'For now, it is buying time, evading responsibility by saying that the abortion ban was a decision of the Constitutional Court, an institution independent of the government. That, however, is a risky excuse given that the court was taken over by the ruling party in an undemocratic way.The Catholic Church, which has enormous influence on Poland\u2019s current rulers, issued a statement saying the Catholic Church is not Poland\u2019s lawmaker, so it had no influence on the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling. The court itself claims to have been true to the letter of the constitution, which protects all life as sacred, so it did what it had to.The abortion-spurred unrest of the last six days may result in a shakeup in Poland. The Catholic Church is losing support with numbers of faithful on the decline. Polls indicate that the ruling Law and Justice populists are steadily losing popularity. Their anti-European Union stance, incompetence and mishandling of the pandemic is beginning to be noticed even by their most faithful voters.Magda Bryla, one of the organizers of protests in Warsaw, told ABC News that the women are planning to hold a strike this Wednesday. \u201cWe have asked all women to consider not going to work tomorrow.\u201d Bryla went on to say, \u201cIf anyone can stop this steamroller, this destructive administration, it\u2019s us, women. We feel nationwide support and we would disappoint everyone if we backed off. Our opponents call us barbaric savages worshiping the civilization of death -- and that alone is good enough reason to express our anger. All we are asking for is basic dignity and for human rights to be observed. Tightening the abortion law even further is unacceptable. Women will be afraid to have children, there will be real tragedies.\u201dIn a nationwide address today, Poland\u2019s Prime Minster Mateusz Morawiecki defended the Court\u2019s ruling and appealed to the protesters for \u201ccalm and reason\u201d. But the women, and men who support them, are unlikely to hear his call.Top StoriesJudge rules evidence related to 'Access Hollywood' tape admissible in Trump trialMar 18, 6:35 PMState Medicaid offices target dead people\u2019s homes to recoup their health care costsMar 16, 4:18 PMTrump claims Liz Cheney and Jan. 6 committee should be jailedMar 18, 8:58 PMTrump faces 'insurmountable difficulties' in securing $464M bond in civil fraud caseMar 18, 10:47 AMTimeline of college student's disappearance after night out in Nashville3 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights \u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n\n\n"
