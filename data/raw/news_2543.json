Russo, a Louisiana law that requires abortionists, like doctors at all Louisiana outpatient surgical centers, to maintain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The measure was enacted to ensure that women who experience a medical emergency during an abortion have access to proper care.\nRemarkably, the bill\u2019s fiercest opponent has been the abortion industry, with abortion doctors asking for exemptions from the law\u2019s requirements.\n\u201cAbortion providers shouldn\u2019t be able to erase a law that protects women\u2019s health,\u201d says Penny Nance, CEO and president of CWA. \u201cThere is no reason women seeking abortions should be treated with lower standards of medical care than other out-patient surgery centers. That\u2019s why I, and hundreds of thousands of women I represent, stand in support of the women of Louisiana.\u201d\nSancha Smith, a member of CWA of Louisiana, says being pro-life necessarily extends to protecting the life of a woman who chooses to have an abortion. \u201cWe cannot say all life is important and ignore the threat posed to women by an abortion procedure. I do not understand how the pro-choice lobby can claim to stand for women\u2019s health while working for this bill to be overturned.\u201d\nThe \u201cProtect Women \u2013 Protect Life\u201d pre-rally event will kick off at 9:00 a.m. Wednesday with a time for women to share their stories. The rally will formally begin at 9:30 a.m. and will end at 11:30 a.m.\nFor more information, please visit: https://www.protectwomenprotectlife.org/\nMedia: email press@thekcompany.co or tdelancey@cwfa.org or call 202.810.5530 or 202.527.3434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweets by CWforA  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT \n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE DO\nCAREERS\nCWA INTERNSHIPS\nCONTACT CWA\n \n\nWHAT WE DO\nCAREERS\nCWA INTERNSHIPS\nCONTACT CWA\n \n\n\n\n\nTRENDING ISSUES \n\n\n\n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\nSO YOU THINK YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?\nSTANDING WITH FEMALE ATHLETES\nPROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN\n \n\nSTAND WITH ISRAEL\nSO YOU THINK YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?\nSTANDING WITH FEMALE ATHLETES\nPROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES    \n\n\n\n\nELECTION RESOURCES\nCWA ACADEMY FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES\nCWA PUBLICATIONS\nSTORE\n \n\nELECTION RESOURCES\nCWA ACADEMY FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES\nCWA PUBLICATIONS\nSTORE\n \n\n\n\n\nMEDIA \n\n\n\n\nPenny Nance\nPRESS RELEASES\nPODCASTS\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\n \n\nPenny Nance\nPRESS RELEASES\nPODCASTS\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\n \n\n\n\n\nGRASSROOTS ENGAGEMENT \n\n\n\n\nCONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA\nWOMEN FOR AMERICA INFLUENCERS\nYOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA\n \n\nCONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA\nWOMEN FOR AMERICA INFLUENCERS\nYOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDONATE \n\n\n\n\nDONATE TODAY\nDEBORAH\u2019S ARMY\nLEGACY GIVING\n \n\nDONATE TODAY\nDEBORAH\u2019S ARMY\nLEGACY GIVING\n \n\n\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 CWALAC.
