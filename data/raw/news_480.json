But none of the cities in the movement \u2014 which started in the East Texas town of Waskom in 2019 \u2014 has been as big as Lubbock and none of them have been home to an abortion provider.\nIt\u2019s unclear when the ordinance will go into effect, and if it will be challenged in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe push to declare Lubbock a \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d began in the last two years and was galvanized by the arrival of a Planned Parenthood clinic in 2020. Anti-abortion activists gathered enough signatures to bring the ordinance to the City Council \u2014 where it was voted down for conflicting with state law and Supreme Court rulings \u2014 and to then put it to a citywide vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Josh Upchurch, Shelby Martin and Hailee Roberts campaign for Proposition A at the corner of Quaker Avenue and 82nd Street on Saturday.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nArdent supporters of the measure, who liken abortion to murder, say it reflects the views held by many in conservative Lubbock. They believe the ordinance would stand up in court and say they have an attorney who will defend the city free of charge if it is challenged.\nBut the strategy of bringing the abortion fight to the local level has divided even staunch anti-abortion activists, and Texas towns like Omaha and Mineral Wells have voted down similar ordinances or walked them back under advice from city attorneys.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which previously sued seven East Texas towns that passed similar ordinances, has said they were watching the vote closely and hinted at a lawsuit in a statement Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrucilla Tigner, a policy and advocacy strategist with the organization, said the \u201cACLU has a long history of challenging unconstitutional abortion bans and will continue to fight to protect the fundamental rights of the people of Lubbock.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood, which has provided birth control and other health services in Lubbock since last fall, said \u201cwe are committed to expanding access to abortion and will provide abortion services when possible in Lubbock.\u201d\n\u201cWe want Lubbock residents to know: Our doors are open and we will continue to advocate for our patients, no matter what,\u201d said Sarah Wheat, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.\nThe Lubbock ordinance outlaws abortions within the city, and allows family members of a person who has an abortion to sue the provider and anyone who assists someone getting an abortion, like by driving them to a clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere isn\u2019t an exception for women pregnant as a result of rape or incest.\nThe ordinance would not be enforced by the government unless the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, or made other changes to abortion laws.\nIt instead relies on private citizens filing lawsuits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Paul Stell calls people forward before announcing Proposition A passed during a watch party in Trinity Church on Saturday in Lubbock.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nRichard D. Rosen, a constitutional law professor at Texas Tech University, expects someone would sue Planned Parenthood and the legal fight would go from there.\n\u201cAs long as Roe is good law I think these suits will ultimately fail, but it [could make] abortion providers ... expend money for attorneys fees and it takes time,\u201d he said.\nThe election\u2019s results were cheered by conservative state lawmakers and other anti-abortion activists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday is a victory for life and proof that the silent majority will still stand up for its Christian conservative values,\u201d state Rep. Dustin Burrows, a Lubbock Republican, said in a statement Saturday.\nMark Lee Dickson, an East Texas pastor behind the \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d movement, helped push the ordinance in Lubbock and said he was \u201cgrateful that the voters of Lubbock voted so overwhelmingly to outlaw abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sofia Bell talks with a potential voter about voting against Proposition A on the Texas Tech University campus.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood and its supporters also worked hard to get their supporters to the polls, and we congratulate them on their efforts,\u201d he said Saturday night. \u201cNow that the voters have spoken, we expect Planned Parenthood to respect the outcome of this election and cease providing abortions at its Lubbock clinic.\u201d\nOpponents of the ordinance said it could leave people wanting to terminate their pregnancies \u2014 sometimes because of traumatic circumstances, like rape or incest \u2014 with limited options.\nWithout the recently opened Planned Parenthood location, the closest abortion clinics are a five-and-a-half hour drive away, said Marilyn Mathew, co-founder of a \u201cMedical Students for Choice\u201d group at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. That could prove to be a cost-prohibitive journey for people needing to stay overnight to comply with state abortion regulations, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about how this is going to play out in the long run,\u201d she said.\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood and Texas Tech University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
