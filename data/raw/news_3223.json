A Pro-Life OBGYN Caring for Women and Babies.Jul 21, 2022In the NewsBlogLives Worth LivingMeet Christina Francis, MD.\u00a0Dr. Francis is a board-certified OB/GYN in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She also sits on the board of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u00a0She\u2019s dedicated her life to human rights \u2013 specifically the right to life.\u00a0Dr. Francis has spent a lot of time in Romania, Burma, and Kenya caring for orphaned children. She also worked for three years providing health care to women as the only OB/GYN at a mission hospital in rural Kenya.\u00a0Dr. Francis knows the value, dignity, and potential of every life.\u00a0As a doctor treating pregnant women, she cares for two patients at once \u2013 a mother and a baby.\u00a0\u00a0On Tuesday, she testified in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to share her expertise to dispel the fear and misinformation President Joe Biden and the Democrats are spreading to promote abortion for all nine months.\u00a0Dr. Francis made clear: She practices medicine to care for both mother and the baby because both lives are worth living.\u00a0Read Dr. Christina Francis\u2019 testimony in her own words:\u00a0\u201cOur country is currently divided over the issue of abortion, but I do think that there is common ground to be found.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOne thing we should all agree upon is that women deserve excellent healthcare and to be empowered with accurate information to inform that healthcare.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have had nearly unfettered access to abortion in this country over the last 49 years and yet we continue to have one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the developed world, along with the worst preterm birth rate.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI believe that my patients deserve better and it is time for us to look for real solutions to the root causes of these problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs OB/GYN physicians, we care for two patients during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAbortion guarantees the ending of the life of one of our patients \u2013 and can severely threaten the life and health of the other.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cScience is clear that a new, distinct, and living human being comes into existence at the moment of fertilization. Dr. Ward Kischer, the author of one of my medical school textbooks, said this: \u2018Every human embryologist in the world knows that the life of the new individual human being begins at fertilization\u2026It is a scientific fact.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAbortive procedures are more than detrimental to the life of the pre-born child, though - they are also dangerous to the mother both in the short and long-term.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPregnancy is not a disease and elective abortion is not healthcare.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDespite what proponents of abortion may claim, elective abortion carries no maternal benefit and ends the life of a separate human being.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs demonstrated by hundreds of studies over nearly five decades, abortive procedures carry several deleterious effects for women, including the risk of preterm birth and mental health problems. These problems have a statistically greater impact on minority populations.\u00a0\u201cThe effects of induced abortions impact women throughout their lifespan, and as board-certified physicians, we believe that our patients\u2019 health will be improved if they receive actual healthcare - not the devastation and false promises of abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn fact, elective abortion exists to solve a social problem, not a medical one.\u00a0\u201cSince the Dobbs decision overturned Roe and Casey, there have been unsubstantiated claims stating that restricting abortion will lead to women dying and that by increasing access to abortion we can decrease maternal mortality rates. These statements, meant to instill fear in women and medical professionals, are baseless for a number of reasons.\u201d\u00a0[\u2026]\u00a0\u201cFalse claims abound that state abortion restrictions will prevent physicians from being able to treat ectopic pregnancies, miscarriage, and other life-threatening complications in pregnancy (such as an intrauterine infection). This is blatantly absurd, as not a single state law restricting abortion prevents treating these conditions.\u201d\u00a0Dr. Francis finished her statement with hope for a post-Roe America, stating:\u00a0\u201cHealthcare for women and their children in a post-Roe America looks bright.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStates can enact commonsense protections for women seeking abortions to ensure that if abortion remains legal in that state, unsafe practices will not be tolerated.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe now have a chance for individual states to hear from the physicians that practice there about how we can, instead, provide true healthcare for all of our patients \u2013 not a band-aid for social issues that need to be addressed outside of the medical profession.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe also face the distinct possibility of restoring the integrity of the physician-patient relationship by restoring the trust that patients should have that their physician is recommending what is best for their health and the health of their child based on the most current medical evidence and informed by the ethical principles that have guided the practice of medicine for millennia.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOur patients are empowered when they are given accurate information, fully informed consent, and real healthcare solutions rather than a political narrative.\u201d\u00a0Helpful Resources: CLICK HERE\u00a0to meet Chloe.
