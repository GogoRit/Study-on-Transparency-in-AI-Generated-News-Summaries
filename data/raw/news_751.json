Still, when she saw the two pink lines, she was shocked.\u00a0\nShe was 16. She didn\u2019t know what to do or what would happen with her parents, whom she describes as conservative.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God. This is it. I\u2019m not going to have a place to live. They\u2019re going to kick me out,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\u00a0\nTiff, whose full name has been withheld to protect her privacy, wanted an abortion. She went to a gynecologist, who told her she was five weeks and five days pregnant. Since September 1, 2021, Texas law has banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\nHer parents didn\u2019t approve of abortion as an option. And because she is a minor, state law required that they would have to sign off on any abortion, unless she could get a state judge to deem her mature enough to decide for herself \u2014 a process that could take weeks.\nWith all of those factors at play, it was all but impossible to get an abortion in Texas. Tiff, who lives just outside of Houston, could theoretically have tried to go out of state \u2014 but getting the funds to do that would\u2019ve required convincing her parents. She also considered trying to find abortion pills online. But if none of those options worked, she would give birth shortly after her 17th birthday \u2014 still a child herself, living at home.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

The state\u2019s law, known as Senate Bill 8, was without precedent. Rather than criminal punishment, it relied on civil litigation \u2014 anyone who \u201caided or abetted\u201d an illegal abortion could be sued for $10,000. That novel structure allowed it to stay in effect even with Roe v. Wade in place.\u00a0\nSix weeks is an incredibly short window: Because of how pregnancies are dated \u2014 people learn they have conceived at the first missed menstrual period, at which point they are already technically four weeks pregnant \u2014 the law gave people two weeks at the most to get a legal abortion in the state of Texas.\nSB 8 offered a first glimpse into a world without Roe, which for nearly five decades protected the federal right to an abortion. It also provided an early clue that the current Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas abortion ban, might be prepared to overturn the 1973 case. So this summer, when five of the court\u2019s justices struck down Roe \u2014 giving states the power to directly and completely outlaw abortion \u2014 health care providers, policy researchers and legal experts across the country already had a sense for just how seismic the impact would be. In Texas, they had already seen a trial run.\u00a0\nIn the past year, the law\u2019s impact has been expansive. Clinics in nearby states \u2014\u00a0Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado and Louisiana \u2014 reported a surge in new patients traveling from Texas. Wait times for an abortion ballooned, jumping from a few days to as long as four weeks. The law even inspired copycat legislation in other states, including a law in Oklahoma that took Texas\u2019 punitive structure and applied it to virtually all abortions. That ban took effect in May, banning abortion in yet another state two months before Roe would be overturned.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        The midterms\u2019 big issues  \u2014 abortion and the economy \u2014 are supercharged in Nevada\u2019s Senate race\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the last full year before SB 8 took effect, Texas recorded about 55,000 abortions performed in the state \u2014 the third most in the country, behind only Florida and New York. In 2021, the state recorded closer to 50,000, and the number of abortions performed in September, October, November and December \u2014 after the law took effect \u2014 fell by about half compared to the previous months in the year. Data from the first three months of 2022, the latest available, shows the number of abortions never picked up; each month, about half as many abortions were performed in state compared to the same timespan a year prior. As of March, about 1,400 people in Texas were traveling out of state for an abortion each month. The number of people requesting medication abortion pills from Aid Access, a European medical service, tripled, research suggests.\u00a0\nThe landscape for Texans with unintended pregnancies has completely changed. While some successfully got an abortion in a clinic \u2014 either in their home state, or after traveling hundreds of miles to another \u2014 countless other did not. Some tried to induce abortions at home with medication abortion. Still others carried their unwanted pregnancies to term.\nThe 19th spoke with three Texas women who sought an abortion in this past year. Each has a different story. But all shared similar sentiments: anger, sorrow, frustration and fear.\u00a0\n\u201cI would wish this on absolutely no one,\u201d Tiff said.\n\nAfter learning she was pregnant, Tiff tried for months to find an abortion. But she worried that leaving the state for a procedure could open her up to prosecution when she came home. (It would not.) Her parents\u2019 disapproval made it even harder to consider leaving the state for an abortion.\nTiff looked online for any website that might help her find medication abortion pills. She posted on Reddit, asking for advice. One of her friends gave her mugwort, an herb commonly used by people trying to induce abortions but that evidence suggests is ineffective. She may have tried other herbs, too, she said, but those months are such a blur that it\u2019s hard to remember.\u00a0\nAt five months pregnant, Tiff was hospitalized due to concerns about her mental health brought on, she said, by the stress of her pregnancy. It was only then that the reality set in. She was pregnant. There was no way she was getting an abortion. And in a few months, she would have a child.\nOn August 11, Tiff, 17, gave birth to a son. Her parents are supportive. Her ex-boyfriend is not. Even now, with a weeks-old baby boy, it\u2019s hard for Tiff to fathom what she has been through.\nShe loves her baby. \u201cBut I still ideally would have had that abortion,\u201d she said.\nMinors like Tiff have faced a particularly onerous burden. In Texas, people younger than 18 were required to obtain parental consent before they could get an abortion. If their parents were unwilling to provide that, the minor could appeal to a judge in a process known as \u201cjudicial bypass\u201d to argue that they were mature enough to get the procedure.\nThat process could take days or even weeks depending on where in the state someone lived and how quickly the court moved, said Irma Garcia, the client services manager for Jane\u2019s Due Process, a Texas advocacy group that helps minors who are seeking abortions. Those delays could mean missing the six-week window. Unless their parents offered consent, people younger than 18 were typically unable to get approved for an abortion under the Texas law, Garcia said.\u00a0\nAnd for most, traveling out of state \u2014 neighboring New Mexico, for instance, does not require parental notification or consent for minors to get an abortion \u2014 wasn\u2019t viable, either. Teens were less likely to have the money, resources and privacy to take multi-day trips without their parents or caretakers knowing.\u00a0\n\u201cMany minors cannot safely get out of the house and maintain confidentiality,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThis was a full abortion ban for many youth in Texas.\u201d\nThings are only more difficult now. Since June 24, when Roe was overturned, Texas has begun enforcing a law banning virtually all abortions. Clinics have closed their doors, with some making plans to relocate to neighboring states. Texas\u2019 abortion funds \u2014 nonprofit organizations that help people pay for abortions \u2014 have stopped covering those costs. And many of the states people in Texas once turned to \u2014 Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 have banned abortions in most circumstances.\n\u201cThe last year was certainly incredibly difficult for abortion providers, for people needing abortions, for the people who were supporting them,\u201d said Kari White, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the lead investigator of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, which has studied the impact of Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban. \u201cThe circumstances are just far poorer now with no in-state abortion being available, and many out-of-state options being shut off, and financial assistance really being curtailed.\u201d\n(Chanelle Nibbelink for The 19th)\nThose neighboring states were critical, said Kaleigh, a Dallas resident. (Kaleigh has told few people about the abortion and requested her full name be withheld.) The 29-year-old took a pregnancy test this past April after she missed her period twice and battled daily nausea. She\u2019d been putting it off, she said \u2014 she and her boyfriend weren\u2019t ready to be parents. She was scared of what she would see.\nKaleigh knew about the six-week abortion ban. So she opened her computer and searched the internet for \u201cpregnancy clinics.\u201d One kept appearing at the top of her search list. So she made an appointment, and that Tuesday showed up for her sonogram at the Prestonwood Pregnancy Center, a crisis pregnancy center in the Dallas suburb of Richardson. (The center did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\u201cAll they did was just asked me about why I was trying to \u2026 get an abortion. \u2018Do you want to see your baby?\u2019\u201d she recalled.\u00a0\nAfter the sonogram was complete, they showed her pictures, she said, and gave her a critical piece of information: Kaleigh was eight weeks pregnant. She could not get an abortion in Texas.\nKaleigh and her boyfriend were on the same page. They could drive to another state for an abortion \u2014 they had a car, and they had the money. They could work remotely if needed. So she started calling clinics. She tried some in Texas, just in case somehow, they might make an exception. When none could see her, she called the three abortion providers then operating in Louisiana. The earliest appointment she could get wouldn\u2019t be for three weeks.\u00a0\nShe couldn\u2019t bear the idea of being pregnant that long.\nFinally, Kaleigh found something: a clinic in Sunland Park, New Mexico, just a mile from the Texas border city El Paso. The drive was nine hours, and they could see her that Friday. So on Thursday night, she and her boyfriend drove west. The next morning, she got two pills at the clinic: mifepristone to take there and misoprostol to take at home.\u00a0\nThe abortion was a relief, but Kaleigh couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what it took to get it. Ten years ago, at age 19, she\u2019d had an abortion. Then, like in April, she\u2019d found out at eight weeks pregnant.\u00a0\nIn 2012, though, she could legally get an abortion in Texas. Per state law, she still had to make multiple visits to the clinic. The process took about a week in total, but she didn\u2019t have to worry about driving for hours across state lines, potentially navigating morning sickness while in transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt was just so much more difficult to figure out how to safely do this, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a problem 10 years ago. Since the six-week ban, it\u2019s like a totally different place.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like the world hates women,\u201d she added. \u201cHow can we not take it that way?\u201d\n\nSB 8 is technically still on the books. But it\u2019s now no longer the dominant abortion ban in the state.\u00a0\nSince Roe was overturned, the Texas government began enforcing an abortion ban that predates Roe, one originally passed in the 1800s. It prohibits all abortions, with a narrow exception if the abortion is needed to save the pregnant person\u2019s life. This past Thursday, the state\u2019s trigger ban also took effect. That law replaces a near-total abortion ban with one that also makes abortion a felony, punishable with lifetime imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000.\n\u201cI think it is probably more confusing now than it was a year ago,\u201d said White, the UT professor. \u201cThere are essentially no services here. With the exception of New Mexico facilities, and depending on what part of Texas you live in, facility-based abortion services are not nearby.\u201d\nInstead, she said, people seeking abortions may try to induce them on their own, through what is called self-managed abortions. Some may use ineffective mechanisms, like certain herbs or vitamin C supplements. Others may do so through dangerous means, such as inflicting physical trauma on themselves.\u00a0\n(Chanelle Nibbelink for The 19th)\nAbortion providers and reproductive rights advocates are instead trying to help people access mifepristone and misoprostol, the medication abortion pills that people can safely take from their homes. It\u2019s a process that requires knowing someone who can help people safely access authentic, accurately labeled pills.\nMaria, also from Dallas, learned she was pregnant in January. Between her vomiting and abdominal pain, she thought she had a terrible stomach bug until she showed up at the hospital and was given a pregnancy test. (Maria is her middle name; she requested her full name be withheld because her family does not approve of the procedure.)\nMaria, 27, was five weeks along when she found out. The hospital staff congratulated her, but she didn\u2019t want to be pregnant.\u00a0\nTheoretically, she could have made it to an abortion clinic. But her immigration status is tenuous. Would going to a clinic in Texas show up on her record? Could it jeopardize her ability to live in the United States? Her immigration concerns meant she couldn\u2019t travel out of state, either. She viewed self-managing as her only option.\nShe texted a woman she knew, someone who worked in reproductive health advocacy. That person had helped Maria six years ago, when she had her first abortion. They connected her with someone else who was based in Texas and could mail her abortion pills. By the time the pills reached Maria\u2019s house, she was six weeks pregnant.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        The midterms\u2019 big issues  \u2014 abortion and the economy \u2014 are supercharged in Nevada\u2019s Senate race\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the first pills came, they were broken. Maria couldn\u2019t use them. When a second set of pills arrived she was seven weeks pregnant. She had heard stories about medication abortions \u2014 there could be hours of pain, and a good amount of blood. People had told her that if she needed to go to the hospital, she should just tell them she had miscarried; theoretically, no one would know the difference. But Maria was still afraid. What if someone in the hospital suspected she had an abortion? What if she was arrested anyway?\u00a0\n\u201cI was just really freaked out. I was really scared,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nShe took the pills alone in her apartment; the person who had gotten her pregnant didn\u2019t support her getting an abortion, and she didn\u2019t feel able to tell her friends or family. The pain from her abortion lasted two whole days \u2014 at some points, Maria said, \u201cI thought I wanted to die.\u201d Even once the pain abated, her bleeding continued about a month longer. She felt awful, but she couldn\u2019t tell anyone.\n\u201cPeople were like, \u2018You look really pale.\u2019 I knew why I was pale,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m weak, \u2018I haven\u2019t had water or eaten well.\u2019\u201d\nMaria\u2019s body has recovered. But still, she rarely tells people she knows about the abortion. When she has talked about it, it\u2019s because she wants other people with experiences like hers to know that they\u2019re not alone.\nAs she has watched abortion rights erode in Texas, that kind of awareness feels even more critical, she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of girls wanting to have an abortion. And they\u2019re just scared.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: What six-week abortion bans really mean\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: 15-week abortion bans may become law in three states.
