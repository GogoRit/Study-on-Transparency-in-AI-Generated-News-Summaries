Those who violated the law could have faced prison time.\nThe measure \u2014 which never went into effect \u2014 has been tied up in litigation since the Texas Legislature passed it in 2017. It was struck down by a district judge in Austin, who said it substantially burdened a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, and was appealed before the politically conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. The proceedings were stalled pending a Supreme Court case decided this summer.\nJudge James Dennis, writing for the majority, said the law \u201cforces abortion providers to act contrary to their medical judgment and the best interest of their patient\u201d by first stopping the fetus\u2019s heart with procedures that are \u201cunfeasible,\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d and provide \u201cno benefit to the woman.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe requirement could increase the duration of an otherwise one-day dilation and evacuation procedure, potentially burdening low-income women who \u201cmust wait until the second trimester to seek an abortion because of the time needed to obtain funds to pay for the procedure,\u201d he wrote.\nThe law\u2019s \u201cburdens substantially outweigh its benefits,\u201d he wrote. The decision was 2-1, with two Democrat-appointed judges in the majority and Republican-appointed Judge Don Willett dissenting.\nThe state\u2019s lawyers have likened the method of a dilation and evacuation to \u201cdismemberment,\u201d and Attorney General Ken Paxton has called it \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\nAbortion providers who brought the lawsuit say dilation and evacuation is the safest way to end a second-trimester pregnancy and that an effective ban on it would subject women to medically unnecessary and untested procedures. The requirement to stop a fetus\u2019s heart could lead providers to \u201cessentially experiment\u201d on patients, one doctor said in a trial about the law in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolly Duane, an attorney with the nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights, said the alternative to a dilation and evacuation procedure is medical induction \u2014 \u201cessentially giving birth.\u201d\n\u201cLabor induction, just practically speaking, isn\u2019t available in Texas, let alone logistically speaking. Asking a patient to exchange a simple outpatient, 10-minute procedure for hours if not days inpatient in the hospital \u2014 again in the middle of a pandemic \u2014 is unrealistic,\u201d she said in an Aug. 12 interview.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said the procedure is \u201cevidence-based and medically preferred\u201d because it results in the fewest complications for women in the second trimester.\nTuesday\u2019s decision comes after the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted a block on four Arkansas abortion restrictions in August, citing Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion in the recent Supreme Court case June Medical Services v. Russo. While Roberts\u2019 crucial vote in that case awarded a victory to advocates of abortion access then, he issued a narrow opinion that said lawmakers have wide discretion \u201cin areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d and that weighing the \u201ccosts and benefits of an abortion regulation\u201d was not necessarily a job for the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawyers representing Texas argued this presents a different standard than was applied by the district court that struck down the dilation and evacuation restriction in 2017. In that ruling, the burdens of the law were weighed in relation to its benefits \u2014 a balancing test rejected by the June Medical decision, the state\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\u201cThe Chief Justice demonstrated that is it not enough to show merely that a law imposes some \u2018burden\u2019 on abortion access, or that a regulation makes abortion more difficult or expensive. \u2026 Rather, \u2018the only question for a court is whether a law has the \u2018effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a non viable fetus,\u2019\u201d the state\u2019s lawyers wrote, citing Roberts\u2019 opinion.\nThe court disagreed, with Dennis writing that the judges agreed the \u201cbalancing test still governs.\u201d\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
