Last week (January 27), the country\u2019s right wing government moved to implement a near-total ban on abortion, despite the ruling sparking mass protests and global criticism when it was first declared three months ago.\nPro-choice activists immediately took to the streets and social media, leading the biggest protests in the country\u2019s recent history. In November, after almost two weeks of demonstrations, the government announced that it was delaying the abortion ban. Now, however, it\u2019s been enforced with immediate effect.\nPoland already has some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, and will now only permit terminations in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. In October, the country ruled that abortion due to foetal defects is unconstitutional, even though 98 per cent of abortions in Poland are conducted for this reason.\n\u201cMy first thought (after the announcement) was that it\u2019s a slap in the face for all those who value basic human rights,\u201d lawyer Eliza Rutynowska tells Dazed. \u201cWomen in Poland have essentially been told that they\u2019ll be subjected to torture by their own state.\u201d\n\nRead More The Tories are trying to stop young people from voting  Climate Crisis: Why migrant justice is now more important than ever UK university students are calling for tuition fee refunds UK university students now can\u2019t afford to eatThousands of people have been out on the streets in Poland, lightning bolts to the sky, demanding change after a near-total ban on #abortion was imposed. #StrajkKobiet#protestkobietpic.twitter.com/cdoNGfPrBl\u2014 Amnesty EU (@AmnestyEU) February 1, 2021\n \u201cMy second thought was about all those women who had already scheduled abortions due to some sort of malfunction of the foetus, and how they must feel knowing they\u2019ve been left all on their own,\u201d she continues. \u201cIf their partner helps them in any way, that person may be persecuted for aiding an illegal abortion, and can face up to three years in prison.\u201d\nMiko Czerwinski, the equal treatment coordinator at Amnesty International, says last week\u2019s ruling is \u201ca signal of a continued attack on women\u2019s rights and sexual and reproductive rights in a country that already does not provide enough access to contraception\u201d. Czerwinski asserts that implementing a near-total ban on abortion during a global pandemic will make seeking alternative arrangements even harder. \u201cThis simple service should be accessible, and should not make pregnant people travel or look for it in sometimes unsafe places.\u201d\nAccording to recent statistics, less than 2,000 legal abortions take place in Poland each year, though women\u2019s groups estimate an additional 200,000 women have terminations either illegally or abroad.\u00a0\n\u201cThose who are seeking an abortion will go abroad if they have the means, or order pills to their door,\u201d explains Rutynowska. \u201cThis entails risks. If someone buys (the pills) for them \u2013 or even hands them the money or assists in any way \u2013 that person may face criminal charges. Effectively, Polish women will have to either figure out the means to go abroad, or be left to deal with the problem on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen in Poland have essentially been told that they\u2019ll be subjected to torture by their own state\u201d \u2013 Eliza Rutynowska, lawyer\n\nShe adds: \u201cThe government, ever so graciously, has mentioned that women won\u2019t be persecuted for their abortions, but Polish women are all alone. Poland today disregards its women and persons who can get pregnant, and leaves them to fight for their own lives.\u201d\nAlthough activists are horrified by the government\u2019s ruling, many say they are not surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this ban to be stopped, neither by protests nor anything else,\u201d Karolina Wi\u0119ckiewicz from advocacy group Aborcyjny Dream Team tells Dazed. \u201cIt would have been naive if anyone believed that. The ruling party established the current situation with the constitutional court \u2013 how would they now depreciate this judgement?\u201d\nThe Aborcyjny Dream Team describes itself as an \u201cinformal initiative\u201d which aims to educate people in Poland about abortion and destigmatise the topic. \u201cWe are part of a great network here in Poland and across Europe of people who do everything so that any person who needs an abortion gets one,\u201d continues Wi\u0119ckiewicz.\nWi\u0119ckiewicz is one of the pro-choice campaigners who launched the abortion initiative Abortion Without Borders in 2019, offering women living in Poland advice and funds to seek treatment abroad. \u201cWe managed through the spring lockdown and we\u2019ll manage through this,\u201d she declares. \u201c120 people had their abortions abroad with us since October, and hundreds had abortions with pills at home. This is abortion reality, and this is what we are going to continue to do \u2013 always, no matter what the law is.\u201d\n\n\n Solidarity in the face of adversity can be most clearly seen in the mass protests which have erupted in Poland following Wednesday\u2019s announcement. Demonstrators defied coronavirus restrictions to gather in the streets, waving rainbow flags and brandishing the red lightning symbol used by the Women\u2019s Strike \u2013 the main organisation behind the protests. According to The Guardian, many carried placards that read, \u2018My body, my choice\u2019, \u2018The revolution has a uterus\u2019, and \u2018You have blood on your hands\u2019.\u00a0\nSeveral protesters have reportedly been arrested. This comes amid growing concern about the excessive force used by authorities against peaceful pro-choice demonstrators last year. As reported by Euronews, protesters were thrown to the ground, hit with batons, and kettled.\n\u201cPolice brutality varies from protest to protest,\u201d Rutynowska tells Dazed. \u201cWe are never sure about what will happen. Last week \u2013 from what we have heard as lawyers \u2013 one protester faced racist slurs from a police officer and ended up in hospital. We are filling complaints regarding (detainments of protesters), many of whom will be faced with misdemeanour and possibly criminal charges.\u201d\nFriday (January 29) marked 100 days of protests since Poland first handed down its controversial ruling on abortion \u2013 but activists show no sign of stopping. \u201cThe state is treating us like we don\u2019t exist and is constantly telling us to fuck off,\u201d concludes Wi\u0119ckiewicz. \u201cBut we also tell them to fuck off, because we will be there for one another.\u201d\n\nPoliticsNewsPolandabortionwomen\nDownload the app\u00a0\ud83d\udcf1\nBuild your network and meet other creativesBe the first to hear about exclusive Dazed events and offersShare your work with our communityJoin Dazed ClubIcon/Social/TikTok\nContact\n\nAbout\n\nJobs\n\nInternship\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDazed Media\n\nAnother\n\nAnother Man\n\nNowness\n\nDazed Studio\n\n"
