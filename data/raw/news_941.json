The case was assigned to Rosel\u00ed Echeguren, a\u00a0lawyer in a government office for the protection of children\u2019s rights in Paraguay.\nEcheguren told Human Rights Watch that community members had noticed that the girl had started to wear a girdle. Echeguren went to see the girl and took her to the hospital, where doctors confirmed that she was pregnant. The girl told her she had kept silent \u201cout of fear.\u201d\nThe authorities opened a criminal investigation into sexual abuse, and community leaders arranged for the girl to move out of her house. Several psychologists have since interviewed her. But Echeguren said that nobody had asked her a crucial question: whether she wants to continue the pregnancy. She said that\u2019s because of Paraguay\u2019s draconian\u00a0abortion law.\nIn Paraguay, abortion is legal only to save the life of a pregnant person. Women and girls are forced to continue unwanted pregnancies even in cases of rape or incest, pregnancies that pose a serious\u2014but not life-threatening\u2014health risk, and pregnancies in which the fetus has no hope of surviving outside the womb. This is one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Latin America.\nThe narrow exception is not enough to protect lives, much less girls\u2019 health and dignity. Human Rights Watch\u00a0research\u00a0in the region shows that strict abortion prohibitions do not stop women and girls from having abortions; they just force them to have unsafe abortions, putting their lives and health at risk.\nIn 2018, a 14-year-old Paraguayan girl who had become pregnant after being raped by a 37-year-old man died as doctors performed an emergency cesarean section, trying desperately to save her and the baby. She had already spent several weeks in the hospital for pregnancy-related complications. The\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0(WHO) has reported that girls between ages 10 and 14 face a higher risk of complications and death as a result of pregnancy than older girls or women.\nHealth Ministry data collected by the Coordinator for the Rights of Children and Adolescents, a coalition of Paraguayan nongovernmental organizations, shows that, on average, since 2013, two girls a day between the ages of 10 and 14 give birth in Paraguay, even though sexual relations with children under 14 is rape under Paraguayan law.\u00a0Amnesty International\u00a0reported last year that Paraguay does not have an adequate system to prevent sexual violence and protect its victims.\nIndigenous girls and women in Paraguay are particularly at risk because, as the UN Committee\u00a0on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women\u00a0pointed out in 2017,\u00a0they are disproportionately affected by poverty, experience discrimination, and have difficulty getting health care, education, and jobs.\u00a0\nWhatever the 13-year-old rape victim would have decided about her pregnancy, she should have had the option to end it safely and legally. Each year, hundreds of girls like her suffer, often in fearful silence, deprived of information and power over their bodies and lives. These are the brutal consequences of Paraguay\u2019s unjust abortion law.\nParaguay should decriminalize abortion, but allowing for even narrow exceptions, in addition to protecting the person\u2019s life, would save lives and protect health and dignity. It is essential to at least permit doctors, with their patients\u2019 informed consent, to end a pregnancy when it results from rape or incest, when a fetus will not survive, or when necessary to protect a person\u2019s health. Paraguayan authorities should act now, before any more girls and women have to suffer unnecessarily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas Paraguay \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 2, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nParaguay: Flawed Investigation of Argentine Girls\u2019 Killings \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 26, 2018\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\n14, Pregnant from Rape, Dead in Childbirth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Contribute to Society\u201d\n\n\nThe Need for Legal Gender Recognition in Tabasco, Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThis Hell Was My Only Option\u201d\n\n\nAbuses Against Migrants and Asylum Seekers Pushed to Cross the Dari\u00e9n Gap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 2, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nParaguay: Flawed Investigation of Argentine Girls\u2019 Killings \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 26, 2018\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\n14, Pregnant from Rape, Dead in Childbirth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
