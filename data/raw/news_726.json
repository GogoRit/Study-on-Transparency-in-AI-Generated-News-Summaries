The only exception would be if the mother's life is in danger.Addison Kliewer, OklahomanLegislation that would ban nearly all abortions in Oklahoma is awaiting action from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt.\u00a0If Stitt signs the legislation\u00a0into\u00a0law, Oklahoma could have one of\u00a0the most restrictive anti-abortion law\u00a0in the country.\u00a0Here's what we know about Senate Bill 612 that would effectively ban most abortions.\u00a0Oklahoma bill would make abortion a felonySB 612 would make it a felony for anyone to perform an abortion, except for those procedures deemed necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency.\u00a0Those who violate the law could face up to 10 years in prison or $100,000 in fines.Oklahoma state law already says abortion is illegal, and anyone who performs the procedure could face a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.However, the law that has been on the books for decades isn't enforced because of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that determined women have a constitutional right to seek an abortion.\u00a0Oklahoma abortion ban: Gov. Kevin Stitt to decide on bill making abortion illegal in OklahomaWhat\u00a0people are saying about the Oklahoma anti-abortion bill\u00a0Proponents of SB 612 say the measure is\u00a0one of the most\u00a0restrictive pieces of anti-abortion legislation in the nation.\u00a0The bill's author, Sen. Nathan Dahm, a Republican from Broken Arrow who is running for the U.S. Senate, touted\u00a0that the bill would effectively eliminate abortion in Oklahoma.\u00a0\"Senate Bill 612 defends life from conception, will stop the murder of the unborn and end the massacre that has been taking place in our state for decades through abortion,\" Dahm said in a statement Tuesday.\u00a0Critics\u00a0say the measure is unconstitutional because of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that\u00a0legalized the practice of abortion.\u00a0After Texas was able to impose the most restrictive anti-abortion law in the country, other conservative-led states are following suit, said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\"I would really\u00a0call it a race to the bottom,\" she said.\u00a0\"Texas, in many ways, inspired other conservative anti choice politicians to go as far as possible and be as extreme as possible.\"Although many conservatives hope the new conservative majority on the court will cripple or completely undo longstanding abortion protections, the current court hasn't decided on Roe v. Wade yet.\u00a0The court is expected to issue a decision this summer in a case challenging a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi.\u00a0More: Oklahoma could ban most abortions if US Supreme Court overturns Roe v. WadeOklahoma also has a \"trigger\" law on the books that would essentially outlaw abortion if the court overturns Roe v. Wade and\u00a0Planned Parenthood v. Casey that reaffirmed Roe. If that were to happen, only abortions necessary to save the life of the mother would be legal.\u00a0What happens if Stitt signs the bill?If approved, SB 612 would take effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns in May.\u00a0However, the law is ripe for a lawsuit and likely would face a constitutional challenge in the courts.If challenged, a lawsuit could delay or prevent implementation of the near-total abortion ban.\u00a0What are the other anti-abortion bills in the Oklahoma Legislature?At least seven other anti-abortion bills are advancing through the Oklahoma Legislature.\u00a0Several are near-total abortion bans.\u00a0More: Oklahoma Republicans advance near-total abortion ban modeled off Texas lawHere's a look at the other GOP-backed bills that would effectively prohibit most abortions in Oklahoma.\u00a0\u00a0House Bill 4327 would block nearly all abortions by allowing private citizens to sue anyone who \"aids or abets\" a woman who pursues the procedure. The legislation allows exceptions only for when an abortion is necessary to save a woman's life or those who seek the procedure following rape or incest, so long as the incident was reported to law enforcement.The bill is modeled off a similar law enacted in Texas.\u00a0Senate Bill 1503 is also similar to the Texas law because it would eliminate most abortions after a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected, which typically occurs around six weeks into a pregnancy. This bill also would allow for civil enforcement of the law.\u00a0Senate Bill 1553 would prohibit most abortions 30 days after the start of a pregnant woman's last menstrual cycle. The bill's author, Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat, R-Oklahoma City, has introduced several other pieces of anti-abortion legislation.\u00a0Two legislative resolutions\u00a0would ask Oklahoma voters to weigh in on abortion related questions. Lawmakers are still in the process of weighing what questions they want to refer to the statewide ballot.\u00a0\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
