Y\u2019all want me to run on nah???\u201dThe rapper told Forbes magazine last week: \u201cA lot of times just like political parties they feel all blacks have to be Democrat. This man, Joe Biden, said if you don\u2019t vote for me, then you are not black.\n\n\nSubscribe to The Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

We act like we didn\u2019t hear that man say that? That man said that. It\u2019s a rap. We gonna walk, all the people. Jay-Z said it best.\u201cFor the other candidates, I just gracefully suggest y\u2019all bow out - Trump and Biden, gracefully bow out.\u201dBut now it looks as though it may be West bowing out, having failed to earn the 10,000 votes he needed to get on the ballot in South Carolina, according to Metro, despite a bizarre first campaign rally in the state over the weekend.If he were to stay in the race, West currently has an 100-1 chance of victory, according to Oddschecker.If he were to overcome those odds and enter the White House, here\u2019s what a West presidency would look like:AbortionWest set out an anti-abortion stance on religious grounds, saying he is \u201cpro-life because I\u2019m following the word of the Bible\u201d.He also posted and then deleted a pro-life tweet calling six-month fetuses \u201csouls\u201d that \u201cdeserve to live\u201d, feeding an ongoing spat with pro-abortion group Planned Parenthood. He has previously said the group is run by \u201cwhite supremacists to do the Devil\u2019s work\u201d, the Daily Mail reports.VaccinationsKanye West at the White House: how the world reacted Why Kanye West is changing his nameAsked about the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, West said: \u201cIt\u2019s so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralysed\u2026 So when they say the way we\u2019re going to fix covid is with a vaccine, I\u2019m extremely cautious. That\u2019s the mark of the beast.\u201cThey want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things to make it where we can\u2019t cross the gates of heaven.\u201dRejecting medical science, West said coronavirus was \u201call about God. We need to stop doing things that make God mad.\u201dEducationWest is keen to return \u201cfear and love of God\u201d to education, saying prayer should return to schools despite the supposed separation of church and state in the US.\u201cReinstate in God\u2019s state, in God\u2019s country, the fear and love of God in all schools and organisations and you chill the fear and love of everything else,\u201d he said.\u201cSo that was a plan by the Devil to have our kids committing suicide at an all-time high by removing God, to have murders in Chicago at an all-time high because the human beings working for the Devil removed God and prayer from the schools. That means more drugs, more murders, more suicide.\u201dSpace programmeWest almost immediately received the public backing of eccentric Tesla chief Elon Musk, who replied to his presidential announcement on Twitter with a message of support.See moreWest told Forbes: \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this for years\u2026 I proposed to him to be the head of our space programme.\u201dRaceWest told Forbes that his support for Trump - and the reason he wore a Make America Great Again cap - was \u201cas a protest to the segregation of votes in the black community\u2026 other than the fact that I like Trump hotels and the saxophones in the lobby\u201d.He said he was confortable taking black votes from the Democratic nominee, thus helping Trump: \u201cI\u2019m not denying it, I just told you. To say that the black vote is Democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy.\u201dIn response to the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests, West said he intended to end police brutality, but added that \u201cthe police are people, too\u201d.He has criticised Black History Month as \u201ctorture porn\u201d and said: \u201cOne time I talked to Jared Kushner, who was saying, \u2018We don\u2019t have Black leaders, we just have hustlers.\u2019 Why? Because they killed all the Black leaders.\u201dThe rapper has previously made widely criticised comments about race, referring to the enslavement of African Americans as \u201ca choice\u201d by the enslaved.\u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice. Like, you was there for 400 years, all of y\u2019all?\u201d he said during an appearance on entertainment site TMZ in 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re mentally imprisoned.\u201d He added that \u201cright now we're choosing to be enslaved\u201d.Death penaltyHe said he opposes the death penalty, quoting the bible: \u201c\u2018Thou shalt not kill.\u2019 I\u2019m against the death penalty.\u201dForeign policyWest\u2019s foreign policy is still to be confirmed, with the rapper telling Forbes: \u201cI haven\u2019t developed it yet. I\u2019m focused on protecting America, first, with our great military. Let\u2019s focus on ourselves first.\u201dBut despite his reluctance to discuss foreign policy, he did profess admiration for China, says the Los Angeles Times.\u201cI love China. I love China. It\u2019s not China\u2019s fault that disease. It\u2019s not the Chinese people\u2019s fault. They\u2019re God\u2019s people also. I love China. It changed my life. It changed my perspective, it gave me such a wide perspective. My mom as an English professor taught English in China when I was in fifth grade.\u201dTaxesLike West\u2019s foreign policy, his domestic fiscal policy is also still missing some detail. On taxes, West said \u201cI haven\u2019t done enough research on that yet.\u201cI will research that with the strongest experts that serve God and come back with the best solution. And that will be my answer for anything that I haven\u2019t researched. I have the earplug in and I\u2019m going to use that earplug.\u201d\n\nExplore More\n\nJoe Biden\nKanye West\nDonald Trump\n2020 Us Election\nUk News\n\n\n\n     To continue reading this article...
