The decision struck down a law that would have required doctors performing abortions to gain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, even though abortion-rights activists say patients rarely need to be hospitalized after the procedure.\nThe White House deplored the ruling. Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said it \"devalued both the health of mothers and lives of unborn children. Instead of valuing fundamental democratic principles, unelected justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of state governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate abortion safety regulations.\u201d \nIn their first abortion case rulings, conservative justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump\u2019s appointments, were in the minority, voting to uphold the Louisiana law that would have overturned a 2016 ruling by a different group of court justices that struck down an almost identical restrictive abortion law in Texas.\nIn concurring with the court\u2019s liberal wing, Roberts said respect for court precedent in previous decisions \u201crequires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore, Louisiana\u2019s law cannot stand under our precedents.\u201d\nRoberts\u2019s alignment with the court\u2019s four liberals was striking because he declared that he continues to believe that the 2016 Texas case was \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d but that it nonetheless should be adhered to in the Louisiana case. \nThe decision was a significant win for U.S. abortion-rights advocates and a setback for abortion foes who had hoped that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh would lead the court to impose more abortion restrictions and eventually overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing abortion rights in the U.S.\nAbortion-rights advocates contended that the Louisiana law was a veiled attempt to chip away at the legality of abortion in the U.S. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the majority \"consequently hold that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional.\" \nHe said the evidence in the Louisiana dispute \u201calso shows that opposition to abortion played a significant role in some hospitals' decisions to deny admitting privileges\" to abortion practitioners.\nHealth experts estimate that more than 800,000 abortions a year are performed in the U.S., although the figure is down substantially from the 1978 to 1997 period when the annual figures topped a million abortions and peaked at more than 1.4 million.\nThe question before the court in Monday\u2019s ruling was whether Louisiana\u2019s 2014 law requiring doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals would unduly burden women seeking an abortion.\nAbortion practitioners have said it had been all but impossible for a variety of reasons for them to obtain hospital admitting privileges, which would have left Louisiana with a single abortion clinic, in the state\u2019s biggest city, New Orleans.\nHowever, the law\u2019s supporters said it would protect the health and safety of women seeking abortions and would help ensure the competence of doctors.\nBut abortion-rights supporters cited the rarity of the need for hospitalization after an abortion and said women could, if needed, be hospitalized whether their abortion practitioner had admitting privileges or not.\nThe Texas law struck down in 2016 said the admitting privilege provision did not have a medical benefit.\nIn that decision, now-retired justice Anthony Kennedy joined the court\u2019s four liberals to form a majority. At that time before Trump assumed the presidency, the Department of Justice argued that the Texas law should be struck down. But under Trump, the department backed the Louisiana law.\nThe court\u2019s 2016 decision said the admitting-privileges requirement \u201cprovides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \u2018undue burden\u2019 on their constitutional right to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court Takes Up 1st Big Abortion Case of Trump Era\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats Thwart Senate Republicans on 2 Abortion-Related Bills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeals Court Keeps Block on Mississippi 6-Week Abortion Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Infodemic: UN Didn't Require Ecuador to Legalize Abortion to Get COVID-19 Aid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore US Stories \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Study Reports Widespread Forced Labor Abuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustin: US, Free World 'Will Not Let Ukraine Fail'\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop US Congressional Leaders Say Spending Deal Reached\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop US Diplomat Affirms Washington's 'Ironclad' Commitment to Philippines Security\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden to Host Japan PM Kishida, Philippines President Marcos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll About America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Day in Photos \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS News\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\nAll About America\n\n\nSilicon Valley & Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThe Americas\n\n\nEast Asia Pacific\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOA Programs\n\n\nSpecial projects\n\n\nDay in Photos\n\n\nPress Freedom\n\n\nRefugees\n\n\nVOA News on Iran\n\n\nVOA News on China\n\n\nArts & Culture\n\n\nEconomy & Business\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nExtremism Watch\n\n\nStudent Union\n\n\nVOA Connect\n\n\n52 Documentary\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From VOA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOAAfrica.com Programs\n\n\nVOA Learning English\n\n\nPolygraph.info\n\n\nEditorials\n\n\nSatellite schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use & Privacy Notice\n\n\nAbout VOA\n\n\nGet VOA+\n\n\nVOA Around the World\n\n\nContact VOA\n\n\nMedia Relations\n\n\nUsage Requests\n\n\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nXS\nSM\nMD\nLG\n\n\n\n"
