Wade on June 24.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nIn a pivotal first election after the complete upending of abortion access in the United States, things looked about the same as always in Texas.\nRepublicans swept easily to victory statewide, shoring up the Legislature\u2019s dominant anti-abortion bloc, and at least three more cities passed local ordinances further banning the procedure.\nNationally, abortion helped Democrats hold off the threatened \u201cred wave,\u201d and in states where reproductive rights were on the ballot, voters turned out and even crossed party lines to support increased access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not in Texas.\nIt\u2019s not that Texans support the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban \u2014 they overwhelmingly oppose it. Nor have they forgotten about the issue \u2014 abortion is second only to inflation, with the majority of voters saying they felt dissatisfied or angry about the overturn of Roe v. Wade, according to an NBC exit poll.\nIn an already bad year for Democrats, with a faltering economy and newly redrawn electoral maps, outrage over abortion access didn\u2019t translate into enough votes to stop Republicans\u2019 relentless rightward march in Texas.\n\u201cThis proves that being bold on life is not going to hurt you in the election,\u201d Texas Right to Life director John Seago said. \u201cIt actually helps. And this is something that I think was really important for the Republican Party to learn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidterm expectations versus reality\nMidterm elections are almost uniformly terrible for the president\u2019s party, so nationally and in Texas, Democrats were braced for a rout this year.\nBut then, in late June, a meteor hit the electoral landscape: The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, freeing states to ban abortion for the first time in 50 years. Across the South and Midwest, abortion access evaporated overnight.\nA few weeks later, defying all polls, deep-red Kansas voted to protect abortion access. A surge of new voters, previously unmotivated voters and party defectors helped strike down the Republican-proposed constitutional amendment, in an apparent repudiation of the Supreme Court.\nAfter decades playing defense on abortion, Democrats saw this as their chance to go on the offensive, attacking Republicans for ending abortion access for millions of Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Texas was unlikely to have a similar referendum anytime soon, Democratic candidates made abortion a key part of their messaging. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke framed abortion as \u201cthe most important thing\u201d about the election, pinning the state\u2019s near-total ban on his opponent, Gov. Greg Abbott in TV ads, fundraising emails and stump speeches.\nRochelle Garza, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, held her record as a reproductive rights attorney up against incumbent Ken Paxton\u2019s staunch anti-abortion views. Down-ballot, more legislative candidates spoke more frankly and more often about abortion than ever before.\nBut statewide Democratic candidates lost, badly, on Tuesday, and the Legislature remains Republican-dominated.\nIn the four months between the Supreme Court decision and the election, other issues began to push abortion out of the headlines \u2014 the faltering economy, swelling inflation, rising crime numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hard part for Democrats isn\u2019t \u201cconvincing people that abortion access is a good thing,\u201d said Drucilla Tigner, deputy director with Planned Parenthood Texas Votes.\n\u201cWe know that they already agree with that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting them to believe that they can make a difference in the state on this issue.\u201d\nDemocrats have long struggled to overcome political ennui in Texas, where turnout is often low and Republicans have dominated for decades. A record-breaking 9.6 million registered voters did not go to the polls Tuesday, along with 1.4 million Texans who are eligible but haven\u2019t registered, according to Texas Election Source. Heightening the sense of hopelessness among Democrats, Texas has new electoral maps, drawn to insulate Republicans from opposition.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not having elections that are in neutrally drawn districts that would reflect necessarily neutral politics,\u201d said Joanne Connor Green, a political science professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. \u201cThese are freshly drawn partisan districts that are designed to temper some of these trends.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTigner said there were some positive signs for abortion advocates Tuesday night: All of the incumbent candidates endorsed by Planned Parenthood Texas Votes won, including those in the hotly contested Harris County Commissioners Court races. But she acknowledged that the results were a setback in an already long fight to restore abortion access in Texas.\nWith this election likely representing the high-water mark for attention on abortion, it\u2019ll be up to abortion advocates to keep voters \u2014 and the Democratic party \u2014 engaged and enraged around this issue.\nThat\u2019s a lesson the other side has learned over decades. Even after their long-awaited victory at the highest level of the American justice system in June, anti-abortion organizers are still mobilizing voters at the grassroots level.\nOn Tuesday, that looked like at least three rural Texas cities passing \u201cSanctuary City for the Unborn\u201d ordinances, which allow private citizens to bring lawsuits against anyone who \u201caids and abets\u201d in an illegal abortion from the moment of conception, going even further than existing state law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbilene, Athens and San Angelo have joined more than 50 other cities in passing these largely symbolic ordinances. None of these three cities had abortion clincis, and the procedure is virtually outlawed in Texas.\nA similar ordinance passed in Hobbs, New Mexico, on Monday, intending to discourage any abortion clinics from relocating to the town just over the Texas border. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who won reelection on Tuesday, said the state \u201cwon\u2019t stand for\u201d ordinances like these. \nAbortion on the ballot\nWhile towns in Texas voted to oppose abortion access, it was an entirely different night for states considering a similar question.\nEver-reddening Kentucky reelected Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul in a landslide and \u2014 at the same time \u2014 knocked down an anti-abortion constitutional amendment. Preliminary analysis indicates at least some Republicans voted to ensure the state constitution would not include a prohibition on abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan voted to protect abortion access in the Constitution and reelected Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who made her opponent\u2019s anti-abortion stance a central part of her campaign. Voters in California and Vermont also added constitutional protections for abortion.\nWhen asked to weigh in on a clear-cut yes or no abortion question, voters seem inclined to protect access, even in conservative states.\n\u201cIf abortion is on the ballot, abortion wins,\u201d Tigner said. \u201cPeople across this country believe that abortion should be legal.\u201d\nBut Texans are unlikely to see a similar referendum on their ballots anytime soon. Even after Tuesday\u2019s election, Republicans do not have the two-thirds majority in either house required to pass a constitutional amendment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if they did manage to build a bipartisan coalition, the proposal would then go to the voters; as Kansas and Kentucky have proven, constitutional amendments make even consistently conservative states a little skittish.\nBut more important, after Tuesday\u2019s election, there\u2019s no sign Texas lawmakers need to be overly worried about enshrining abortion restrictions in the state constitution. The state\u2019s power balance remains firmly in the hands of the Republican party, giving legislators virtual free rein to pass as many, and as restrictive, abortion laws as they believe voters will let them.\nAlready, the scope of conversation around abortion in the upcoming legislative session is beginning to take shape. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of adding rape and incest exceptions to the near-total ban, but beyond that, lawmakers\u2019 focus will likely be on increasing enforcement and furthering the reach of the state\u2019s existing abortion laws.\n\u201cThat\u2019s gonna require Republicans to be courageous on this issue, again, like they did last session,\u201d Seago said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that with these election results, we can make the case that it is actually to your political benefit to be strong on these issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen, from TCU, cautioned against reading too much into the Republican victory on Tuesday.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that the voters were issuing a mandate of change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems as though we entered the elections very divided, and then we emerged very divided without a clear consensus of what we want, either as a state or a nation.\u201d\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood and Texas Christian University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
