On most Fridays, members of the \u201cnon-registered student organization\u201d hand out free condoms to other students,\u00a0reports\u00a0the\u00a0Loyola Phoenix, the university\u2019s student newspaper.In response, Loyola for Life members decided to hand out crisis pregnancy center pamphlets alongside members of SRJ during \u201cFree Condom Fridays.\u201d[RELATED: 5 times pro-life advocates fought for their beliefs on campus in 2021]Campus Reform\u00a0spoke with Loyola for Life President Grace Shallal, who explained the importance of fighting for Catholic values within a Catholic university.\u201cLoyola is a Catholic University. Since no one has ever protested it before, we didn\u2019t want the school to think that all of their students agreed with what SRJ was doing,\u201d Shallal told\u00a0Campus Reform.Shallal also spoke against SRJ\u2019s activities, which she characterized as having the potential to pressure students into partaking in sexual activity.[RELATED:\u00a0WATCH: Senator Steve Daines: \u2018We can\u2019t let our colleges and universities turn into abortion clinics\u2019]\u201cWe simply wanted to be a voice of opposition not only for the school, but also for those who may feel pressured by what SRJ is doing. Imagine someone\u2019s not sexually active, yet there is a group screaming on a street corner yelling \u2018wrap your meat\u2019 and other phrases,\u201d she said. \u201cThat could make someone feel like something is wrong with them, or even feel pressured into thinking that they\u2019re supposed to be having sex.\u201dLikewise, Emily Torres, vice president of Loyola for Life, criticized the message behind \u201cFree Condom Fridays.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just give students access to condoms, but it encourages students and it may even pressure some to take free condoms,\u201d Torres said.\u00a0Torres added, \u201cIn a culture where casual sex is glorified and religious values are scorned, it is extremely important for Catholics to stick together and stand up for their ideology. At the end of the day, Catholic values come down to loving God and loving our neighbor; we only want the best for others.\u201dCampus Reform\u00a0reached out to Loyola University Chicago and Students for Reproductive Justice for comment; this article will be updated accordingly.\u00a0Follow\u00a0@thelogandubil\u00a0on TwitterTagscondomsIllinoisCatholicJesuitStudent GroupsLoyola Marymount ChicagoLoyola for LifeStudents for Reproductive JusticeAbortionShare this articleLogan Dubil  '23Senior Pennsylvania Campus CorrespondentView ProfileMore articles like this\n\n\nWhat you stand for is what defines youConservative students on college campuses are marginalized, threatened, and silenced by threatening students who oppose their views, or radicalized liberal professors or administrators. Campus Reform\u2014and readers like you\u2014are pushing back. Progressives would rather threaten you with violence, silence your conservative views, or call for you to be \"canceled\" from our society if you oppose them. They say your views are dangerous, hateful, fearful, or racist.They have it all wrong. What we stand for defines us\u2014it always has.We can no longer remain silent. It is time for conservatives young and old to unite as a single voice to boldly proclaim what we stand for and oppose the mob.Will you join with us, select the principles you stand for, and sign your name below?I stand for the preservation of free speech all across our country\u2014where I'm allowed to express my beliefs without fear of condemnation if my opinion differs from yours.I stand for protections for conservative students who are illegally being threatened or silenced on college campuses all across our country.I stand for the federal funding to be pulled from colleges and universities when they silence conservative views or students.Loading...Copyright \u00a9 2024 Leadership InstituteAll rights reservedv1.02"
