But what distinguishes these health winners is not just the female shape of their leaders but the feminist shape of their societies. Even more gender-balanced societies headed by men\u2014like Canada\u2014do better in health crises than their less equitable peers like the United States. On the other hand, the most patriarchal countries headed by regressive strongmen do worse at every level of development. Today, we see this in Brazil, which until recently had managed health crises well under less masculinist leadership.Gender equitable societies are healthier for everyone. As feminism challenges restrictive gender norms, improvements in women\u2019s access to health care, reproductive rights, and protection from violence have positive effects on everyone\u2019s life expectancy and well-being, especially children. A simple scatter plot and a Pearson correlation of the Gender Development Index and the Life Expectancy Index show a positive linear relationship between them. We recognize there are many variables that contribute to those results, but the frequency of cases where gender equitable societies are healthier cannot be ignored.Source: UNDP Human Development Data (1990-2018), graphic courtesy of the authors.\u00a0According to a series on how gender and health intersect published by The Lancet in 2019, countries with a greater share of female physicians have lower maternal and infant mortality rates, as well as greater life expectancy for men and women alike. As feminism produces a more gender-balanced workforce and political representation, countries tend to invest more in health across the board. As the Canadian case showed in a statistical study of 1976 to 2009, the presence of more women in multiple government positions\u2014regardless of political leaning\u2014is associated with larger government spending in health and reduced mortality rates.Feminism materializes through investment in human capital and caregiving sectors of the economy that improve public health capacity and focus. During this pandemic we have seen the comparative advantages of countries around the world who invested in sectors such as medical research, health services, and manufacturing for health exports. Like Canada, Taiwan introduced a single payer system for healthcare in 1995, which is now helping to contain the pandemic while also sharing best practices with the global health community. Taiwan has been able to not only expand medical technology investment\u2014a signature initiative of the island\u2019s first female President Tsai Ing-Wen\u2014but also to develop\u00a0 \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d by donating 10 million masks globally. Taiwan even started sharing best medical practices with multiple countries through online seminars, fostering humanitarian solidarity under the slogan #Taiwancanhelp. Taiwan is positioning itself as a model of a feminist democracy.Feminism is physically healthy because it comes from and encourages socially healthy historic choices and development dynamics. The development patterns that enable women\u2019s empowerment also produce more modern, equitable, and better governed societies with better performance on all dimensions of social well-being. Gender equity is associated with more and better distributed economic growth, which leads to better health systems. The movement from patriarchal structures of social organization to a more feminist open society is associated with a larger middle class, more state capacity, and more pressures for government accountability. Women\u2019s empowerment fosters better development, as lower levels of hierarchy provide political incentives to invest in the broader population, and broader participation drives more spending on public health and children\u2019s needs. Feminist societies are also better for health because they are more collaborative and more effectively governed, which is good for all forms of public policy and crisis adjustment.Generally more democratic, peaceful, and outward-looking, feminist societies are able to cope with the increasing proportion of globalized health crises. More specifically, more gender-balanced states have more multilateral and humanitarian foreign policies\u2014they invest in global institutions and programs that support global health at home and abroad. Some of these states, such as Taiwan, consciously seek to promote a feminist foreign policy that aspires to advance worldwide gender equity, global cooperation, and holistic human development. Such globalist countries can quickly tap into international knowledge, networks, and resources to manage a border-crossing health crisis. By contrast, macho nationalists operating in isolation from global cooperation in the United States, the United Kingdom, Iran, and Russia have visibly failed to protect their citizens\u2014or even to adjust their supply chains.The COVID-19 pandemic is adding to the lessons of a generation of global governance and human rights, epitomized in the slogan of the Argentinian activists\u2019 campaign endorsed by the Organization of American States\u2019 Interamerican Commission on Women: \u201ca feminist world is a better world.\u201d Good leadership by strong women is certainly helpful\u2014but in the broader picture of a feminist society, women\u2019s leadership grows from and reinforces equity across all areas of political, economic, and social life. More feminist societies are relatively resilient in the current pandemic because they have more equitable access to social welfare, more effective and accountable governments, more diversified economies with better social safety nets, and more global cooperation for expertise and management. In times of crisis, societies that citizens perceive as fair and caring can draw upon their legitimacy to mobilize social solidarity and absorb short-term sacrifice\u2014as illustrated by citizens\u2019 support for women\u2019s leadership in New Zealand and Germany as they called for tough policies that contained the coronavirus and long-term adjustments that are needed to manage it going forward. A society advancing towards equality for women is good for everyone\u2019s health and well-being; in fact, feminism could save your life.Alison Brysk is Distinguished Mellichamp Professor of Global Governance at the University of California Santa Barbara, a former Wilson Fellow, a co-PI of WomanStats, and the author or editor of 15 books on international human rights.Miguel Fuentes Carre\u00f1o is a Ph.D. student at UCSB who has interned at the United Nations Population Fund in Egypt and is currently based in Mexico City, where he is\u00a0working with NGOs advocating for HIV/AIDS, women\u2019s rights and LGBTI+ rights in Mexico.\u00a0Sources: Asociaci\u00f3n Civil Comunicaci\u00f3n para la Igualdad,\u00a0Brookings Institution, Columbia University Press, Council on Foreign Relations, Forbes, Foreign Policy, Journal of Peace Research, London Journal of Primary Care, NBC News, Science Direct, Taiwan Today, The Africa Report, The Lancet, The National Bureau of Economic Research, The New York Times, The Pacific Review, The Storm Media, The Washington Post,\u00a0USA Today, World Economic Forum, World Health Organization.\u00a0\u00a0Photo Credit: Sesi\u00f3n 22\u00aa Valparaiso 13 mayo 2020, courtesy of\u00a0Ren\u00e9 Lescornez A,\u00a0Diputadas y Diputados de Chile.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nTopics:\nBrazil, \n\tCanada, \n\tCovid-19, \n\tdemocracy and governance, \n\tgender, \n\tGermany, \n\tglobal health, \n\tGuest Contributor, \n\thealth systems, \n\tNew Zealand, \n\tTaiwan \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJoin the Conversation \nRSS\nsubscribe\nfacebook\nG+\ntwitter\niTunes\npodomatic\nyoutube\n\n\nTweets by NewSecurityBeat \n\n\n\nTrending Stories \n\nFeatured Media \n\n\n\n\nBackdraft\nPodcasts\n\n\n\nMore \u00bb\nWhat You're Saying\n\n\nClosing the Women\u2019s Health Gap Report: Much Needed Recognition for Endometriosis and Menopause\n\nAditya Belose: This blog effectively highlights the importance of recognizing conditions like endometriosis &...\n\n\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day 2024: Investment Can Promote Equality\n\nAditya Belose: This is a powerful and informative blog on the importance of investing in women for gender equality!...\n\n\n\nA Warmer Arctic Presents Challenges and Opportunities\n\nDan Strombom: The link to the Georgetown report did not work\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting Human Rights in DRC Cobalt Mines: A U.S. Priority in a Green Transition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS Feed\nYouTube\nTwitter\nFacebook\n Home\nWho We Are\nPublications\nEvents\nWilson Center\nContact Us\nPrint Friendly Page\n \n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2007-2024.
