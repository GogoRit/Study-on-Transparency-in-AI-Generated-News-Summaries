(Photo: John Partipilo)\n\n\n\n\n\nJust months after one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws took effect in Tennessee, Republican lawmakers are considering bills to provide exceptions, including for saving the life of the mother in a deadly pregnancy.\nState Sens. Ferrell Haile and Rusty Crowe both confirmed to the Tennessee Lookout they are exploring legislation that would alter the law as the 113th General Assembly\u2019s first session opens in January.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at what exceptions might be appropriate,\u201d Haile, a Gallatin Republican, said.\n  Sen. Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin (Photo: Tennessee General Assembly)\nHe declined to specify whether those would include rape and incest, which are not allowed under the \u201ctrigger ban,\u201d noting he is in the \u201cexamination phase.\u201d He did say, though, he is \u201cleaning toward\u201d sponsoring legislation.\n\u201cI just think that there\u2019s a reason here that there might be a need for some exceptions on this,\u201d Haile said.\nAsked whether such legislation could include a change in the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d portion of the law, Haile said that is being discussed by other lawmakers.\u00a0\nCrowe, a Bristol Republican, is looking at that type of legislation, which would make saving the life of the mother an exception rather than require an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d in which the physician would have to introduce evidence in court to negate criminal or civil liability, proving an abortion was necessary to stop the mother from dying or suffering a life-altering illness.\n\u201cIn the upcoming legislative session, Sen. Crowe wants to ensure the law protects physicians who perform life-saving abortions when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. At this point, Sen. Crowe has not met with stakeholders to discuss specific legislation but he looks forward to doing so in the coming weeks and months,\u201d said Senate Republican Caucus spokeswoman Molly Gormley.\nThough Republican lawmakers who voted overwhelmingly for the \u201ctrigger ban\u201d in 2019 are having second thoughts about the restrictions, they will run into opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just think that there\u2019s a reason here that there might be a need for some exceptions on this.\n\n\n\u2013 Sen. Ferrell Haile, a Gallatin Republican, speaking on the state's strict abortion ban.\n\n\n\n\tGov. Bill Lee says he is \u201csatisfied\u201d with the law as written and doesn\u2019t think it needs to be changed. Other Republican lawmakers are likely to throw up roadblocks as well.\nTennessee Right to Life celebrated the law\u2019s enactment this summer after Roe v. Wade was overturned. And lobbyist Will Brewer said the organization, which was largely responsible for passage of the Human Life Protection Act, \u201cin abstract\u201d would oppose those types of legislation. He hasn\u2019t seen any language yet but already voiced opposition to Haile and Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, supports exceptions to save the life of the mother and for rape and incest.\nPhysicians who perform an abortion can be charged with a felony carrying a penalty of up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\nIn addition to talking with lawmakers, Tennessee Right to Life is negotiating with the Tennessee Medical Association, after previously saying it would not agree to any changes in the law.\n\u201cWe are in talks with the TMA to see if there is any kind of clarifying language that all the parties can agree to, but we\u2019re not gonna support any kind of legislation that downgrades the affirmative defense or adds any other exceptions to the Human Life Protection Act,\u201d Brewer said.\u00a0\nBrewer would not give details on those negotiations.\nAccording to a ProPublica article published last week in the Tennessee Lookout, Brewer and other anti-abortion leaders coached lawmakers in a recent webinar on fending off changes to the state\u2019s law.\nWhen state Rep. Susan Lynn asked during the presentation if they could organize crisis pregnancy centers nine months after the law\u2019s enactment to see some of their clients\u2019 babies, Brewer responded in the affirmative.\nGroups seeking to tweak the law will hit that kind of mind-set when the session starts.\nThe Tennessee Medical Association is among those pushing for a change in the abortion ban in cases when doctors are forced to deal with fetal anomalies and pregnancy complications. The organization is part of a coalition of medical and hospital interests working to protect women\u2019s health.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe physicians should be held criminally liable or have charges levied against them for providing care and appropriate treatment, and we also believe harmful delays in care should be avoided,\u201d TMA spokesman Doug Word said.\nHe declined to be specific about negotiations with Tennessee Right to Life.\nCrowe, chairman of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, could not be reached for comment this week. But he said during a meeting earlier this year he was hearing from medical and physician groups that the Legislature should \u201cfine-tune\u201d the law \u201cto make sure we don\u2019t get our docs in trouble when they\u2019re trying to follow the law.\u201d\n  Sen. Rusty Crowe, R-Johnson City (Photo: Tennessee General Assembly)\nCrowe said lawmakers would need to deal with questions surrounding dangerous pregnancies and fertilization of an egg outside the womb.\nHe pointed out the intent of the law is understood: to stop \u201celective\u201d abortions, not to put physicians in a quandary or endanger women\u2019s health during events such as ectopic pregnancies in which the egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube and other deadly situations.\nBriggs, who admits he didn\u2019t think Roe v. Wade would be overturned when he voted for the \u201ctrigger ban\u201d in 2019, said this week he did so to make sure the state had some sort of law in effect governing abortions. Otherwise, any type of abortion could have been allowed at any time for any reason other than a medical purpose, he said.\nA physician by trade, Briggs isn\u2019t planning to carry legislation to change the abortion ban but said he will support measures to allow exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\nBriggs sent a letter to Brewer and Right to Life board members explaining his position.\nThough he thanked the organization for its efforts in overturning Roe v. Wade and reminded them that he co-sponsored the \u201ctrigger\u201d bill and helped defeat legislation allowing abortion pills by telemedicine, Briggs said the law needs clarification.\n\u201cA doctor who must operate for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or has to terminate an early pregnancy so he can save the life of a woman with acute leukemia should not be committing a crime,\u201d Briggs wrote. \u201cA physician dedicated to preserving a life God considers precious is not a felon whether he is charged or not. The right to life is for everyone for the whole life, not just the unborn.\u201d\nBriggs has defended physicians\u2019 oath to provide treatment to their patients, and in the letter he also said a child \u201cwho falls victim to a brutal rape or incest should not be forced by law to carry a pregnancy which could result in her never able to have a family of her own.\u201d\n\u201cMoral decision making is not always clear but means acting responsibly,\u201d his letter states.\n  State Sen. Richard Briggs. (Official photo: Tennessee General Assembly)\nBriggs told the Tennessee Lookout his biggest mistake in voting for the \u201ctrigger\u201d bill was that he didn\u2019t understand the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d portion of the bill.\nThe way the law is written, doctors are guilty until they can prove their innocence, which runs counter to normal judicial protections, and they must pay their own legal bills for providing the necessary care to save the mother\u2019s life, Briggs points out.\nIn the webinar conducted by Tennessee Right to Life and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, lawmakers were urged not to give in to calls to change the act.\nBrewer contended there is a difference between a pregnant woman bleeding in an emergency room in the middle of the night and a case in which a woman wants to end a pregnancy because she has a history of medical problems.\nThe Right to Life lobbyist claims those involved in the call didn\u2019t mislead legislators, nor does the language in the law.\n\u201cAnd I believe in a real-world application, there is an exception for the life of the mother, even if it\u2019s not phrased that way. It is an exception because prosecutors will take the possibility of an affirmative defense into their charging considerations, and so as you\u2019ve seen in Tennessee with our post-viability ban and as you\u2019ve seen in other states, nobody gets charged when there\u2019s affirmative defense when there\u2019s been a good-faith effort to do the right thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAbortion legislation pending to provide exceptions, save life of the mother\nby Sam Stockard, Tennessee Lookout November 22, 2022\nAbortion legislation pending to provide exceptions, save life of the mother\nby Sam Stockard, Tennessee Lookout November 22, 2022\n Just months after one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws took effect in Tennessee, Republican lawmakers are considering bills to provide exceptions, including for saving the life of the mother in a deadly pregnancy.\nState Sens.
