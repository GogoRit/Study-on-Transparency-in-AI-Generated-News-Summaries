Thirteen other Louisiana elected officials also signed the letter \u2014 including East Baton Rouge Parish Mayor President Sharon Weston Broome and half the Democrats in the Louisiana Senate.\n\nEdwards and others asked that the Democratic platform state that Americans have \u201cdiffering views\u201d on abortion. They also asked the national Democrats not to push Congress to pass a law ensuring abortion access or to allocate tax dollars for abortion. They said such stances make it difficult for Democrats to get elected in conservative areas and swing districts. \n\n\n\u201cAn extreme position on abortions violates our commitment to inclusivity and diversity,\u201d said the letter signed by the officials.\nEdwards has never been shy about his antiabortion stance.
