It \u201conly\u201d took 99 years after the end of the Civil War for Black Americans to be finally welcomed with full citizenship (the Civil Rights Act of 1964/Voting rights Act of 1965), it \u201conly\u201d took 72 years for all women to win the right to vote (from the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 to the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920), but it \u201conly\u201d required 49 years for the never-say-die (literally) right-to-life movement to see Roe reversed and some measure of legal protection restored for innocent, pre-born life.\u00a0For Subscribers:Will Louisville enforce Kentucky's abortion ban? Resistance is already growingMuch of the recent criticism from the pro-choice organizations has been directed at the five justices who voted to reverse Roe. But this great win for human rights has a much deeper foundation and history. This was a victory for a grassroots movement that began, at least here in Kentucky, even before Roe was handed down on Janaury 22, 1973.Louisville\u2019s own Margie Montgomery, a college-educated, former city editor for a New Jersey newspaper, civic volunteer\u00a0and mother of three children, was so appalled that California had legalized abortion in 1970 that she started \u2013 right there in her living room --a 50-year effort that would become a local, state\u00a0and even national pro-life movement.Many other local women supported her efforts \u2013 Jane Grimm, Margo Borders, Mary Lou Gray, Sally O\u2019Grady, Hilda Pullen, Darlene Pajo, Jane Peak, Rose Mohr, Mary Ann Schubert, Donna Durning\u00a0and many others I apologize for forgetting \u2013 whose own consciences were also shocked that in a country that supposedly revered all human life, pre-born babies\u2019 lives could now be \u201cterminated\u201d under the protection of the law.\u00a0The Dobbs decision was the culmination of the long-term effort the movement adopted at the outset with two over-arching goals: electing pro-life candidates to state legislatures that would pass bills to chip away at Roe that would lead to court challenges and, secondly, to put a pro-life President in the White House, a candidate that would promise to nominate similarly-minded individuals to fill Supreme Court vacancies.Neither of those aspirations, however fervent, could succeed without tremendous perseverance and dedication to their humanitarian cause. The Dobbs triumph would not have occurred without the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. every January 22, with hundreds of thousands bearing witness in the usual frostbitten cold to defending life, without similar rallies here in Louisville and on the steps of the Capitol in Frankfort, without the tens of thousands of Jefferson Countians who signed the annual two-full-page ads in this very newspaper every January to continue to decry the fearsome loss of millions of precious lives that will always be Roe\u2019s pernicious legacy, and without similar endeavors large and small \u2014 my sainted mother wrote occasional pro-life letters to the editor.For Subscribers:Advocates have a plan to restart abortions in Kentucky. Opponents have a plan to stop itAs I lived throughout this time, I continued to be impressed that the pro-life movement was predominately led by women. At the national level, there was Ellen McCormack who ran for President in 1976 (as a Democrat), prominent surgeons Drs. Carolyn Gerster and Mildred Jefferson, who grew the National Right to Life Committee into a potent political force and who worked around the world to preserve, protect\u00a0and defend the sanctity of all human life. As a legislator, I was inspired in my first term by female colleagues who were outspoken in their advocacy for the protection of the unborn, women like state Reps. Dolly McNutt (Paducah\u2019s first female Mayor), Louisville\u2019s Claudia Riner, and Lexington\u2019s Pat Freibert.\u00a0Now that the victory has been won, the thousands of problem pregnancy centers that opened across the country over the last five decades (there are over two dozen in Kentucky) must redouble their efforts and resources to provide compassionate support to convince troubled women to choose life for their babies rather than succumb to all-expenses-paid trips to California, New York, Illinois\u00a0or other states where\u00a0abortion will remain legal. While elective abortion might remain legal in some states, Roe is no longer the law of the United\u00a0States, and because of that, America is once again, in the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln, \u201cthe last, best hope of Earth.\u201dBob Heleringer is a Louisville attorney and former Kentucky state Representative.
