It\u2019s striking that one of the few ways for protestors to get the attention of D.C. officials is not by violence or vandalism, but by voicing love and concern for the preborn.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis case is about the constitutionality of government officials taking sides in a public debate,\u201d from\u00a0Frederick Douglass Foundation, Inc., et al. v.\u00a0District of Columbia,\u00a0Appeal No. 21-7108\u00a0(D.C. Cir.)\u00a0\nWASHINGTON D.C. (02-18-2022) \u2013\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA) and the Frederick Douglass Foundation (FDF) through their attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed an appeal this week in what is now an on-going free speech case against the District of Columbia. Following the violence of Black Live Matter protestors along with city-allowed painting of Black Lives Matter = Defunding Police on streets, SFLA and FDF organized\u00a0a peaceful protest in 2020\u00a0to pray, peacefully protest, and paint BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER in temporary paint, as D.C. police advised.\u00a0Click here to read the ADF filed brief.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported, police showed up at the event, telling those at the scene that they could not paint or chalk BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER, even though chalking is common practice at such protests.\u00a0Two students were arrested by police\u00a0as they began marking on a sidewalk outside of a Planned Parenthood in the nation\u2019s capital, leading to legal action.\u00a0\nObama appointed\u00a0U.S. District Court\u00a0Judge\u00a0James Boasberg\u00a0dismissed the case first brought, claiming that because police did not have concerns about a violent reaction from the peaceful protestors, applying ordinances against them\u00a0and not others was understandable.\u00a0\u00a0\nADF attorney Erin Hawley said: \u201cThe District of Columbia singled out Frederick Douglass Foundation and Students for Life of America for discriminatory treatment based on their pro-life message. The Metropolitan Police Department turned a blind eye towards certain favored speech while shutting down pro-life speech with which it disagreed. This is the essence of viewpoint discrimination and selective enforcement in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments.\u201d\u00a0\nClick\u00a0here for a\u00a0video\u00a0at\u00a0Breitbart\u00a0that illustrated D.C. police treatment of pro-life Americans compared to\u00a0Black\u00a0Lives\u00a0Matter\u00a0protestors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the appeal, ADF attorneys note:\u00a0\u201cIt was not until Plaintiffs\u2014pro-life groups concerned about the hun\u00addreds of thousands of unborn Black children killed by abortion each year\u2014requested a permit to gather and paint their own mural stating \u2018Black Pre-Born Lives Matter,\u2019 that the District rediscovered its Deface\u00adment Ordinance \u2026\u00a0It is not enough that the government enact neutral laws; it must also enforce them in a viewpoint-neutral way \u2026 While \u2018legitimate\u2019 distinguishing factors may result in differential enforcement, it is irrational for government to impose greater punishment on speakers who seek to comply with notice and permitting requirements and less on speakers who flaunt those requirements. Similarly, it would be illegitimate to subject small, peaceful demonstrations to more stringent enforcement than large-scale protests complete with the permanent defacement of public and private property.\u201d\u00a0\nGiven the way that D.C. law enforcement ignored the conduct of Black Lives Matter protestors compared to those supporting the BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER message, \u201c(t)his is evidence of \u2018a policy or practice of enforcing the Defacement Ordinance against speech it disagrees with and not enforcing against speech it prefers,\u2019\u201d said ADF on behalf of SFLA and FDF.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn an opinion piece at\u00a0Newsweek,\u00a0Hawkins along with Toni McFadden,\u00a0formerlyMinority Outreach and Healthy Relationships Director with Students for Life of America,addressed the issues at stake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey observe: \u201cThe issue here is constitutional fairness. Actors, artists, politicians and CEOs have the liberty under the First Amendment to voice support for abortion or omit preborn children from their activism. But governmental entities engage in unconstitutional overreach when they seek to bar pro-life citizens from expressing the position that\u00a0all\u00a0Black lives matter, that abortion is violence, and that the Black preborn child deserves protection.\u00a0\n\nTo read more about the 9 most common violations of student free speech,\u00a0click here to read Hawkins\u2019 op-ed in the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\u00a0Click to see a\u00a0VIDEO:\u00a0Cross Stomping, Attacks, Profanity, and Intimidation Common Nationwide as Pro-Life Students Speak up for the Preborn and their\u00a0Mothers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor interviews, contact Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or \u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\n\u201330\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages.
