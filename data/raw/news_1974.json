    "description": "A wave of newly approved abortion restrictions in the Southeastern United States has sent providers scrambling to reconfigure their services for a region with already severely limited access. South Carolina\u2019s governor signed a bill Thursday banning most abortions around six weeks of pregnancy, setting up an anticipated legal challenge from providers. The law Thursday goes into effect immediately. Pending bans at varying stages of pregnancy in North Carolina and Florida are threatening to further delay abortions for patients as appointments pile up and doctors work to understand the new limitations. The states had been holdouts providing wider access to the procedure in the region.",

(AP) \u2014 A wave of newly approved abortion restrictions in the Southeastern United States has sent providers scrambling to reconfigure their services for a region with already severely limited access.Stiff limitations enacted in South Carolina and pending in North Carolina and Florida \u2014 states that had been holdouts providing wider access to the procedure \u2014 are threatening to further delay abortions as appointments pile up and doctors work to understand the latest constraints.\u201cThere\u2019s really going to be no way for the whole abortion-providing ecosystem to manage it all,\u201d said Jenny Black, the president of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.Black, who oversees the organization\u2019s work in North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and parts of Virginia, said providers have had to quickly determine how to comply with the pending laws amid the \u201cdecimation of abortion access across the South.\u201d She expects new restrictions will compound the stressors on a system that was already seeing lengthy waiting periods in North Carolina driven by an influx of patients from Georgia and Tennessee.\n\nAbortion is severely restricted in much of the South, including bans throughout pregnancy in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Georgia, it\u2019s allowed only in the first six weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina joined its neighbors rolling back the procedure Thursday when the governor signed a bill banning most abortions around six weeks of pregnancy. But providers quickly filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law that resembles one already deemed a violation of the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy by the South Carolina Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a great day for life in South Carolina, but the fight is not over. We stand ready to defend this legislation against any challenges and are confident we will succeed,\u201d Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. \n\nA report released in early April by the Society of Family Planning found rising numbers of abortions in states near those with the deepest restrictions but where abortion had remained largely legal. Florida and North Carolina were among the states with the biggest increases \u2014 and among those where new limits are pending. Most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy will be banned in North Carolina beginning July 1 and a six-week ban in Florida will take effect only if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court.South Carolina had also proven to be a key destination for people seeking abortions. Provisional state Health Department data showed larger numbers of out-of-state patients after the state\u2019s highest court overturned previous restrictions and left abortion legal through 22 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law will change that status, according to Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College. Myers, who studies the effects of reproductive policies, said limited evidence suggests about half of the people who want abortions won\u2019t be able to make the six-week threshold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely to end up sending a lot of desperate people seeking abortions even farther distances and result in even greater congestion at the facilities that are left to receive them,\u201d Myers said.Jessica Tarleton, an OB-GYN in Charleston, anticipates sending patients outside the state for abortions. She said the new law will disproportionately affect those who lack financial means for child care, hotels and air travel. Most women who get abortions are already mothers, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.The action comes as many state legislatures convene for their first regular sessions since the U.S. Supreme Court struck federal abortion protections. Over the past two months, Republican officials in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida have pushed Virginia closer to being a regional outlier as a place with relatively permissive access.The tide of state-level activity has been welcomed by anti-abortion groups who had long chipped away at access. Caitlin Connors, the southern regional director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, celebrated the recent legislative changes as victories made possible by last summer\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cWe are officially in an era where states who have tried to pass pro-life legislation \u2014 laws that would protect unborn children, laws that would also implement services for moms and families and babies \u2014 to finally be able to be enacted and not be under the chokehold of the Roe v. Wade decision,\u201d Connors said.That shifting landscape has also heightened uncertainty among providers that has kept them from expanding services, Myers said, and likely will prevent some patients from getting abortions as doctors weigh what is and isn\u2019t permissible.Erica Pettigrew, a family medicine doctor in North Carolina, said the new constraints will make it much more difficult for her to help patients navigate the system. Although North Carolina Republicans pitched the new 12-week limit as a middle-ground change, Pettigrew pointed to other provisions that make it much more restrictive.\n\nNew hurdles require that women make in-person visits to a medical professional at least 72 hours before the procedure. The three-day waiting period could previously be initiated over the phone. The law also requires a doctor to schedule a follow-up visit for women who have a medically induced abortion, increasing the hardship on those who travel from other states.Those regulations will make it harder to advise patients on their options, she said, especially when waiting periods already spanned two to four weeks in some cases.Other delays may result from what Pettigrew called unclear exceptions for certain life-threatening conditions.\u201cNow we\u2019re in this horrible purgatory of trying to figure out how to interpret it, how we can comply with the law,\u201d Pettigrew said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many unknowns.\u201dImmediate reproductive care has been slowed in states restricting abortion, and Tarleton believes South Carolina will be no different. The new law mandates that doctors document their rationale for inducing an abortion under a list of excepted circumstances and make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to avoid the procedure. She expects to seek legal advice when treating patients for early pregnancy complications and miscarriages, which she fears will increase maternal mortality in a region where many states already report some of the nation\u2019s worst rates.\u201cWe are likely to see sicker pregnant patients, sicker babies,\u201d Tarleton said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to start happening now that there\u2019s really no place to turn in the Southeast for this kind of care.\u201d\u2014-Associated Press writer Hannah Schoenbaum contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina.
