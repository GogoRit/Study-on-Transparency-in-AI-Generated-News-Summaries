As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said recently, \u201cThe Beijing Conference was a watershed; a landmark; a turning point. \u2026 But we have not fulfilled the ambitious vision of the Beijing Declaration.\u201d\nWhy? The equal rights of women and men are enshrined in the UN Charter, penned 75 years ago. The benefits of gender equality, for everyone, everywhere, have been extensively and repeatedly documented \u2014 in fact, more than 100 countries said as much at a significant meeting at the UN about the Beijing anniversary.\nVolkan Bozkir, President of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, speaks with Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres ahead of the opening of the General Assembly high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.

UN Women, with the governments of Mexico and France, will host two Generation Equality Forums in 2021, with the aim of putting forth an action-oriented agenda for gender equality. Generation Equality needs to be history-making, galvanizing, and truly transformative so we don\u2019t lose another generation\u2019s worth of progress. A tall order.\nTo understand what happened then and where we are now, I asked my colleagues what they recall from the Beijing era of the global women\u2019s movement and what they want now. I also asked several of our current and former Girl Up Teen Advisors, who are the present and future of collective feminist leadership, what they want next. This is what I learned.\nCareful negotiations and confronting the opposition\nMelinda Kimble served as a key negotiator for the U.S. government at the Beijing conference and at the human rights and development conferences that preceded it in Vienna and Cairo.\nShe remembers the task forces, working groups, and countless individuals that began negotiating language as early as 1993. Important ideas about women\u2019s rights and states\u2019 obligations traveled from conference to conference, gathering strength. Opposition groups did, too.\nThe International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 \u201cwas a leap forward and a seminal shift,\u201d Kimble remembers, pushing forward the agenda for sexual and reproductive health and rights and laying the groundwork for consensus at Beijing a year later. Unlike today, the U.S. was then pushing for more progressive language and was carefully negotiating with other countries in an effort to hold together a coalition of the willing. As part of that effort, Kimble helped to pull together a negotiating bloc that was so effective it was applauded in the plenary negotiations.\nThe decisions made in Beijing had lasting and far-reaching effects, she says. National governments returned home and enacted violence against women laws as part of Beijing and increased funding for women and girls to prevent and treat HIV, a key topic of discussion at the conference. Looking back, Kimble considers the Beijing Platform for Action to be a breakthrough in its insistence on a holistic approach for gender equality. She also remembers then-first lady Hillary Clinton making her famous speech declaring that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d to a crowd on its feet and in the aisles.\nHowever, Kimble notes, \u201cImplementing it has been a fight. It is phenomenal to think how long ago Beijing was, and how long it takes to move the needle on this. It is distressing to think that the Beijing language is the best we can do. But the other side of the coin is that it gives us a baseline to build on, and that is what is really important about Beijing.\u201d\nIlze Melngailis was early in her career when she attended the Beijing conference as part of the Latvian government delegation. She was only 25 and had just founded the Latvian Association for Family Planning and Sexual Health. \u201cWhen the Beijing meeting was announced, I knew it was something big,\u201d she said. \u201cI got to witness the UN in action on an issue I was passionate about \u2014 reproductive health and family planning. I experienced firsthand the beautiful democracy of the UN and how every country had an equal voice in arguing what the global declaration needed to say.\u201d\nShe remembers the diversity of women and the range of perspectives on gender equality and \u201ccountless hours of fighting over words like \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019 \u2014 little words that made a big difference in the final negotiations.\u201d What she didn\u2019t expect was seeing what she believed to be fundamental rights up for debate. \u201cI remember the craziness of having questions about women\u2019s \u2014 and my own \u2014 rights decided by all these people.\u201d\nThe Beijing backlash\nMayra Buvinic was president of the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) when she boarded the plane to Beijing. A contributor to the efforts of the UN\u2019s International Women\u2019s Year (1975) and previous UN World Conferences on Women in Copenhagen (1980) and Nairobi (1985), she noticed more enthusiasm, more visibility, more financial support, and a stronger community of global grassroots advocates in Beijing.\nA general view of attendees at the Non-Governmental organizations Forum held in Huairou, China. The Forum was part of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women which convened in Beijing, China on 4-15 September 1995.\nGlobal advocates gathered in Huairou, a suburb of Beijing, where they coped with rain, mud, and transport issues, as well as surveillance by the Chinese government, which had stashed the advocates far from the conference center in hopes of limiting their influence and action. Still, Buvinic remembers the 1995 conference as impressive and exciting. \u201cIt was a big moment for the women\u2019s movement. All this rights language that had been pushed for earlier \u2014 it got recognized and formalized at Beijing.\u201d\nBuvinic adds that \u201cit was all wonderful and then it all went very quiet, and that is the most interesting story. There was a backlash globally. There was an economic recession, fundamentalism, donors cut back on gender equality, and everyone retreated, but it tells you a story of what Beijing did not do: There was a lot of rhetoric but not much follow-up. That is what needs to be understood now and guarded against. These conferences are motivational; they help crystallize rights language on a global scale; they summarize \u2014 but there should be a strong follow-through.\u201d\nWorking alongside Buvinic, Geeta Rao Gupta was vice president of ICRW at the time and deeply involved in Beijing preparation. At the last minute, a family health issue kept her in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor me,\u201d Gupta recalls, Beijing \u201cwas the recognition of the work we had been doing in the shadows, on the margins of what was considered international development work. For the first time, there was international recognition that this was an important area that needed government commitments, to address barriers of women\u2019s rights and access \u2014 to acknowledge and recognize women\u2019s rights. Beijing was a high point where we hoped we would get recognition.\u201d\nGupta also emphasizes the key roles of funders in supporting women\u2019s organizations. Five big foundations had a joint strategy to deliver critical funding for women\u2019s rights organizations.\n\u201cAs soon as the Platform for Action was supported by national governments, this funding dried up. We watched in horror as many grassroots women\u2019s organizations had to close their doors,\u201d Gupta laments. To implement this agenda, she argues, we need a strong and organized civil society that holds governments accountable to their commitments. Without funding, for example, there has been a loss of momentum and a backlash against reproductive rights. \u201cThe civil society presence that could have withstood this backlash was greatly weakened,\u201d she said.\nThe new generation pushing for progress\nWhat does Gen Z know about Beijing? The youth advocates I spoke to \u2014 who are on the frontlines of current social justice movements \u2014 have never heard of the 1995 Beijing conference or identified it as central to our global feminist histories. What does that mean for our collective striving? What do they want to see next year as the world prepares to gather in Mexico and France?\nYoung activists like those in Girl Up are giving us hope and leading the way toward Generation Equality.\nLeena Abdelmoity is a college student with a passion for refugee-related issues, stemming from her own background. Abdelmoity\u2019s particular concern for women and girls living in refugee camps led her to establish a nonprofit, Light for Refugees Foundation, to provide solar lights in refugee camps, to prevent sexual harassment, and to allow for nighttime studying, with its first camp in Greece. Abdelmoity says Generation Equality must \u201crecognize the differences of women and girls \u2014 their locations, the different crises they face \u2026 women of color and marginalized backgrounds face unique challenges. Being a woman has many components, whether it is race, personal experience. To generalize women to a page is not doing justice to the diversity of women.\u201d\nEmily Lin, a high school senior in Taiwan, was motivated by the prevalent challenges of sexual harassment, domestic violence, and public harassment \u2014 significant issues in Asia \u2014 to start a Girl Up Club in 2017. \u201cGender equality is a very big topic with many subtopics,\u201d Lin says, noting the \u201cstigmatization of groups, stereotypes of Asian women, the discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. Different countries will have different topics to focus on. We need to come together to work for the same movement.\u201d\nVanessa Louis-Jean is a racial and gender justice activist from South Carolina. Growing up in a rural town, her journey toward feminist activism started in her high school freshman year. She began exploring social injustices and the slow pace of change and vowed to be an agent of change herself. Her activism is fiercely intersectional and focused on racial justice and feminism. The Girl Up Club that she founded has fostered a safe space for discussions on colorism, unrealistic beauty standards, and much more.\nFor Louis-Jean, Generation Equality needs to be about a fundamental shift in power. \u201cThe power of the people will make a drastic difference instead of decision-makers,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should take the mic back. We need to be able to amplify our voices. Give voice back to the voiceless.\u201d\nThe energy and ambitions of this emerging generation, and the lessons of Beijing gleaned from those who were there, give us hope for the path ahead and guidance to heed along the way toward Generation Equality in 2021.\nGupta hopes for a re-energized civil society movement and that \u201cyoung women and young men will organize \u2014 differently from the way we did when we were younger. They will find commonality across different injustices in a way we didn\u2019t do as well in the past and use social media to affect change. They are fighting against inequalities of different kinds within a feminist agenda \u2014 and I hope this becomes the new women\u2019s movement.\u201d She adds that she wants to see women in leadership positions at all levels. \u201cWe should demand leadership, to hold positions of power ourselves.\u201d\nMelngailis says, \u201cIt is time to set a new bar of genuine equality and hold everyone accountable to it.\u201d Meanwhile, Buvinic stresses the importance of what happens after Generation Equality. \u201cYou have to make sure with Generation Equality that you establish the mechanisms that will allow this to be sustained over time, including accountability and implementation,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that it\u2019s a more complicated world, it is doubly important to do that.\u201d\n\nNext year we must build on the hard work of the many women and men who came before us \u2014 an extraordinary lineage of activists and advocates, practitioners and researchers, leaders and allies \u2014 and put the voices of our youngest advocates out front and center, to demand transformative change, and lasting progress. In 25 years, we want the world to feel that we fulfilled the \u201cambitious vision\u201d of gender equality for all of us \u2014 and that includes the 5-year-old girls who are watching us now and will be watching us then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirls and Women\n\n\n\n\n\n25 Years After Beijing, Gender Equality Demands a Renewed Push for Gender Data\n\n                By \n                                  Emily Courey Pryor\nSarah Boyd\n\n                October 1, 2020\n              \n\n                Read More\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirls and Women\n\n\n\n\nGiving Girls a Voice, and a Vote\n\n                By \n                                  Susannah Rosenblatt\n\n                August 14, 2020\n              \n\n                Read More\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovid19\nGirls and Women\nGlobal Health\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shadow Pandemic: How the COVID-19 Crisis is Exacerbating Gender Inequality\n\n                By \n                                  Michelle Milford Morse\nGrace Anderson\n\n                April 14, 2020\n              \n\n                Read More\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to know\r\nwhat we're up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\n\nIssues\nInitiatives\nCommunities\n\n\nWhy We Do It\n\nOverview\n\n\nWho We Are\n\nOur Approach\nOur Financials\nOur Mission and History\nOur Partners\n\n\nGet Involved\n\nGive\nLearn\nAct\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York Office\nUnited Nations Foundation\n320 East 43rd Street, 3rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10017\nPhone: 212.697.3315\nWashington, D.C.
