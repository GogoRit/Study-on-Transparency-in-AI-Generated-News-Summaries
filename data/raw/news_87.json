The movement is called the Women\u2019s Strike, with a red lightning bolt as its symbol. The fight started in 2016, when women bearing black umbrellas rallied against attempts to ban abortion. Polish illustrators have shown their support with art. For more images and an interview with the artist behind the bolt, go to marlenaagency.com/women-strike-in-poland. \n\n\n\n\n\n Ola Jasionowska \n\n (Marysia Machulska) \n\n (Agata Nowicka) \n\n (Kasia Bogda\u0144ska) \n\n (Joanna Grochocka) \n\n (Kasia Bogda\u0144ska) \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
