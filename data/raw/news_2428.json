For decades, the Buffett Foundation\u2014supported by business magnate Warren and named for his late wife\u2014has poured incredible sums into the most powerful abortion lobbies in the world. From pushing unrestricted abortion access to testing experimental abortion pills on impoverished Africans, these groups are advancing an extremist agenda with billions of dollars from one of America\u2019s most-celebrated philanthropists\u2014and with almost no scrutiny from the media.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not exactly the face of abortion activism. When most Americans think of Warren Buffett\u2014the famed Wizard of Omaha and third-richest man on Earth\u2014other things come to mind: the brilliant investor and founder of mega-conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, outspoken Democratic Party donor, and accomplished philanthropist.\nIt\u2019s his charity that\u2019s earned this notoriously frugal arch-capitalist (he still lives in the house he bought in 1958 for $31,500) the most acclaim from the otherwise free-market-skeptic media. Liberal pundits and philanthropoids gushed over Buffett\u2019s 2006 \u201cGiving Pledge,\u201d an oath to gradually give away 99 percent of his wealth. (Other elites such as Bill and Melinda Gates, Paul Allen, and Michael Bloomberg have also taken the pledge.) In 2011, President Barack Obama even hosted Buffett in the White House for an \u201cupdate\u201d on the Giving Pledge\u2019s progress. CNBC has celebrated Buffett as America\u2019s \u201cmost charitable billionaire.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a darker side to Buffett\u2019s multi-billion-dollar philanthropy. For decades, he\u2019s donated vast sums to a foundation created to address what one biographer called Buffett\u2019s \u201cMalthusian dread\u201d of overpopulation\u2014the thoroughly debunked idea that humans will reproduce themselves into mass starvation and death, named for the 19th century British scholar Thomas Malthus. Given his enormous wealth and single-minded commitment, Warren Buffett may be the biggest funder of abortion in history.\nBillions for Millions of Abortions\nAccording to my analysis, over the past two decades the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation has poured an incredible $4 billion into pro-abortion, pro-population control groups, easily making Warren Buffett the single most important supporter of abortion-on-demand in our day. In that period (2000\u20132018), the foundation\u2019s grants totaled $5.5 billion, meaning 73 percent of the Buffett Foundation\u2019s grant money went to anti-life groups.\nTo put that in perspective, Buffett\u2019s billions are enough to pay for 8 million abortions according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion think tank, at an average cost of roughly $500 per aborted fetus. That\u2019s the entire population of Arizona or the equivalent of the people in nine states: Wyoming, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, and Vermont.\nIt\u2019s a stunning revelation from a foundation so shadowy that even its liberal admirers call it \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201cpublicity-shy.\u201d But these are understatements. A recent (and favorable) profile by the Inside Philanthropy website commented on the difficulty in simply contacting the Buffett Foundation: \u201cTrying to penetrate this place is like being a tourist asking around for the Mafia in Little Italy.\u201d\nThe Buffett Foundation is one of the largest grantmaking foundations in America. In 2018, it gave away $624 million in grants, almost $100 million more than the Ford Foundation ($535 million) and enough to earn Warren Buffett infamy as the \u201cKing of Abortion\u201d in pro-life circles. The president of Students for Life, a center-right college group, once deemed Buffett the \u201csugar daddy of the entire pro-abortion movement.\u201d\nHis largesse has also won him acclaim in the pro-abortion camp. \u201cHave an IUD? Thank Warren Buffett,\u201d the Washington Post pronounced in 2015, referring to grants his foundation gave in the early 2000s to develop modern intrauterine devices for preventing pregnancies.\nEven far-left Vox\u2014whose writers often disparage the very existence of billionaires as \u201ca policy failure\u201d\u2014grudgingly praises Buffett. \u201cIf you could snap your fingers and rid the world of billionaire philanthropists instantly,\u201d it wrote in 2019 of Buffett\u2019s philanthropy, \u201chundreds of millions of women worldwide would lose access to contraception.\u201d\nYet the Buffett Foundation is almost nonexistent in the mainstream news. Although it\u2019s been in operation since 1964, the group\u2019s simple, out-of-date website offers information about scholarships for college freshmen in Nebraska (Buffett\u2019s home state), nothing more: \u201cThe Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation responds to questions about college scholarships only. The Foundation does not respond to other inquiries.\u201d\nPerhaps left-leaning NPR summarized it best in 2006: \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t know Warren Buffett\u2019s foundation has been funding abortion rights organizations? Well, that\u2019s just the way the Buffetts wanted it.\u201d\nAbortion\u2019s Underground Railroad\nAlthough Warren Buffett is better known for his investment strategies than his support for population control, his involvement in pro-abortion activism predates the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 and is largely attributable to Charles Munger, Buffett\u2019s close friend and Number Two at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger, a Republican, described his views in a 2000 interview: \u201cIt was emotionally hard for me to become pro-choice because I do have reverence for human life, but when I thought through the consequences, I found it necessary to overrule that part of my nature.\u201d\nMunger convinced Buffett to join him in paying for the legal defense of Leon Belous, a California doctor convicted in 1967 of administering an illegal abortion; Belous\u2019s appeal in that case led the California Supreme Court to declare the state\u2019s ban on abortion unconstitutional in a 4-3 vote two years later. The Left still hails Belous as a hero for advancing the nation\u2019s abortion laws, and his case was cited in the pro-choice appellants\u2019 brief in Roe v. Wade four years later.\nAt the same time as the Belous case, Munger and Buffett organized a \u201cchurch\u201d run by a minister who had broken with his congregation over his own pro-abortion views. By the pair\u2019s own admission, the so-called Ecumenical Fellowship was far from a religious institution; instead, it acted as a roving counselor on \u201cfamily planning,\u201d aiding women in obtaining abortions outside the United States in the late 1960s.\nWarren and I were revolutionaries. We created a church that was used as an underground railroad. We supported the Clergy Counseling Service [a group of liberal ministers who arranged abortions for women outside the U.S.]. The minister running it was cashiered by his own church for helping women get abortions. First I tried to persuade the church to let him continue. That failed. I called Warren and asked him to help me establish our own church. That we did. For years this minister ran the thing. That was our contribution, trying to help so that society didn\u2019t force women to give birth\u2014to be held in a system [ecologist and overpopulation alarmist] Garrett Hardin called \u201cmandatory motherhood.\u201d\nAlthough this \u201cunderground railroad\u201d lost its purpose after abortion was legalized nationwide after Roe v. Wade, Munger continued his activism for years as a trustee and chief financial officer for the Los Angeles chapter of Planned Parenthood. He merged the Ecumenical Fellowship into the chapter and advised it on getting into the abortion business. Munger later bragged that \u201cwe were way ahead of the national office of Planned Parenthood in arranging abortions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the next installment of \u201cTerror of the Unborn,\u201d trace Warren Buffett\u2019s obsession with population control.\n\nTags: \u00a0Terror of the Unborn\n\n\nHayden Ludwig\n\nHayden Ludwig is the Director of Policy Research at Restoration of America.
