For women in those towns, fear and confusion reigns.By\u00a0Melissa JeltsenSenior Reporter, HuffPostMar 2, 2020, 05:45 AM ESTLEAVE A COMMENTMark Lee Dickson holds one of the plastic \"fetal models\" in the cab of his truck.Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostBIG SPRING, TEXAS \u2014 Mark Lee Dickson squeezed a plastic toy fetus in his right hand as he drove down the highway. Small and soft, it resembled a fetus in its 12th week of development, about the size of a fat baby carrot. Two more of them sat in Dickson\u2019s center console. The 34-year-old pastor carried them around as props.\u201cMy thought was when I first saw one was, it\u2019s a baby!\u201d Dickson said. \u201cThat\u2019s how most people react. No one has ever taught them this is what a child looks like at this stage.\u201d Advertisement\n\nDickson, who wore a backwards baseball cap over his shaggy hair, referred to the toys as anatomically correct. (An OB-GYN I consulted said they were oversimplified.) It was late January, and Dickson was on his way to Big Spring in west Texas, population 28,000, where the city council was about to vote on an ordinance to ban abortion. The ordinance was Dickson\u2019s idea. After Alabama effectively banned abortion last year \u2014 the unconstitutional law has not gone into effect \u2014 and other states raced to restrict abortion at earlier and earlier stages of pregnancy, he had the terrible feeling that Texas was lagging behind. He also worried that as neighboring states made it harder for abortion clinics to operate, providers would cross the border into Texas. So he came up with a plan. If cities could ban plastic straws, he asked, why not abortion?Mark Lee Dickson spends his time driving town to town, meeting with local lawmakers and encouraging them to pass abortion bans. Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostSince last summer, he has crisscrossed Texas in his truck, encouraging municipalities to declare themselves \u201csanctuary cities for the unborn\u201d and pass ordinances outlawing abortion. His first success story was Waskom, a city of under 2,000 residents in east Texas, which banned abortion last June. At publication time, 12 towns had passed abortion bans lobbied by Dickson. (One town, Omaha, later walked it back under advice from city attorneys.) Four other towns had voted his ordinance down. Dickson has a list of 400 Texas towns to go.Advertisement\n\nThe ordinances, as they stand, are unconstitutional. Abortion is legal in Texas and no state or local laws can change that. Dickson\u2019s \u201cattempts to analogize this situation to actions that are not protected by the Constitution, like banning plastic straws, are a direct attempt to mislead the public about the nature of the Constitution and the rights it protects,\u201d said Drucilla Tigner, reproductive rights political strategist at ACLU of Texas. Dickson is not shy about his desire to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion. If he happened to spur a legal challenge that prompted the Supreme Court to reconsider abortion rights, he said, he\u2019d thank whomever sued. Confusion Is The PointDickson and his supporters say the ordinances are mainly preventative, designed to stop abortion clinics from setting up in towns that do not currently offer abortion services, but critics say there\u2019s a more sinister plan afoot. \u201cThe point is to create a sense of confusion,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at Guttmacher Institute. Peddle enough false claims, and people seeking an abortion won\u2019t know how and if they can obtain one, even while the procedure remains safe and legal. Misinformation is the \u201cbread and butter\u201d of anti-abortion groups, she said. \u201cThey are trying to stigmatize abortion, shame patients and vilify providers.\u201d The ordinances lobbied by Dickson go even further to besiege every aspect of abortion. They define abortion as premeditated murder and declare that organizations that provide abortions are criminal. They also make it unlawful to help anyone get an abortion within the city limits or provide any information about self-managed abortion. Family members of someone who has received an abortion would gain the right to sue the provider for \u201cemotional distress.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nBig Spring does not have an abortion clinic for which abortions need to be prevented. But for local residents (and other towns that have passed such bans), the ordinances have sown fear and confusion. In the lead-up to the vote, women in Big Spring told me they didn\u2019t know if they were allowed to seek an abortion anywhere else were the measure to pass, or if they could be punished for abortions obtained in the past. Some worried about offering reproductive advice to others, or lending money to friends seeking abortion care out of town. Others questioned whether they could still buy emergency contraception, or even speak openly about abortion at all. Standing Up For RightsBig Spring, a small oil patch town in west Texas, sits in the middle of an abortion desert. There are more than 60 churches here, but the closest abortion services provider is in Fort Worth, around 250 miles away. It wasn\u2019t always this way. In early 2012, abortions were available at Planned Parenthood clinics in Abilene, Midland, San Angelo and Lubbock, all less than a two-hour drive. Then state budget cuts forced the Abilene clinic to close. The other three clinics ceased operations after Texas passed a sweeping anti-abortion law in 2013 requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers. Advertisement\n\nThose regulations were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016, but it was too late: Over half of the state\u2019s clinics had shuttered. West Texas was hit particularly hard. According to a recent study, of the five cities in the U.S. where people must travel the farthest to reach an abortion clinic, four are in west Texas. Long distances to reach a clinic, paired with onerous restrictions and prohibitive costs, have left women attempting abortions on their own. In Texas, women try to end their pregnancies themselves three times more often than women anywhere else.On the morning of the ordinance vote, I met with Stephanie Vela Anderson, 39, a third-generation Mexican American who was born in Big Spring and lived there until 2009. The night before, she drove six hours back to her hometown, through a lightning storm, so that she could protest Dickson\u2019s actions. It was personal to her.In 1997, when Anderson was 17, she became unexpectedly pregnant. At the state-run health clinic in town, a nurse told her that she could get an abortion about an hour away if she wanted, but her mother wouldn\u2019t allow it. In their Catholic family, termination was not an option. Anderson\u2019s church was somewhat accepting of her pregnancy out of wedlock, she said. They threw her a baby shower, and gave her diapers and onesies. But still, she was overcome by feelings of guilt. She no longer believed God loved her, she said. \u201cIt was common knowledge that if you\u2019re having sex, you\u2019re a slut,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very lonely place to be a pregnant teenager.\u201d Anderson now lives in Austin with her partner. She has three children and works in customer service for an internet company. She is also a visual artist. Despite her conflicted feelings about her hometown, she returns often to visit friends, and it was on a recent trip when she read in the Big Spring Herald that an out-of-town pastor was attempting to ban abortion there. Advertisement\n\nStephanie Vela Anderson, who grew up in Big Spring, is helping to organize against Dickson's abortion bans.Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostShe was flooded with anger, imagining a pregnant teen girl like herself, living at home with religious parents, scared and lonely and trying to work out what to do. There was already so much stigma around abortion in Big Spring, she said. Dickson\u2019s ordinance would only make things worse. Anderson went on Facebook to vent. Soon, she connected with another woman in east Texas doing the same thing after her town passed one of Dickson\u2019s bans. (That woman, a college student, asked to remain anonymous due to fears of judgment by her conservative family.) Together, they now manage a private Facebook group where they organize against the bans, bringing together hundreds of women from across the state. Online, some Big Spring women were furious about the proposed ordinance, and worried about its implications. But they were scared to speak in public. Most of them were members of local churches. They were small business owners, or worked for the town. Some expressed anxiety about having their hours cut, or losing their jobs entirely. Others didn\u2019t want to be ostracized in their social circles. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal ... there\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d one woman told me. \u201cThis is a small west Texas town. Everyone knows everything about everyone.\u201d In the Facebook group, one member who worked in Human Resources offered advice on what to do if a person\u2019s job was threatened due to their political views. When I met with Anderson, at a motel in town, she was getting ready to stage a protest outside city hall. For weeks, she had been urging Big Spring women to attend. It was important that the town see visible resistance, she said. Some of them agreed to participate. But the closer the time of the protest came, the more Anderson\u2019s phone chirped with bad news. Woman after woman dropped out. For a brief moment, it appeared that Anderson would be leading the protest alone. The evaporating support surfaced old feelings from her childhood, she said. Once again, she was isolated and vulnerable. Advertisement\n\n\u201cI feel like women are always going to lose in west Texas,\u201d she said. Still, she gathered her protest signs and got in her car. One Person Makes A Difference Dickson is from White Oak, a small town in east Texas, an hour from the Louisiana border. In 2012, he joined the \u201cfront lines of the abortion battle,\u201d he said, when he began preaching outside Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, located about 20 miles from Texas. That clinic is now at the center of a major abortion case headed to the Supreme Court. Oral arguments are scheduled for Wednesday.At issue is a restrictive Louisiana law that requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. (It was modeled on and is virtually identical to the Texas law that was struck down by the court in 2016.)If the law prevails, it is estimated that only one clinic will remain open in the state. Dickson, who supports the Louisiana law, worried that it would have the unintended effect of causing an influx of abortion clinics into Texas. So one day last summer, he decided to go on the road, becoming something of a traveling salesman for municipal abortion bans. In the months since, he has driven to dozens of Texas towns, pitching his ban to anyone who is receptive. Advertisement\n\nMark Lee Dickson drives by a group of people protesting the proposed abortion ban. Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostOn the day of the Big Spring vote, I rode with Dickson to city hall. His truck was littered with candy, newspapers, fetal models and a warning ticket for speeding. As we approached the meeting, I asked what had led him to this particular calling. Dickson responded by describing his love for the movie \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d in which the main character, George Bailey, gets to see what the world would have looked like had he not been born. Dickson was struck by the idea of how much one person can influence another. \u201cThe absence of one person leaves a void in so many other lives,\u201d he said, a tear rolling down his cheek. As he saw it, life was precious and shouldn\u2019t be thrown away. Since he was young, he said, he had retained a childlike sense of wonder about his own existence. \u201cI have these moments where I stare at my hand and pinch myself and I\u2019m blown away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here! This is not a dream!\u201d I asked him if he had ever had a personal experience with abortion \u2015 if a girlfriend had experienced an unintended pregnancy and had to make a difficult decision about starting or expanding a family. He had not. \u201cI\u2019m a virgin,\u201d he said. He would like a family one day, he added, and sometimes feels lonely. He has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts in the past. \u201cI would love to have companionship,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is where God has me right now.\u201dA Town DividedAnderson arrived at city hall with her stomach in knots. But she was not alone. Around a dozen people showed up to protest, and they stood close together, holding their signs up for the cars that passed. A few beeped. Advertisement\n\nAnderson had focused her poster \u2015 CITY PENSION B4 CHURCH ORDINANCE \u2015 on the possible financial ramifications of the ordinance. It could open Big Spring up to costly litigation, she worried, and the town could not afford it. (Her fear would prove prescient: In the time I was reporting this story, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against seven towns that passed similar ordinances. Dickson has said he has a legal team that will defend the towns and cover any costs incurred, though he declined to offer details on who was footing the bill.) Stephanie Vela Anderson leads a small protest in Big Spring. \"Growing up here, I have no patience for people who want to dictate the choices of others,\" she said. Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostA half-hour before the meeting was scheduled to begin, Anderson got in line. The city chambers fit only 86 people and while normally meetings were sparsely attended, the past two times that the abortion ban was discussed the room had filled to capacity and latecomers were forced to wait outside. Dickson arrived too, and joined the end of the line. Once inside, people soon divided themselves between those who supported the ordinance and those who did not. Nearly everyone was white. (Almost half the town is Hispanic, according to census data.) Mayor Shannon Thomason, a Libertarian, called the meeting to order with his cell phone propped up by a bible. Anderson sat in one of the first rows, her face furrowed; Dickson picked a chair on the far wall and removed his hat. Mayor Thomason addressed the attendees and invited them to share their opinions about the ordinance. He explained that they had to give their name and address before they spoke, a requirement of the city administrative code. In the front of the room, a woman trained her video camera on the podium; a local news station was streaming the meeting online.Advertisement\n\nMany of the women who protested outside before the meeting did not speak. They later told me they were afraid of publicly declaring their position on abortion to the crowd. Those who did testify against the ordinance shied away from sharing their personal views on abortion. Instead, they argued that the city had no place in dictating a women\u2019s health care choices. Others, choosing to sidestep the contentious issue altogether, worried that the hastily written ordinance \u2014 Roe was misspelled as \u201cRow\u201d in the version offered online \u2014 would backfire on the town, opening it up to litigation.Supporters of the ordinance urged council members to vote yes, often employing incendiary language. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t pro-life then just call it what it is ... you are in support of the murder of innocent lives,\u201d said a woman named Wendy who taught junior high school. \u201cIt is not pro-life, it is pro-death!\u201d She picked up her child in a bassinet and immediately left. Others compared abortion to the Holocaust.Left: Mark Lee Dickson waits his turn to speak at the Big Spring city council meeting. Right: Stephanie Vela Anderson begs the council to defeat the measure.Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostMost everyone spoke about God. \u201cMaybe abortion is a sin, but maybe it is the only option a woman has not to ruin her life,\u201d said John Ferguson, a 91-year-old lawyer and Sunday school teacher. \u201cThis is a matter between a woman and her God.\u201d Advertisement\n\nBack and forth, the town went.When it was Dickson\u2019s turn to speak, the young pastor kept his remarks short, reminding the council members that they were elected to represent the people in their districts, not their own personal views. \u201cHate evil and love good; establish justice in the city gate,\u201d he said, quoting a bible passage. \u201cPerhaps the lord, the God of Hosts, will be gracious on the city of Big Spring.\u201d Then Anderson was up. She shook a little, and turned to address the council. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to connect with people right now on the other side,\u201d she said. She went on, looking around the room. She had heard a lot about protecting life, but none of the supporters of the ordinance seemed to care much about mothers and children in Big Spring. Where was this urgency when it came to addressing the real problems in town, like poverty or homelessness or the fact that there was no domestic violence shelter there? What about rampant child abuse, or the crumbling schools, or the line for the food bank that wrapped around a street corner?\u201cMark doesn\u2019t live here,\u201d she said, turning her attention to Dickson. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what this town needs.\u201d The VoteAn hour later, the ordinance passed, four to two. The crowd clapped loudly, and one man exclaimed, \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Anderson left quickly. Outside, she lit a cigarette and huddled with a small group of women, who were dumbstruck by the outcome. One resident who attended the meeting but did not testify told me that she had recently purchased Plan B for her teenage daughter after a sexual assault. She was worried about being prosecuted for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d an abortion. While she knew emergency contraception does not terminate a pregnancy, she was concerned that the ordinance could be incorrectly interpreted by overzealous lawmakers.Advertisement\n\nPeople react as the city ordinance passes, prohibiting abortion procedures within city limits. Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostAnother woman described how after her daughter got pregnant last year, she took her to a health clinic in town to get a sonogram. Her daughter wanted to know how far along she was. But after medical staff learned that she planned to have an abortion in El Paso, they refused to administer the sonogram. Both women asked to remain anonymous for fears of publicly aligning themselves in support of abortion rights. A few minutes later, Dickson came outside to find someone. There was a flurry of activity as the women suddenly approached him. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019ve done to my town, and you don\u2019t care,\u201d Anderson said, confronting him. \u201cIf you care, you\u2019d move here and take care of children.\u201dDickson turned and went back inside, refusing to engage. Anderson got in her car. She had a long drive back to Austin as she had work in the morning. She was angry at Dickson, she said. Before he came to town, no one talked about abortion. People minded their own business. She felt like he had used the citizens of Big Spring to push his own radical agenda.Advertisement\n\nShe updated her Facebook group on the news, and then immediately began mulling over her next steps. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have more to do.\u201dStephanie Vela Anderson takes a moment after the Big Spring city council passed an ordinance to ban abortion. Ilana Panich-Linsman for HuffPostWhen I later spoke with Dickson, he said he was pleased with the results, but added his intention had not been to rub it in the women\u2019s faces when he came outside. I asked if he had empathy for those who disagreed with his position; if he could imagine what it would feel like to have to carry and give birth to a child you didn\u2019t want.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that I want to tell women what they can and can\u2019t do with their bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell women what they can\u2019t do with another human body.\u201d Mothers sacrificed for their children, they didn\u2019t sacrifice them, he added. After the vote, he celebrated with chicken fried steak and fried pickles at a hotel restaurant. In the morning, he\u2019d go to another town and begin the process again.
