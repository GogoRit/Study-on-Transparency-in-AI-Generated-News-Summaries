An account with this name posts many obscene things, but this one was decidedly over-the-top. The original poster ended up deleting the tweet and made their account private\u00a0shortly thereafter.\n\nWAPA is a small account with only 220 followers, which makes sense as abortion is not popular and the average pro-choice or on-the-fence American sees abortion more as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d \u2013 not something to be celebrated. Plus, their complete disrespect for the faith of others (about 205 million Christians, to be exact) isn\u2019t going to gain them many extra followers.\nBut they do draw attention to a sad reality. There\u2019s a habit of more moderate pro-choice Americans to make the claim that \u201cno one\u2019s\u00a0really\u00a0pro-abortion.\u201d But this account, others like it, and even posts like this made by Secular Pro-Life beg to differ.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA post shared by Secular Pro-Life (@secularprolife)\n\n\n\nBut wait\u2026 there\u2019s more! We Are Pro-Abortion has some exciting new merchandise available for their 220 followers.\n\n\n\nThe new merch was posted on October 31st and it already has 3 likes, so make sure to get your profane abortion shirt quickly while supplies last. But, back to the realm of seriousness\u2026 3 likes for a shirt like this pretty much aligns with the popularity of this opinion. Honest onlookers admit that abortion isn\u2019t safe, its legality has no bearing on its morality, and even abortion supporters don\u2019t believe taxpayers should be forced to fund abortion.\n\n Post Views: 1,832\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
