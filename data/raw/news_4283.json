We are interviewing and reviewing the candidates for the Florida legislature, school board, county commission and judicial positions. Most voters hear and read only the paid campaign literature of candidates. We will do our research and share it with interested individuals and groups. Judicial candidates are especially important because most voters have no knowledge of the candidates who can and will make life-altering decisions.What is your focus for the future?Our focus for the future includes advocating and supporting policies for women\u2019s rights, such as reproductive and health rights that may threaten a woman\u2019s life; economic justice in jobs, pay, credit, education and the violence of poverty; reducing violence against women, sexual assault, harassment, gender bias and victimization in the judicial system.We also are focused on reducing racism and ethnic divisiveness, which stand in the way of women\u2019s empowerment and full equality; reducing discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, which prevent people from living their lives with dignity, safety and security.We strive to guarantee equal rights for all women in the U.S. Constitution so we will not have to fight for every advance. We will fight for the ERA, the Equal Rights Amendment.>>MORE NEIGHBORHOOD POST: Know what\u2019s going on in your communityHow can the community help?From creating a petition for your city council to helping fund the local domestic violence shelter, registering voters for the next election, organizing a rally against unfair legislation, and planning a meeting where people can share their experiences with street harassment, Palm Beach County NOW is a way for you to put your beliefs into concrete action and create change.You can join as a member of Palm County Beach NOW or as an at-large member in Florida.
