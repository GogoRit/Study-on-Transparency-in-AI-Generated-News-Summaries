Ben Sasse (R-NE) on Capitol Hill on September 27, 2018, in Washington, DC.\nAndrew Harnik-Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna North\n        is a senior correspondent for Vox, where she covers American family life, work, and education. Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n      \n\n\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday is hearing testimony on a bill that would put in place requirements for the care of infants born after failed abortions \u2014 and could send doctors to prison if they fail to comply. \nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), failed in the Senate last year. But now Sasse is bringing back the legislation, and it\u2019s part of a bigger debate about abortions very late in pregnancy that is intensifying in the runup to the election this year. \nSasse says the legislation is necessary to guarantee the best care for infants. A spokesperson for the senator told Vox in an email, \u201cthis is about making sure that every baby receives the same degree of care, whether they\u2019re born in a hospital or an abortion clinic.\u201d\nBut reproductive rights and physician groups say the bill could criminalize doctors and is unnecessary \u2014 not only because a live birth after an abortion attempt is an extremely unlikely scenario but also because laws already exist to protect an infant in this instance anyway. \u201cThe bill maligns and vilifies providers and patients to push a false narrative about abortion later in pregnancy,\u201d Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a board member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, told Vox in an email last year.\nBy holding a hearing on the bill, Sasse is focusing attention on an aspect of the abortion debate that some see as a wedge issue for voters: abortions very late in pregnancy. \nThe issue came to the fore last year during debate over a Virginia bill that would have broadened the circumstances under which someone could get a third-trimester abortion.   Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam made confusing comments in support of the bill that some took as an endorsement of infanticide, and President Donald Trump has been bringing up the episode in speeches ever since. At the March for Life earlier this year, he said that Northam had \u201cstated that he would execute a baby after birth\u201d (the governor did not say this), and that Democrats want to \u201callow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb right up until delivery.\u201d \nAs before, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is unlikely to pass, and bringing it up again may be a strategic move by Republicans to energize voters in the runup to this year\u2019s election \u2014 using language that, abortion rights advocates say, paints a false picture of abortion in America.\nWhile a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal under at least some circumstances, some polls have found that abortions in the third trimester are more controversial. For Republicans, bringing up abortions later in pregnancy may be a way to appeal to voters who are on the fence about the issue. And for Trump, talk about \u201cexecuting babies,\u201d though inaccurate, is likely a way to remind abortion opponents that, regardless of what they may think of him personally, he\u2019s delivered on his promise to appoint anti-abortion judges to courts around the country \u2014 and would probably continue to do so if reelected in 2020.\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is coming up now in part because of controversy over a Virginia abortion bill\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require doctors to provide the same care for a baby born alive after a failed attempt at abortion as they would for any child of the same gestational age. After providing appropriate care, they would be required to ensure that the baby \u201cis immediately transported and admitted to a hospital.\u201d\nDoctors who failed to comply with the requirements would face a fine and up to five years in prison.\nAbortion opponents say the bill is necessary to protect babies, pointing to activists like Gianna Jessen who say they were born after failed abortion attempts. But abortion-rights advocates and some physicians say that today, that situation is so uncommon as to be essentially nonexistent. Brandi, of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said she had never heard of a case of a child born after a failed attempt at an abortion. \u201cThis is a part of the false narrative around this bill and abortion later in pregnancy,\u201d she said. \nSasse introduced the bill in 2017, but it did not make it out of committee. Marsha Blackburn, then a House member, sponsored a similar bill in 2017, which passed the House but not the Senate.\nWhen Sasse introduced it again in 2019, all Republicans present voted in favor of a procedural motion on the bill, according to the Washington Post. They were joined by three Democratic senators \u2014 Bob Casey (PA), Joe Manchin (WV), and Doug Jones (AL). All other Democrats present voted against the motion, enough to block further consideration of the bill.\nIn a 2019 speech introducing the bill, Sasse specifically referenced Northam\u2019s comments about the Virginia abortion measure. \nAsked about the possibility of abortions during labor, Northam said, \u201cIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Northam told Vox that the governor was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d referring to infanticide, but that \u201cthe governor\u2019s comments focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.\u201d\n\n\n    Related\n  \nThe controversy around Virginia\u2019s new abortion bill, explained\n\nBut Sasse said in a speech to the Senate last year that Northam had \u201cendorsed infanticide.\u201d The governor \u201ctarnished the American idea of equality under law, he betrayed the universal truth of human dignity, and he turned the stomachs of civilized people not just in this country but in every country on earth,\u201d Sasse said.\n\u201cThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act prohibits exactly the kind of infanticide that Gov. Northam was endorsing,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what the legislation is about.\u201d\nSenate Democrats, reproductive rights groups, and groups representing doctors disagree, calling the legislation unnecessary and potentially damaging. \u201cThe politicians behind this bill are making up a problem that doesn\u2019t exist because their ultimate goal is to ban safe, legal abortion in this country,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement to Vox on Tuesday. \u201cThis bill serves no purpose but to deny people the ability to make the best choices for them and their families.\u201d\nAbortions in the third trimester are very rare: Just 1.4 percent of all abortions take place at 21 weeks or beyond, according to Planned Parenthood. The situation described in the Virginia committee hearing simply doesn\u2019t come up, Brandi said \u2014 \u201cpatients do not request abortion when they are in labor and doctors do not provide it.\u201d \nEven if a child were to be born after an abortion attempt, she said, laws already exist to protect the baby. In 2002, Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which guaranteed full legal rights to infants born at any stage of development. That bill, which passed with bipartisan support, did not include criminal penalties for doctors and did not impose specific requirements on medical care.\nSasse\u2019s bill, Brandi said, \u201cis a stark departure from the 2002 law as it singles out abortion and applies strict new requirements on abortion providers only, with the intent to malign and threaten abortion providers.\u201d \nBrandi and others were concerned that the threat of fines and imprisonment could hamper providers\u2019 ability to practice. Some critics of the bill believed its language \u2014 especially the requirement that doctors \u201cexercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence\u201d in caring for a child born after a failed abortion as they would in caring for any other child \u2014 was so vague that it could leave doctors vulnerable to lawsuits. \nWhen the earlier version of the bill was proposed in 2017, the head of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called it a \u201cgross legislative interference into the practice of medicine, putting politicians between women and their trusted doctors,\u201d according to Rewire News.\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA) called Sasse\u2019s bill \u201canti-doctor, anti-woman, and anti-family,\u201d in remarks released to media, and said that \u201cits proponents claim it would make something illegal that is already illegal.\u201d \nBut Sasse\u2019s spokesperson pushed back against such criticisms, saying, \u201cif opponents of the legislation maintain that this will somehow hurt healthcare providers, I\u2019d simply say that is a condemnation of some of the darker corners of the abortion industry rather than an excuse to block this pro-baby legislation.\u201d\nThe bill may be part of a larger strategy\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act has little chance of success in the closely divided Senate. The same was true last year, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who co-sponsored the bill, may have brought it to a vote in part to get Democrats on record opposing it.\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know whether their senators stand with vulnerable children struggling for life,\u201d McConnell wrote in an op-ed in the Courier-Journal, a Kentucky newspaper. \n\u201cAre we really supposed to think that it\u2019s normal that there are now two sides debating whether newborn, living babies deserve medical attention?\u201d he asked in a speech to the Senate last year. \u201cI would urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of the American people.\u201d\nThe bill may also be part of a larger strategy by Republicans of focusing on very late abortions in order to drum up support among social conservatives, a reliably Republican voting bloc. Northam\u2019s comments gave Trump and other Republicans an opening to draw attention to very late abortion procedures with emotionally charged language about babies being \u201cexecuted.\u201d \nNow, they may be using that language to drum up votes. Republicans lost ground in Congress in 2018, and Trump will soon face what\u2019s shaping up to be a difficult reelection bid, at least according to some polls. But he has delivered for abortion opponents by appointing conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, as well as many conservatives to lower federal courts. With a potential challenge to Roe v. Wade on the horizon, Republicans may see a benefit to reminding voters of their party\u2019s anti-abortion bona fides, even if their efforts don\u2019t change any laws in the short term.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
