Donald Trump said last week that he didn\u2019t know the position of his nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50-year-old Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.\n    \n\n            \u201cYou don\u2019t know her view on Roe v. Wade. You don\u2019t know her view,\u201d Trump told Democratic nominee Joe Biden in last week\u2019s presidential debate, in response to Biden\u2019s admonition that the future of Roe is on the ballot this fall.\n    \n\n            But for Barrett\u2019s supporters and detractors alike, it\u2019s clear that her confirmation would cement a conservative majority on the Supreme Court to limit abortion access.\n    \n\n            Even if the court doesn\u2019t overturn Roe, there are cases percolating in courts nationwide that would chip away at an individual\u2019s right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy and give the state room to second-guess that decision.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 16: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) arrives for a Republican senate luncheon in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill September 16, 2020 in Washington, DC.

The ad from the Saint Joseph County Right to Life calls for putting \u201can end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\u201d\n    \n\n            Ten years later, Barrett told an audience at Jacksonville University she believed that while Roe wouldn\u2019t be overturned, access to abortion could eventually be limited.\n    \n\n            \u201cI don\u2019t think the core case \u2013 Roe\u2019s core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion \u2013 I don\u2019t think that would change,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cBut I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, you know, how many restrictions can be put on clinics \u2013 I think that would change.\u201d \n    \n\n            Supporters of abortion rights are watching more than 15 cases percolating in the lower courts that will likely arrive at the Supreme Court in the coming terms. They include issues such as requirements for the burial of fetal tissue, hospital admission rules and parental notification, as well as bans on abortion as early as six, eight or 10 weeks into pregnancy. \n    \n\n            How far Barrett would go is a question roiling the country as progressives lament that Trump chose to replace the liberal late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a 48-year-old conservative jurist who is the feminist icon\u2019s ideological opposite, especially when it comes to reproductive health.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Supreme Court  is seen on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. \n\nOLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThe Supreme Court confirmation process, explained\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cAt this unprecedented time, and while the nation is still mourning and paying tribute to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s tremendous contributions to advancing equality, President Donald Trump has nominated a replacement who would gut Justice Ginsburg\u2019s legacy and turn back five decades of advancement for reproductive rights,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. \n    \n\n            Conservatives, some of whom gathered on the court\u2019s plaza last Saturday night as the President announced the nomination, think their time may have finally come. Chanting \u201c6-3, 6-3\u201d to reflect the court\u2019s new potential majority that night, they believe Trump has fulfilled a campaign promise from 2016 to appoint anti-abortion justices. \n    \n\n            Barrett\u2019s record indicates she believes the Roe v. Wade decision is an act of \u201cjudicial imperialism,\u201d Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said at a Judiciary Committee meeting last Thursday. \u201cI do believe Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s record bears that out.\u201d\n    \n\n            On the bench, Barrett, a deep thinker and meticulous jurist who was well aware long before her nomination that she was on Trump\u2019s short list, has left a careful trail. That trail reveals votes open to more restrictive laws and a state\u2019s expanded ability to regulate abortion, as well as a judicial philosophy aligned with that of her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who believed Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided.  \n    \n\n    What Barrett said at her 2017 Senate hearing\n\n\n            Confirmation hearings, long on drama and often short on substance, rarely reveal anything new about a nominee.  \n    \n\n            In September 2017, Barrett appeared before Congress for her confirmation to the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals and was pressed on Roe v. Wade. \n    \n\n            She followed the script of most every nominee to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, noting that lower court judges are bound by Supreme Court precedent. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett is nominated to the US Supreme Court by President Donald Trump in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC on September 26, 2020. - Barrett, if confirmed by the US Senate, will replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18.

Wade with Amy Coney Barrett\n\n\n\n\n            Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the panel, persisted, asking the nominee whether she considered Roe v. Wade the kind of precedent that could be overturned.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIf I were confirmed, I would follow all Supreme Court precedent without fail,\u201d Barrett responded. \n    \n\n            Asking such questions is often a fruitless endeavor. That\u2019s because every lower court judge is bound by Supreme Court precedent. But the stakes would be different on the high court. \n    \n\n            During her upcoming confirmation hearing Barrett will be asked what she thinks of the doctrine of stare decisis. It\u2019s a legal term that refers to a court\u2019s practice of following precedent. Literally, it means \u201cstand by the thing decided.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nJustices Thomas and Alito lash out at the decision that cleared way for same-sex marriage\n\n\n\n\n            It comes up as senators push to see a particular nominee\u2019s view on the doctrine. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, has said he has little respect for it, while other justices believe it\u2019s an important stabilizing factor for the court. \n    \n\n            O. Carter Snead, a longtime colleague at Notre Dame, says he\u2019s hard-pressed to see where Barrett has been definitive on Roe v. Wade. \n    \n\n            \u201cIn her scholarship, I\u2019ve never seen her stake out a position on Roe v. Wade, as to whether it was decided correctly in the first instance as an originalist matter, or how principles of stare decisis might apply to overturning it.\u201d\n    \n\n            Democrats are likely to turn to Barrett\u2019s own writing from 2013, when she was a professor at Notre Dame and she penned an essay centered on the doctrine. While she pointed to its strength, her critics focus on the fact that at one point she suggested room for some cases to be overturned. \n    \n\n            \u201cIf anything, the public response to controversial cases like Roe reflects public rejection of the proposition that stare decisis can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle rather than desire that precedent remain forever unchanging,\u201d she wrote. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts leaves after day five of the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol January 25, 2020 in Washington, DC. \n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nJohn Roberts faces a new round of legacy-defining turmoil\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cCourt watchers,\u201d she added, \u201cembrace the possibility of overruling, even if they may want it to be the exception rather than the rule.\u201d  \n    \n\n    What Barrett has said about abortion on the bench\n\n\n            Her critics won\u2019t be able to point to an appellate court opinion where she has taken a position in a merits case cutting back on Roe, but they are looking at two votes in particular. \n    \n\n            In one, a three-judge panel struck down an Indiana abortion law with provisions dealing with fetal remains and barring abortion based on the race, disability or sex of the fetus. Indiana asked the full appeals court to review only the provision on fetal remains, which it declined to do. \n    \n\n            But Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote in dissent, saying he thought the full court should have voted to revisit the case, and was joined by Barrett. Easterbrook returned to the law\u2019s provision barring abortion on the basis of race, disability or sex of the fetus, calling it a \u201ceugenics statute,\u201d and he wrote that there is a \u201cdifference between \u2018I don\u2019t want a child\u2019 and \u2018I want a child, but only a male, or \u2018I want only children whose genes predict success in life.\u2019 \u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor at Notre Dame University, poses in an undated photograph obtained from Notre Dame University September 19, 2020.  \n\nMatt Cashore/Notre Dame University/Handout/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nNotable dissents from Judge Amy Coney Barrett\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cNone of the Court\u2019s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race and other attributes of children,\u201d he wrote.\n    \n\n            The fact that Barrett expressed a will to reconsider a dispute about the Indiana law (even though Indiana didn\u2019t even ask for a rehearing on that provision) suggests she thought the panel had gotten the decision wrong. \n    \n\n            Her critics seize on the Indiana law as being just the kind of statute that chips away at an individual\u2019s right to make the decision on whether to terminate a pregnancy and gives the state room to second-guess that decision. \n    \n\n            In another case, a three-judge panel struck down a law dealing with parental notification when it comes to minors seeking abortions. Planned Parenthood was challenging the law before it went into effect. The panel held the law was likely unconstitutional. Again, the full 7th Circuit Court denied Indiana\u2019s request to rehear the case. \n    \n\n            Barrett wanted to reconsider the panel decision and joined the dissent, which raised questions pertaining to when a law could be blocked prior to its enforcement date. \u201cPreventing a state statute from taking effect is a judicial act of extraordinary gravity in our federal structure,\u201d Judge Michael Kanne wrote.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-choice supporters pose for photos outside the Planned Parenthood Reproductive Health Services Center in St. Louis, Missouri, May 31, 2019, the last location in the state performing abortions, after a US Court announced the clinic could continue operating. - A US Court on May 31, 2019 blocked Missouri from closing the clinic.

As things stand, restrictions are often blocked before they take effect.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous sign that in the only two abortion cases she heard she was going to reach out and disrupt a three-judge opinion by her colleagues that these restrictions violated 40 years of Supreme Court precedent,\u201d said Helene Krasnoff, vice president of public policy litigation and law at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n    \n\n            \u201cImportantly, there is nothing in her record to suggest the opposite. In fact every writing and every decision suggests that she would be a reliable vote to restrict access to abortion,\u201d Krasnoff said. \n    \n\n            Barrett\u2019s supporters note that she voted with the majority to uphold Chicago\u2019s so-called \u201cbubble zone\u201d ordinance, which bars opponents of abortion from approaching someone within 8 feet in the vicinity of a clinic if the purpose is to engage in protest. \n    \n\n            While some may say that the opinion, rooted in the First Amendment, protected those seeking abortions, others note that the court made clear it was bound to apply a Supreme Court case that was \u201cmaterially identical\u201d to the case at hand. \n    \n\n            \u201cIn fact, the opinion suggests that if she were presented with the same issue as a Supreme Court justice, she would rule the other way,\u201d Krasnoff added. \n    \n\n            It\u2019s something Barrett\u2019s supporters reject. \n    \n\n            \u201cSince 1973 Democrats have been scaring American voters that every Republican Supreme Court nominee would overturn Roe v. Wade, and here we are nearly 50 years later and Roe v. Wade is still intact,\u201d said Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project, a group that supports Trump\u2019s nominees. \n    \n\n            \u201cJudge Barrett, someone who is clearly pro-life, has also clearly demonstrated on her three years on the 7th Circuit that she can separate her personal views from her judicial decision making,\u201d he said. \n    \n\n    At Notre Dame\n\n\n            A Notre Dame Magazine article from 2013 detailed a \u201cProfessors for Lunch\u201d lecture series that featured a talk by Barrett. The article said she \u201cspoke both to her own conviction that life begins at conception\u201d and to the \u201d \u2018high price of pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018burdens of parenthood\u2019 that especially confront women.\u201d \n    \n\n            According to the article, \u201cshe asked her audience whether the clash of convictions inherent in the abortion debate is better resolved democratically.\u201d \n    \n\n            Such a line of reasoning evokes Scalia\u2019s jurisprudence. He thought a judge should interpret a text as people would have understood that text at the time it was ratified. As Barrett said in 2016: \u201cJustice Scalia resisted the notion that the Supreme Court should be in the business of imposing its views of social mores on the American people.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 14: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seen as she presents the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Inaugural Woman of Leadership Award to Agnes Gund at The Library of Congress on February 14, 2020 in Washington, DC.

It leaves it up to democratic choice.\u201d\n    \n\n            Barrett was also a member of the Notre Dame chapter of a club called University Faculty for Life. The group wrote a resolution in 2016, when Barrett was a member, noting that it sought to \u201cpromote the truth\u201d that \u201cevery human being, from the moment of conception and until natural death, must be cherished and protected, and must never be intentionally killed.\u201d As such it wrote to oppose Notre Dame\u2019s decision to award a medal to then-Vice President Joe Biden. \n    \n\n            \u201cMr. Biden has for decades conspicuously rejected Church teaching about life,\u201d the resolution read. \u201cHe has rejected it repeatedly and consistently in the context of
