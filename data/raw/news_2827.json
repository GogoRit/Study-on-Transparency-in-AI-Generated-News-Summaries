Pictured: White on her original documentary, Brainwashing Stacey: Anti-Abortion Camps, in 2017White previously featured on Stacey's show, Brainwashing Stacey Dooley: Anti-Abortion Camp in 2017, in which the presenter visited 'summer camps' for children run by White.On his website, White describes his group as a 'national pro-life youth ministry calling on young people to take a stand against the evil of their day, which has killed one-third of their generation.'He previously revealed to the BBC that he has been arrested more than 100 times during public anti-abortion demonstrations.

Pictured: Stacey in her documentaryHe said: 'We have entire museums out here in California with the slogan that says never again. And they're talking about how we have to make sure that this terrible atrocity never happens again.'The truth of the matter is, it is happening again. Not only with abortion in America but in all kinds of places where genocide is taking place.'What happened to the Jewish community is terrible at every level but they don't own the term. Nor should they.'In fact, if there is a legitimate comparison, if people are being killed without a trial, in the case of the children in the womb while they're still innocent.'So not only should it not be offensive, they should be embracing it and they should look at the comparison and ask: is somebody dying unjustly?'If we don't do that we will never stop it from happening again because there will never be another man named Hitler.       'It is going to look different in a different day and a different day and we need to be prepared as good people to always stand against evil.'Stacey then forcefully responded by saying, 'I don't think it is for us to tell the Jewish community how to feel towards that word. This thought process is where we really differed.'It is my belief and other people's belief that a cluster of cells\u2026 it is not a fair comparison.White then added, 'To use the terminology a clump of cells is not really accurate.'You've seen the pictures, you've seen the babies, what they look like, so to say a clump of cells isn't really accurate.'White, who also told Stacey he houses 18 mothers and their children and pays for their college educations, then parodied what he believed to be Stacey's position.Speaking as her, he said, 'Women, Jeff, are more important than that little baby.'It doesn't matter that there's two human lives, we are dismissing one of those human lives arbitrarily so that we can protect their health.'He then added, 'Not even protect, you're not saving a woman's life, you're just helping her to have a better life. And the cost of helping that woman to have a better life is to kill a child.'In the scales of humanity it does not weigh up.'With God as your witness, what are you doing to help the oppressed, the hurting, the homeless, whoever it is in your community?'For the vast majority of them that would hold that opinion, I'll tell you how much they're doing: absolutely nothing.'Stacey then brought up how Jeff's organisation trains children in front-line activism against abortion.She said: 'This is what I found difficult to digest. Children are so impressionable. They're so easy to manipulate.'And you can sit them down, some of these kids are 11-years-old, you can feed them this narrative that you believe to be true, and then you send them out and you urge them to convince grown women not to go through with an abortion.'         Defending her pro-choice position, Stacey hit back by saying it was not for him to 'tell the Jewish community how to feel towards that word' and that the comparison was not a fair one. Pictured: Stacey during a similar conversation on the documentary three years agoSpeaking of a moment on the programme where protests were taking place outside a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, Stacey added, 'I remember when we were all stood outside Planned Parenthood, thinking how has this child got the audacity to tell me what to do?'I'm a grown woman, it is my body, it is my choice. How is this child going to help me? How is this 11-year-old going to help me?'But Jeff responded by saying that if it is ok for children themselves to get an abortion, then it should be ok for 'their peers to be educated and speak to that person to convince them not to get an abortion.'The campaigner, who is a Christian, then shocked Stacey by launching a volley of criticism at other believers.He said: 'Christians are standing by day by day while Christians are slaughtered. But they want to talk nice on their radio shows. I want no part of it.'I don't want to do Christian radio because I really have no time for them. They know better.Asked if he was 'disappointed' with his fellow Christians, he added, 'I'm not disappointed, I'm disgusted. For Christians, we are called upon to love our neighbour as ourselves.         On his website, White describes his group as a 'national pro-life youth ministry calling on young people to take a stand against the evil of their day, which has killed one-third of their generation'. Pictured: White during his clash with Stacey on her show'We are called upon to defend the poor and the weak, the defenceless. Who is more defenceless than the unborn child?'The church is missing in action. And just like anyone else that goes AWOL, you should line them all up and shoot them because they're not doing the work that they're supposed to do.'Is that a little rough? I'm sorry.'Giving the impression that he may not have been serious, Stacey told her listeners, 'That's way too rough, he doesn't mean that. I see that your language is as loaded as ever.'And despite the pair's disagreements, they both ended up praised each other.Stacey said, 'If I felt like abortion was murder, I would be out there with them.\u00a0'And I found it really impressive actually that young people were standing up for what they thought was right.White then dished out his own praise for the presenter and her show.\u00a0He said: 'What came through was your honesty as you weighed their position and didn\u2019t change yours but I think you were fair.\u00a0'That is part of even conversation with anybody who disagrees with you.'Stacey DooleyGermanyCalifornia\n\n\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n                        Radical pro-life activist insists abortion is 'like the Holocaust' during Stacey Dooley clash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nshares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost watched News videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic gather in London to view suspected Banksy art work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShocking moment crocodile handler is attacked and bitten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld's politest protestor waits for show to end before interrupting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShocking clip of man's best friend taped to lampost by angry neighbour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Jong Un oversees 'real war capabilities' rocket launch drills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoment Eagle Ridge boy is swarmed and beaten up by mob of students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBodycam shows Riley Strain speaking to cops night he went missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen claim they were kicked off their flight due to their size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEkin-Su is a no-show on 'Lorraine,' much to host's surprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiques Roadshow guest receives huge valuation for statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTallulah Willis with dad Bruce at the Premiere of 'The Whole Ten Yards'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoment female acrobat falls 12ft after circus act goes wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\nSite\nWeb\n\n\nEnter search term:\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDON'T MISS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDave Myers' heartbreaking final on screen words are revealed as best friend Si King chokes back tears during last ever Hairy Bikers episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam makes sweet remark about wanting Kate by his side during visit to housing project in Sheffield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVEJames Martin SPLITS from girlfriend Louise Davies after 12 years - as he browses watches with Arun Nayar's ex-wife Kim Johnson in Mayfair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROBERT JOBSON: William's one misstep ignited the wild conspiracy theories.
