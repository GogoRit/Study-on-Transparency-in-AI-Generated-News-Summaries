Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, has also said Trump is the \u201cmost pro-life president in history,\u201d as has Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and Fr. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life.Advertise on TGC\nThe assertion has become one of the most unexamined talking points in pro-life activism. But is it true? And, more importantly, does it matter?\nTo judge the veracity of the claim we must first establish some relevant criteria. In 2016, I wrote \u201cWhy It Is Imperative that Presidents Be Pro-Life\u201d and outlined six ways U.S. presidents have a limited, but substantial and broad-based, role in protecting life\u00a0and defending the most vulnerable\u00a0in society. (For the purposes of this post, I\u2019ll use the term \u201cpro-life\u201d as it is most often used\u2014as a synonym for anti-abortion.)\n1. Preserving the Pro-Life Riders\nEach year pro-life provisions or \u201criders\u201d are attached to the annual appropriations bills, preventing public funds from supporting abortions, abortion providers, or abortion promoters.\u00a0Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump have all supported such riders.\nCategory winner: Four-way tie\n2. Filing of\u00a0Amicus\u00a0Briefs in Cases Before the Judiciary\nWhere a case may have broader implications,\u00a0amicus curiae\u00a0briefs are a way to introduce those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal effects of court decisions will not depend solely on the parties directly involved in the case. Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump have all filed amicus briefs in abortion cases before the courts.\nCategory winner: Four-way tie (though Reagan may have a slight advantage since his administration called in a brief for Roe to be reversed).\n3. Defending Pro-Life Laws in Federal Courts\nThe president selects the\u00a0U.S. attorney general, the head of\u00a0the Department of Justice and the\u00a0chief lawyer of the\u00a0United States government.\u00a0Those offices are responsible for defending or advocating for pro-life laws before the courts. The administrations of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump have each defended pro-life laws before the courts.\nCategory winner: Four-way tie\n4. Issuance of Executive Orders\nExecutive orders help direct the operation of officers within the executive branch. They also have the force of law when made in pursuance of certain acts of Congress, when those acts give the president discretionary powers. For example, Reagan used an executive order to introduce the Mexico City Policy, which makes \u201cneither performing nor actively promoting abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\u201d conditions of receiving federal funding for any NGO.\u00a0George W. Bush reinstated the policy when it was rescinded by Clinton, and Trump reinstated it when it was rescinded by Obama.\nPresidents Reagan, George W. Bush, and Trump all issued executive orders relating to abortion.\nCategory winner: Three-way tie\n5. Using the \u2018Bully Pulpit\u2019\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt referred to the White House as a \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d meaning a wonderful platform (Roosevelt often used the word \u201cbully\u201d as an adjective meaning superb) from which to persuasively advocate an agenda. The use of this pulpit to preach against abortion is the one area where there has been some distinction between modern Republican presidents.\nFor example, Nixon made no public statement when the Supreme Court struck down laws criminalizing abortion in Roe v. Wade in 1973, but privately supported some abortions. (In a taped recording he said, \u2018There are times when an abortion is necessary. I know that. When you have a black and a white. Or a rape.\u2019\u201d Nixon also refused to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning abortion, as did Ford. (Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush all supported such an amendment; it is unclear whether Trump does.)\nThree of these presidents also spoke at the March for Life (Reagan and George W. Bush by phone, and Trump by satellite) and opposed abortion in a State of the Union Address (Reagan in 1988, George W. Bush in 2014, and Trump in 2019). While in office, George W. Bush also declared January 18 \u201cNational Sanctity of Human Life Day,\u201d stating that the \u201cthe most basic duty of government is to protect the life of the innocent.\u201d\nAdditionally, Reagan also gave several significant speeches during his time in office in which he publicly spoke out against abortion. In 1983, he also published Abortion & the Conscience of the Nation, the only book to be published by a U.S. president while in office.\nCategory winner: Reagan\nMeaningless Metric for \u2018Most\u2019\nBased on these criteria, Reagan would be the victor, with Trump and George W. Bush vying for second. Does this mean Reagan was the most \u201cpro life president ever\u201d? Not really, for the claim is so subjective as to be meaningless.\nFor instance, some may complain that my list of criteria doesn\u2019t include appointment of federal judges or Supreme Court justices. But the last four Republican presidents have appointed as many pro-life judges as they could, and the question of which justices will overturn Roe remains to be seen. Similarly, we could come up with other criteria to ensure our preferred candidate won the title. But does it really matter?\nIn one sense, the claim is unimportant to anyone but activists seeking to curry favor with the latest political regime. It\u2019s not even clear that the activists making the claim believe it\u2019s true. When George W. Bush was still in power, Fr. Pavone claimed Bush was the \u201cmost pro-life president that we have ever had.\u201d I suspect Pavone will make the same claim about the next Republican president. But that is, ironically, why the claim is significant: any generic Republican president is the \u201cmost pro-life\u201d when compared to Democratic presidents. While the distinction between the pro-life records of Republican presidents is rather minimal, the divergence between the pro-life achievements of Republican and Democratic presidents is enormous.\nIt\u2019s not necessarily because Republicans are more pro-life by conviction. Every modern Republican president only became pro-life in middle age, at a time they were seeking higher office. George W. Bush became pro-life at the age of 48, while Reagan and George H. W. Bush changed their minds about abortion while in their 50s. Trump, who supported partial-birth abortion as late as 1999, only became pro-life in 2012\u2014at the age of 66.\nMost Pro-Life or Only Pro-Life Option?\nThis is not to say their conversions to the pro-life cause weren\u2019t sincere. But it doesn\u2019t really matter what they personally believe, since their electability is constricted by their party\u2019s platforms and preferences. Similarly, some Democratic politicians\u2014such as Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden\u2014have claimed for most of their lives to be personally opposed to abortion, and yet still support their party\u2019s pro-abortion agenda.\nEach of the two main political parties have made the issue of abortion a partisan litmus test. But this wasn\u2019t always the case. In 1976, President Ford and his challenger, Jimmy Carter,\u00a0held somewhat similar positions on abortion.\u00a0By the 1980s, though, pro-life activists had pushed the Republican Party to oppose abortion, while pro-abortion activists had pushed the Democratic Party to an opposite and extreme position.\nToday, about one-third of Democratic voters (34 percent) identify as pro-life, and nearly half (48 percent) oppose elective abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy. But no Democrat presidential candidate can get elected in the current political climate if they support any restrictions on abortion. None is even willing to try.\nThis is why many Christian voters who consider abortion to be a primary issue of justice continue to support whatever candidate runs on the GOP ticket. It\u2019s not that they are necessarily looking for the \u201cmost pro-life president in history,\u201d they just feel they have no other viable choice. And if the current trend of the Democratic Party is any indication, they won\u2019t be given a pro-life alternative anytime soon.\n \n\nIs there enough evidence for us to believe the Gospels?\nIn an age of faith deconstruction and skepticism about the Bible\u2019s authority, it\u2019s common to hear claims that the Gospels are unreliable propaganda. And if the Gospels are shown to be historically unreliable, the whole foundation of Christianity begins to crumble.\n\nBut the Gospels are historically reliable. And the evidence for this is vast. \n\nTo learn about the evidence for the historical reliability of the four Gospels, click below to access a FREE eBook of Can We Trust the Gospels? written by New Testament scholar Peter J.
