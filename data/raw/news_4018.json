They spent much of last year protesting\u00a0in front of state capitols and joined\u00a0forces to combat severe restrictions with lawsuits.Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, pointed to November election victories that saw\u00a0voters support\u00a0candidates who affirmed the right to abortion, particularly in\u00a0Kentucky and Virginia.She cited a 2019 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that showed 77%\u00a0of Americans want the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold\u00a0its decision in Roe v. Wade,\u00a0made 47 years ago Wednesday,\u00a0protecting\u00a0a woman's right to have an abortion without burdensome government intrusion.\"We\u2019ve seen how supporting reproductive rights is not only good for people, it\u2019s good politics,\" Johnson said.\u00a0\"Anti-abortion politicians have already shown us that they will stop at nothing to ban abortion and punish patients for accessing basic health care. We won\u2019t stand for this \u2013 not now, not ever.\"\u00a0Some of the strictest anti-abortion\u00a0laws last year were passed in Alabama \u2013\u00a0which enacted a total ban on abortion \u2013 and\u00a0Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Ohio, which outlawed the procedure after about six weeks when a fetal heartbeat is detected.Women's March 2020:Thousands protest, bring 'renewed energy' to start new decade: 'We are not resting'Federal judges temporarily blocked the laws from going into effect while the legal challenges by abortion-rights groups\u00a0are fought\u00a0this year in lower courts.\u00a0\u201cNo one is expecting the district court to be the final word,\" said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at Guttmacher.\u00a0Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists are hoping the cases ultimately rise to the Supreme Court, with its new\u00a0conservative majority and\u00a0the power to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u00a0is likely to rule this spring on a Louisiana law that requires\u00a0abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. A similar law in Texas was struck down by the high court in 2016.Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, called the anti-abortion advocates'\u00a0Supreme Court strategy a \"political game.\"\u00a0Banning abortions, she said,\u00a0will ultimately force more women to have illegal, unsafe abortions.\u00a0\"It\u2019s irresponsible, and it\u2019s going to have consequences,\" Fox said.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t say you care about women and then turn around and restrict access to health care.\u201dWith abortion in the spotlight, Nash said it's likely states will pass more restrictions this year.\u00a0Democratic lawmakers in some states, however, have pushed back\u00a0by passing laws that support abortion rights. According to her group, 36 measures\u00a0were enacted last year to protect abortion.\u00a0But Maureen Ferguson, a senior fellow for The\u00a0Catholic Association who participates in March for Life each year, said the anti-abortion laws and the popularity of the annual event\u00a0reflect a \"growing pro-life sentiment\" across\u00a0the nation.\u00a0Ferguson hopes women recognize they are resourceful and don't need to resort to abortion.\"That kind of violence ought to\u00a0never be the solution\u00a0to\u00a0a problem\u00a0of poverty or any other difficult circumstance,\" she said.\u00a0\"Taking the\u00a0life of an innocent child is never a good solution.\u201d\u00a0There is much to celebrate at this year's march, organizer\u00a0Mancini said. While 800,000 women had abortions in 2017, the number performed in the U.S. reached a historic low. New pregnancy care centers are opening, and more young people are\u00a0supporting the cause.\u00a0Many of marchers are traveling from schools and colleges across the country, she said.\u00a0\"This is a human rights issues, so we can\u2019t not march,\" Mancini said. \"We are changing hearts and minds.\"Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
