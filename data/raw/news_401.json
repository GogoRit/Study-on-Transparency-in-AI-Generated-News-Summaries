Last Thursday, a ruling of the Constitutional Court has made it illegal to terminate pregnancy also in this third situation.\nGiven that the majority of the legal abortions conducted in Poland were performed because of this third reason, the ruling means that there will be almost no abortions in Poland \u2014 officially, that is. Unofficially, according to one of the country\u2019s main feminist organizations, the Federation for Women and Family Planning, some hundred thousand abortions are made in Poland annually.\nVarious organizations in Poland and abroad help Polish women to get abortion pills or otherwise terminate pregnancy. The current law does not punish women for terminating pregnancy \u2014 but, by imposing up to three years\u2019 imprisonment for helping women to terminate a pregnancy, it endangers the doctors as well as the providers of pharmacological aid.\nLast Thursday\u2019s decision was taken under Poland\u2019s conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government. Yet every political option has managed to betray women already. There were the social democrats, who had the necessary majority in Parliament to change the drastic anti-abortion law in 2004, but chose not to do so, as they needed the church\u2019s support for Poland\u2019s accession to the European Union. Or take the liberals, who claim that that the law established in 1997 was a \u201ccompromise.\u201d\nHaving kept Poland in a state of constant anxiety about abortion since at least 2016, the conservatives now decided to push it further, again using the Constitutional Court. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of the ruling PiS, said in 2016 that women should keep risky pregnancies and give birth no matter what, even if the fetus dies.\n\n\n\nPaying the Price\nAs with all things, abortion also has its class dimension, basically dividing the Polish society into those who can afford it, and those who cannot. It obviously matters, whether you live in a metropolitan area or in regions, where all doctors refuse to terminate pregnancies because of their \u201cconscience.\u201d\nOne of the most popular feminist slogans today says: \u201cWe want doctors without conscience!\u201d In recent years, the liberal narrative of \u201cchoice\u201d has been replaced by that of \u201cneed\u201d; this, not to deny women\u2019s right to choose, but to emphasize that most women do not have a choice when it comes to abortion.\nRegardless of whether you decide to do it in Poland or abroad, it costs between 50 and 100 percent of your monthly salary \u2014 depending on the city, the form it takes, and its general accessibility. Indeed, every newspaper in Poland advertises abortion \u2014 albeit under the name of \u201cinducing menstruation\u201d or \u201cregulating the menstrual cycle.\u201d Many doctors who refuse to carry out terminations in public hospitals, agree to perform abortions in private clinics. It is all a question of money \u2014 and connections.\nIn recent decades, \u201cthe state of exception\u201d has generally been discussed as a way of expressing the exceptional condition of refugees and undocumented migrants \u2014 the fact of being outside of the law. Necropolitics, a term coined by Achille Mbembe, shows how the neoliberal, globalized biopolitics governs the contemporary world by carelessly allowing the exposure of entire groups and populations to death.\nI believe that today women in Poland are such a group, exposed to the risk of death by those who claim to continue the Christian heritage in Polish state institutions and the Catholic church. The perpetuation of the neoliberal pact of conservative values and liberal market takes the form of the oppression of women, in the name of traditionalist values.\n\n\nResistance\nBut wherever there is control, there is always resistance. And Polish women contested, undermined, and struggled against the abortion ban since day one.\nIn 1997 approximately a million signatures were collected for a referendum on abortion. In April 2016, faced with the first efforts to further restrict access to abortion, 100,000 women immediately joined feminist groups created ad hoc online. Some 150,000 marched in different cities and towns in Poland in what soon became known as \u201cthe Black Protests,\u201d leading to the Women\u2019s Strike and eventually the International Women\u2019s Strike.\nThis resistance is again apparent today. On Monday, October 26, some thirty cities and towns in Poland were blockaded by cars, bikes, and pedestrians in spontaneous protests in support of the rights of women. The day before that, farmers used their vehicles to block streets in several small towns to protest the newly established abortion ban.\nFollowing the first demonstrations on Friday October 23 \u2014 the day after the ruling \u2014 protests have extended from big cities to small towns and villages around the country. A rough count suggests that protests took place at least in seventy locations in Poland, as well as in some twenty towns and cities abroad.\nA general strike has been called for Wednesday, and many workplaces have already begun declaring their support for the women\u2019s cause. A new and very popular element of the protest is for feminists to visit churches in order to advocate for the right to abortion and women\u2019s rights. The activists enter churches, and standing there, hold banners and distribute leaflets. This usually happens peacefully, without violent clashes.\nThe current protests do seem to have a slightly different vibe than those held previously \u2014 now we are mad, not just unhappy, and the main slogan is a swear word, \u201cwypierdala\u0107!\u201d, which can be translated as: \u201cget the fuck out of here!\u201d\nIf they did do so, the deeply unpleasant Kaczy\u0144ski and his conservative colleagues might have some trouble finding anywhere else to go. But Poland\u2019s feminists have more serious problems to deal with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nContributors\nEwa Majewska is a feminist philosopher of culture, lecturer at the Art Academy in Szczecin, Poland.
