In some states, several judges blocked the bans. Others were eventually lifted by the states themselves.\nBut for weeks, many women were left in limbo.\n\n\nImani sits on a nearly empty plane after flying from Texas to Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nWhile waiting at Planned Parenthood, Imani watches a news brief from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nAmong the women affected was Imani, a 22-year-old in Texas. (CNN has agreed to use a pseudonym to protect her identity.)\nImani was trying to obtain an abortion, but the timing could not have been worse. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed an executive order on March 22 banning \u00e2\u0080\u009csurgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the life of a patient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney general, Ken Paxton, said the ban included elective abortions.\nTexas said the move was necessary to preserve personal protective equipment, or PPE, while the state dealt with Covid-19. The legal challenges soon followed.\n\n\nImani waits for an appointment. \n\n\n\nA close-up of drawers at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Los Angeles.\n\nImani called several clinics in Texas, but they were closed or said they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help her. So she had to look elsewhere. A friend suggested she go to Mexico, but she declined. She called a couple of clinics in Arizona before eventually settling on Los Angeles, hundreds of miles from home.\nShe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only one. Planned Parenthood Los Angeles was \u00e2\u0080\u009cgetting a huge influx of people from out of state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenna Gordon, a freelance photojournalist who documented Imani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story.\nGordon had been trying for a while to do a story about the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cabortion deserts\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 areas of the United States where women have to travel long distances to obtain an abortion. She never expected a pandemic to make things even harder.\n\n\nImani learns more about what's happening with her body.\n\n\n\nImani lies down during her first appointment.\n\nGordon was introduced to Imani through Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, and Imani agreed to have Gordon photograph her experience.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI agreed to do it so a light can be shed on what women have to go through health-wise and with the decisions we make for ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told CNN via text.\nGordon was with Imani for several days, meeting her at Los Angeles International Airport after she arrived on a nearly empty plane out of Texas.\n\n\nA clinician shows Imani her sonogram.\n\n\n\nColor-coded markers at the clinic show each patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status inside.\n\nImani went to Planned Parenthood, where she was hoping to have a medication abortion and avoid any surgical procedure. It was late April. By this time, the executive order in Texas had expired and Abbott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new guidelines had loosened the restrictions. But Imani was still getting conflicting information, and she had already booked her LA trip.\nWhen she got to LA, she learned that a medication abortion was not going to be possible. There were medical complications, she was in pain and it turned out she needed urgent surgical care, Gordon said.\nImani considered going to the emergency room, and maybe even back to Texas, when Planned Parenthood Los Angeles offered her a surgical appointment the next day.\n\n\nA look inside the clinic during Imani's surgical procedure.\n\n\n\nInstruments are lined up during Imani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surgery.\n\nGordon was with Imani the whole time.\n\n        \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbortion is something that happens behind closed doors, and we don't get to see it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the photographer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's a lot of reasons for that, and I think it's hard for us to have a lot of empathy for things we can't see. That's why I do photography, to try and make some of those things more visible and more real for people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nImani said she was nervous during the procedure and exhausted afterward, both physically and mentally. But she was comfortable with her decision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery woman should have the option to do as she pleases with her body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\nA medical team helps Imani up to go to the recovery room.\n\n\n\nImani rests as her sedatives wear off in the recovery room.\n\nGordon agrees, and she has a very personal connection.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had my own abortion when I was 30, and I have no regrets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the right choice for me at that moment, and I can't really imagine my life if I hadn't had that option \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I know that that option was a privilege. I know that it was really easy for me to access reproductive health care, and I know that that is not true for all women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGordon said she is encouraged by the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision Monday to block a controversial abortion law in Louisiana. The law barred doctors from performing an abortion procedure unless they had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the court had gone the other way, countless women would have had to jump through even more hurdles than ever just to get basic reproductive health care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\nA curtain offers some privacy.\n\n\n\nImani stops at the beach during the trip. It was closed because of Covid-19, but there were a few people wandering around.\n\n\n\nGlenna Gordon is a photographer based in Los Angeles.
