Here\u2019s how he has been working against the abortion giant lately:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter Kentucky recently enacted House Bill 3, a pro-life law which will protect preborn babies and mothers from Chemical Abortion pills among other pro-life measures, Planned Parenthood, along with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), did what they do best: sued the heck out of anyone who stepped in the way of their murderous, moneymaking schemes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLawsuits were filed in federal court by the Planned Parenthood affiliates of Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky on the grounds that abortionists cannot comply with the new law\u2019s standards since some forms which will be required in the future are not yet written. In turn, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings has temporarily blocked this state law, allowing the Kentucky abortion facilities to resume committing abortions. However, AG Cameron has said the lawsuit\u2019s interpretation of the new law is absolutely \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cwholly improper.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe responded to the lawsuits in a 23-page brief which utterly roasted Planned Parenthood and ACLU, stating that both organizations had overstepped in wrongfully requesting a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against HB 3. According to AG Cameron, the new law is \u201ccommon sense\u201d because it \u201cenacts a number of varying, much-needed regulatory reforms on abortion practices in Kentucky.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe continued by saying that some of the reforms of the new law \u201crequire abortion providers to comply with new forms and regulations that the Cabinet for Health and Family Services must promulgate over the next couple of months.\u201d However, he again acknowledged that these forms do not exist yet and therefore abortionists are not (and cannot be!) required to submit to an abortion monitoring system that does not exist yet. Why\u2019s that hard to understand, Planned Parenthood?\u00a0\u00a0\nAG Cameron also reiterated that the law does not require abortion vendors to stop committing abortions until this system is created, writing: \u201cThe bill in no way shuts that business down or orders it to cease operations.\u201d However, he did maintain that there are other parts of the law that abortion vendors can and should comply with immediately. Clearly, AG Cameron would support the complete shut-down of abortion facilities, but he is clarifying that the abortion industry\u2019s characterization of this law is disingenuous.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAG Cameron went on in his response to summarize this challenge to the entirety of HB 3 as a \u201csleight of hand;\u201d a trick manufactured by the abortion industry to strike down a powerful, pro-life law. He said that Planned Parenthood \u201csummarily asserts that all of HB 3 operates as an effective ban on pre-viability abortion and must therefore be enjoined in its entirety. That argument makes no sense, and Planned Parenthood has done nothing to convince the court otherwise.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe continued by highlighting the obvious fraudulence of the lawsuits and unmasking Planned Parenthood\u2019s real purpose in taking this law to court, writing: \u201cThe fact that Planned Parenthood is not yet able to complete certain forms is not a blank check for (it) to ignore every other provision of HB 3 that it does not like.\u201d Wow\u2014consider yourself burned and schooled, Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis clearly isn\u2019t AG Cameron\u2019s first rodeo; in fact, he did wonders for the pro-life movement a little earlier this year as well when he took a case up to the United States Supreme Court and came home triumphant. SFLA reported back in March:\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cPro-life Attorney General Daniel Cameron took his fight to defend the law [Kentucky\u2019s 2018 law which banned dismemberment abortions] all the way to the Supreme Court, and today\u2019s ruling in his favor sets a precedent for future government officials who may need to step in to defend pro-life laws when governors or district attorneys\u202frefuse to do so.\u202f\u00a0\nStudents for Life of America has been following the case from the\u202fbeginning, and\u202frallied in support\u202fof AG Cameron during oral arguments last October and is celebrating today\u2019s victory as a win for the preborn. SFLA and Students for Life Action are looking forward to preborn children receiving the protection they deserve in Kentucky thanks to AG Cameron\u2019s persistence.\u201d \u202f\u00a0\n\n(To read more about the Cameron v. EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center case that AG Cameron won, click HERE.)\u00a0\u00a0\nSFLA salutes AG Cameron once again and applauds him as an inspiration for the Pro-Life Generation. He is a stellar representative of the movement as a philosophically- sound, hard-working history-maker. Keep up the good work, AG Cameron\u2014you make the pro-life movement proud.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Medical Students Do Not Want to Commit Abortions; Abortion Activists Are Trying to Force Them\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,039\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
