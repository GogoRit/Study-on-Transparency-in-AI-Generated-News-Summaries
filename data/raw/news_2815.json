From our immediate family to our friends and family, our co-workers and family, our city and family, our state and family, our country and family, our world,\u201d the rap superstar said.\n\u201cThe culture of humanity needs to be family,\u201d West continued, adding, \u201cThe design of our cities, the design of our schools, there\u2019s a lot of things designed for us to not promote family, they\u2019re designed to create separation.\u201d\nAbortion has become a central component of West\u2019s campaign, and the artist continued to reference it throughout the interview.\nKanye West speaks to Nick Cannon on his YouTube podcast.Youtube\n\u201cThere\u2019s some harsh facts that deal with the black genocide that is abortion, and it\u2019s happening every day,\u201d West said, adding that God had given him this information because he wanted him to use his platform to share it.\nOver the past 50 years, the rap superstar said, more than 22.5 million black children were aborted \u201cstrategically and on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood was set up and placed in minority communities to kill black people,\u201d West asserted.\nCannon and West then discussed Margaret Sanger, a founder of Planned Parenthood, whom the organization recently disavowed over her connections to the eugenics movement.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\tNick Cannon supports Kanye's presidential bid: 'We need another black man in power'\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rapper then pulled out his phone, reading a damning account of Sanger.\n\u201cMargaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was an avowed racist whose goal was to reduce the black population in America and she succeeded. Eighty percent of abortion clinics in America are in minority neighborhoods,\u201d West read from his phone.\nPlanned Parenthood was founded by Sanger, her sister and a friend in 1916 as America\u2019s first birth control clinic in Brooklyn.\nWhile she was beloved by feminists for her views on women\u2019s reproductive access, she also supported eugenics, the discredited movement promoting selective breeding that often targeted people of color and the disabled.\nWhile noting that black babies were aborted every day, West argued that \u201cwe are inside of genocide as we speak.\u201d\nCannon, who is similarly pro-life and expressed like-minded views on supporting black motherhood, asked the artist if he needed to run for the presidency in order to adequately promote these different points of view.\n\u201cWell, it hit me to run for president in 2015,\u201d West said, before explaining that he made his decision to name his political party the Birthday Party because it was \u201cabout life,\u201d referencing abortion again.\n\u201cThe connection point to the Birthday Party is dealing with life, and pro-life, because these are kids who are now going to get a chance to have birthdays.\u201d\nKanye went on to explain that with his candidacy and promoting black motherhood, more children would be born, and thus, more children would have birthday parties.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\tNick Cannon sits down with rabbi after anti-Semitic remarks\t\n\n\n\n\n\nWest continued that while some in the media wanted to knock him for crying at the South Carolina rally at the thought of aborting his daughter, \u201cthere are people who have decided to have [their] child because they connected\u201d to what he said.\n\u201cBecause of South Carolina, there are people who have decided to have the child because they connected. If they were on the fence about it, they never saw anyone in my position take that position.\u201d\nWest then referenced his father, who he said made him apologize for bringing up at his raucous rally that his parents had wanted to abort him as well.\n\u201cMy father made me apologize to him for bringing this up publicly \u2026 he also said the abortion culture teaches people that a child isn\u2019t a real soul.\u201d\nSoon after, West decried how men were removed from the abortion conversation, remarking that he felt the need to be mindful about using the word \u201cabortion\u201d as a man.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how shook we are about using the word \u2018abortion\u2019 as men,\u201d he said.\nCannon shared West\u2019s frustration as a male, saying that it was an argument made by those on the pro-choice side of the issue that men couldn\u2019t be involved in the conversation.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a strategy to take the male opinion out of any conversation, like taking the leaders and the males out of neighborhoods in the \u201980s,\u201d West replied.\n\u201cYou need both opinions,\u201d the rap superstar continued, \u201cyou need the male and the female opinion.\u201d\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppClick to email a link to a
