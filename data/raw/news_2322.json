Wade.Julia ArcigaReporterUpdated\u00a0Jan. 24, 2020\u00a06:53PM EST\u00a0/\u00a0Published\u00a0Jan. 24, 2020\u00a05:26PM EST\u00a0Oliver Douliery/GettyIf there is any tension between religious Americans and President Donald Trump, it wasn\u2019t evident at Friday\u2019s pro-life March for Life.\u00a0The march comes weeks after an op-ed in Christianity Today, which called for Trump\u2019s removal from office, raised questions about whether the president\u2019s strong evangelical support is eroding. But crowds at the rally roared when he came on stage, as the first president to address the march in person. They also cheered when he declared himself the \u201cmost pro-life president in American history.\u201d\u201cWe are so blessed to finally have a president who has the guts to do things like this\u2014for us, this is huge,\u201d Howie, a 63-year-old from Pennsylvania, said.The large majority of people at the event had come in large church groups or were students from religious schools, and Trump catered to his audience accordingly\u2014calling a child in a womb a \u201cglimpse\u201d into the \u201cmajesty of God\u2019s creation,\u201d and stating that all human life was \u201cmade in the holy image of almighty God.\u201d  \u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House, and as the Bible tells us: each person is wonderfully made,\u201d he said.In a 1999 Meet the Press interview, Trump said he was \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d despite him \u201chate[ing] the concept of abortion.\u201d He has since swung to the other side of the issue, mentioning his pro-life beliefs in political speeches and campaign rallies.\u00a0 \u201cSavannah, a 23-year-old from Washington state, said the \u2018ultimate goal\u2019\u00a0of the movement was to reverse Roe v. Wade.\u201d The religious rhetoric from the president resonated with many, including Robin Jenkins\u2014a Whitepost, Virginia woman who came with her church.\u201cIt is murder, it\u2019s not God\u2019s will,\u201d\u00a0Jenkins said, referring to abortion. \u201cI believe the Bible is right and the whole nation needs to turn back to what God says is right.\u201dTrump also touted his actions to push forward the pro-life agenda while in office\u2014like reinstating the Mexico City Policy (also called the global gag rule, which cuts off funding for NGOs that provide abortion counseling or referrals), cutting off federal funding to organizations who provide abortion services in many cases, and filling up vacant judicial seats with anti-abortion judges.\u201cTo uphold our founding documents, we have confirmed 187 federal judges who apply the Constitution as written,\u201d Trump said to a burst of loud cheers.As Trump boasted about the number of judges he put on the bench, Howie fist-bumped one of his friends.\u00a0\u201cWhen he gets re-elected and he appoints one more conservative judge, the Supreme Court will be locked up for a long, long time and that will allow for sanctity of human life and Roe v. Wade hopefully to be overturned\u2014so that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping and praying for,\u201d Howie said, adding that filling up the courts was one of the \u201cmajor\u201d reasons he would be supporting Trump in 2020. \u201cThat will set the tone for years and years and years to come.\u201dSavannah, a 23-year-old from Washington state, said the \u201cultimate goal\u201d\u00a0of the movement was to reverse Roe v. Wade. She didn\u2019t describe herself as pro-life for religious reasons and denied being a fervent Trump supporter, but said she planned on voting for him in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m not a personal fan of his behavior but I\u2019m an issues voter, and there\u2019s no issue that\u2019s more important to me than pro-life.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t [vote for Trump] last year. I would prefer to vote third-party but it\u2019s difficult. I\u2019m technically a libertarian, so I would love to vote for a libertarian but a lot of libertarians are pro-choice\u2014so I do vote pro-life ultimately,\u201d she said.\u00a0The March for Life took a pro-women tone this year, with promotional videos and speakers on the stage insisting that abortion was an anti-women belief. Trump praised mothers for being \u201cheroes\u201d and said the \u201cdevotion\u201d\u00a0and leadership of women \u201cuplifts the entire nation.\u201dSavannah admitted that Trump said \u201cwacky\u201d things about women in the past, like his \u201cgrab \u2018em by the pussy\u201d comment, but chalked it up to Trump not being \u201cperfect\u201d or having a politician\u2019s polish.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t always say the correct things, it is what it is. But I care more about someone\u2019s actions and what they do rather than what they say,\u201d she said.\u00a0Jenkins\u2019 friend, 51-year-old Kim Houzer, also said she didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but would be supporting him in 2020 for the pro-life movement.\u201cI look at what his actions are. What his personal beliefs are, I don\u2019t know, but what he does is what matters to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a personal fan of his behavior but I\u2019m an issues voter, and there\u2019s no issue that\u2019s more important to me than pro-life.\u201d  Julia ArcigaReporter@JuliaArcigaGot a tip?
