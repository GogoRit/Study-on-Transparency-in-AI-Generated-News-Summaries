(CNS photo/Jim Bourg, Reuters)\n  20220308T1439-USA-COURT-JACKSON-1522827 web\n\u00ab\n\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSomething unusual happened last month at the session during which President Joe Biden introduced Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as his choice for the Supreme Court. When her turn to speak came, she began by thanking not Biden but God.\nThese days nominees for high office in the nation\u2019s capital don\u2019t ordinarily declare themselves by speaking first of God. But Jackson made it a point to credit God at the start \u201cfor delivering me to this point in my professional career.\u201d Speaking as prospectively the first black woman justice, she told the world that \u201cone can only come this far by faith.\u201d\nIt may be grasping at straws. But those unexpected words on what was a very special occasion for her offered at least a glimmer of hope that on the bench she might emerge as something rather different from the acolyte of abortion and LGBTQ rights that the liberal media have made her out to be.\nThat said, I readily admit it may be wishful thinking. But we shall see.\nDon\u2019t expect much light on this subject from the four days of confirmation hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee that begin March 21. Following well-established precedent set by other Supreme Court nominees, Jackson is expected to announce that she firmly supports Goodness, Truth, and Beauty and thinks the U.S. Constitution is just swell. Concerning specific questions she will face as a member of the Supreme Court she\u2019ll stay mum.\nYears back, Jackson clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, author of the majority opinions in all the court\u2019s major abortion cases of the last two decades. Aside from the most obvious differences \u2014 gender and race \u2014 the most significant difference between Breyer and Jackson is age. He is 83 and she is 51, which will make her the court\u2019s second youngest member after Justice Amy Coney Barret, who is 50.\nBreyer will formally retire when the court\u2019s current term ends in late June, and Jackson, presumably confirmed by then, will immediately succeed him.\u00a0 Barring the unexpected, it\u2019s a good bet that once on the Supreme Court, she will remain there for the next quarter century or more.\nAs an associate justice she will be part of a three-woman liberal minority composed of herself, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. The six other justices, generally described as conservatives, are Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett.\nJackson will be joining the court shortly after it announces its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The outcome in that closely watched case, involving a Mississippi law barring virtually all abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy, is widely expected either to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, or at least to permit meaningful state restrictions on the practice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEither way, the court will face a slew of new cases involving new state enactments. Anticipating a favorable outcome in Dobbs, pro-life state legislatures have already adopted dozens of new laws setting limits on abortion and there are more to come if the Supreme Court does as expected. Challenges to those laws will keep Jackson and her colleagues occupied for years.\nCasting grave doubt on the faint hope that the new justice might be anything less than totally pro-choice was the ecstatic reaction of abortion rights groups to her nomination. Typical of the comments was the statement from NARAL Pro-Choice America, which hailed her \u201cdemonstrated record of defending\u201d abortion rights. That includes co-authoring a brief supporting NARAL in a case that involved a Massachusetts law establishing a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around abortion clinics to keep pro-life protesters at bay.\nAgainst this background, it\u2019s reasonable to suppose that the prospects that Jackson will disappoint the abortion lobby and embarrass Joe Biden lie somewhere between unlikely and impossible. And yet \u2014mightn\u2019t a person who thanks the Lord of Life for bringing her to the apex of her career have second thoughts about voting in favor of destroying unborn lives?\nDon\u2019t count on it, but don\u2019t count it out entirely.\nShaw writes from Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTopics: Pro-Life supreme court \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal presence \n\n\n\n3/7/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     3\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsh Wednesday for Catholics \n\n\n\n2/14/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     3\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story is not over: we continue to pray, march and work for all life \n\n\n\n1/25/24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to eNewsletter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArlington Catholic Herald200 N.
