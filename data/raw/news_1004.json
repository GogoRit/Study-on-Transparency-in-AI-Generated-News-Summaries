Ron DeSantis speaks to supporters before signing Florida's 15-week abortion ban into law at Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee. \n\nPaul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Florida\u2019s law banning abortions at 15 weeks will remain in effect after the state filed an appeal Tuesday that stayed a state judge\u2019s order temporarily blocking the ban.\n    \n\n            In a verbal ruling last week, Second Judicial Circuit Court Judge John Cooper said that the Florida law was unconstitutional and that he would issue a temporary statewide injunction in a challenge brought by some Florida abortion providers. The law, known as House Bill 5, went into effect on Friday. \n    \n\n            Cooper signed the written order on Tuesday morning. But soon after, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, filed an appeal on behalf of the state, automatically staying the judge\u2019s order under Florida state law.\n    \n\n            Plaintiffs said they intend to file a motion seeking to reinstate the injunction.\n    \n\n            Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the new abortion restrictions into law in April. \n    \n\n            Florida previously allowed abortion through the second trimester of a pregnancy, with exceptions to save the pregnant woman\u2019s life or avert \u201cserious risk of imminent substantial and irreversible physical impairment\u201d to the woman.\u201d\n    \n\n            HB 5 bans abortion after 15 weeks, with an exemption for a fatal fetal abnormality if two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing. It does not allow exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.\n    \n\n            Several abortion providers sued to block the law on June 1, arguing that it \u201ccriminalizes pre-viability abortions in direct violation of Floridians\u2019 fundamental privacy rights guaranteed by the Florida Constitution.\u201d\n    \n\n            In his written order, Cooper said that the plaintiffs had a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that HB 5 violates the right to privacy contained in the Florida Constitution.\u201d \n    \n\nCNN\u2019s Steve Contorno
