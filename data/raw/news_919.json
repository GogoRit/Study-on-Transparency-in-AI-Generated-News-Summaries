That\u2019s normal. In our state, with requisite training and certification, advanced registered nurse practitioners (ARNPs) and physician assistants (PAs) can become abortion providers, and a new bill introduced in this year\u2019s legislative session would make it official. This proposed change to Washington\u2019s Reproductive Privacy Act, which codified abortion rights statewide in 1991, is one of several changes raised in the new bill, known as the Affirm Washington Abortion Access Act (HB 1851/SB 5766).\n\nIn addition to officially broadening the state\u2019s base of abortion providers, the bill, which was voted out of the House Health Care & Wellness Committee on Wednesday, Jan. 26, also seeks to \u201c[preserve] a pregnant individual\u2019s ability to access abortion care\u201d through making the language of the law gender-neutral and protecting individuals from prosecution for self-managed abortion. In what reads as a blue-state clapback to the vigilantism promoted by Texas\u2019 extreme six-week abortion ban, the bill would also shield anyone who provides assistance to someone else seeking abortion care.\nThe expansion of Washington State\u2019s base of abortion providers isn\u2019t new: Advanced-practice clinicians already provide abortions, supported by opinions issued by the attorney general\u2019s office under Bob Ferguson in 2019 and Christine Gregoire in 2004. But the opinion issued by Ferguson concluded that \u201ca statutory clarification that removes any doubt about the authority of PAs and ARNPs would be ideal.\u201d The Affirm Washington Abortion Access Act would do just that, and it follows similar legislation passed by California in 2013.\nWith some states ready to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is reversed or weakened later this year, it\u2019s also notable that the Affirm Washington Abortion Access Act includes language protecting Washingtonians from prosecution for self-managing or facilitating abortion \u2014 a topical development, given the rise of self-managed medication abortion and the legal questions its availability raises.\nAccording to Sara Ainsworth, senior legal and policy director at the reproductive justice law group If/When/How, no one has been prosecuted for simply ordering abortion pills through the mail for personal use, and the Food and Drug Administration has clarified that obtaining medication abortion by mail through telehealth is unambiguously legal. But if the drugs are obtained outside of the health care system or through a pharmacy in another country, state and federal laws regulating prescription drugs introduce a legal gray area for both patients and providers.\nAinsworth says the number of people ordering pills online and using them safely and without legal consequences far exceeds the number of prosecutions, but navigating the overlap between different state and national policies can be confusing. With its protections for people who have abortions, Washington\u2019s abortion bill would help clear up that ambiguity locally. This is also why If/When/How operates a Repro Legal Helpline, which helps people sourcing abortion pills determine the legality of doing so within specific jurisdictions. As with so many things related to abortion and reproductive health, whether the law is on your side \u2014 and whether you have access to care at all \u2014 depends a lot on where you live.\nThe protections would also keep pregnant people from being prosecuted for their own pregnancy outcomes. While it may sound like something out of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, this has happened: Laws against \u201cfeticide\u201d or \u201cfetal harm\u201d have been used against pregnant people who self-manage abortion, miscarry, or even happen to be a victim of a violent crime while pregnant. In 2019, that\u2019s exactly what happened to an Alabama woman named Marshae Jones, who was charged with manslaughter after a shooting ended her pregnancy. In cases like these, evidence that someone has purchased abortion pills online could be used against them.\nBlack, Indigenous, and People of Color and folks living in poverty are more likely to be targeted by this prosecutorial overreach. \u201cFrom all of the cases that we are familiar with \u2026 it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re more likely to be targeted if you\u2019re a Person of Color,\u201d said Ainsworth. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to be targeted if you\u2019re an immigrant. All of the people targeted for these kinds of prosecutions have been low-income, with very few exceptions.\u201d\nThough a case like Jones\u2019 would be unlikely to proceed in Washington, the State code does contain a fetal harm law that could open the door to prosecutions like the ones Ainsworth described. The legislature\u2019s abortion bill would keep that from happening.\n\n\nMegan Burbank is a writer and editor based in Seattle.
