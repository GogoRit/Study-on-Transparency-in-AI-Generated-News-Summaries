I was told that if I had sex before marriage, you are a cup of water and whenever \u00a0you have sex with a boy, he spits in it and who else would want to drink that cup of water.\n\u00a0\nJessica\nSo I\u2019m from Lowndes County, a small rural town in the Black Belt. My first exposure to sexual health was a sexual health class. The beginning we signed these virginity pledges and then we just started doing homework.\n\u00a0\nAbba\nEverything I knew about sex I learned from the internet, the back of the bus and watching trash TV.\n\u00a0\nVOICE OVER Annerieke \nIn Alabama, schools are not required to provide sexual health education and if they do teach it, the State Code requires a focus on abstinence.\n\u00a0\nSynauri Boykin, High school biology teacher\nWe need sex education in schools because children, regardless of what they do, they need to have the education necessary to be able to make the decisions that\u2019s going to impact their lives.\n\u00a0\nAbba\nThat is the role of a school, a school is supposed to like educate and prepare kids and I do think they deserve to be given as much information as possible to make the right decisions for themselves.\n\u00a0\nLocator: Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity (URGE)\nUniversity of Alabama Chapter\n\u00a0\nAbba I wish that more young people understood what an STI is and how it affects the body and how exactly it\u2019s spread.\nAnnerieke Voice over\nAlabama has high rates of sexually transmitted infections or STIs. \u00a0One STI, the human papillomavirus or HPV, can lead to several types of \u00a0cancer, including cervical cancer. Alabama has one of the highest rates of cervical cancer deaths in the US and Black women there are twice as likely to die from the disease as white women.\nCervical cancer is highly preventable. The HPV vaccine is an effective cancer prevention tool and protects against most of the strains of HPV that can lead to cancer. Yet in Alabama, vaccination rates are low. Without access to information, young people lack the knowledge to decrease the risk of cervical cancer and safeguard their health.\n\u00a0\nJessica\nI feel like a lot of people see the HPV vaccine as something that\u2019s gonna make girls promiscuous so they kind of shun away from that. I know sometimes when I do outreach events and we talk about HPV vaccinations and then girls they\u2019re are really confused, like \u201cwhat is that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAshley Wagner, Nurse Practitioner\nVaccines are good. They help prevent disease and in this case they help prevent cancer so we need to market them to a level to parents and children, within school community, within churches.\n\u00a0\nDr. Pilar Murphy, Associate Professor of Pharmacy, Samford University\nI am so big on prevention.\u00a0 If we can teach people how to prevent, if we can teach you to get the HPV vaccination, if we can teach you to get those Paps [PAP smears] on time, maybe I can prevent you from getting cancer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLast July, I\u00a0spoke with Sky H., a 20-year\u2013old\u00a0who\u00a0identifies as non-binary\u00a0and\u00a0grew up in a\u00a0very\u00a0conservative rural town in\u00a0the Black Belt region of\u00a0Alabama.\u00a0In school, Sky received abstinence-only education.\u00a0Sky\u00a0told me\u00a0there was little instruction\u00a0about sexual and reproductive health\u00a0besides the basics of reproduction.\nAfter years of pain,\u00a0Sky was diagnosed\u00a0at age 18\u00a0with endometriosis, a painful disorder\u00a0that\u00a0can lead to fertility complications.\u00a0The condition might\u00a0have\u00a0been diagnosed much earlier if they had learned more about their own bodies and\u00a0reproductive health in school, Sky believed.\nUnfortunately, Sky\u2019s experience isn\u2019t unique.\u00a0Over the past\u00a0year and a half,\u00a0I\u2019ve spoken to more than\u00a040\u00a0young people from 16 counties throughout Alabama\u00a0who also didn\u2019t learn about their sexual and reproductive health in school. Like Sky, they missed out on\u00a0critical information\u00a0and\u00a0described the\u00a0negative\u00a0impact this had on the choices they made\u00a0and their health as they grew older.\nSchools in Alabama\u00a0are not required\u00a0to teach about\u00a0sexual health but\u00a0if they do, the State Code\u00a0mandates\u00a0a\u00a0focus on abstinence.\u00a0The State Code\u00a0also\u00a0contains stigmatizing language around same-sex activity and\u00a0prohibits schools from teaching\u00a0about sexual health in ways that affirm lesbian, gay,\u00a0bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth. This makes it even harder for young people like\u00a0Sky to\u00a0get\u00a0information.\nBut Alabama is not alone.\u00a0Sixteen\u00a0other\u00a0states in the U.S.\u00a0also do not mandate\u00a0sex\u00a0education in schools.\u00a0And at least\u00a0five others\u00a0have laws stigmatizing same\u2013sex activity.\nComprehensive sexuality\u00a0education\u00a0can\u00a0improve\u00a0health outcomes\u00a0for\u00a0young people. It can help them learn about their\u00a0bodies\u00a0and how to recognize abnormal gynecological symptoms,\u00a0steps they can take to prevent\u00a0and treat\u00a0sexually\u00a0transmitted infections\u00a0(STIs)\u00a0and other dangers to their health,\u00a0and where they\u00a0can go for reproductive health services.\nSex ed can also educate young\u00a0people\u00a0about\u00a0the human papillomavirus\u00a0(HPV)\u00a0\u2014 the most common\u00a0sexually transmitted infection\u00a0in the U.S. \u2014 and how to lower their risk of HPV-related cancers through the HPV vaccine.\nThis information\u00a0can\u00a0improve\u00a0young people\u2019s\u00a0health\u00a0and\u00a0save lives.\u00a0Yet so few young\u00a0people in\u00a0schools throughout\u00a0Alabama\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0receive it. Instead, like Sky and\u00a0other\u00a0Alabama\u00a0students,\u00a0many young people receive abstinence-focused education.\nThese programs withhold critical, science-based information young people need to make safer decisions on their sexual health. They also shame adolescents\u00a0about their\u00a0sexuality, often leaving young people\u00a0uncertain about who they can talk to or where they can\u00a0go\u00a0for\u00a0accurate\u00a0information\u00a0about\u00a0sexual behavior and health.\nThe problem is\u00a0both a lack of political will and\u00a0of adequate funding.\u00a0Discriminatory property taxes and an inequitable education system\u00a0leave many school districts in\u00a0rural and\u00a0less wealthy regions of\u00a0Alabama\u00a0without adequate funding.\u00a0This means\u00a0that programs considered\u00a0optional,\u00a0like\u00a0sex ed,\u00a0often\u00a0aren\u2019t offered.\nAlabama, a state with high rates of\u00a0sexually transmitted infections\u00a0and cancers\u00a0related\u00a0to\u00a0HPV\u00a0needs to do more\u00a0to address historic inequalities and state neglect that have\u00a0left Black people at a higher risk of poor health outcomes.\u00a0Mandating comprehensive sexuality\u00a0education\u00a0for all\u00a0of the state\u2019s schools\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0allocating\u00a0state funding for these programs \u2014\u00a0would be an\u00a0important step forward.\nStudents\u00a0in\u00a0underfunded and neglected school districts\u00a0\u2014\u00a0many of whom\u00a0are\u00a0Black and living in poverty \u2014\u00a0often\u00a0lose out on access to critical and lifesaving information.\u00a0It keeps them from being able\u00a0to make informed and safe decisions and can\u00a0harm their health.\u00a0This unequal access to information can create lifelong disadvantages and may contribute to racial disparities in health\u00a0as\u00a0young\u00a0people\u00a0age into adulthood.\nThe Black Belt region of Alabama, where Sky is from,\u00a0has\u00a0high rates of poverty and poor health outcomes.\u00a0The Black Belt\u00a0region also\u00a0has high rates of\u00a0sexually\u00a0transmitted\u00a0infections\u00a0and the\u00a0highest rates of\u00a0HIV in the state.\u00a0Yet schools\u00a0in this rural and marginalized region of the state\u00a0are persistently underfunded.\nThe\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic\u00a0has brought\u00a0glaring\u00a0attention to systemic\u00a0inequalities and\u00a0racial\u00a0disparities\u00a0in health,\u00a0including in Alabama,\u00a0where Black\u00a0people are significantly\u00a0more\u00a0likely to die from the virus than white people.\u00a0Within the United States, we\u00a0continue to\u00a0see the disproportionate toll the pandemic has taken on Black\u00a0people,\u00a0who\u00a0are more likely to live in poverty, lack\u00a0access to health insurance, and suffer from\u00a0chronic health conditions\u00a0that\u00a0put them at a higher risk of adverse health outcomes from the virus.\nThe pandemic\u00a0has\u00a0highlighted the importance of\u00a0ensuring that everyone has the information, tools, and resources they need to make informed decisions to protect their health. Schools in Alabama\u00a0\u2014 and across\u00a0the\u00a0country \u2014\u00a0should\u00a0help do\u00a0that\u00a0for all young\u00a0people.\nThe pandemic is\u00a0also showing us what happens\u00a0when discrimination and neglect leave certain people out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nSexual and Reproductive Health Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Alabama Missing Ways to Improve Young People\u2019s Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nHow Sex Ed Can Save Lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cIt Wasn\u2019t Really Safety, It Was Shame\u201d \n\n\nYoung People, Sexual Health Education, and HPV in Alabama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 29, 2018\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nIt Should Not Happen\n\n\nAlabama\u2019s Failure to Prevent Cervical Cancer Death in the Black Belt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Alabama Missing Ways to Improve Young People\u2019s Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nHow Sex Ed Can Save Lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
