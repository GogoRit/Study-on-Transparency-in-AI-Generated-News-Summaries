Options were limited in the rural region of Texas where she lived, along the Red River that would, two decades later, come to form the Oklahoma state line. So Smith\u2019s former teacher got a blacksmith to make a \u201cmetallic instrument,\u201d which he used to open her vagina to allow him to insert a 7-inch metal rod inside of her womb.\n\u201cShe stated that this operation gave her pain, and that for a short time she felt sick and faint, but it soon passed off,\u201d according to court records. Smith also drank a compound of cotton root and oil of rue, and a month later, delivered a stillborn fetus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Texas was under a near-total abortion ban that outlawed performing or \u201cfurnishing the means for\u201d an abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant patient, punishable by up to five years in the penitentiary.\nThe law had been on the books for as long as Texas had books, dating back to the creation of the state\u2019s penal code in 1857. It remained in effect, largely unchanged but only intermittently enforced, for the next 116 years until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          The north side of the Texas Capitol grounds in 1892.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Austin History Center, Austin Public Library\n        \n\n\n\n\nNow, after a reversal from the same court at the end of June, this frontier-era statute is once again the law of the land, leading to a near-total termination of abortion in Texas. Clinics have closed, and citing the vagueness of the law, abortion funds have even stopped paying for the procedure over state lines \u2014 state lines which, in some cases, didn\u2019t even exist when the laws were first written.\nThe laws, often called the \u201cpre-Roe statutes,\u201d are also sometimes mistermed the \u201c1925 laws,\u201d which refers to the year that Texas recodified the statute while reorganizing its penal code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the laws actually appeared much earlier, during the brief period when Texas had joined the United States but not yet left for the Confederacy. It was a moment when many states were passing similar restrictions, motivated by a declining white birth rate and encouraged by a nascent medical profession trying to take control of childbirth and reproduction.\nHow these 165-year-old statutes that have been suspended for five decades will be used in 2022 remains to be seen, said South Texas College of Law professor Charles \u201cRocky\u201d Rhodes.\n\u201cThis was legislation that wasn\u2019t really designed for the types of situations that we\u2019re being presented with today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not very clear \u2026 to try to figure out what they meant back then.\u201d\nSpanish origins\nThe origin of abortion restrictions in Texas starts much earlier \u2014 and in a much different place \u2014 than much of the rest of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish common law, which governed the early United States, allowed abortion up to \u201cquickening\u201d or the point 15 to 20 weeks into pregnancy when a fetus can first be felt moving in the womb.\nBut Texas originated as a Spanish colony and then became part of independent Mexico, both of which prohibited abortion. For its decade of existence, the Republic of Texas \u201cjust continued on with that,\u201d said Lina-Maria Murillo, a historian at the University of Iowa who has studied abortion laws in Texas and Mexico.\n\u201cTexas is special \u2026 because it experiences so many different legal systems in a matter of decades,\u201d Murillo said. \u201cAnd the abortion question really brings into stark relief that moment of turmoil of Texas and its position vis a vis the United States.\u201d\nDespite the longstanding legal restrictions on abortion, Texans still found ways to control their reproductive destinies, historians say. In the absence of pregnancy tests or advanced understanding of menstrual cycles, how these practices aligned with the abortion law wasn\u2019t always clear-cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were no period trackers at the time, and so they would take a potion or a brew, and they would take it to so-called \u2018bring on their menses,\u2019\u201d said reproductive health historian Rebecca Kluchin. \u201cIt could be to regulate their menstruation or it could be to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it was just really blurry.\u201d\nAbortion providers were rarely, if ever, criminalized in this period, in part because the information about whether and how long a woman was pregnant rested entirely with the woman herself.\n\u201cYou can see cases where someone swears an abortion [happened] on a woman,\u201d Kluchin said. \u201cAnd \u2026 her representative \u2014 because she can\u2019t speak in court \u2014 would just say she was never pregnant, and never quickened, and very clearly she\u2019s not now, and the law finds for her.\u201d\nBy the time Texas joined the United States in 1846, though, the former British colonies were moving in the direction of their Spanish counterparts when it came to criminalizing abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas\u2019 fledgling medical industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Cover page of the sixth Texas Legislature\u2019s penal code, adopted in 1857.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Legislative Library of Texas\n        \n\n\n\n\nTexas\u2019 abortion statute, filed in the state\u2019s first penal code under \u201coffences against the persons or individuals,\u201d came with two to five years of prison time for performing or furnishing the means for an abortion. The law exempted abortions performed \u201cby medical advice\u201d to save the life of the pregnant patient.\nIt was codified at a moment when the medical establishment in Texas was starting to take shape and assert itself politically.\nIn 1852, a group of physicians placed an ad in the Texas State Gazette calling a meeting of all those \u201cdesirous of promoting the advancement and improvement, as well as elevating the standard of our profession within this State.\u201d\nAt the time, the medical profession in the United States was almost entirely unregulated. Any man \u2014 with any level of education or experience \u2014 could call himself a doctor and charge for medical remedies of varying usefulness. Texas had no medical schools, although several prominent Texans were educated in other states before returning home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          The Capitol building in Austin from 1856 until it burned in 1881.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Texas Politics Project\n        \n\n\n\n\nThirty-five of those trained physicians \u2014 referred to as the \u201cregulars\u201d \u2014 attended that first meeting in Austin in 1852 and, by the next year, succeeded in getting the Legislature to authorize the creation of the Medical Association of Texas.\nThey were all men; Texas would not admit the first \u201clady applicant\u201d until 1887. And with the Civil War looming, according to a history of the Texas Medical Association, \u201cpractically all Texas physicians were loyal to the Confederacy.\u201d\nThe nascent group wanted to institute educational requirements and standards of care to root out \u201cquack\u201d doctors. They also wanted to start making real money. Doctors were generally paid by the case, and since they weren\u2019t particularly well-respected, they weren\u2019t called on that often.\n\u201cBut women were having babies every two years,\u201d Kluchin said. \u201cSo doctors are trying to push in on midwives, in terms of childbirth, but midwives also tended to be the healers in their communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationally, doctors started a campaign against midwives, Kluchin said, painting them as dirty, uneducated and dangerous to pregnant women.\n\u201cBut these are health care providers who have a ton of knowledge and deep experience, and they tend to have better outcomes in terms of obstetrics than doctors,\u201d Kluchin said. \u201cDoctors come in in the 1850s with forceps and anesthesia promising an easier birth, but there\u2019s no regulations.\u201d\nMidwives were also the keepers of knowledge about how to terminate a pregnancy. This is part of why state laws regulating abortion often had an exception to save the life of the pregnant patient \u2014 as determined by a doctor.\nTexas\u2019 efforts to regulate both childbirth and abortion coincided with a national effort started by a Boston doctor named Horatio Storer. Storer and the American Medical Association pushed states to tighten their abortion laws, citing concerns over \u201cunborn life\u201d and women shirking their responsibilities as wives and mothers, said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian focusing on abortion at Florida State University College of Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorer\u2019s other main argument \u2014 both explicit and implicit \u2014 focused on rising immigration and declining white birth rates. Birth rates in the U.S. plummeted during the 19th century from about seven children per woman to less than four, with white women making up the steepest declines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Texas\u2019 efforts to regulate both childbirth and abortion coincided with a national effort started by a Boston doctor named Horatio Storer, who pushed states to tighten their abortion laws.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Public domain\n        \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thought was that with the abortion laws as they stood, the racial stock of the U.S. was going to decline,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cBecause the wrong people were going to be having more kids and the right people were going to be having fewer kids.\u201d\nIn Texas, a slave state with a large Mexican population, these racial concerns were front and center. Murillo posits that maintaining white birth rates was seen at that time as an essential part of maintaining white power in the state.\n\u201cThey\u2019re sort of wrestling with this population question at this moment,\u201d Murillo said. \u201cAnd it becomes even more so once they become part of the Confederacy in 1861, just [four] years after they established the penal code.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly legal battles\nUnlike in current times, Texas\u2019 1850s abortion ban didn\u2019t spark much of a backlash.\n\u201cPeople just kept having abortions,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cTo the extent there was a protest, it was just people ignoring the law.\u201d\nTexas was still largely rural and law enforcement was informal and sparse. There wasn\u2019t much effort to proactively identify and root out people who were performing or helping people access abortions.\n\u201cThese laws weren\u2019t so much preventative as they were disciplinary,\u201d Murillo said. \u201cThis is about making an example, especially an example of white women and \u2026 disciplining white fertility.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laws were most often used in cases in which the women died, like a case from the early 1900s near Fort Worth. Two doctors were called to treat a woman who was \u201csuffering from hemorrhages from the womb which was greatly distended, the discharged matter being quite offensive,\u201d according to court records.\nAmid her screams of pain, the woman admitted that she\u2019d had an abortion. The doctors refused to treat her until she told them who had helped her terminate her pregnancy. Eventually, she gave the name of a doctor who had \u201cused instruments and tried to take it away.\u201d\nThe doctor who elicited this deathbed confession told law enforcement that \u201che did not think she was dying at the time, and he further said that her cries were caused by the pain she was suffering rather than from any calm, deliberate belief that death was impending.\u201d\nThe doctor she accused was convicted, though an appeals court later overturned the ruling on several grounds, including the inadmissibility of her dying declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt cases like these were the venue through which the nuances of the law were sorted out over the course of decades. In 1907, after that case and other legal challenges, the Legislature voted to add a definition of abortion to the law, declaring that the \u201cfact that Article 641 of the Penal Code, which relates to the offense of abortion, does not define said offense, and is therefore inoperative, creates an emergency.\u201d\nIn several cases from the turn of the century, the court ruled conclusively that the person who undergoes an abortion cannot be criminally charged as either the principal or accomplice.\nAn appeals court ruled that while Mollie Smith, the 20-year-old impregnated by her former teacher, \u201cmay be culpable morally, under our law she is not indictable for an abortion committed on herself.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s case offers a foreshadow of how the law may be prosecuted in the modern era of medication abortion; the man who provided her with medication to terminate the pregnancy tried to argue in court that he was just an accomplice to her misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAppellant seems to think, because he merely procured the drug, handed it to her and advised her to take it, and did not actually assist her or force her to take it, therefore he did not \u2018administer\u2019 it to her,\u201d the appeals court wrote. \u201cThere is good authority sustaining the proposition that to deliver a drug, poison or medicine to another for the purpose of being used for abortion is to administer the same.\u201d\n1857 statutes\u00a0today\nAt times, illegal abortion operated in plain sight in Texas, largely unchecked \u2014 and sometimes even aided \u2014 by law enforcement, Murillo said. But at other points, she said, the crackdowns would be swift and severe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of ebbed and flowed with the politics of moralizing,\u201d Murillo said.\nBut in the 1960s, the tide started moving in the opposite direction. Feminist activists, in Texas and across the country, began speaking out against abortion bans that had, in many cases, sat unexamined for decades. In 1970, two young women lawyers brought a lawsuit challenging the Texas statutes on constitutional grounds, and in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee worked together to successfully argue Roe v. Wade, which in 1973 gave women a right to abortion.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nRoe v. Wade blocked not just Texas\u2019 statute but all state abortion bans, instead instituting a constitutional protection for abortion up to the point of viability, usually around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe Texas attorney general said in a 1974 advisory that the laws \u201care no longer of any effect. \u2026 Therefore, there are now no laws in this State regulating abortion, per se.\u201d In 2004, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the laws had \u201cat least, been repealed by implication.\u201d\nUnable to be enforced, the laws were, effectively, moot and were even moved out of the criminal code, into the civil statutes, when the state codified a new penal code in 1973. But they were never formally repealed, and in 2021, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade looming, the Texas Legislature started laying the groundwork to bring these zombie statutes back from the dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n Linda Coffee argued Roe v. Wade. Now, she\u2019s watching its demise. \n\n\n\n\n        \n        July 12, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, lawmakers prepared for a more modern post-Roe future by passing a trigger law to automatically set in place an abortion ban 30 days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its judgment overturning Roe v. Wade. That law explicitly protects a pregnant person from prosecution and allows for abortions in narrow cases to save the life of the pregnant patient. Unlike the 1857 law, it does not criminalize anyone who assists in or furnishes the means for a prohibited abortion.\nBut in late June, when the high court ruled on abortion, Attorney General Ken Paxton immediately issued an advisory, saying \u201cabortion providers could be criminally liable for providing abortions starting today\u201d under the pre-Roe statutes.\nClinics stopped providing abortions, and nonprofits that fund abortions stopped paying for procedures out of state, fearful that the law\u2019s reference to \u201cfurnishing the means\u201d for an abortion could be used against them.\nA group of abortion clinics attempted to challenge the law in court, and even got a Houston judge to agree that they were no longer in effect.\nBut the Texas Supreme Court disagreed, meaning these laws \u2014 created on the eve of the Civil War, in the days of quack doctors and blacksmith implements \u2014 are again governing abortion access in modern-day Texas, at least for now.\nUntil the state Supreme Court says otherwise, these laws will remain in effect even when the trigger law goes into effect Aug. 25, creating a murky legal landscape that will likely have to be sorted out in court.\nIn the five decades that these laws have been unenforceable, abortion has emerged as a central political hatchet, dividing the country along party and state lines. Now, the country has split in two, with some states promising to protect abortion access as aggressively as others promise to stop it entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Abortion opponents attend the Rally for Life march at the Capitol in Austin on Jan. 27, 2018.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Knowles for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nTexas\u2019 most virulent anti-abortion lawmakers have made it clear that they intend to try to stop any Texan from getting an abortion anywhere in the country. The Freedom Caucus, made up of conservative state House members, has sent cease-and-desist letters to top law firms and abortion funds, threatening them with legal action if they help people leave the state to get abortions.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how and whether they will actually be able to criminalize out-of-state abortions, said Rhodes, the law professor. The answers to these \u2014 and many other \u2014 legal questions swirling around Texas\u2019 abortion laws lie on the other side of a test case, which is not a risk most people are willing to take.\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping that they\u2019re going to be able to keep most of these questions from ever being resolved by courts by just having people comply,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re scared of the risk of what occurs if they don\u2019t comply.\u201d\nTo find a recent example of a time when politicians wanted to see such morally divisive state laws enforced in other states that were politically opposed to them, Rhodes said, you have to look back to the same era when these abortion laws were first written \u2014 when slave states were pushing the federal government to pass the Fugitive Slave Act and other legislation to enforce slavery laws in free states.\n\u201cThere are parallels,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with these questions of extraterritorial application of state laws that we just haven\u2019t really dealt with on this kind of systematic level in a long time in the United States.\u201d\nDisclosure: Texas Medical Association has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
