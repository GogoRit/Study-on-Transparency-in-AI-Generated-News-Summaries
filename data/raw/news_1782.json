Last month, the Indiana Supreme Court decided that the ban does not violate the state\u2019s constitution.\n\r\n\tUnder the law, abortions are only allowed if the pregnant person\u2019s serious health or life is at risk; if there\u2019s a lethal fetal anomaly up to 20 weeks post-fertilization; and in cases of rape or incest, but only up to 10 weeks.\n\r\n\tSunday\u2019s event was organized by the Indianapolis National Organization for Women. About 25 people attended to voice their commitment to continue advocating for abortion rights.\n\r\n\tDemocratic Indianapolis City-County Councilor Ali Brown spoke at the gathering. She said she experienced placental abruption during the birth of her son in 2017, causing her to lose a large amount of blood. She said if she becomes pregnant again, her life could be in danger.\u00a0\n\r\n\tBrown said abortion is necessary health care, and nothing should come between a pregnant person and their doctor in deciding if they wish to have an abortion.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt is a right that I was born with, and on Tuesday, I will wake up without that right, and I find it disgusting and reprehensible that people would put their religious positions over the health and safety of pregnant people,\u201d Brown said.\n\r\n\tJanette Cobb worked at an abortion clinic in Indianapolis when Roe v. Wade was overturned and Indiana enacted its own abortion ban. Cobb left her job in abortion care last year, and said the law has driven many healthcare workers she knows who provide abortions to leave the field.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt broke my heart to leave abortion care,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have a mortgage to pay and I\u2019m the primary breadwinner in my home. What am I supposed to do? I have to work.\u201d\n\r\n\tShe said she still thinks of her patients often.\n\r\n\t\u201cThey deserve access to their bodies,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThey deserve to be able to decide for themselves whether or not they want to be pregnant. And what will they do now?\u201d\n\r\n\tThe nonprofit group MADVoters Indiana helped organize the event. Co-founder Chelsea McDonnel said her work to fight against the ban is not over.\n\r\n\t\u201cThis is still a very real issue, this is a huge risk to our communities. We need to be loud again and we need to show up in a really big way and we need to remind them that this isn\u2019t okay,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tMore abortion rights demonstrations are expected to take place across the state Monday.\n\nIndiana Public Broadcasting's Brandon Smith contributed to this story.\n\nContact WFYI criminal justice reporter Katrina Pross at kpross@wfyi.org.\u00a0Pross is a Corps Member of Report for America, an initiative of The GroundTruth Project.\n\r\n\t\u00a0\nTags:abortionabortion rightsAbortion banreproductive rightsSupport independent journalism today.
