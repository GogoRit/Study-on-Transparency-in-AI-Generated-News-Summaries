Shemitz/CNS.)\nListenWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Many of the country\u2019s leading pro-life advocates said the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 29 ruling striking down a Louisiana abortion law puts women\u2019s health in danger, allows subpar care of women and gives abortion clinics a pass on \u201ccommonsense regulations\u201d for \u201cthe sake of profit.\u201d\n\u201cWomen were dealt a huge blow in today\u2019s ruling from the Supreme Court,\u201d said Abby Johnson, who used to be the director of a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Texas and currently leads the group And Then There Were None, which she founded.\n\n\u201cBy deciding that abortion doctors and clinics need to follow a separate, less stringent set of rules than every other medical facility leaves women open to the consequences of an industry that has mastered cutting corners on health care,\u201d said Johnson, whose organization assists abortion workers in leaving the abortion industry.\n\u201cWomen will continue to get subpar care at abortion clinics because of this Supreme Court ruling,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not a victory for women, for access, for equality, like the abortion industry will say today. The back alley abortions that the industry thinks will happen if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned may very well become commonplace inside abortion clinics due to the lack of commonsense regulations that this case just dismantled.\u201d\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled as unconstitutional Louisiana\u2019s 2014 Unsafe Abortion Protection Act requiring that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.\nJustice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the majority opinion in the case, June Medical Services v. Russo, said the law posed a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d for women seeking abortions while providing \u201cno significant health-related benefits.\u201d\nBreyer was joined in the opinion by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts filed an opinion concurring in the judgment of the four justices. In his dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the court\u2019s decision \u201cperpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction.\u201d\nAs a result of the ruling, pro-life advocates believe abortion clinics around the country will continue to cut corners on health care for women \u2014 which was the concern that led Louisiana state Sen. Katrina Jackson, a pro-life Democrat, to write the bill when she was a state representative.\nRELATED: Louisiana lawmaker says court ruling \u2018has almost taken my breath away\u2019\nJackson said in a statement after the Supreme Court issued its ruling that one of the reasons she wrote the measure was the fact that in Louisiana, when a man chooses to go an outpatient surgical center, ambulatory surgical center and have a vasectomy, that physician is required to have admitting privileges. But not so for abortion clinics. The law passed with a bipartisan vote.\n\u201cAs you know, in Louisiana, radiologists and ophthalmologists have performed abortions,\u201d said Jackson.\n\u201cThe March for Life is appalled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision today, which failed to hold Louisiana abortion facilities accountable for their numerous health and safety violations,\u201d Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, said in a June 29 statement. \u201cThe legislation at issue in June Medical Services v. Russo was designed to safeguard women\u2019s health and safety, which the abortion business in Louisiana egregiously sidelined for the sake of profit.\u201d\n\u201cNo abortion facility should receive a free pass to provide substandard care,\u201d she added. \u201cThis decision underscores the importance of nominating and confirming judges who refrain from legislating from the bench, something pro-life voters will certainly remember come November.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court failed to identify the main concern, which is the health of women, said Kristan Hawkins, Students for Life of America president. The ruling \u201cprioritizes ending preborn life over saving a mother\u2019s life\u201d and only provides safety for the people in the abortion industry, she said.\nEric Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, said the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow ruling in the Louisiana case \u201cis a stark reminder that the pro-life movement must continue to follow a twofold strategy.\u201d\n\u201cOur fight to defend the lives of unborn children and protect women from the dangerous and unregulated abortion industry must continue in our nation\u2019s statehouses and courts,\u201d Scheidler said in a statement. \u201cBut at the same time, we must work harder in the public square to educate our fellow Americans about abortion and offer women alternatives to abortion.\u201d\n\u201cTo all those disappointed by today\u2019s ruling, I say, join us on the front lines,\u201d he added. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the next big court case. Speak out against abortion today. Because for every child we save from abortion through direct action, Roe v. Wade has already been overturned.\u201d\nThe Justice Foundation\u2019s president, Allan Parker, said the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling went against the desires of the state of Louisiana.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the court is extremely disappointing to thousands who want to ensure protections for women,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWhile the justices ended up siding against the state of Louisiana, this case exposed the malfeasance, malpractice and misrepresentation of the abortion industry.\u201d\n\u201cThe state of Louisiana,\u201d he added, \u201cshould be commended for fighting to protect women from being hurt by abortion.\u201d\nShareLatest StoriesA Wisconsin ruling on Catholic Charities raises the bar for religious tax exemptionsMar 19Todd Richmond,\u00a0Associated PressCatholic nuns support women\u2019s rights in Central African RepublicMar 19Nirmala CarvalhoA priest who refused to stay silent still speaks to the world todayMar 19John L.
