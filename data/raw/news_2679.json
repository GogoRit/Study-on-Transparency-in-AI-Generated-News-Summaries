Chip Roy on 2020 ElectionKristi Hamrick - 04 Nov 2020Students for Life Action Congratulates Rep. Chip Roy on 2020 Election Victory\n\u201cThe Pro-Life Generation devoted hundreds of hours of time and talent to educating Texas voters on Rep. Roy\u2019s pro-life record,\u201d said SFLAction President Kristan Hawkins. \u201cWe are so excited to see him headed back to Washington to defend the preborn for another term.\u201d \nFREDERICKSBURG, V.A. and AUSTIN, T.X. (11-04-2020) \u2013 Students for Life Action (SFLAction) congratulated Representative Chip Roy on his victory on Tuesday evening, following a highly contested race against pro-choice Democrat Wendy Davis, 52.1%-45.2%.\nSFLAction collectively knocked more than 15,000 doors on behalf of Representative Roy this cycle.\n\u201cThere is bipartisan agreement that this election cycle was one of the most important of our lifetimes, with the potential to impact millions upon millions of present and future lives,\u201d said SFLAction President Kristan Hawkins. \u201cIt is clear that the work SFLAction did this cycle contributed immensely to the most critical victories in the country. Rep. Roy\u2019s victory tonight is one example of that. The Pro-Life Generation went on the front lines in this election, to have a voice and a vote for life.\u201d\nIn months leading up to the election, SFLAction led major student activism weekends in Texas to make voters aware of Rep. Roy\u2019s consistently pro-life position and urge them to #VoteProLifeFirst this election cycle.\nIn addition to Texas, SFLAction also had a heavy presence in Montana, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado, Washington, Arizona, Michigan, and North Carolina.\nMORE ON SFLA/SFLAction IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE: Students for Life and Students for Life Action engaged in multiple states through in-person door knocking, calls, texts, and mobilizations on campuses, calling on voters to #VotePro-LifeFirst\u00a0 as well reminding people of the importance of who gets to pick Supreme Court Justices, given the way in which the human rights issue of our day was hijacked by the high court 50 years ago.\nIn the final stretch, SFLA/SFLAction launched a new, 6-figure campaign buy in a 48-hour GOTV blitz this Monday and Tuesday designed to rally voters aged 18 to 35 to #VoteProLifeFirst. To accomplish this 48-hour GOTV blitz, SFLAction made more than 1.5 million personal text messages to cell phones, sent nearly 900,000 voicemail messages to land lines as well as launched a five-digit ad buy on social media. Among those contacted in this blitz were 273,000 new voters who were considered swing voters on the life issue as well as more than 1 million pro-life, yet low propensity voters who hadn\u2019t voted early this fall in the following 9 states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nStudents for Life\u2019s GOTV blitz follows up extensive fall grassroots campaign in which SFLA/SFLAction team members and volunteers\u2026\n\nMade more than 523,022 phone calls\nContacted more than 1.6 million, primarily youth, voters\nSent more than 2.18 million personal text messages\nKnocked on more than 150,000 doors\n\nThe #VoteProLifeFirst digital media campaign included 85 different image ads and multiple videos reaching voters whose views on abortion vary and were seen more than 8 million times. More than 2.28 million voters engaged with the efforts this fall, including the 107,000 young voters who pledged to vote pro-life first as a result.\nStudents for Life of America\u2019s \u201cSock the Vote\u201d campus tours also went to 46 states, calling on new voters to prioritize abortion which ends 2,362 lives each day. Students used baby socks as part of the display. This followed a very successful earlier campaign, \u201cSock it to Planned Parenthood,\u201d during which SFLA held events and traveled across the country with a truck carrying 328,348 baby socks, representing the number of abortions Planned Parenthood commits each year.\nIn October, SFLA/SFLAction went from Alaska to Florida in a 10-state #Justice4Life tour on behalf of now Justice Amy Coney Barrett an extension of the SFLAction Activism Weekends that included more than 731,000 voters contacted. SFLAction conducted similar student trips over the summer, knocking on more than 50,000 doors and making more than 200,000 phone calls to educate voters in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and Kansas before key Republican and Democratic primaries.\u00a0 Click here to read more about SFLAction\u2019s results in this cycle.
