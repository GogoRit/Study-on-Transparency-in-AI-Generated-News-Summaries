This is an important question we often receive during an election cycle\u2014thanks for asking it!\nCatholics have never had and never will have the luxury of voting for a perfect candidate or party. We must judge between imperfect candidates with a conscience that is well-formed by reason and Church teaching. An unformed or poorly formed conscience, on the other hand, leads to erroneous judgments for which we are morally responsible.\n\u201cA good Catholic,\u201d Pope Francis said in a homily in September 2013, \u201cmeddles in politics, offering the best of himself.\u201d Every Catholic should work in common with others to pursue what is good for persons, families, communities, and the nation. Catholics have much to offer in building up the common good, and it would be unconscionable for us to abandon or neglect the field of politics.\nThe obligation to oppose abortion and other intrinsic evils\nIn their teaching document on political responsibility (Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship), the U.S. bishops have reminded Catholics of their obligation to pursue the good and discourage and prevent evil. They also reiterate that abortion is intrinsically evil, and intrinsic evils \u201cmust always be rejected and opposed and must never be supported or condoned\u201d (no. 22).\u00a0\nAbortion is not the only intrinsically evil action, nor the only evil that violates human life or weakens its protection. But Forming Consciences teaches that \u201c[t]he threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority because it directly attacks life itself, because it takes place within the sanctuary of the family, and because of the number of lives destroyed\u201d (p. 6).\nSimply stated, \u201c[a] Catholic cannot vote for a candidate who favors an intrinsically evil act \u2026 if the voter\u2019s intent is to support that position\u201d (no. 34). And, according to the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, \u201c[a] Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil\u2026 if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate\u2019s permissive stand on abortion.\u201d This can never be justified.\nThe hard cases: where both candidates support intrinsically evil positions\nThere are circumstances, however, where both candidates support intrinsically evil positions. In such cases, no Catholic is morally required to support either candidate. One may abstain from voting or cast a third-party vote in good conscience.\nThere are even circumstances where a Catholic could vote for a pro-abortion candidate whose views on abortion he or she did not share\u2014for \u201ctruly grave moral reasons\u201d (no. 35).\nIf, for example, in the voter\u2019s good-faith, conscientious judgment, the \u201cpro-life\u201d candidate\u2019s positions on other foundational issues are so gravely evil that the balance of those evils outweighs the other candidate\u2019s support for abortion, this may constitute a \u201ctruly grave moral reason\u201d that could justify support of the pro-abortion candidate. This judgment may be further supported if that candidate is more likely to pursue policies promoting other authentic human goods, such as marriage and family life, religious liberty, an end to unjust warfare, and educational opportunity for the poor. However, given the right to life\u2019s preeminence and status as the necessary foundation for all other human rights, this is a very difficult case to make.\nAs Pope St. John Paul II reminds us in Christifideles Laici, \u201cthe common outcry which is justly made on behalf of human rights... is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.\u201d\nDeciding how to cast our votes in certain elections can be difficult and even stressful. Our political responsibility is no light matter. But elections are also opportunities to continue our formation of conscience in accord with the Church, discern the difficult choices that face us, and turn to prayer so that we may come to peace with our decisions. As always, let us call upon the Holy Spirit for wisdom.\nWrite to Ask the Register using our\u00a0online form,\u00a0or write to 3700 Sheridan Blvd., Suite 10, Lincoln NE 68506-6100.
