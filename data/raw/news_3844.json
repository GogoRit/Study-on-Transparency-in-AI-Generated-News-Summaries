Unfortunately, we also came across situations where women in Malta were given wrong information or even tricked by local anti-choice pregnancy helplines,\u201d Doctors for Choice member, and psychiatrist Christopher Barbara said.\nBarbara said the restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic had limited women\u2019s access to abortion, apart from witnessing a rise in domestic abuse cases and the temporary inaccessibility of certain types of contraception.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors at work: Chris Barbara (centre) at the first pro-choice gathering. Malta\u2019s pro-choice doctors have done much to raise the level of debate on abortion to a more, medically-based and rational discourse\n\n\n\n\u201cThis service does not in any way absolve the State from its obligations, but at least women in Malta can now find reliable and unbiased information on sexual and reproductive healthcare and options without fear of judgement,\u201d Barbara said of the Family Planning Advisory Service (FPAS).\nThe FPAS is being billed as a service that is filling a gap of advice sorely lacking in Malta. Run by volunteers who are either health or social professionals, it will also include persons who are already part of pro-choice organisations with experience in the area.\nWomen\u2019s Rights Foundation (WRF) chairperson Andrea Dibben said that back in 2018 when WRF had launched its position paper on sexual and reproductive health and rights, it had commented on the lack of community-based family planning and sexual health services and made recommendations to the State to implement such measures.\n\u201cSince then, Doctors for Choice and Women\u2019s Rights Foundation as well as the administrators of the social media group Women for Women on Facebook, have consistently received messages and calls from people asking for information and support on contraception, abortion access, and other reproductive health issues. Since there is a clear need for such a service, it made sense for us to pool our resources and set up FPAS,\u201d Dibben said.\nThe FPAS will provide information, advice, and support on anything related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception, morning-after pills, and on all pregnancy options \u2013 including abortion \u2013 \u201cwithout fear of being judged or worse, reported,\u201d Dibben said.\n\u201cWe are working hand in hand with the UK charity Abortion Support Network (ASN), and referring clients to ASN if financial support is needed to access abortion abroad. We are also collaborating with a network of local pro-choice professionals including gynaecologists, family doctors, clinical and counselling psychologists, and psychotherapists who we can refer callers to as needed.\u201d\nThe service also provides help to access contraception for those with financial difficulties and hopes to expand in the future, depending on the needs identified by women. \u201cOur helpline is free of charge and we have volunteers who speak multiple languages.\n\u201cWe thought that we would not get any requests for the first few weeks until we kick off with advertising campaigns and media coverage; however, in the first two days we have already had a good number of people use the service,\u201d Dibben said.\nThe service has already received several messages of support and several requests from people to volunteer. \u201cThe general feedback we got from the public was that such a service was much needed in Malta.\u201d\nMisinformation and intimidation\nOn his part, Barbara said that misinformation against abortion services and related reproductive health choices is also rife.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is not an exaggeration to say that women in Malta who need unbiased and reliable information on reproductive healthcare face a dire situation,\u201d Barbara said, adding that often people seeking an abortion cannot speak to their family or to their regular doctor out of fear that they may be snubbed.\n\u201cAnd when they try to search for information online they are tricked by anti-choice groups that pretend to give \u2018advice\u2019 but actually dish out misinformation to suit their anti-abortion and anti-contraception agenda. This is not right, and women in Malta deserve better than this.\u201d\nLikewise, Dibben said that women in these dire situations, need advice and support on sexual and reproductive health issues in order to make a properly informed decision. \u201cWe just wanted to give women the option to have a pro-choice advisory service. Our response to groups who spread misinformation about us is to be consistent in providing a quality service based on the latest scientific and medical evidence with kindness and compassion,\u201d she said.\nBarbara said the FPAS service was created to be a catalyst for change. \u201cWe wanted to give women a truly unbiased and compassionate pro-choice advisory service that will support them in whatever decision they make. Word travels fast in Malta and we know that FPAS will have an impact, not just by directly helping women, but also by eliminating the stigma that surrounds abortion and contraception once and for all,\u201d he said.\nPersons can access the Family Planning Advisory Service (FPAS) via phone 2778 2758, chat or email at [email\u00a0protected].
