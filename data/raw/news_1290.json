ETShare full article6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe first election to put abortion rights to the test after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade appears unlikely to reshape the map of abortion access \u2014 at least not overnight. Though some races remain uncalled, voters in much of the country reinforced the status quo, choosing candidates who are likely to either maintain existing protections or restrictions in their states, or to deepen them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Impact where abortion is legal\n        \n\n\n\nMixed\n\n\n\nNew protections\n\n\n\nNo change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Impact where abortion is restricted\n            \n\n\n\nNew restrictions likely\n\n\n\nMixed\n\n\n\nNo change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRepublican power did expand in some states, opening the door to further bans on abortion in the coming months. But elsewhere, Republicans fell short in key contests for control of state governments that would have allowed them to easily advance restrictions.\n\n\n\tAnd voters in several states revealed broad support for abortion rights, with California, Michigan and Vermont enshrining lasting protections in their state constitutions and those in Kentucky and Montana rejecting anti-abortion measures.\n\n\n\tIn many places, the outcome of down-ballot races may prove as consequential for abortion access as those for governor or legislative seats. Shifts in power on state supreme courts are important to watch, as these courts can rule on challenges to new or existing abortion laws. Newly elected attorneys general will also have some say in their enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates that added abortion protections in the midterms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew protections\n\n\n\n            Tap a state for more details\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDemocrats had hoped that Roe\u2019s overturn would drive voters who support abortion rights to the polls in November, and their hopes were buoyed after Kansans defeated a proposed constitutional amendment to restrict abortion in August.\n\n\n\tNew constitutional protections approved by voters in three states will not only bolster local and regional access to abortion, but also may encourage other states to follow suit.\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia\nAbortion is already legal until viability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallot measure affirming a right to abortion passed\n\n\n\n\n\tThe state already has strong protections in place, and voters approved an amendment to the State Constitution to protect reproductive rights, including the right to abortion and contraceptives. The new amendment offers a safeguard that can be undone only by another voter referendum.\n\n\n\n\nMichigan\nA near-total ban is blocked in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallot measure affirming a right to abortion passed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic governor re-elected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Democratic majority in the State Legislature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic attorney general re-elected\n\n\n\n\nA winning ballot measure will enshrine the right to abortion in Michigan and overturn an existing ban from 1931 that has already been blocked in court.\n\n\n\tMichigan Democrats rode support for abortion rights to flip both chambers of the Legislature, giving them control of the state government for the first time in 40 years. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats who pledged to protect abortion rights, also won re-election.\n\n\n\n\nVermont\nAbortion is already legal with no gestational limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallot measure affirming a right to abortion passed\n\n\n\n\n\tA large majority of voters backed a proposal to amend the State Constitution to guarantee a right to personal reproductive autonomy. State lawmakers had first passed legislation that recognized abortion as a fundamental right in 2019 to begin the multiyear amendment process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates that may add abortion restrictions after the midterms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew restrictions likely\n\n\n\n            Tap a state for more details\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn some states that already limit abortion access, races up and down the ballot removed Democratic lawmakers who stood in the way of restrictions. With fewer obstacles, Republican majorities are expected to pass new or more restrictive bans in the months to come.\n\n\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re going to see states that have already banned abortion try to adopt other restrictions, too,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. She pointed to possibilities including harsher criminal penalties for providers and allowing attorneys general to prosecute local abortion cases.\n\n\n\n\nFlorida\nA 15-week ban is already in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican supermajority secured in state legislature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican governor re-elected\n\n\n\n\n\tRepublicans secured supermajorities in both chambers of the Florida Legislature, putting them on a path to further restrict abortion. And they will likely have the support of Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who won re-election in a landslide and said previously that he intends to \u201cexpand pro-life protections.\u201d Florida already bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but legislators may push for a six-week or total ban.\n\n\n\tThe Florida Supreme Court recognized a right to abortion in the State Constitution three decades ago, but the court has become more conservative in recent years, and all judges up for election on Tuesday held their seats. They may reject a challenge to the state\u2019s 15-week ban, or rule in favor of future abortion restrictions.\n\n\n\n\nOhio\nA six-week ban is blocked in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative majority secured on State Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican governor re-elected\n\n\n\n\n\tRepublicans won all three seats up for election on the Ohio Supreme Court, and Gov. Mike DeWine will appoint a new judge to a vacant seat, securing a stronger conservative majority. A ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, which Mr. DeWine signed in 2019, is currently blocked by a lower court in Ohio but is expected to reach the state\u2019s Supreme Court next year.\n\n\n\tThe court has not previously ruled on abortion rights, but the new makeup \u201ccould have a significant impact on cases related to abortion,\u201d said Douglas Keith, the counsel for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere abortion policy remains uncertain after the midterms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed\n\n\n\n            Tap a state for more details\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlthough voters in many states affirmed the status quo on abortion, in a few places the results of the midterms were more mixed. One unexpected outcome was voters\u2019 rejection of an anti-abortion ballot measure in Kentucky, a state that bans nearly all abortions. And split partisan control of state governments in a few other states may mean gridlock on abortion legislation for the time being.\n\n\n\n\nArizona\nA 15-week ban is already in effect. A near-total ban is blocked in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic governor elected\n\n\n\n\n\tDemocrats eked out a victory in a close race for governor, a critical position for abortion policy in Arizona. Republicans held their control of the State Senate and were on track to maintain a majority in the House of Representatives, but Governor-elect Katie Hobbs has said she will veto any new anti-abortion legislation.\n\n\n\tAn appeals court has temporarily blocked enforcement of an 1864 law that banned abortion, but a separate ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy is in effect. Ms. Hobbs is unlikely to tackle either law without the support of the State Legislature. That means the outcome of the attorney general\u2019s race, which is headed for a recount, could have a significant effect on abortion access in the state. The Democratic candidate, Kris Mayes, has said she will not enforce the 1864 ban. Her Republican opponent, Abraham Hamadeh, has said he will.\n\n\n\n\nKansas\nAbortion is already legal until 22 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic governor re-elected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican attorney general elected\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Democratic incumbent, Laura Kelly, held onto the governor\u2019s office, though Republicans retained a veto-proof majority in the Legislature and could try to enact restrictions on abortion in next year\u2019s legislative session. The newly elected Republican attorney general, Kris Kobach, has said he wants to make Kansas the most anti-abortion state in the country.\n\n\n\tIn August, Kansans decisively rejected an amendment that would have removed protections for abortion rights from the State Constitution, which the state\u2019s Supreme Court recognized in 2019. Six of seven judges on the court held their seats in the midterm elections, despite efforts by conservative groups to oust five of them.\n\n\n\n\nKentucky\nA near-total ban is already in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallot measure denying any right to abortion rejected\n\n\n\n\n\tKentucky already bans nearly all abortions, but the midterms signaled some support for abortion rights: A majority of voters opposed a ballot measure to amend the State Constitution to say there is no right to abortion. That rejection will not overturn the existing ban, but the vote could affect the State Supreme Court\u2019s decision in a lawsuit challenging the ban that began on Nov. 15.\n\n\n\tRepublicans in the State Legislature maintained their veto-proof majority over the Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, who has denounced the ban. But two candidates for the State Supreme Court who were backed by anti-abortion groups did not win their races.\n\n\n\n\nMontana\nA 20-week ban is blocked in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallot measure mandating care for infants \u201cborn alive\u201d rejected\n\n\n\n\n\tMontana voters rejected a ballot measure that would have required medical interventions to save those it described as \u201cborn-alive\u201d infants and which opponents said was designed to curtail abortion rights. But voters also supported the incumbent governor, Greg Gianforte, a Republican who is determined to ban abortion. Republicans also gained a supermajority in the state legislature, giving them broad power that neither party has garnered in the state in nearly a century.\n\n\n\tThe Republican-controlled legislature has long tried to ban abortion, but the Montana Supreme Court has stood in the way. The court recognized abortion as a constitutional right in 1999 and has blocked multiple restrictions since. A progressive judge held her seat on the court, despite efforts by conservative groups to replace her.\n\n\n\n\nNebraska\nAbortion is already legal until 22 weeks.\n\n\n\n\tRepublicans are likely to fall just short of a supermajority in the Nebraska Legislature, meaning that abortion may remain legal in the state. Republicans will still hold a majority of the officially nonpartisan Legislature, and the newly elected governor, Jim Pillen, is stringently anti-abortion. Officials may pursue a 12-week ban or other restrictions next year, but Democrats are likely to hold enough seats to filibuster any attempts, as they did in April, to ban abortion outright. It is possible, though, that anti-abortion Democrats could side instead with Republicans on proposed prohibitions.\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nA 20-week ban is already in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative majority secured on State Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\tRepublicans won a new majority on the State Supreme Court, flipping two seats and shifting the balance of power in favor of conservatives. The court has not ruled on abortion restrictions in the past, but the new conservative majority may be more likely to reject any challenges to future bans.\n\n\n\tEnacting an abortion ban in North Carolina is not likely until at least 2025, however, when Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s term expires. Mr. Cooper, a Democrat, opposes abortion restrictions, and Republicans narrowly failed to secure a supermajority in the Legislature that would have allowed them to override his veto.\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin\nA near-total ban is already in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic governor re-elected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic attorney general re-elected\n\n\n\n\n\tDemocrats held onto executive power in Wisconsin, allowing them to pursue a challenge to the state\u2019s ban on most abortions, an 1849 law that took effect when Roe was overturned. Josh Kaul, the incumbent attorney general, has sued to block the ban. Republicans fell short of enough seats in the state legislature to secure a veto-proof majority over Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat who supports abortion rights and has trumpeted his role as a block on legislative efforts to restrict the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead 6 CommentsShare full article6AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation\u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
