Meanwhile, there are significant barriers to obtaining an abortion. Advocates argue that IHS is failing to live up to its federal responsibilities, but despite lawsuits, reprimands and regulations, the agency continues to drag its feet in achieving compliance. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u201d said Charon Asetoyer, executive director of the Native American Women\u2019s Health Education Resource Center (NAWHERC). \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have federal agencies with any kind of abortion services.\u201d\n\nSarah Deer, left, has worked to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Charon Asetoyer, right, is executive director and a founder of the Native American Women\u2019s Health Education Resource Center. Credit: Jolene Yazzie/High Country News\nA 2002 study published by the Native American Women\u2019s Health Education Resource Center, a South Dakota-based nonprofit that advocates for Indigenous women, found that only 25 abortions were performed in the IHS system since 1976, when the Hyde Amendment was passed. (The Hyde Amendment prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortion services, with rare exceptions.) That 2002 study is one of the few to track abortion statistics specifically among Indigenous women. High Country News filed a Freedom of Information Act request for more recent data from the Indian Health Service, but it has gone unanswered. \nWhen clinics are able to provide an abortion, it comes with strict conditions: The procedure can only be performed in the case of rape or incest or when a woman\u2019s life is in danger. Furthermore, IHS policy states that rapes must be reported within 60 days in order for women to receive abortion care.\n\u201cWe know that most rape victims don\u2019t report at all,\u201d said Sarah Deer, a citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, who has been recognized for her work on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. \u201cSo if they don\u2019t make that report within 60 days, then they are no longer eligible for even that exception.\u201d\nIHS also requires signed documentation from a law enforcement agency and a health-care facility, along with a police report filed within 60 days of the incident. \u201cAdditionally, the incident in question must meet the definition of rape or incest as defined by law in the state or tribal jurisdiction where the incident was reported to have occurred,\u201d the policy states. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, which tracks crime nationally as well as in Indian Country, reported that in 2016, Alaska Native and Native American women experienced higher rates of sexual violence than their white and Latinx counterparts did.\u00a0\nSupport independent journalism about the West.

Plan B, which acts as emergency birth control when other methods fail, is an over-the-counter medication available at pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens. Native women sometimes don\u2019t use those pharmacies, choosing instead to obtain their medication at IHS clinics. \u201cEvery other woman in this country has access to it except for Native women,\u201d said Asetoyer. \u201cWe jump through all kinds of hoops to get it.\u201d\nThe Plan B pill wasn\u2019t available at IHS clinics until a 2010 lawsuit from the Native American Women\u2019s Health Education Resource Center forced IHS to make it available. Two years later, NAWHERC found that more than half of tribally run health centers were out of compliance when it came to providing the medication. Even after those findings, NAWHERC found that barriers remained. Some clinics still required a prescription, while almost a third failed to stock Plan B at all. \n\n\u201cWhy should we be denied access to Plan B when it is perfectly legal?\u201d said Asetoyer.\nSome of the facilities that did not provide Plan B were in Oklahoma, particularly in the Creek, Chickasaw and Shawnee nation health centers. Emergency contraceptives were not available, allegedly because they were not in stock.\n\nThe treaties that tribal nations signed with the United States specifically stated that, in exchange for land cessions, the federal government would provide medical care and supplies for tribal members and citizens.\u00a0\n\nThe Indian Health Service maintains that it is understaffed, and that every year, the amount of money the federal government allocates to hire, train and staff its clinics shrinks. Long waiting times and delayed care are part of Indian health care. Asetoyer says that, even with budget cuts, this lack of care is a violation of the federal government\u2019s trust responsibility. The treaties that tribal nations signed with the United States specifically stated that, in exchange for land cessions, the federal government would provide medical care and supplies for tribal members and citizens. The Indian Health Service did not comment for this story by publication. \nThe Indian Health Service was cited by the\u00a0Government\u00a0Accountability Office in 2011 for its slow response time to sexual assault. The GAO examined the ability of\u00a0the Indian Health Service and tribally operated hospitals to collect and preserve the medical evidence needed for criminal prosecution in cases of sexual assault and domestic violence. It also analyzed what, if any, special challenges these hospitals face in collecting and preserving such evidence, and what factors besides medical evidence contribute to the decision to prosecute such cases.\nThe Government Accountability Office made three recommendations: Develop a new plan and policies for treating sexual assault; provide better training for hospital staff who handle sexual assault victims; and update the process followed when medical staff are subpoenaed to testify. \n \n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNative American women still have the highest rates of rape and assault \n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Amnesty International stepped in and filed a Freedom of Information Act request asking about the number of rapes and sexual assaults reported each year, as well as the number of rape kits clinics had on hand and how often they were requested. The group also asked how often Indian Health Service staff were asked to testify, and how many had done so on behalf of a client. If a request to testify was declined, Amnesty wanted to know on what grounds. The worldwide human rights organization also inquired about the number of sexual assault nurse examiners and whether victims were offered emergency contraceptives at the time of their visit. But according to Tara Dement of Amnesty International, this request was denied. \nDespite this setback, Amnesty and NAWHERC continue to lobby for more accountability when it comes to these essential services. Recently, they met with members of the staffs of Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., urging them to keep pressure on IHS to provide requested information and make sure these services are available to Indigenous women.\n\u201cThis is not a fulfillment of U.S. obligations under its own treaties or under international human rights standards,\u201d Dement said.\n\nAllison Herrera is Xolon Salinan from the Central Coast of California and serves as editor of climate and environment for\u00a0Colorado Public Radio.
