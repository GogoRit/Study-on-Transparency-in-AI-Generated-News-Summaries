Alongside the crosses were signs that read \u201c972 Lives Killed by Planned Parenthood Every Day\u201d and \u201c1 Cross = 1 Child Killed by Planned Parenthood TODAY.\u201d\nLauren Emo | Mustang News\nThe demonstration grabbed the attention of those passing by and eventually a group of students formed to counter-protest the display.\u00a0\nSoftware engineering sophomore Jack Kilborn passed by the demonstration at around 11:15 a.m.\n\u201cEarlier in the day I saw these people advocating for pro-life, which from my understanding is a classist, racist, misogynist thing to advocate for,\u201d Kilborn said.\u00a0\n \n \n\nKilborn returned around 12:30 p.m., set up a bike and some tables across from the demonstration, and began inviting students on the lawn to join in counter-protest, making signs from cardboard and markers. By 2 p.m. Kilborn\u2019s bike was covered in signs.\nKilborn also said they threw out condoms.\u00a0\n\u201cEarlier I came by and tossed out some condoms to promote safe sex rather than what they\u2019re doing, which I think, in my opinion and proven statistically, is something that leads to a lot of unsafe medical emergencies,\u201d Kilborn said.\u00a0\n \n \n\nAs the demonstration continued, more students joined Kilborn on Dexter Lawn across from the Students for Life of America booth.\u00a0\n\u201cI saw pictures on my friends\u2019 stories and stuff so I came to help support,\u201d materials engineering junior Kat Meany said.\u00a0\nMeany and fellow materials engineering junior Roxy Jackson-Gain made signs that read: \u201cNot your uterus. Not Your Choice,\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t know you hate women\u201d and \u201cReligion has no place in my uterus.\u201d\u00a0\n \n \n\nJackson-Gain said she noticed a large number of students that said they were \u201cclearly upset\u201d by the pro-life demonstration.\u00a0\n\u201cThere was one girl who came by and took the two purple signs and was walking around with them for a while while they were following her,\u201d\u00a0Jackson-Gain said.\nAs the demonstrations continued, upset students began to walk on top of it, pulling the red crosses out of the ground and throwing them across the field, according to Nevada and Northern-California Regional Coordinator for Students for Life of America, Lea Kalinowski, who was leading the pro-life demonstration.\u00a0\nKilborn said they wanted to clarify that the counter-protest movement \u2013\u2013 making the cardboard signs across from Students for Life of America \u2013\u2013 was not the same people who started taking down the signs.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it visible, that on this campus, we\u2019re not going to let this stuff happen without other opinions happening too,\u201d Kilborn said.\u00a0\nStudents passing by the pro-life demonstration expressed concerns that the display may evoke violent reactions from some passers-by.\u00a0\n\u201cIt seems every time I\u2019ve walked by, it\u2019s gotten a crowd, and it\u2019s just gotten a little negative,\u201d said liberal studies sophomore Corinne Maxfield, \u201cWith the wrong person seeing it, it could turn violent which was also a safety concern.\u201d\u00a0\nMaxfield also said she worries that the message of the cross display could be harmful to some students who have had an abortion.\n\u201cIt makes me feel unsafe because if I was to have an abortion, I wouldn\u2019t feel safe on this campus and that\u2019s a very personal decision,\u201d Maxfield said. \u201cJust the fact that women who have had abortions have to walk by this when that\u2019s a very difficult decision that they\u2019d ever have to make \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s just very upsetting.\u201d\u00a0\nKalinowski said that Student Lives of America isn\u2019t demonstrating to \u201cshame women,\u201d and that their goals from the display were to \u201craise awareness about abortion, other resources besides Planned Parenthood and life-affirming resources.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to care about both women and children,\u201d Kalinowski said.\u00a0\nRegardless of the goal of the demonstration, students said they felt it was inevitably going to lead to conflict.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is creating way more of a division than there needs to be on campus which is not what we\u2019re going for at all,\u201d liberal studies sophomore Julia McEachen said.\u00a0\n\n\nTagged: Counter-Protest,\u00a0Dexter Lawn,\u00a0Pro-Choice,\u00a0Pro-Life,\u00a0protest \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLauren Emo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLauren Emo is the news editor and a journalism major.
