Anthony Pro-Life America, the most influential group in the anti-abortion movement, is telling each potential GOP presidential hopeful that to win its backing \u2014 or avoid being a target of its opposition \u2014 they must support national restrictions on the procedure. Exceptions in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother are acceptable, the activists say, but leaving the question for states to decide is not.\u201cIt is a level of protection that goes to every single state. That\u2019s the baseline of what we\u2019re looking to do,\u201d said Frank Cannon, Susan B. Anthony\u2019s chief political strategist. \u201cAnything less than that will not be acceptable and will not be somebody that SBA can support. So, it\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nThat directive is creating an early litmus test for Republicans considering entering the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined federal protections for abortion for roughly 50 years. While the hard-line stance could please anti-abortion activists who hold sway in GOP primaries, it could create problems for the party\u2019s eventual nominee in the general election. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s top public health doctor warns senators wrong lessons being learned from COVID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTighter proposed South Carolina budget would include raises for teachers and state workers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootball powers converge to support South Carolina athlete compensation bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters protected abortion rights via ballot measures in six states in 2022, including Kansas, a state former President Donald Trump twice won by double-digit margins. AP VoteCast, a survey of the midterm electorate, showed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was broadly unpopular. About 6 in 10 said they were angry or dissatisfied by it, and roughly the same percentage said they favor a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of abortion rights say the issue was a \u201cgame changer\u201d that helped Democrats last year and that will motivate voters even more in 2024, after two years of seeing the effects of restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a nation where 18 states have no access to abortion, and that number is not going down. It\u2019s going to go up as additional court cases get decided,\u201d said Jenny Lawson, vice president of organizing and engagement campaigns at Planned Parenthood Action Fund. She predicted people will see headlines \u201cover and over again\u201d about pregnant children forced to travel out of state for abortions or people unable to get proper miscarriage care because doctors are afraid of liability.Pressure from the anti-abortion movement has put Trump, who announced his third run for the presidency last year, in perhaps the most complicated position.He is arguably more responsible for the overturning of Roe than anyone else, having appointed three anti-abortion Supreme Court justices who backed last year\u2019s ruling. But he has also made clear that he believes pushing any further will hurt Republicans, and he accused anti-abortion leaders of failing to do enough to help GOP candidates in the midterms. \u201cI just didn\u2019t see them fighting during this last election, fighting for victory,\u201d Trump said in an interview with David Brody, a longtime commentator for the Christian Broadcasting Network. \n\nTrump, who described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d before entering politics, stressed that objecting to exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother makes it \u201cmuch harder to win elections.\u201d He has criticized evangelical leaders who have been slow to endorse his latest run, blasting decisions by pastors like Robert Jeffress to wait to assess the rest of the field as \u201ca sign of disloyalty.\u201dCannon called the notion that opposing abortion hurt the GOP last year \u201cabsolutely absurd,\u201d pointing to candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 a top potential GOP presidential candidate \u2014 who easily won reelection. DeSantis signed into law last year a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Republican candidates who got \u201cclobbered,\u201d Cannon said, were those who tried to avoid the topic. \u201cWhat you have to do is argue for protections that the American people see as reasonable versus the extremism of no exceptions, even late-term abortion,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cAnd if you do that, it\u2019s a winning combination.\u201d\n\nSBA Pro-Life America, which raised over $60 million for 2020 campaigns along with its affiliated super PAC, is talking with each potential candidate, Cannon said. While records are being discussed, what matters in 2024 is what policies the candidates prioritize when they announce their bids. SBA\u2019s specific request is to support \u201cat a minimum\u201d a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d or \u201cpain-capable\u201d bill, he said.The heartbeat bill would make abortion illegal after cardiac activity is detected, which occurs at roughly six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before some women know they\u2019re pregnant. Legislation that references the fetus feeling pain, such as a measure introduced last year by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would ban the procedure at around 15 weeks. Graham\u2019s bill didn\u2019t advance in the Democratic-controlled chamber, and even some fellow Republicans distanced themselves from it ahead of the midterms.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance has provided an opening on the right for potential rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both of whom are evangelical Christians with long-held anti-abortion stances.Pence has spent months visiting so-called crisis pregnancy centers that counsel women against abortions. And he has embarked on a tour of megachurches, including Jeffress\u2019 First Baptist Church in Dallas, and spoken before major anti-abortion groups. His advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, has pushed for Congress to pass legislation including a national abortion ban beginning around six weeks of pregnancy and a bill that would establish legal personhood at conception. Marc Short, Pence\u2019s former chief of staff and longtime adviser, said that when it comes to declared and potential 2024 candidates, \u201cI see him as the most comfortable explaining his pro-life convictions and the basis for them.\u201d For Pence, he said, the issue is about much more than politics.\u201cMike does it because this is core to the reason that he ran for office and won for the first time. It\u2019s always been for him a top issue and it\u2019s a priority,\u201d he said. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, is another potential candidate who signed abortion prohibitions into law in her state. The 2016 law bans abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and includes an exception if the mother\u2019s life is in jeopardy but not for cases of rape or incest. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Haley said states, and not \u201cunelected justices,\u201d should control abortion policy. That position puts her at odds with SBA and other anti-abortion groups. Others see abortion as a potential vulnerability for DeSantis. A spokesperson for South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is also exploring a potential run, recently unloaded on DeSantis, questioning where he stands on the issue.\u201cGovernor Noem was the only Governor in America on national television defending the Dobbs decision,\u201d Ian Fury wrote in an email to the National Review. \u201cWhere was Governor DeSantis? Hiding behind a 15-week ban. Does he believe that 14-week-old babies don\u2019t have a right to live?\u201d Cannon stressed that those in the anti-abortion movement are the \u201cfoot soldiers\u201d of the Republican Party during elections and comprise a huge percentage of primary voters.\u201cNo Republican candidate can win the presidency without the backing of the pro-life movement,\u201d he said.___Colvin reported from New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJILL COLVIN\n\n\n                Colvin is an Associated Press national political reporter covering the 2024 presidential campaign.
