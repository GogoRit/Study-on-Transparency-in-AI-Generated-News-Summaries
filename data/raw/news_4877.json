For Black Women, They\u2019re Especially DamagingStephanie LongLast Updated June 8, 2022, 7:00 PMThis story was originally published on October 20, 2020.In 1973, Roe v. Wade made abortion legal across the U.S., but, as is the case with many other laws and landmark decisions, its application throughout the country was anything but simple \u2014 or equal. Decades after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that a person's freedom to have an abortion without excessive government limitations is constitutionally protected, various restrictions continue to pose obstacles for people seeking abortions. And, with the appointment of several new conservative judges to the Supreme Court, as well as a rise in restrictive abortion legislation being passed at the state level, the road ahead isn\u2019t looking much clearer.\u00a0AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTIn 2019 alone, 25 new abortion laws were passed \u2014 including bans on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in Mississippi, Kentucky, and Georgia, and a full abortion ban in Alabama. \u201cWe saw these political attacks on the reproductive rights of Southerners [in 2018] across Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama,\u201d Quita Tinsley, co-director of Access Reproductive Care-Southeast, a regional abortion fund, told Refinery29 last year after the signing of Tennessee\u2019s near-total abortion ban. With 2020 and the advent of the coronavirus pandemic came a slew of new challenges, including the fact that abortion services are now considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d medical services in many states.Many of these bans occurred in alignment with a common goal of anti-abortion lobbyists: the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. And while the need to protect people\u2019s access to abortion care has always been an urgent one, especially for Black people, the necessity feels particularly pronounced amid this country\u2019s double crisis: not only has the coronavirus run rampant throughout the U.S., but this nation\u2019s ongoing epidemic of anti-Black racism continues apace.\u00a0At the center of it all exists America\u2019s most vulnerable population: Black women and girls. As the recent grand jury decision surrounding Breonna Taylor\u2019s murder demonstrated, American institutions do not protect Black women. And why would they? They\u2019re not intended to do so. This fact is evident in the various systems of oppression that make it difficult for Black women to survive in this country. It\u2019s evident in how they are treated in the workplace. It\u2019s evident in their experience of excessively high rates of pregnancy-related deaths, many of which are preventable, but are exacerbated by a discriminatory healthcare system. And it\u2019s evident in abortion restrictions that disproportionately harm Black women. All of this is a reminder of how long-standing systemic racism is built into every facet of our society; it\u2019s why Black and brown lives are not safe, and never have been.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTOf course, the endangerment of Black women\u2019s lives is not new. Black women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health in particular has been in jeopardy for decades. \u201cBlack women\u2019s bodies have been a site of control since slavery,\u201d Zakiya Luna, PhD, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara and author of Reproductive Rights as Human Rights: Women of Color and the Fight for Reproductive Justice, tells R29Unbothered. \u201cThey were thought of as vessels for reproductive control for the benefit of white slave masters and their families, even as Black women were providing so much important, critical labor.\u201dIn the same way that slavery was rooted in the exploitation of Black bodies, anti-abortion efforts have white supremacist roots in which Black women were pushed aside in order for white men to increase their own wealth and power. \u201cPrior to the Civil War, abortion and contraceptives were legal in the U.S., used by Indigenous women as well as those who sailed to these lands from Europe,\u201d reports the American Civil Liberties Union. Back then, most women received reproductive health care from midwives, not doctors, and around half the women who provided reproductive health care were Black women.\u00a0 \u201c[Black women] also were keepers of knowledge of how to actually terminate an early pregnancy before \u2018quickening,\u2019\u201d a term used to describe the first sensations of fetal movement, says Luna.But, once Black women\u2019s prowess within the field posed a threat to white men looking to capitalize in the field, midwifery was decried as a \u201cdegrading\u201d form of obstetrical care. Male doctors lobbied to ban the practice and abortion along with it, positioning themselves as superior, and ultimately removing Black and Indigenous women from the same spaces they helped cultivate. Of course, it had been those same Black women whose bodies were probed and prodded in experimental, dangerous surgeries that ultimately made it possible for the kind of obstetrical advances that would further delegitimize midwifery. \u201cDr. Marion Sims famously wrote about his insomniac-induced \u2018epiphanies\u2019 that stirred him to experiment on enslaved Black women, lacerating, suturing, and cutting, providing no anesthesia or pain relief,\u201d notes the ACLU. In addition to being used, mistreated and mutilated, Black women were also barred from practicing inside hospitals once they came into existence. Another effect of the sidelining of Black midwives was the banning of abortion and contraceptives; this made it possible for white men to have all the power when it came to women\u2019s reproductive choices, and also made it illegal for Black women to help their communities in the way they\u2019d been doing for generations.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTWhat we\u2019re experiencing now, then, a time when Black women are jumping additional hurdles to obtain the reproductive care they need, feels horribly familiar. \u201cIt\u2019s a different moment, but it\u2019s similar in that restricting who has access to the means of reproduction is part of the history of the U.S.,\u201d stresses Luna. \u201cBlack women in particular have been used in a way to develop policies that end up having a broad affect on all women and people, controlling the reproductive possibility of their lives.\u201dThere is no arguing the fact that abortion bans disproportionately harm Black people, who are three times as likely to die during childbirth as white people. Making it more difficult for Black people to access reproductive healthcare literally puts their lives at risk. With multiple states calling for the postponing of abortion procedures amid COVID-19 \u2014 during which Black and brown communities are being hit the hardest \u2014 Black women are being met with the prospect of navigating an already treacherous healthcare system to birth children during a pandemic if they are unable to gain access to abortion care.\u201c[The COVID-19 pandemic] certainly makes it all the more tenuous for folks to get the kind of care that they need,\u201d Kwajelyn Jackson, Executive Director of the Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center in Atlanta, Georgia tells R29Unbothered. \u201cWe know that folks are taking a tremendous risk just by being outside of their homes during this period of time. But also, abortion care has always been an obstacle course.\u201dAdvertisementADVERTISEMENTIn order to get an abortion, patients often need to take time off work, find childcare, secure safe transportation, and find someone who will be able to be with them throughout the day, particularly if they\u2019re undergoing a surgical procedure that requires them to have anesthesia. There\u2019s also the challenge of\u00a0 paying for the care, which may be especially difficult right now, with 54 percent of Black women reporting that they were facing some sort of economic hardship in June \u2014 including being laid off from their jobs \u2014 amid the rapid rise in unemployment seen as a result of the pandemic. In states like Georgia, Jackson explains, the Hyde Amendment has been deployed to ban the use of state Medicaid funding to cover the cost of abortion care in most cases. Worth noting: Georgia has one of the highest Black maternal mortality rates in the country, making it clear their policy isn\u2019t borne out of concern for women or children.\u00a0 It\u2019s why reproductive justice advocates of color are fighting to end racist and classist legislation like the Hyde Amendment.\u00a0And with Black and brown pregnant women being more likely to be exposed to and die from COVID-19, their fight has become especially critical. Not only do abortion bans perpetuate the systems of oppression that threaten Black women\u2019s lives daily, but during this especially prounounced period of anti-Black racism and social unrest, it becomes increasingly difficult for Black women and their families to survive in their homes and communities.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\u201cWhat is very clear is that [access] very much depends on your geography, and that has been the case with abortion access in the U.S. for a long time,\u201d says Luna. \u201cFor some folks, that likely meant that they ended up taking a pregnancy full term, but then there\u2019s other folks who did what people did before the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion federally, where there was patchwork and access varied state by state: they will travel to another state if they\u2019re able to.\u201dIn either case, the stakes are high for Black women and girls, who \u2014 without safe and legal access to abortion care \u2014 will continue to die, especially those who may not be able to afford to travel. Black women, Jackson adds, are in a place where it doesn\u2019t feel safe to continue a pregnancy, particularly during a pandemic. It doesn\u2019t feel safe to venture out of your home, let alone travel across the country to another state. It doesn\u2019t feel safe to move through crowds of protesters in order to enter an abortion provider. And consistent, stress-free access to contraceptive care is becoming scarce.\u00a0\u201cThere are so many systems that are working against our ability to live full, self-determined, autonomous lives when it comes to our safety and our reproduction,\u201d says Jackson. And with a post-Roe America becoming a very possible reality, (in May 2022, a leaked Supreme Court decision suggested that Roe v. Wade will be overturned) things are becoming more worrisome.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\"Abortion bans are inherently racist because they do not consider the lived experiences of Black people and other communities of color. Many state policymakers would rather criminalize and endanger Black birthing people than supply them with all of the resources they actually need,\" Jackson says. \"Removing the option of abortion care in clinics in so many threatened states will not reduce the need for abortions. But it will harm those communities by compounding existing structural inequities and health disparities.\"Places like the Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center are working hard to broaden  reproductive health services they we offer so that Black and brown communities have the care they need and deserve, Jackson adds. \"We care just as fiercely about Black people having safe and healthy pregnancies and births and the resources to parent with dignity, as we do about them having safe abortions.\"But as we continue to navigate this pandemic, one in which clear, up-to-date, science-based information regarding safety protocol remains unavailable to many in this country, people across the nation face a bleak future \u2014 but it\u2019s Black women who will be asked to carry the heaviest burden.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTRelated StoriesMeg Thee Stallion Will Always Protect Black WomenHow Nature's Holding Space For Black WomenWhy Tennessee's Abortion Ban Is Racist\nWhy Abortion Bans Are Racist & Threaten Black WomenAccess For All \u2022 Abortion \u2022 The Latest \u2022 Unbothered \u2022 Wellnesswritten by Stephanie LongIllustrated by Sofia HjortbergMore from WellnessTaking CareI Feel Romantic Love Even If My Body Won\u2019t Produce The HormonesAs 21-year-old Toria Christie scrolled through TikTok, she started to cry. \u201cI was so sad when I first saw [those videos],\u201d she tells me. \u201cLike, so saby Izzie PriceHoroscopesYour Horoscope This Week: March 17 To 23Pisces Season comes to an end on the 19th and gives way to the astrological new year once the sun enters Aries at 11:06 p.m. EST.
