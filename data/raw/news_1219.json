Kevin Stitt signed Oklahoma's most restrictive abortion ban into law on Wednesday. (KOKH)OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) \u2014 Gov. Kevin Stitt signed Oklahoma's most restrictive abortion ban into law on Wednesday. HB 4327 prohibits all abortions, except to save the life of a pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to authorities. The new law doesn't touch any form of contraception or emergency contraception, however, including Plan B and other morning after pills.RELATED | Oklahoma lawmakers voice opinions on gun control after Texas school shootingI promised Oklahomans that as governor, I would sign every piece of pro-life legislation that came across my desk and I am proud to keep that promise today. From the moment life begins at conception is when we have a responsibility as human beings to do everything we can to protect that baby's life and the life of the mother. That is what I believe and that is what the majority of Oklahomans believe. If other states want to pass different laws, that is their right, but in Oklahoma, we will always stand up for life.The bill has an emergency clause, so it will go into effect immediately.The ACLU of Oklahoma has responded to the new legislation:No one should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will and face the life-altering consequences of being denied this essential health care. Banning abortion does not eliminate the need for this kind of care - rather it forces people to seek abortion outside of the health care system. Attacks on abortion access have and will continue to fall on the most marginalized people: people of color and people struggling to make ends meet.SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser praised Stitt and Oklahoma lawmakers:Governor Stitt and the Oklahoma Legislature have delivered the biggest win yet for unborn children and their mothers. By protecting unborn babies throughout pregnancy, as many as 3,800 lives a year may be saved. In contrast to the Democratic Party\u2019s extreme agenda of abortion on demand until birth, Oklahoma is standing strong for women and children and empowering families with the support they need to choose life. We are grateful to Gov. Stitt and all our local pro-life allies for their courage, and we hope that if the draft Dobbs decision holds, more states will act swiftly on the will of their people.For more local news delivered straight to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter by clicking here.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\u00a9 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ..."
