An increase in unsafe abortions can be linked to poor comprehensive sexuality education, poor contraceptive coverage and restrictive abortion laws. All this can easily be changed. It is a matter of political will. To the question of \u2018pro-life\u2019, we have to ask, whose life? In Namibia, annually about  12% of all maternal deaths are a result of unsafe abortions, and more than 7\u00a0000 women are admitted to public hospitals because of abortion-related health complications.\nWe therefore have to ask ourselves: If women\u2019s lives matter, why do we maintain an apartheid-era law that puts their lives at risk?\nThe evidence shows that the law does not stop abortion but drives it underground with huge risks for women\u2019s lives. Ironically, anti-abortion opinion pieces that dominate the media are mainly penned by those who don\u2019t have a uterus, whose lives can never be threatened by this law  and who will never be faced with the difficult decision to abort an unintended and unwanted pregnancy.\nThe anti-abortion political project emerged in the USA and is rooted in politically conservative religious fundamentalism. The project was exported to Africa through the funding of anti-abortion religious groups.\nAbortion has been the battering ram of vote-seeking conservative politicians like Ronald Reagan, George W Bush and Donald Trump. Their hypocrisy is constantly exposed when black lives are so easily and cheaply terminated by a militarised  police force over which they preside, when they execute people on death row, and when they force wars and invasions of smaller countries at the cost of many lives.\nIn Namibia the anti-abortion groups have shown the same hypocrisy. Some profess to be \u2018pro-life\u2019 while calling for a return of the death penalty, and the irony of this completely eludes them. They are outraged by the abortion of a foetus, but do not show the same outrage when women die unnecessarily when their lives could easily have been saved.\n\u2018Pro-life\u2019 is a misnomer as the political project that steers it is at the centre of taking lives. Someone recently succinctly pointed out that their project is not \u2018pro-life\u2019 but anti-choice.\nAt the heart of the debate are questions of power and control. It is not really about the foetus nor is it about life. There is the desire to punish women for the sexual acts that lead to such pregnancies. This punishment could mean shaming women; young girls dropping out of school to have kids they are unable to care for; or women dying of unsafe abortions.\nThis desire to punish  and shame stems from the ongoing patriarchal struggle to control women\u2019s bodies. More particularly, to control their sexuality, fertility and reproduction.\nRather than centring women\u2019s lives and interests, some women have joined the patriarchal chorus. They chastise and shame those who assert their right to make choices about their bodies. A change to the restrictive abortion law would give women a choice over their own bodies. This is what the fight is really about: Women\u2019s reproductive autonomy.\nThose who don\u2019t believe in abortion have the same reproductive autonomy not to abort. They, however, do not have the right to deny that reproductive autonomy to others. In a  patriarchal society, as ours is, the responsibility of fertility mainly rests on the shoulders of women. Men are seldom held responsible for their sexuality and fertility.\nHuman rights organisations have repeatedly condemned restrictive abortion laws as being incompatible with human rights norms. Restrictions impede women\u2019s rights to life, liberty, privacy, equality and non-discrimination as well as freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. It violates Article 10 of our Constitution and restricts women\u2019s choices.\nMen will therefore never be subjected to the same treatment, punishment and outcomes resulting from unwanted pregnancy, yet they are equally responsible for it. A further injustice is committed against poor and mainly black women. Wealthy women fly to South Africa for safe abortions, but poor women are compelled to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term or \u2013 out of desperation \u2013 endure the trauma of haemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation and damage to the genital tract and internal organs from inserting dangerous objects  to induce abortion.\nI appeal to lawmakers to centre women\u2019s lives, gender equality, reproductive justice and racial justice when they are finally called upon to decide on changes to the abortion law.\nLet the evidence and the Constitution upon which this secular state is built guide decision-making.\nTo my friends in the church, I ask that you show compassion.\nPlease don\u2019t condemn and shame; rather join us in saving women\u2019s lives, for women\u2019s lives do matter.\n* Lucy Edwards-Jauch is an associate professor of sociology and a gender justice activist.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Stay informed with The Namibian \u2013 your source for credible journalism.
