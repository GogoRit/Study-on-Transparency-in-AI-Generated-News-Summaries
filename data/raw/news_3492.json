Gavin Newsom blasts Republicans, chides fellow Democrats and urges Americans to \u201cwake up\u201d on the threat to abortion rights.\n\n\n\n\nCalMatters is dedicated to explaining how state government impacts our lives.\u00a0Your support\u00a0helps us produce journalism that makes a difference. Donate now.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom is running for reelection as governor of California, but from the impassioned speech he gave Wednesday outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Los Angeles County \u2014 and his repeated exhortations for Americans to \u201cwake up\u201d \u2014 you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he might be setting his sights even higher. \nOn the implications of a draft U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion to take away the federal constitutional right to abortion:  \u201cAt a time when countries around the world are expanding liberties, expanding freedoms, expanding rights, here we are in the United States of America about to roll back rights. \u2026 And don\u2019t think for a second \u2014 don\u2019t think for a second \u2014 this is where they stop. \u2026 Wake up, America.\u201d \nOn the Republican Party: \u201cHow about all of those women and girls raped in states where they don\u2019t even make an exception for rape? Talk about extremist. \u2026 They claim to be pro-life, they\u2019re pro-birth. That\u2019s all this is about. This is the pro-birth party. And then you are on your own.\u201d \nOn the Democratic Party: \u201cI felt this enormous sense of frustration, like, Where the hell is my party? Where is the Democratic Party? You guys paying attention to what\u2019s going on? \u2026 Across the spectrum of issues, where is the Democratic Party? Where\u2019s the party? Why aren\u2019t we standing up more firmly, more resolutely? Why aren\u2019t we calling this out?\u201d \nThe apparent implication behind those remarks: Where the party isn\u2019t standing up, Newsom will; what the federal government can\u2019t do, California will. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to roll over. We will not back down. And we will continue to fill in the gaps and address the disparities that continue to persist,\u201d the governor said. \nNewsom\u2019s press conference came the same day he released a campaign ad  focused on reproductive rights, which he declared the \u201cdefining issue of the 2022 election.\u201d But will that strategy prove effective in helping California Democrats turn out liberal and moderate voters even as the party faces strong national political headwinds? CalMatters\u2019 Alexei Koseff takes a closer look.  \nNewsom\u2019s ad accuses one of his opponents, GOP state Sen. Brian Dahle of Bieber, of wanting \u201cto roll back abortion rights, punishing women and doctors.\u201dDahle, in an interview with CalMatters, described himself as \u201cpro-life. I\u2019m not shy about that.\u201d But Dahle also told the San Francisco Chronicle that Newsom is trying to use the draft Supreme Court ruling to distract from his record on crime and homelessness \u2014 two issues on which voters give him low marks. \nNewsom \u2014 asked Wednesday why he was focusing on reproductive rights instead of issues such as inflation, skyrocketing interest rates and public safety when California already does more than any other state to protect abortion access \u2014 had a quick response: \u201cBecause rolling back fundamental constitutional rights has a profound impact across the spectrum of issues. It\u2019s a foundational issue. Everything\u2019s built off that fundamental right: Freedom.\u201d\nFor more on Newsom and California\u2019s plans to protect abortion rights: Join me and CalMatters Engagement Editor Meg Zukin for a Twitter Spaces conversation at NOON TODAY.

Yee implicated in Blue Flame fiasco\nCalifornia Controller Betty Yee during a meeting in Sacramento on June 28, 2016. Photo by Rich Pedroncelli, AP Photo\nRemember the early days of the pandemic, when California wired nearly half a billion dollars to a face mask company that had been in business for just three days \u2014 only to claw the money back hours later when a bank flagged the transaction as suspicious? Text messages obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that Democratic state Controller Betty Yee \u2014 who isn\u2019t seeking reelection this year due to term limits \u2014 worked behind the scenes to help the two Republican political strategists behind Blue Flame Medical LLC secure the no-bid contract. Yee assured the strategists she would \u201cpress governor\u2019s folks\u201d and ensure \u201cthe wire happens first thing this morning.\u201d She also advised them not to disclose their estimated $134 million profit margin, noting, \u201cIf you share info with State, it may \u2026 become a matter of public record and make headlines.\u201d\nRick Chivaro, the controller\u2019s chief counsel, said in a lawsuit deposition: \u201cThe controller was merely trying to ensure that we had the face masks that we needed and other PPE to protect the nurses and the doctors that were handling these COVID cases.\u201d Yet Yee\u2019s role in the Blue Flame fiasco stands in stark contrast to her role in another controversial pandemic no-bid contract: Her office for months refused to approve payments for a $35 million voter education contract then-Secretary of State Alex Padilla\u2019s office had awarded to public affairs firm SKDKnickerbocker. Yee spokesperson Jennifer Hanson said the controller couldn\u2019t legally pay the SKDKnickerbocker contract until the funds, originally earmarked for the counties, were made available for that purpose by the Legislature. Controller candidate and Democratic state Sen. Steve Glazer of Orinda told CalMatters this week: \u201cSome of the no-bid contracts that have been put out during COVID, you want to make sure that the folks that took that money did the right thing.\u201d\nText messages also formed the basis of a Mercury News investigation, which found San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and top-ranking Valley Transportation Authority officials sought to avoid publicizing federal estimates that BART\u2019s planned extension to San Jose could cost $2.25 billion more than currently budgeted. \nLiccardo: \u201cTo protect taxpayer dollars, it was my duty as a public official to avoid publicly discussing competing estimates for increased BART construction costs while private contractors were contemporaneously preparing bids on that same multi-billion dollar contract.\u00a0Doing so would result in higher bids that would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. I would do precisely the same thing if I were confronted with this issue today, and I hope that any other public official representing our taxpayers would do so as well.\u201d\n2. Will CA follow Redondo Beach model?\nDarin Backer hears from the judge at Redondo Beach\u2019s homeless court on April 27, 2022. Photo by Lauren Justice for CalMatters\nWhat\u2019s the best way to help people experiencing homelessness access the care and services they need to get back on their feet? One approach is Newsom\u2019s proposal to create a court framework to compel people with serious mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders into treatment; two San Diego city council members submitted a funding request this week to expand a city program that could place more homeless people into conservatorships.  \nAnd then there is the approach Redondo Beach took amid the pandemic: moving its homeless court program outdoors, in a central location where the unhoused tend to congregate, and incentivizing attendance by promising defendants they won\u2019t be jailed for showing up. Participants are instead connected to housing programs, mental health and substance abuse services and legal assistance. The court has had an average attendance rate of 80% since September 2020, CalMatters\u2019 Nigel Duara reports \u2014 and now Democratic Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi of Torrance is carrying a bill to expand such efforts statewide by offering counties grants to tailor homeless courts to their own communities. \nDesiree Garibay, 31: \u201cThey actually work with you. I like just the fact they\u2019re helping me with housing, just my own place finally to call home.\u201d\n3. Introducing: Homelessness super agency\nA man walks by a homeless encampment in San Jose on June 22, 2021. Photo by Dai Sugano, Bay Area News Group\nBut, when all else fails, you can create a super agency on homelessness \u2014 which is what Los Angeles County supervisors voted 3-2 to do Tuesday on the recommendation of its Blue Ribbon Commission on Homelessness. \nWhat makes the agency super? It\u2019s intended to serve as a sort of superstructure to the county\u2019s homelessness response, overseeing and coordinating efforts between its health, mental health and social services departments, among others. Some supervisors applauded the new agency: It will contribute to a \u201cframework for building a transparent, inclusive and accountable homeless governance system,\u201d said Supervisor Hilda Solis. Others didn\u2019t seem to think it was too super: It will \u201ccause a thickening of the county bureaucracy and a process of administrative seat-swapping that will divert time, resources and attention,\u201d said Supervisor Sheila Kuehl. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving the deck chairs on the Titanic and thinking it will keep it afloat.\u201d\nIn other housing news: \nTenants rights advocates are suing the California Department of Housing and Community Development, alleging that its \u201coften onerous\u201d system for processing rent relief applications and its \u201cfailure to provide the full amount of rental assistance intended by the law\u201d is putting renters at increased risk of eviction and homelessness. Los Angeles mayoral candidates want to build more group shelters for homeless people \u2014 but many would prefer not to live in them. San Jose, which is facing a federal order to clear a massive homeless encampment near its airport, said Wednesday that it needs to extend its June 30 deadline to Sept. 30, noting that an estimated 131 of 200 residents are still living in the camp. \n\nA message from our Sponsor\n\n\nCalMatters commentary\nCalMatters columnist Dan Walters: A recap of Newsom\u2019s first term: Reality bites.\n\nOther things worth your time\nCalifornia moves to embrace cryptocurrency and regulate it. // Associated Press\nTurboTax to pay 370,000 Californians charged for \u2018free\u2019 filing. // Mercury News\nLinkedIn settles with U.S. over alleged pay discrimination for California workers. // Associated Press\nParole ordered for killer of SDPD Officer Archie Buggs after judge overrules Newsom\u2019s decision. // San Diego Union-Tribune\nMedical parole got them out of state prison.
