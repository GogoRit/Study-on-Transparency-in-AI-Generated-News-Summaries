Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Actress Patricia Heaton\u00a0has\u00a0denounced the Democratic Party's platform for including what she called a \"barbaric\" position on abortion.    \"I don\u2019t understand why pro-life people want to know if they are 'welcome'\u00a0to join the democrat party [sic],\" the \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" co-star tweeted Wednesday.\u00a0\"Why would any civilized person want to support a barbaric platform that champions abortion for any reason through all nine months funded by taxpayers?\"The issue has resurfaced in recent weeks after\u00a0Kristen Day, who leads Democrats for Life, asked former South Bend, Ind.\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg about whether the party included room for her. During a Jan. 26 Fox News town hall\u00a0with Buttigieg, Day specifically took issue with the language in the party's platform.  KRISTEN DAY: BUTTIGIEG AND 2020 HOPEFULS, DON'T CANCEL 21 MILLION PRO-LIFE DEMS IF YOU WANT TO BEAT TRUMP  \"The Democratic platform contains language that basically says, 'We don't belong, we have no part in the party because it says abortion should be legal up to nine\u00a0months, the government should pay for it,'\" Day told Buttigieg, who supported his party's position.  Pro-life leaders also\u00a0blasted former Buttigieg after he seemed to back away from answering whether he supported infanticide.\"I just know that I trust her and her decision medically or morally isn't going to be any better because the government is commanding her to do it in a certain way.\" he told \"The View\" co-host Meghan McCain.  PETE BUTTIGIEG FACES BACKLASH FROM PRO-LIFE WOMEN AFTER INFANTICIDE ANSWER: 'YOU'RE EXTREMELY RADICAL'Live Action Founder\u00a0Lila Rose interpreted Buttigieg's answer as a pass for partial-birth abortion.  \"He said as long as a mother wants to abort a baby, at any age, she should be able to [e]ven if that means partially delivering a full-grown, 7 lb infant, who can recognize her mother\u2019s voice, & then stabbing her neck & suctioning out her brain,\" she tweeted.\u00a0Second trimester surgical abortions also\u00a0involve\u00a0dismembering a fetus and crushing its skull.More from Media Joy Behar: Friends of Trump can 'rob a bank because he's got you covered'Rush Limbaugh: New Hampshire turnout shows media is 'creating Trump support'Former DOJ official: Trump critics are overreacting to Roger Stone sentence recommendation reduction    The\u00a0Democratic platform\u00a0reiterates the party's interest in protecting abortion access but doesn't specify any time periods for potential restrictions.\"We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion\u2014regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured,\" it reads.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., another 2020 candidate, indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to build a \"big tent\" for pro-life Democrats like Day.In a comment to Fox News, Day responded: \"We are appreciative of her acknowledgment, but we do need to talk more specifically about the platform language, litmus test currently being applied against pro-life Democrats and the stranglehold by the abortion lobby.\"                      Trending        Divorce  Ariana Grande to pay ex-husband $1.25M in spousal support as she reportedly moves on with new boyfriend        British Royals  Kate
