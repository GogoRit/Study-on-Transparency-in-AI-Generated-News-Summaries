A nursing student\u2019s pro-life efforts on campus have been met with dozens of cyber bullying messages and threatening comments as she goes about daily activities on campus. \u00a0\nThe efforts of her peers and faculty, including a nun, have tried to silence her pro-life group as the nun and faculty work to make her campus events near impossible. \u00a0\nDanielle Smits, President of V-Hawks for Life at Viterbo University, had paved the way for pro-life advocacy on her campus until the school administration caused her work to come to a screeching halt. After tabling with Students for Life of America (SFLA) Regional Coordinator Matt Murphy for a \u201cNo Woman Stands Alone in a Post-Roe America\u201d event, the Franciscan Catholic university placed restrictions on the group as students harassed the pro-life members.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Smits is asking her club to be treated equally as other peer led organizations on campus and how the harassment has made her no longer feel safe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn early May, V-Hawks for Life were informed that the group would have to go through additional levels of approval for tabling events \u2013 a warning notice that no other student organization had been given. The next day they were informed that the SFLA Regional Coordinator was no longer allowed on campus. The reason for this sudden policy? Smits and Murphy tabled on campus to share why no woman stands alone in a post-Roe America.\u00a0\u00a0\nSmits was very excited for this tabling event because she indicated that there was no better time to talk about the resources in place for women than this very moment, when Roe was finally reversed, and she could share life-affirming resources to her peers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTogether, the pro-life group stood as a united front but were met with screaming, belittling comments, and insulting names by Viterbo students and faculty. When their table wrapped up for the day, the group took a photo and exchanged numbers to stay in touch.\u00a0\nThe comments of the three staff present sought to place shame on pro-lifers for spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d to students and \u201csparking division within the campus community.\u201d\nSmits was grateful for SFLA\u2019s support on campus and said, \u201cI thanked them all profusely for tabling with me because for the first time, I felt supported as a pro-life student on Viterbo\u2019s campus even if it wasn\u2019t by anyone from the university itself.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter Smits posted the group photo on the club Instagram page with a caption about how great it was to have compassionate conversations about abortion with the campus community, the comment section started blowing up with hateful and demeaning messages by Viterbo students. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only was the post receiving hate, but the direct messages to the club\u2019s Instagram account were filling up. Since people on campus knew Smits was leading the club, she said that many people with her personal cell phone number started texting her.\u00a0\nIn the midst of studying for her final nursing exams and leading her pro-life group, Smits was distraught over the virtual harassment she was facing. Smits had the support of some great friends, and she began to fill out official hate/bias reports for the comments, texts, and interactions she had experienced on campus.\u00a0\nSmits returned to studying as she worked to fill out the lengthy hate/bias reports. She constantly looked for ways to get off campus to avoid more profane screaming from dorm windows and anonymous notes that wished for her to be sexually assaulted and impregnated.\u00a0\nLeaving the university after completing final exams, it was her understanding that she would be updated on the progression as the hate/bias reports. Since May, she has heard of no action\u00a0 taken by the school administration. Instead, Smits\u2019 club received more restrictions making it even harder to table on campus.\n\n\n\u201cI no longer feel safe walking around campus,\u201d she told SFLA.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe university shared that there is a new \u201cno visitor\u201d policy, but this new policy was directly in response to the pro-life group\u2019s tabling display. While this new policy applies to all Viterbo clubs and organizations, it will greatly affect how the pro-life club functions on campus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOn August 22, Sister Laura Nettles, Executive Director for Mission and Social Justice, said publicly that she was \u201cplacing restrictions on the pro-life club.\u201d An audience member asked Sister Nettles during the meeting why a \u201cpro-choice\u201d club was not allowed to form on campus to which the faculty member said they could under a name such as \u201cReproductive Rights Club.\u201d While assuring the audience that a pro-life club was being restricted and would not allow future displays from them, she said \u201cpro-choice\u201d is a trigger word for the Catholic church.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the student handbook, Viterbo \u201ccommits to creating an inclusive environment where persons of all faiths and no faith are welcomed.\u201d Smits sought out her education at Viterbo because she knew the statistics of young adults losing their faith when they leave for college, and she wanted \u201ca community to build me up as a Catholic woman as I made the transition into adulthood and independence for the first time in my life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLeading a pro-life group has caused Smits great challenges and she said, \u201cI have found myself struggling to ever find true rest on Viterbo\u2019s campus, never knowing what would be said next in contradiction to my faith or my belief that abortion is morally wrong.\u201d\u00a0\nThe university has attempted to block Smits\u2019 pro-life advocacy on campus and remove her support by stopping SFLA\u2019s Regional Coordinator from visiting campus. Smits said, \u201cMy Regional Coordinator cannot do apologetics training for our club members, and he cannot be the active support system I very much crave and deserve to have as a student leader. I supposedly have the support of campus to continue this club, but I can no longer actively utilize the resource of my Regional Coordinator that has been giving me strength to keep fighting for the unborn.\u201d\u00a0\nThe nursing student continues to study and work to bring a positive, pro-life message to campus. Smits has sent a letter to her school administration with the help of SFLA and continues to urge the faculty to treat pro-life groups fairly. In a post-Roe America, sharing life-affirming resources should never lead to such harassment and hate by students \u2013 we\u2019re proud of the Pro-Life Generation for standing up and speaking out! \u00a0\u00a0READ NEXT: Let Their Hearts Beat: SFLA Champions Commonsense Protections for the Preborn\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 6,177\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeCollege StudentsFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
