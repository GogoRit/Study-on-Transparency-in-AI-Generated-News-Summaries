Taking a strong pro-life stance in his speech, Holtz offered support for President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on the matter.\u00a0He then criticized the Biden-Harris ticket as \u201cthe most radically pro-abortion campaign in history.\u201d Holtz elaborated on that by declaring that any Catholic politician who supports abortion, like Biden, is \u201cCatholic in name only.\u201dHoltz\u2019s pro-life stance seemed to cause controversy at the Catholic university, drawing a rebuke from the school\u2019s president, Rev. John Jenkins, who made it clear that the university did not endorse the words of its former football coach.[RELATED: University of Notre Dame keeps mum on \u2018Confronting Whiteness\u2019 event...but why?]\u201cWhile Coach Lou Holtz is a former coach at Notre Dame, his use of the University\u2019s name at the Republican National Convention must not be taken to imply that the University endorses his views, any candidate or any political party. Moreover, we Catholics should remind ourselves that while we may judge the objective moral quality of another\u2019s actions, we must never question the sincerity of another\u2019s faith, which is due to the mysterious working of grace in that person\u2019s heart. In this fractious time, let us remember that our highest calling is to love,\u201d Jenkins said.Notre Dame College Republicans President Adam Morys had a different reaction.\u201cIt was right to criticize Holtz to a certain extent. He was incorrect in calling Biden \u2018Catholic in name only,\u2019\u201d Morys told Campus Reform.\u201cHaving received the Church\u2019s sacraments, Biden is a Catholic, but he is a Catholic committing scandal by publicly promoting a position that is manifestly contrary to that of the Church.\u201dAs reported by the Catholic News Agency, in late August, Pontifical Academy for Life President Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia,\u00a0stated that Catholic politicians \u201cmust stop promoting laws against the life\u201d of the unborn.\u00a0\u201cThe Church is very clear in this regard. It is a response from the Catechism. It is a great mistake to promote legislation on abortion and euthanasia,\u201d Paglia said.\u201cIt is likely that political pressure is influencing the university. In June, Fr. Jenkins praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision preventing the president from rescinding DACA,\u201d Morys told Campus Reform. \u201cIt is saddening that the University will not publicly oppose Biden\u2019s stance on abortion as aggressively as it opposed Trump\u2019s attempt to end Obama\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty.\u201d\u00a0\u201cEvery Catholic institution, especially one as respected as Notre Dame, must be willing to rebuke Catholic politicians that support abortion,\u201d Morys added.Campus Reform reached out to the University of Notre Dame for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.Follow the author of this article on Twitter:\u00a0@Chris_TremoglieShare this articleChristopher Tremoglie Commentary Fellow, Washington ExaminerChristopher Tremoglie is a Commentary Fellow at Washington Examiner.
