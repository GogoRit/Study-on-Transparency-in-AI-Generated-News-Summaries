(AP) \u2014 New Mexico\u2019s governor signed an abortion-rights bill Thursday that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting access to abortion procedures and medications.Reproductive health clinics in New Mexico offer abortion procedures to patients from states, including Texas, with strict abortion bans. The new law also aims to ensure access to gender affirming healthcare related to distress over gender identity that doesn\u2019t match a person\u2019s assigned sex.New Mexico has one of the country\u2019s most liberal abortion access laws, but two counties and three cities in eastern New Mexico have recently adopted abortion restrictions that reflect deep-seated opposition to offering the procedure.The bill signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham overrides those local ordinances.An additional bill working its way through New Mexico\u2019s Legislature would protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state interference, prosecution or extradition attempts.\n\nIn 2021, New Mexico\u2019s Democrat-led Legislature passed a measure to repeal a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures, which ensured access to abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court rejects appeal by former New Mexico county commissioner banned for Jan. 6 insurrection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch Madness brackets are here.

The decision shifted regulatory powers over the procedure to state governments.Many states have also enacted or contemplated limits or outright bans on transgender medical treatment, with conservative U.S. lawmakers saying they are worried about young people later regretting irreversible body-altering treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
