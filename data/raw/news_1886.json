abortion-rights rally on June 25, 2022 in Austin, Texas. \n\nSergio Flores/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Several women who say Texas\u2019 abortion bans posed significant risks to their health have sued the state this week, opening a new front in the legal battles that have emerged since the Supreme Court overturned national abortion rights protections last year.\n    \n\n            Five women allege in the lawsuit that uncertainty around when medical emergency exemptions in Texas\u2019 abortion laws apply exacerbated medical emergencies that put their lives, health and fertility in danger.\n    \n\n            \u201cTo the extent Texas\u2019s abortion bans bar the provision of abortion to pregnant people to treat medical conditions that pose a risk to the pregnant person\u2019s life or a significant risk to their health,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthe Bans violate pregnant people\u2019s\u201d rights under the state constitution\u2019s provisions protecting fundamental rights and the right to equality.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana Rep. Danny McCormick's anti-abortion legislation, which would charge women who receive abortions with murder, was the first of its kind to move out of a legislative committee to the full house floor. \n\nHillary Scheinuk/The Advocate/AP\n\n\n\n\n\nThese male politicians are pushing for women who receive abortions to be punished with prison time\n\n\n\n\n            The lawsuit is not seeking to block Texas\u2019 abortion bans outright. Rather, the women \u2013 who are joined by two medical providers in the lawsuit \u2013 ask the court to clarify that abortions can be performed when a physician makes a \u201cgood faith judgment\u201d that \u201cthe pregnant person has a physical emergent medical condition that poses a risk of death or a risk to their health (including their fertility).\u201d\n    \n\n            The women\u2019s complaint details harrowing stories of being denied abortion care when they faced emergency complications in their pregnancies, which were all wanted. They filed the lawsuit Monday evening in state court in Austin, Texas.\n    \n\n            Texas, its Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Texas Medical Board and its Executive Director Stephen Brint Carlton are listed as defendants in the lawsuit. \n    \n\n            A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that he \u201cis committed to doing everything in his power to protect mothers, families, and unborn children, and he will continue to defend and enforce the laws duly enacted by the Texas Legislature.\u201d \n    \n\n            The spokesperson, Paige Willey, also pointed to guidance Paxton issued after last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that said the state\u2019s trigger law \u201cprotects women facing life- threatening physical conditions resulting from pregnancy complications.\u201d\n    \n\n            A spokesperson for the state medical board did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office also did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry.\n    \n\n    Texas a flashpoint in legal fight over abortion\n\n\n            Texas, which has arguably the most aggressive abortion restrictions in the country, has been the site of several legal battles over abortion since before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June. \n    \n\n            A challenge that predated that ruling to Texas\u2019 2021 civil enforcement abortion ban \u2013 which allows private civil lawsuits against anyone accused of facilitating abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks into the pregnancy \u2013 also went up to the Supreme Court. The justices allowed the law to stay in effect, even though at the time Roe was still on the books.\n    \n\nTexas also preemptively sued last year to block guidance from the Biden administration that instructed health care providers that federal law obligated them to provide abortion care in medical emergencies. A federal judge sided with Texas and halted enforcement of the guidance \u2013 which threatened civil penalties and conditioned federal funding on compliance \u2013 in the state.\n    \n\n            The abortion laws in question in the new lawsuit are the six-week civil enforcement ban, a so-called \u201ctrigger ban\u201d that went into effect after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last year, and a pre-Roe abortion ban. The statutes contain language\u00a0allowing exemptions for medical emergencies.\n    \n\n            \u201cYet inconsistencies in the language of these provisions, the use of non-medical terminology, and sloppy legislative drafting have resulted in understandable confusion throughout the medical profession regarding the scope of the exception,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n    \n\n            The lawsuit also highlights a letter from the civil enforcement ban\u2019s legislative sponsor to the head of the Texas Medical Board, raising concerns about reports that women facing dire health emergencies from their pregnancies were being denied care that the lawmaker said was covered by the exceptions in the state abortion code.\n    \n\n            \u201cTexas law makes it clear that a mother\u2019s life and major bodily function should be protected. Any deviation, such as these allegations, should be investigated as potential malpractice and a non-physician (including hospitals) instructing a physician to act should be investigated as a prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine,\u201d the August 2022 letter, from Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, said. He asked the board to issue guidance on the issue.\n    \n\n            It remains to be seen what kind of success Monday\u2019s lawsuit will have. The Texas State Supreme Court, which is typically the final arbiter of whether state laws comply with the Texas constitution, has ruled in favor of Texas abortion restrictions in previous disputes that went up to the state high court.\n    \n\n    Plaintiffs\u2019 stories\n\n\n            The women who brought the lawsuit, all Texas residents, say they experienced irreparable harm \u2013 including emotional trauma and risks to their physical health \u2013 because of the hoops they had to jump through to obtain the care they needed.\n    \n\n            One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Amanda Zurawski, says she \u201cwas forced to wait until she was septic to receive abortion care, causing one of her fallopian tubes to become permanently closed.\u201d\n    \n\n            As Zurawski and her husband previously told CNN, she became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility\u00a0treatments. But at 18 weeks into her pregnancy \u2013 well before the point of viability\u00a0\u2013 her water broke, and she was told by her doctor that the baby would not survive, according to her account. \n    \n\n            However, her doctors told her that they would not terminate her pregnancy until she was \u201cconsidered sick enough that my life was at risk,\u201d she recounted to CNN last year, adding that she was told that could take hours, days or even weeks.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas woman almost dies because she couldn't get an abortion  \n\n\n\n\n            Zurawski and her husband decided they could not risk the several hours it would take to travel to another state where abortion would available. When she fell under a fever that spiked up to 103 and began exhibiting signs of sepsis, her doctors felt that they could legally induce labor without violating Texas\u2019 abortion laws, according to the lawsuit. However, she went on to develop a secondary infection and septic shock, and her family flew into Austin, Texas fearing she could die. While she eventually\u00a0recovered, the infections caused damage to her reproductive organs.\n    \n\n            Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Lauren Miller, was pregnant with twins but learned through testing that one of the fetuses had multiple fetal abnormalities that made it highly unlikely that it would survive to birth, according to the lawsuit. Her specialists suggested she travel out of state, but evaded giving her and husband direct answers to their questions, the lawsuit says.\n    \n\n            It \u201cwas apparent that their doctors, nurses, and counselors were all fearful of speaking directly and openly about abortion for fear of liability under Texas\u2019s abortion bans,\u201d the lawsuit states. \n    \n\n            Miller ultimately traveled to Colorado to obtain a so-called\u00a0selective reduction \u2013 a procedure to abort the likely non-viable fetus to preserve the health of the other fetus and the mother \u2013 and Miller is now due to deliver the other fetus this month.\n    \n\n            A third plaintiff, Lauren Hall, traveled to Seattle for an abortion after being told at an 18 week scan that her fetus had a condition that gave it no chance of survival. She was told that the condition, according to the lawsuit, posed risks of\u00a0hemorrhage and preterm birth, among other risks. But she says her specialist in Texas would not give her information about her options or even transfer her medical records to an abortion provider.\n    \n\n            The fourth plaintiff, Anna Zargarian, says in the complaint that at 19-and-a-half weeks into a pregnancy her water broke. She was diagnosed with\u00a0preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and told that her fetus would not survive to birth, according to the lawsuit. \n    \n\n            But even as doctors said the recommended treatment was an abortion, they told Zargarian they were barred from performing one because the fetal heartbeat was still detectable, according to the lawsuit. Eventually she obtained the procedure in Colorado, but now faces fear about becoming pregnant in Texas again because she has been told she will be at high risk of developing conditions linked to PPROM, the lawsuit says.\n    \n\n            The fifth plaintiff,\u00a0Ashley Brandt, also says she faced complications in a pregnancy with twins, during which one fetus had conditions that were putting the other fetus at risk. Though she was ultimately able to obtain a selective abortion in Colorado, according to the lawsuit, she faced other complications that at one point sent her to the emergency room where she felt \u201ca distinct uneasiness and confusion.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIt appeared that the medical staff thought they were not supposed to know about Ashley\u2019s abortion or discuss it with her,\u201d the lawsuit said, adding that the remainder of her pregnancy \u201cwas plagued by fear and stress.\u201d She ultimately delivered a healthy baby at 38 weeks into the pregnancy.\n    \n\n            In a statement, Vice President Kamala Harris praised the lawsuit, saying it demonstrates that the fears about \u201cthe harm\u201d patients \u201cwould experience as a result of Texas\u2019 extreme laws\u201d had turned into reality.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe lawsuit includes devastating, first-hand accounts of women\u2019s lives almost lost after they were denied the health care they needed, because of extreme efforts by Republican officials to control women\u2019s bodies,\u201d Harris said.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n\n  CNN\u2019s
