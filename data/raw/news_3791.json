This right is also rarely recognised in intergovernmental \u201cpatriarchal\u201d settings, which perpetuate historically unequal power relations between women and men. Not only are the words \u201cright to sexual and reproductive health\u201d (not mere status) difficult to use\u2014because they imply a clear recognition of the justiciability of the right\u2014but the expression \u201caccess to sexual and reproductive services\u201d is as well.\u00a0\nOne year ago, on 23 April 2019, the UNSC adopted Resolution No.\u00a02467 (2019)\u00a0within the framework of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda. At the time of the adoption, the UNSC was composed of 15 men and 0 women. A key paragraph on access to sexual and reproductive health was watered down upon political pressure in order to avoid the US veto, which would have impaired the adoption of the Resolution itself. The Resolution, which falls under Chapter VI UN Charter, has divided scholars and activists, ranging from\u00a0criticism\u00a0to\u00a0appreciation\u00a0of its positive aspects. Even though the Resolution registered some important steps forward\u2014including the recognition of the rights of children born of conflict-related sexual violence, a survivor-centred approach, the repetition of elements of the WPS Agenda that constitute binding legal obligations, and acknowledging the continuum of violence\u2014access to sexual and reproductive health was willingly excluded from the final text, both from the preamble and from the operative paragraphs.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0debate\u00a0during the negotiations and after the adoption of Resolution No. 2467(2019) clearly demonstrates how a general \u201caccess to health care\u201d can be accepted, but not the access\u2014or better, the right\u2014to sexual and reproductive health. Months later, during the\u00a0debate\u00a0following the adoption of Resolution No.\u00a02493 (2019), focused on women\u2019s participation, the women representing the states sitting at the UNSC made strong affirmations in favour of the recognition of sexual and reproductive health services as a vital public service for women in all countries (UK), and expressed regret that the Resolution omitted references to women\u2019s crucial sexual and reproductive health and rights (France). These declarations demonstrate that access to (or the right to) sexual and reproductive health are not obviously included in a resolution unless explicitly stated, even with a reference in the preamble to Resolution No.\u00a02122 (2013).\u00a0\nWhy is it so relevant to recognise this right in the WPS Agenda? Why do states show this reluctance, if this right has been confirmed by UN treaty bodies and in the reports of the UN Secretary General (SG)? Would states finance a programme for\u2014say\u2014access to abortion services based on Resolution No. 2467 as it is written today?\u00a0\nAt the UN level, reproductive rights are not only a component of the right to health, but also a major health topic of global concern and a human rights issue. The right to health, as originally conceived in human rights legal instruments, reflects a male-oriented conception of health, where issues related to reproductive health are absent (see, in that respect, among others,\u00a0Putman,\u00a0Cook,\u00a0Doyal,\u00a0Sherwin,\u00a0Leary, and recently\u00a0Nelson).\u00a0\nThe right to health, as originally conceived in human rights legal instruments, reflects a male-oriented conception of health, where issues related to reproductive health are absent.\nWhen it comes to independent experts (e.g., the\u00a0latest report\u00a0of the UN SG) or to bodies that promote an evolutive interpretation of existing law (see\u00a0Alyne da Silva Pimentel Teixeira v. Brazil, CEDAW Committee, as an example), the outcome is in favour of the recognition of this right, \u201cgendering\u201d the more general right to health. It means, in other words, to acknowledge women\u2019s control over their reproductive functions, contributing to the disruption of structural inequalities present in societies (see\u00a0Siegel).\u00a0\nHowever, when it comes to intergovernmental action, this recognition is far from being achieved. The Council of Europe\u00a0Istanbul Convention\u00a0on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, for example, contemplates \u201chealth\u201d in one provision only\u2014regarding compensation. The UN General Assembly, approving a\u00a0Resolution\u00a0on global health in December 2019, struggled to include a reference to sexual and reproductive rights.\u00a0Only by separate votes\u2014with eight countries voting against\u2014could it reaffirm its commitment to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health rights.\u00a0\nTo return to the UNSC, it combines two elements: on the one hand, the promotion of security, mainly meant as military security; on the other hand, a rigorous intergovernmental and unequal structure. The voluntary absence of a reference to access (and even more importantly to the right) to sexual and reproductive healthcare, can constitute a form of\u00a0violence against women\u2019s health\u00a0through laws (e.g., through UNSC law), that impede women\u2019s rights and autonomy. The UNSC mirrors a patriarchal structure of the society, characterised by fixed gender power structures that have been reproduced over the years after the Second World War.\u00a0\nThis is crystal clear in some provisions of Resolution No. 2467(2019). It is a huge step forward that this Resolution refers to the \u201cnon-discriminatory access to services such as medical and psychological care\u201d, to the risks of HIV as a consequence of violence, to the \u201creparation programmes including health care.\u201d Nonetheless, merely referring to the \u201cright to health\u201d is not enough, because of the traditional male-oriented approach to medicine and health. As scholars have\u00a0argued: \u201cbecause women are women, they are subject to social dysfunctions that impact on their physical, mental, or social health.\u201d The absence of a right to sexual and reproductive health, to paraphrase\u00a0Charlotte Bunch, shows the resistance to laws and social changes \u201cthat put control of women\u2019s bodies in women\u2019s hands: reproductive rights, freedom of sexuality whether heterosexual or lesbian, laws that criminalize rape in marriage, etc.\u201d\u00a0\nEven though the Resolution registered some important steps forward, access to sexual and reproductive health was willingly excluded from the final text, both from the preamble and from the operative paragraphs.\u00a0\nThe inclusion of the right to sexual and reproductive healthwould have been fundamental in order to stress not only that this right is violated before, during and after conflict, but also to recognise women\u2019s agency expressed as sexual and reproductive autonomy and as justiciability of the right in front of domestic and regional human rights courts. It would have meant, among others, to clearly ensure the right to fistula operations, to ongoing monitoring, and to access to abortion and post-abortion care.\nThe future of the WPS Agenda depends not only on the political will of the Members of the SC, but also on the activity and actions undertaken outside this framework within the UN (UN SG, CEDAW, other UN-treaty bodies, the Special Representative on conflict-related sexual violence) and on the work of non-governmental organisations, women\u2019s groups, and academia.\u00a0\nIt took years to acknowledge sexual violence as an international crime and to\u00a0include it in the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and probably time will come in which we will see the recognition of the right (not access, not status, but the right) to sexual and reproductive health in a UNSC Resolution. This would support the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda, both in terms of financed programmes in situation of conflicts or post-conflict settings, and in terms of justiciability in order to enable survivors to ask for reparations as a consequence of the lack of access to adequate reproductive health services.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is a part of a series on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) produced in partnership with the University of Binghamton, based on a conference held in April 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSara De Vido is associate professor of International Law at Ca\u2019 Foscari, where she teaches international law, human rights law and European Union law.
