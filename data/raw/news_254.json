(Crystal Vander Weit/Kalamazoo Gazette-MLive Media Group)The Plain DealerBy Lauren Gibbons | lgibbon2@mlive.comAnti-abortion groups in Michigan are asking Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to declare abortion procedures \u201cnon-essential\u201d under the state\u2019s stay-at-home order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the state.On Wednesday, Right to Life of Michigan and the Michigan Heartbeat Coalition called on Whitmer, a Democrat who is supportive of abortion rights, to classify abortions as an elective procedure under the state\u2019s executive order prohibiting most in-person work during the coronavirus pandemic. Some Republican-led states have asked abortion providers to cease operation, citing stay-at-home orders. In Ohio, the Attorney General\u2019s office sent letters to abortion clinics ordering them to \u201cimmediately stop performing non-essential and elective surgical abortions.\u201dKelly Rossman-McKinney, spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, said in Michigan, \u201cwe won\u2019t dictate services physicians choose to perform and we won\u2019t interfere with the doctor/patient relationship.\"Related: Ohio Attorney General sends letters to 2 abortion clinics, telling them to stop all non-essential proceduresWhitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order includes exemptions for health care providers, and allows individuals to leave their homes to secure medication \u201cor to seek medical or dental care that is necessary to address a medical emergency or to preserve the health and safety of a household or family member.\u201dAnti-abortion groups in Michigan argued Wednesday abortion procedures shouldn\u2019t be included in that definition, noting abortion procedures require personal protection equipment and that close contact between patients and staff could contribute to the spread of COVID-19.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a pattern of pro-abortion elected officials putting ideology first, and people at risk of the coronavirus second,\" Right to Life of Michigan President Barbara Listing said. \"Why should abortion facilities get to be above the law?\u201d she later continued. Michigan Heartbeat Coalition President Corey Shankleton said abortions are not necessary to sustain or protect human life: \u201cElective procedures have been banned by Governor Whitmer and this needs to apply to abortions.\"Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan are abiding by Whitmer\u2019s executive order and have had additional precautions in place for weeks, including screening staff and patients for coronavirus symptoms, rescheduling people who are symptomatic or have been exposed and making social distancing mandatory for staff and patients in waiting rooms, said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, director of communications for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan.The governor\u2019s orders were clear on what is considered essential - pregnancy care is essential,\" Vasquez-Giroux said. \u201cWe continue to give our patients the care they depend on us for.\u201d In response to the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s demand, Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region said on Twitter abortion is \u201can essential and time-sensitive medical procedure\u201d that needs to remain available during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cDelays or additional barriers to care can make it more difficult or even impossible for patients to access safe, legal abortion,\u201d the tweet read.PREVENTION TIPSIn addition to washing hands regularly and not touching your face, officials recommend practicing social distancing, assuming anyone may be carrying the virus. Health officials say you should be staying at least 6 feet away from others and working from home, if possible. Carry hand sanitizer with you, and use disinfecting wipes or disinfecting spray cleaners on frequently-touched surfaces in your home ( door handles, faucets, countertops ) and when you go into places like stores.Complete coverage of coronavirus in Michigan.Related coverage:Detroit hospital system almost at capacityHow to report non-essential businesses still operatingMichigan\u2019s Oakland County asks businesses to screen essential staff daily for coronavirus symptomsAll Michigan residents, most businesses ordered to stay home to slow spread of coronavirusRead Michigan Gov.
