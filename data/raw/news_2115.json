Photo: Technizo Concept\n\n\n\nNow that the super-cheap 2020 iPhone SE is finally out Apple fans can turn all their anticipations to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro launch this fall.\nThere has been no shortage of video concept videos imagining what Apple\u2019s first 5G handset will look like, but the latest mockup created by Technizo Concept might be the most accurate depiction of the iPhone 12 Pro we\u2019ve seen yet.\nLook at that sleek new industrial body:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnizo Concept\u2019s concept checks off most of the boxes for the latest rumors. The iPhone 12 Pro frame is expected to be more edgy and industrial, kind of like the iPhone 4 design. Apple is also expected to add a new LiDAR sensor to the back camera array.\nBloomberg reported earlier this week that the two higher-end iPhone 12 models won\u2019t have a notch. The screen will also be flat, instead of sloped at the edges like on the latest iPhones. Apple will also supposedly introduce a new midnight blue color option.\nThe 2020 iPhones are allegedly still on track to be unveiled in the fall despite production problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple unveiled the 2020 iPhone SE on Wednesday, April 15. The device costs just $399 and packs an A13 processor, Portrait Mode camera on the back, wireless charging, WiFi 6, Gigabit LTE and Touch ID.\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\nNumber of comments on this postLeave a comment \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\nDaily round-ups or a weekly refresher, straight from Cult of Mac to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\nCult of Mac Today\nOur daily roundup of Apple news, reviews and how-tos.
