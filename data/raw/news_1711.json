Every two years, Republicans would try to find new and novel ways to outwit Roe v. Wade, while Democrats relied on the courts as a bulwark against further restrictions.\nBut now, the deed is done, the war is won and abortion is almost entirely banned in Texas. The number of monthly legal abortions in the state has dwindled into the low single digits.\nIn overturning Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court not only undid the constitutional protection for abortion. It also made irrelevant many of Texas\u2019 most contentious political scuffles of the past half-century, forcing both sides to revisit their time-honored legislative strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis session, Democrats are the ones stoking outrage and trying to circumvent the courts, while many Republicans are hoping to sidestep the issue entirely, focusing instead on property taxes, education issues and anti-LGBTQ efforts.\nNone of the \u201cBig Three\u201d \u2014 governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the house \u2014 have indicated they intend to focus on abortion this session, likely hemming in both the rightward edge of the Republican Party, which is pushing for additional restrictions, and Democrats, who are hoping to chip away at the near-total bans.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not going to be able to repeal the legislation,\u201d said state Rep. Donna Howard, a Democrat from Austin. \u201cSo we focus on mitigating damage and making our primary focus access to health care.\u201d\nPushing for more\nWhile the overturn of Roe v. Wade may move abortion down the priority list for some Republicans, the issue certainly isn\u2019t disappearing from the discourse anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Friday, 151 lobbyists had registered their intent to advocate for and against abortion legislation this session, including from Texas\u2019 aggressive, nationally influential anti-abortion movement.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just had a huge historical victory,\u201d said John Seago, with Texas Right to Life. \u201cBut in our opinion, the victory is not fully accomplished, it\u2019s not really secured, until we enforce our laws.\u201d\nImmediately after the decision, some anti-abortion Republicans promised legislation to tighten the existing laws, which prohibit abortion except to save the life of the pregnant patient.\nA main target is companies that help pay for employees\u2019 out-of-state abortions. Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican from Dallas, has filed a bill that would prevent those companies from receiving tax incentives from the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Briscoe Cain, a Republican from Deer Park, has promised to file a bill that circumvents district attorneys who won\u2019t bring abortion-related charges. Cain has not yet filed that bill; he did not respond to request for comment.\nA similar bill was filed that would allow the attorney general to take over election fraud cases.\nThe Attorney General would also be permitted to seek financial penalties from any district attorney who \u201cprohibits or materially limits the enforcement of any criminal offense,\u201d under two bills filed in the House and the Senate.\n\u201cRather than adopt politically-motivated virtue signaling and blanket immunity for criminals, district attorneys have a duty to evaluate the merits of each alleged crime on a case-by-case basis to ensure the public safety of Texans,\u201d said state Rep. David Cook, a Republican from Mansfield who filed the legislation alongside state Sen. Tan Parker of Flower Mound, in a press release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Dade Phelan mentioned the role of district attorneys in curbing crime rates in his opening remarks to the House.\n\u201cIf rogue district attorneys will not uphold the law,\u201d Phelan said, \u201cit is time to rein them in.\u201d\nThe legislation does not address abortion directly, but Seago said these efforts will help the cause.\n\u201cBut the devil\u2019s in the details,\u201d Seago said. \u201cAre we just going to punish those DAs for not doing their job, or are we going to adopt tools to go around them to make sure the laws are enforced?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas will likely see more anti-abortion bills between now and the March 10 filing deadline. Other states have seen legislation that would criminalize pregnant people who get abortions, tighten restrictions on medication abortion and institute more roadblocks for minors seeking abortions.\nBut in a busy session, with a budget to negotiate and a surplus to spend down, any new proposals will be competing with myriad other Republican priorities.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the challenges that we\u2019re gonna have now,\u201d Seago said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this historic victory, but we\u2019re always competing with other issues.\u201d\nPushing for expanded exceptions\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are hoping to expand the list of circumstances in which health care providers are permitted to perform abortions. Bills have been filed that would allow abortions in cases in which the fetus is incompatible with life, to preserve the mental health of the pregnant patient or in cases of rape or incest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut to make any progress on that front, Democrats will need Republicans to join their cause. While a few have shown an interest in adding rape and incest exceptions, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has thrown cold water on even that incremental step.\n\u201cWhether anything else goes beyond [the existing exceptions], at this point, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Patrick told WFAA, a TV station in Dallas, last week. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a groundswell for it \u2026 I\u2019d have to see a big groundswell.\u201d\nGov. Greg Abbott told WFAA that he would like the Legislature to clarify the existing exceptions, but did not commit to whether he would sign a rape and incest exception if it passed.\nThere does seem to be bipartisan interest in expanding women\u2019s health care, however. One of Phelan\u2019s top priorities is expanding postpartum Medicaid, from two months after birth to a full year. The Senate has resisted similar proposals in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThankfully, we\u2019ve heard a lot of conservatives in the last two years, since this last session, come on board,\u201d Seago said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing that this makes good sense financially, and it\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d\nDemocrats have also filed bills that would expand maternal health care, increase funding for family planning and strengthen the social safety net.\n\u201cHopefully, my colleagues who have been pushing their so-called pro-life agenda \u2026 will put their money where their mouths are and help us take care of these moms and babies,\u201d Howard said.\nDemocrats are also pushing to expand access to contraception, especially for minors. Texas teens almost always have to get parental consent to access birth control. One of the few programs that offered confidential contraception was recently blocked by a federal court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said all along, if you want to avoid abortions, the best way we can all come together is to prevent the unplanned and unwanted pregnancies in the first place,\u201d Howard said. \u201cAnd part of that has to do with access to contraceptives.\u201d\nRep. Ana-Maria Ramos, a Democrat from Dallas, has filed a bill that would allow minors to access birth control without parental consent. Ramos, who had her first child at 15, said the state\u2019s high teen birth rate is evidence that young people are having sex \u2014 and that they need more tools to do so safely.\n\u201cThe only reason I was able to get my GED, get my law degree and become a legislator was because I was able to get contraception and able to plan a future for myself and my daughter,\u201d Ramos said.\nDemocrats and Republicans are expected to file additional bills between now and the deadline in March, each trying to move the needle in opposite directions. Ramos said she\u2019s hopeful that women\u2019s health care will emerge as the central issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much more they can do to strip away women\u2019s rights,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cOf course, you say that, and then they think of something else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
