Larry and Gail Wasser were Jews who took the family to temple on the High Holidays, and Kiessling, a fair-haired, blue-eyed child, recalls people asking, \u201cWho\u2019s the little shiksa?\u201d Her only sibling, an adopted older brother, acted out in grade school and later got into trouble with the law. In Kiessling\u2019s memory, Larry would joke that \u201csocially deviant behavior is genetic,\u201d a reference to the 1956 thriller \u201cThe Bad Seed,\u201d in which a psychopathic child turns out to be the descendant of a serial killer. Gail sewed matching mother-daughter outfits, but that did little to quell Kiessling\u2019s feeling that she didn\u2019t belong. She likes to recount a story about seeing the musical \u201cAnnie\u201d and being transfixed by the song \u201cMaybe,\u201d in which the orphan protagonist dreams of her mother and father. When Kiessling and I first met, last spring, she recited some of the lyrics for me. \u201cBetcha they\u2019re good\u00a0/\u00a0Why shouldn\u2019t they be?\u201d Annie sings. \u201cTheir one mistake\u00a0/\u00a0Was giving up me.\u201dIn a spiral-bound notebook, Kiessling counted down \u201cthe years, months, and days\u201d until she would be old enough to legally access information about her biological parents. On her eighteenth birthday, in 1987, she contacted a local probate court. Soon she received a two-page letter from an adoption caseworker, which listed details about her birth mother down to her \u201creddish highlights\u201d and \u201caverage\u201d high-school grades but stated, \u201cNo information is available concerning your biological father, other than he was caucasian and of large build.\u201d Kiessling recalled, \u201cIt sounded like a police description. I thought, Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d She reached out to the caseworker, who reluctantly confirmed what Kiessling already suspected: she was the product of a rape. She eventually spoke by phone with her birth mother\u2014who asked that I use only her first name, Joann\u2014and learned that Joann had been walking to a grocery store near her home in Livonia, Michigan, one night in October, 1968, when a stranger attacked her at knifepoint. Kiessling told me, \u201cI remember thinking, Do I have this ugliness lurking inside of me? Because, after all, socially deviant behavior is genetic, right?\u201dKiessling took some comfort in the reunion with her birth mother, writing in her journal, \u201cShe called me honey.\u201d She saved a copy of a typewritten letter in which Joann told her, \u201cI AM SO HAPPY I AM CRYING.\u201d Years later, once the two had met in person, Joann confided that while pregnant with Kiessling she\u2019d tried to get an abortion\u2014twice\u2014and backed out only because the procedure was illegal in Michigan. Pro-lifers sometimes dramatize the stakes of abortion by asking, \u201cWhat if your mother had aborted you?\u201d If you consider reproductive freedom to be a right, you might not be devastated by the prospect. \u201cI was never mad at her,\u201d an anonymous woman told the Irish Times, of her mother\u2019s unsuccessful medication abortion, in an interview two years before the referendum that overturned Ireland\u2019s abortion ban, in 2018. \u201cIt would have been much better for my mum\u2019s mental and physical health.\u201d For Kiessling, who says that she has always believed life starts at conception, Joann\u2019s disclosure was essentially a confession of attempted murder. \u201cMy mom tried to kill me,\u201d she said.In the decades since, Kiessling has made a career as an attorney and a pro-life activist by leveraging her experience as a child of rape who narrowly \u201csurvived\u201d abortion. Her main targets are rape exceptions, the legal provisions that allow pregnant victims special access to the procedure. \u201cI believe I am the living embodiment of what is at stake,\u201d she has said. A graduate of Wayne State University Law School, Kiessling is fifty-three years old, with a lean build and a mane of strawberry-blond hair. For media appearances, she wears sleeveless dresses in bright jewel tones, which she has read play best on camera, and threads her pro-life arguments with calculated emotional appeals. During a CNN debate with the lawyer Gloria Allred, who has spoken about getting a back-alley abortion after being raped in the sixties, Kiessling offered condolences for the loss of Allred\u2019s \u201cson or daughter,\u201d adding, \u201cYou may not think that their life matters, but you know what? That matters to me.\u201d Kiessling\u2019s story is featured in \u201cThe Gift of Life,\u201d an anti-abortion documentary narrated by the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Backstage at the film\u2019s premi\u00e8re, in 2011, she confronted Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry, then candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination, about their support for rape exceptions. Perry later said that Kiessling\u2019s story \u201cpierced my heart.\u201d A day after the meeting, he signed a \u201cpersonhood pledge,\u201d vowing to protect human rights from the moment of conception, \u201cwithout exception and without compromise.\u201dFor a long time, many pro-lifers accepted that it was politically untenable to prohibit abortion in the so-called \u201chard cases\u201d of rape and incest. Ronald Reagan was President when Kiessling found out how she was conceived, and she has recalled feeling \u201cutterly disappointed\u201d to learn that he supported rape exceptions, as have all Republican Presidents since. The Hyde Amendment, which has restricted federal funds for abortion since 1976, includes allowances for victims of rape and incest. Gallup polls have shown that three-quarters of Americans support legal abortion in such cases, but purists in the movement have never considered exceptions to be morally sound. Kristan Hawkins, the president of the nonprofit Students for Life of America, has decried such provisions for \u201cdetermining another person\u2019s value based on something other than his or her status as an innocent member of the human family.\u201d On her Web site, Kiessling calls out two camps for \u201cstanding in judgment\u201d of her life: pro-choicers who defend abortion \u201cespecially\u201d in cases of rape, and pro-lifers who oppose it \u201cexcept\u201d in those cases.In recent years, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority has emboldened the pro-life movement to \u201cask for what it wants,\u201d as the pro-choice legal scholars Mary Ziegler and Michele Goodwin have written in The Atlantic. In June, the Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization overturned Roe\u00a0v. Wade\u2019s federal protection for abortion without requiring state bans to include exceptions of any kind. To date, ten states have no rape exceptions. All ten include some provisions that protect the \u201clife of the mother,\u201d though ambiguities about what qualifies as life-threatening have left many patients deprived of urgent medical care. When news broke, in July, that a ten-year-old rape victim in Ohio had been forced to leave the state for an abortion, some conservatives tried to dismiss the case as a hoax. (A twenty-seven-year-old man was later arrested on rape charges.) Others have denied that rape can even cause pregnancy, a right-wing canard rooted in the medieval belief that women had to experience pleasure in order to conceive.Kiessling has pursued the same ends from a different angle, by devoting her legal career to advocating for mothers whose children were conceived through rape. Her work centers on the rare but nightmarish scenario in which a man who fathers a child through rape receives visitation rights or custody. A leader in this niche area of family law, she has represented or advised several dozen mothers facing custody battles with their alleged assailants. From a certain vantage, these efforts put her in the company of such feminist attorneys as Allred, who specialize in helping victims fight their abusers. For Kiessling, though, this line of work is first and foremost a strategy for combatting abortion. She told me, \u201cIf victims know they\u2019re going to be protected from their rapists, they\u2019re going to be more likely to choose life.\u201dIn 2017, Kiessling made headlines representing a Michigan mother named Tiffany Gordon, who\u2019d become pregnant at the age of twelve when an older friend of a friend abducted and raped her. Gordon decided to go through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a son. Her assailant struck a plea deal and spent less than a year in county jail, though he later served prison time for sexually assaulting another girl. When Gordon\u2019s son was eight, she applied for public assistance, which, under federal law, triggers a routine effort to track down the father for child support. In most states, the authorities can skip this step if there is evidence of domestic abuse, but in practice they often fail to do so. As a result, according to Lucy Guarnera, a forensic psychologist who studies rape-related pregnancies, seeking welfare can be like \u201cpoking the bear.\u201d In Gordon\u2019s case, a county judge ordered her to share custody with her rapist and to move within a hundred miles of his address. Kiessling, who took on the case pro bono, filed a motion to challenge the court\u2019s decision, drumming up media attention with a rally and a petition that collected more than a hundred thousand signatures. The judge reversed his ruling, claiming that he hadn\u2019t been made aware of the circumstances surrounding the child\u2019s birth.The most frequently cited studies, based on decades-old population figures, suggest that about thirty thousand women in the United States become pregnant from rape every year, and about a third of them choose to raise the resulting babies. Until a decade ago, though, only about half of the states had passed any legislation limiting the parental rights of men who father children through rape. Today, most states have laws that apply only if the father has been convicted. But less than three per cent of rapes result in conviction, and the majority of pregnancies from rape are a product of intimate-partner abuse. In 2015, President Obama signed the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act, which incentivized states to allow courts to terminate a father\u2019s rights where there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of rape, a lower burden of proof than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, less than half of the states have codified this standard, among them Michigan, where Kiessling worked to shape the bill. She told me, \u201cIt needs to be public policy that rapists don\u2019t make good parents.\u201dOne week this past spring, I visited Kiessling at the Tudor-style home in the Detroit suburbs where she lives with her three teen-age daughters. (She and her ex-husband, a marketing manager, recently divorced.) Parked in the driveway was Kiessling\u2019s S.U.V., which bears pro-life bumper stickers and vanity plates referencing her advocacy organization, Save the 1\u2014named for the estimated one per cent of abortions that involve pregnancies resulting from rape.Inside the house, which is furnished in shades of off-white and glittering gray, Kiessling sat at her dining table with Genevieve Marnon, the legislative director of the nonprofit Right to Life Michigan. The women were scheduled to speak that day at a conference for local crisis-pregnancy centers, the pro-life facilities that try to steer women away from abortion. In the meantime, they sipped herbal tea and puzzled over a flaw in the state\u2019s laws which one of Kiessling\u2019s clients was confronting. A young Michigan resident, the client had become pregnant after her employer allegedly raped her. She gave birth and left the baby at the hospital under the state\u2019s safe-haven law, which allows women to surrender their newborns anonymously. But soon after the baby was placed with an adoptive family the man (who denies the allegation) made use of a grace period during which birth parents can petition the court for custody. Kiessling and Marnon were now proposing changes to the existing legislation, so that a mother would have standing to challenge her rapist\u2019s parental rights even after giving up her own.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen a lot, and you hate to make laws for those exceptions,\u201d Marnon said. But if Roe was overturned, she added, \u201cI think this would come into play a lot more.\u201d A talkative woman in her fifties, Marnon told me that, among liberals especially, \u201cthere\u2019s this knee-jerk reaction, like, \u2018Well, of course you\u2019re gonna have an abortion. You shouldn\u2019t have to have a rapist\u2019s baby, right?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Turning to Kiessling, she added, \u201cNo offense.\u201dKiessling waved her hand, as if to swat away the label. \u201cI\u2019m a grown woman and I still get called the \u2018rapist\u2019s child,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who say that feel women who have the baby after rape are betraying the cause.\u201d\u201cSorry, Jeff. Two\u2019s company, three\u2019s an infestation.\u201dCartoon by Jake GoldwasserCopy link to cartoonCopy link to cartoonLink copiedShopShopAlthough pro-life leaders are among the loudest advocates for mothers who were raped, the movement to strengthen victims\u2019 parental rights has champions on both sides of the abortion debate. The Obama-era initiative was introduced by the Florida congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a pro-choice Democrat, and it received bipartisan support in the House and the Senate. Lisae Jordan, the executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, led a decade-long effort to enact the clear-and-convincing standard in her state. Although she is pro-choice, she collaborated with the Maryland Catholic Conference, an anti-abortion lobbying group, to get the bill passed. But Jordan told me that she objects to Kiessling\u2019s framing of victims\u2019 rights as an alternative to reproductive choice. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the Right to Life folks do not spin these laws as some sort of savior for women who are raped,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to replace abortion access by any stretch.\u201dDuring the Supreme Court\u2019s oral argument in Dobbs, Justice Amy Coney Barrett downplayed concerns that abortion bans would force women into parenthood by asking whether safe-haven laws \u201ctake care of that problem.\u201d Kiessling speaks similarly about tweaking societal conditions to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies. Part of a cohort of \u201cpro-life feminists,\u201d she portrays abortion patients as misguided victims. During one conversation, she quoted the Eastern Orthodox activist Frederica Mathewes-Green, who has written that a woman \u201cwants an abortion as an animal, caught in a trap, wants to gnaw off its own leg.\u201d Kiessling added, \u201cIt\u2019s an act of desperation, and a sign that we, as a society, have failed her.\u201d She suggested a \u201cmultitude of solutions,\u201d including equipping student centers with high chairs and changing tables so that young mothers \u201cdon\u2019t have to choose college or abortion.\u201d I pointed out that, even in an imaginary American society that offered sufficient support to mothers, many women\u2014and, perhaps especially, many pregnant rape victims\u2014might still feel that they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to have a baby. Kiessling cut me off. \u201cAs a feminist, I shudder to hear a man saying, \u2018Oh, women think they can\u2019t,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said sharply, adding, \u201cWhat happened to \u2018I am woman, hear me roar\u2019?\u201dIn \u201cFar from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity,\u201d the author Andrew Solomon writes that \u201cmany people see children of rape as intrinsically defective\u2014including, often, their mothers.\u201d He quotes one survivor who described her son, in testimony before the Louisiana state legislature, as \u201ca living, breathing torture mechanism that replayed in my mind over and over the rape.\u201d Lucy Guarnera, the expert on rape-related pregnancy, knew of no existing scholarly studies on the relationships between mothers from rape and their children. She told me that some women consider pregnancy \u201canother trauma layered on top of the original trauma,\u201d but others don\u2019t, adding, \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily fit neatly into categories that score your political points.\u201dOn Facebook, Kiessling runs private support groups both for mothers who\u2019ve had children through rape and for children conceived in rape. She makes a point of keeping the two populations separate. \u201cIf there are some moms who say, \u2018I\u2019m struggling today\u2014my child got angry, and I felt like I could see the rapist in his face,\u2019 they need to have the freedom to say that,\u201d she said. The group for mothers has more than a hundred members, most of whom are pro-life. Kiessling told me that, in theory, she welcomes pro-choice members, but that she\u2019s seen pile-ons when mothers in the group express support for abortion. On the Web site of Save the 1, Kiessling features testimonials emphasizing the gift of motherhood even when it results from assault. \u201cMy sweet boy may have been conceived in rape, but he was carried with love,\u201d one entry, from a mother in Missouri, reads. Tyesha Ahmad, a thirty-four-year-old from Michigan, describes her child as \u201cmy beauty from ashes.\u201dOne morning at Kiessling\u2019s home, I met Ahmad, who belongs to the support group for mothers. A veteran of the Army Reserves, Ahmad alleges that she became pregnant, in 2014, after an ex-boyfriend\u2014also her former unit commander\u2014sexually assaulted her. She went through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a daughter in 2015. \u201cWhen she was born, I didn\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Ahmad told me. \u201cBecause this is my child, but this is also my permanent connection to him.\u201d (Her ex maintains that all their sexual encounters were consensual.) After Ahmad applied for public assistance, a DNA test confirmed that her ex was the father and he was ordered to pay child support. Soon afterward, he went to court and won visitation rights. The judge assigned to the case hadn\u2019t yet heard the rape allegation, and Ahmad, who is Black, with a round, youthful face, felt that he treated her as a \u201cbitter baby mama.\u201d Once, after she filed a motion requesting a list of modifications to her ex\u2019s parenting time, the judge called her a \u201cvery picky, picky, picky lady,\u201d adding that she and her ex were \u201cstuck with each other for the next fifteen years, until this girl becomes eighteen.\u201d Ahmad contacted Kiessling after seeing a news segment about Tiffany Gordon. Kiessling wasn\u2019t available to represent Ahmad but recommended that she request a special hearing under Michigan\u2019s Rape Survivor Child Custody Act legislation.Ahmad\u2019s romantic and professional history with her alleged abuser made the case especially thorny. At the hearing, which spanned two days last summer, her lawyer, Debra Kauten, presented testimony from a military investigator who\u2019d looked into a previous rape allegation that Ahmad had made against her ex. The investigator had found probable cause that the assault occurred, but Ahmad had stopped co\u00f6perating with the probe, saying that she feared professional repercussions. Her ex\u2019s attorney tried to paint her as vindictive and inconsistent, pointing out that, on the day of the alleged attack that left her pregnant, she\u2019d asked her ex for a ride home from the airport. Kauten noted that Ahmad had received a diagnosis of P.T.S.D. and was seeing three different therapists to cope with the mental toll of continued exposure to her alleged assailant. In the end, the judge found Ahmad to be the \u201cmore credible\u201d witness. In December, 2021, he ruled that there was clear and convincing evidence of rape and revoked her ex\u2019s parental rights.We sat on Kiessling\u2019s living-room couch, beneath decorative crosses emblazoned with the words \u201chope\u201d and \u201ctruth,\u201d and joined a video call with two other mothers from the Facebook support group. Both have young children who they say were conceived in rape, but neither has succeeded in challenging her alleged assailant\u2019s custody rights. One of the mothers wished to remain anonymous. The other, a California resident who asked to go by her middle name, Teresa, gave birth to fraternal twins after she was allegedly raped by a co-worker, in 2016, during a trip to Las Vegas. Her co-worker, who claims that the sex was consensual, now shares parenting time fifty-fifty. In California, terminating parental rights in cases of rape still requires a criminal conviction, but the Las Vegas detectives whom Teresa contacted told her that there was not \u201cenough probable cause to move the case forward.\u201d A package that she\u2019d sent to the police, containing a red dress that she believed was stained with her co-worker\u2019s semen, was returned unopened. During custody battles, complaints of domestic violence are often dismissed as mudslinging. After Teresa repeatedly tried to broach the rape during court proceedings, a judge chided her for conducting \u201cburdensome litigation\u201d and ordered her to pay almost five thousand dollars toward the father\u2019s legal fees.Even in states that have adopted the clear-and-convincing standard, victims face long odds. Lisae Jordan, the pro-choice advocate who worked on Maryland\u2019s legislation, told me, \u201cThere are so many cases where you\u2019re never going to be able to prove the rape occurred in a court of law.\u201d Moreover, the laws usually stipulate that a court may terminate a father\u2019s rights if it\u2019s in the best interest of the child, not that it must. Lucy Guarnera described the legislation in most states as \u201cvery short\u201d and \u201cvery vague,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen you are successful, it tends to be random.\u201d To Kiessling\u2019s knowledge, Ahmad is the only mother since Tiffany Gordon who has succeeded in using Michigan\u2019s clear-and-convincing standard to deny her alleged rapist custody.In an article published in the Georgetown Law Journal, in 2010, the pro-life attorney Shauna Prewitt blamed the weak protections on the abortion-rights movement and the medical establishment. Now an Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego, Prewitt conceived a daughter through an alleged rape in 2004, when she was a senior at the University of Chicago, and later fought the father for custody. In her view, pro-choice rhetoric positions abortion in cases of rape as \u201ca matter of necessity rather than of choice,\u201d ignoring the needs of those who choose to keep their children.The women on the support-group call echoed Prewitt\u2019s complaints. \u201cThe message should be \u2018Punish the rapist,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Teresa said. \u201cNot \u2018Abort! Abort! Abort! Or else you\u2019re going to have to share custody.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKiessling replied, \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that so many of you felt like you had a little angel to help keep you company during your trauma.\u201d She described children of rape, somewhat paradoxically, both as sources of healing and as lingering proof of their fathers\u2019 crimes. \u201cWe do the hashtag all the time: #RapistsLoveAbortion, because it destroys the evidence,\u201d she said.At the end of the call, Kiessling left the room and returned with a matching set of the placards that she often brings to pro-life protests. She told me that she finds signage plastered with grisly fetal imagery too painful to bear. Her own signs are hot pink or baby blue, and decorated with illustrations of dainty infant feet. She passed one to Ahmad. \u201cMOTHER FROM RAPE,\u201d it read in block letters. \u201cI LOVE MY CHILD.\u201d The second sign, which Kiessling usually carries herself, was a gift for Ahmad\u2019s daughter: \u201cCONCEIVED IN RAPE\u2014I LOVE MY LIFE.\u201dLast March, Kiessling travelled to Wyoming to testify in favor of a proposed state abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. \u201cThis trigger bill here is perfect,\u201d she told a committee of lawmakers, speaking from behind a long, polished table at the state capitol, in Cheyenne. As she often does, Kiessling cited the philosophy of fetal personhood and quoted the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal-protection clause, telling the legislators, \u201cExceptions are discriminatory.\u201d But the rest of her testimony was a raw personal plea. \u201cWhen you deny equal protection,\u201d she said, her voice breaking, \u201cyou\u2019re saying to someone like me, \u2018I think your mother should have been able to abort you. If I had my way, you\u2019d be dead right now.\u2019\u00a0\u201d At one point, she appealed to the committee\u2019s chairman, a Republican state senator who she\u2019d learned was a volunteer fireman. Would he refuse to save young burn victims just because they\u2019d be \u201ca horrible reminder to their parents\u201d?Kiessling had testified at the invitation of the bill\u2019s sponsor, a state representative named Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, who runs a crisis-pregnancy center in Cody, Wyoming. Their abortion ban passed handily in Wyoming\u2019s state senate, but, in a final review of the bill, a pro-choice Republican had proposed adding exceptions for the \u201cvery egregious circumstances\u201d of rape and incest. The amendment squeaked by, fifteen to fourteen, after one pro-life state senator was excused from the vote. Among the ayes was the volunteer fireman, who was apparently unswayed by Kiessling\u2019s direct entreaty.The following week, Rodriguez-Williams scheduled a video call with Kiessling to plan their next moves. Wyoming state law doesn\u2019t yet observe the clear-and-convincing standard, and Rodriguez-Williams wanted Kiessling\u2019s advice. Kiessling explained that, even with a criminal conviction, the existing law merely permits judges to terminate a rapist\u2019s parental rights. There was no guarantee.\u201cThat\u2019s not O.K.,\u201d Rodriguez-Williams said, scribbling notes.Kiessling, who was seated at her dining table, offered to testify again when a new bill was ready. \u201cI know you have a lot of men in your legislature who think that this just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said.Talk turned to the trigger bill, and Kiessling explained that she\u2019d challenged established rape exceptions before. \u201cWhat I need is local counsel,\u201d she said. In 2018, when the A.C.L.U. of Iowa sued the state to block a new \u201cheartbeat\u201d law, she intervened in the lawsuit, filing a motion to remove the exceptions. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting a target right upon us,\u201d she said at the time. The judge denied her request, calling it \u201cheartfelt\u201d but \u201clacking as grounds for intervention.\u201d Still, Kiessling told Rodriguez-Williams that a similar maneuver could be worth trying in Wyoming. \u201cOtherwise, everybody\u2019s just gonna say rape,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a secret passcode.\u201dAs a law student at Wayne State, in the early nineties, Kiessling converted to Catholicism and wrote a forty-three-page \u201cPhilosophical Abortion Essay.\u201d The paper, now posted on her Web site with a note warning students not to plagiarize, concludes, \u201cIt is an indisputable fact that an unborn child is a living human being since no human \u2018fetus\u2019 has ever been known to develop into a dolphin, a rabbit, or a carrot.\u201d At twenty-six, Kiessling started her own family-law practice in Oakland County, Michigan, and devised creative tactics to protect \u201cpreborn children\u201d in the community. She argued that a divorcing woman had the right to keep frozen embryos that her ex wanted destroyed (a judge disagreed), and offered free representation to pregnant clients who promised to keep their babies. In the summer of 1998, she read a news story about a seventeen-year-old in Alabama who\u2019d sought a court\u2019s permission to get an abortion without parental consent. The court had granted her request, but only after appointing a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the fetus.Kiessling was inspired by that case when she learned, soon afterward, of a twelve-year-old Michigan girl who\u2019d been impregnated by her older brother. By the time the girl\u2019s parents discovered the pregnancy, she was twenty-seven weeks along, past the cutoff for a legal abortion in the state. Instead, they made an appointment with George Tiller, a doctor in Wichita, Kansas, who specialized in late terminations. (A decade later, he was murdered by an anti-abortion extremist.) Before the family could go to the appointment, however, a judge blocked the girl from leaving the state, and prosecutors petitioned to investigate her parents for neglect. The case became a flash point for local pro-lifers, some of whom offered to foot the bill for an early delivery or to adopt the baby themselves. Kiessling, then working under her maiden name, Rebecca Wasser, filed a motion to appoint herself guardian ad litem of the fetus and said she\u2019d found a doctor who was willing to deliver the baby that day, two months premature. Lauren Tomayko, a lawyer for the girl\u2019s parents, told me, \u201cShe was a zealot. There\u2019s no other way to put it.\u201d The judge refused to consider Kiessling\u2019s motion and cleared the way for the abortion to proceed.Kiessling often cites the work of David\u00a0C. Reardon, a pro-life author known for touting the unproved malady of \u201cpost-abortion syndrome.\u201d In his 1996 book, \u201cMaking Abortion Rare,\u201d he wrote, \u201cWe must change the abortion debate so that we are arguing with our opponents on their own turf, the issue of defending the interests of women.\u201d Like Reardon, who has described abortion as a \u201cpainful intrusion into a woman\u2019s sexual organs by a masked stranger,\u201d Kiessling casts the procedure as a form of brutality. She told me, of the twelve-year-old girl, \u201cMore violence in the place where she was violated isn\u2019t going to help her heal.\u201d I asked Kiessling whether she might also have been acting out of a sense of identification with the girl\u2019s fetus, or a primal feeling of rejection stemming from her own mother\u2019s abortion attempts. Kiessling wasn\u2019t surprised by the suggestion. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years: \u2018All she cares about is her\u2014like the world wouldn\u2019t revolve without her in it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she told me. \u201cThe most selfish thing to do would be to say, \u2018Oh, at least my life was spared. Too bad for the rest.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBefore Kiessling gave birth to her biological daughters, whom she has referred to as \u201csecond-generation abortion survivors,\u201d she felt called to adoption, which she sees as another way of standing up for stigmatized children. She adopted three children, all of whom had tragically short lives. Her sons, a pair of biological half brothers named Caleb and Kyler, died of fentanyl poisoning in 2020, after taking pills from the same tainted batch. When Kiessling gives speeches, she often invokes their names alongside that of her late daughter, Cassie, whom she adopted at birth, in 2000. She\u2019d met the biological mother at a crisis-pregnancy center, and according to Kiessling an amniocentesis had been normal. But Cassie was born with the genetic disorder DiGeorge syndrome and died after thirty-three days.In a ninety-minute autobiographical film from 2008, \u201cConceived in Rape: From Worthless to Priceless,\u201d Kiessling recounts Cassie\u2019s story from an empty nursery, with a pastel-colored Teddy bear clasped to her stomach. She recalls that, when she first researched her daughter\u2019s condition, \u201call I kept finding was how you could detect it in utero so that you could have the opportunity to abort.\u201d Cassie had severe physical anomalies, including a hole in her heart, and went into cardiac arrest after leaving the NICU. Kiessling often describes fighting to keep resuscitating the baby against doctors\u2019 advice, even after she\u2019d suffered extensive brain damage. In the film, Kiessling speaks with a chilling sense of certainty that this was the moral course of action. She does a disdainful impression of a doctor telling her, \u201cYou have to consider what her \u2018quality of life\u2019 would be.\u201d Kiessling recalls responding, \u201cI don\u2019t care. We\u2019ll take care of her.\u201dOne afternoon in early June, I spoke over Zoom with Kiessling and Joann, her biological mother, who is eighty-four and lives near Detroit. They were sitting outside Joann\u2019s house in the shade of a yellow umbrella. In the years after her reunion with Joann, Kiessling distanced herself from her adoptive parents. Larry Wasser, whom I reached by phone, recalled that \u201cthings started to unravel\u201d when he and Kiessling discussed abortion. \u201cIt led to her throwing me out of her house one time because I was talking about women\u2019s rights, and she said, \u2018You want me killed? You want me dead?\u2019\u00a0\u201d In 2010, Kiessling had a judge issue Larry and Gail notices terminating their parental rights. (Gail has since died.) Joann and her current husband adopted Kiessling soon afterward. To celebrate, Kiessling threw herself a \u201cbaby shower,\u201d with pink balloons and a cake frosted with the message \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d\u201cI think you just folded the cat.\u201dCartoon by Mick StevensCopy link to cartoonCopy link to cartoonLink copiedShopShopFor a long time, Kiessling hoped to track down her birth father, a prospect that alarmed Joann. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she\u2019d really want to do that,\u201d Joann told me. A decade ago, Kiessling saw a television special about John Norman Collins, a.k.a. the Ypsilanti Ripper, who is believed to have raped and murdered a number of young women in southeastern Michigan in the late sixties. She says that she persuaded an attorney to have Collins take a DNA test in prison, where he\u2019s serving a life sentence for one of the killings, but that it wasn\u2019t a match. Later, after sending a saliva sample to Ancestry.com, Kiessling connected with a half brother, who she says described their father as abusive and advised her to attempt a meeting only if she was in public and accompanied by a man. Kiessling decided against it. \u201cOne day, when he dies, I will look in his casket, and that will be my closure,\u201d she told Joann. (Kiessling\u2019s half brother did not respond to requests for comment. Her father, reached by phone, hung up at the mention of her name.)Joann, a petite woman with cropped white hair, recalls very little about the man who attacked her. She\u2019d been walking to the store to buy milk. It was about ten o\u2019clock. The Tigers had just won the World Series, and ribbons of toilet paper still hung from the trees. \u201cHe cut my slacks I had on,\u201d Joann told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say much of anything. He said, \u2018Behave yourself.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The next morning, she burned her clothes. She was in the midst of divorcing her first husband, with whom she had a son and a daughter. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to support them, let alone another one,\u201d she said.At the time, abortion was illegal in Michigan, with no exceptions for rape or incest, under a state law dating to 1931. A friend of Joann\u2019s sister had got an underground abortion at an ob-gyn\u2019s office in Detroit, so Joann went there. \u201cThere was dried blood on the counter,\u201d she recalled. The doctor told her that she was too far along, but he referred her to another provider, who issued strict instructions. Joann was to wait, alone, in front of a statue of \u201cThe Thinker\u201d downtown. Then someone would drive her, blindfolded, to an undisclosed location. \u201cI had to have a sanitary napkin and a belt with me, and eight hundred dollars,\u201d she said. The night before the procedure, she backed out. \u201cAll I could think was it wouldn\u2019t go right, and somebody would find me in a ditch somewhere, and my ex-husband would get my two children.\u201d She gave birth on July\u00a022, 1969, and drove the newborn Kiessling to a foster home.Joann has mostly avoided participating in her daughter\u2019s media engagements. \u201cI don\u2019t want nobody coming after me,\u201d she said. But Kiessling has recounted her mother\u2019s story often, emphasizing that, like Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, Joann eventually had a pro-life awakening. In 2019, testifying in favor of Ohio\u2019s heartbeat law, Kiessling told legislators, \u201cToday, my birth mother and I are both thankful we were both protected by law from the horror of abortion.\u201dWhen I asked Joann about her views on abortion, though, she sounded conflicted. \u201cIt\u2019d probably be the best thing to do away with it, you know, altogether,\u201d she said. She paused, then added, \u201cI suppose, in certain cases, they\u2019d probably still be able to do it.\u201d\u201cLike \u2018life of the mother\u2019?\u201d Kiessling asked.\u201cYeah, like \u2018life of the mother.\u2019 I\u2019ve changed my mind along the way because I don\u2019t think abortion should be used as birth control. But there was one article where the baby was all deformed and had a bad heart.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d Joann trailed off. \u201cAnd some woman in that kind of case should have the right, because otherwise\u2014\u201d\u201cI disagree with you on that,\u201d Kiessling said with a pinched smile. \u201cThink about baby Cassie. You were just talking about her earlier, how beautiful she was.\u201d\u201cShe was, but she suffered,\u201d Joann replied.\u201cShe didn\u2019t suffer,\u201d Kiessling said. \u201cShe was loved.\u201d Kiessling shook her head and looked away. She seemed wounded, as though Joann\u2019s ambivalence about abortion called into question her maternal love. When I asked Joann what she made of rape exceptions, she answered without hesitation: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think for rape anymore, because Rebecca turned out to be a special person.\u201dKiessling and I were talking by phone on the morning of June 24th, when I noticed a news alert announcing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs. She had been planning to spend the weekend at a pro-life conference in Indiana, and she gasped when I told her of the decision: \u201cOh, my gosh!\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have the best celebration.\u201d Later that day, she spoke at an impromptu rally of anti-abortion activists outside the Michigan Hall of Justice, in Lansing. She was carrying one of her signs and wore a dress in a matching shade of pink. Gesturing toward her high heels, which were bedazzled with the words \u201cBAM!\u201d and \u201cPOW!,\u201d she told the crowd, \u201cYou\u2019re superheroes\u2014you save lives.\u201dBut Kiessling went on to call the victory \u201cbittersweet.\u201d Once Roe was overturned, pro-lifers in Michigan had hoped to see prosecutors enforce the old abortion ban. \u201cI literally owe my birth to that 1931 law,\u201d Kiessling said. In anticipation of Dobbs, though, Planned Parenthood of Michigan had sued to block the law\u2019s enforcement, resulting in a temporary injunction.A record number of states placed abortion measures on the ballot this year. In the first referendum of its kind since Dobbs, in August, Kansans overwhelmingly rejected a pro-life amendment to the state\u2019s constitution. In Michigan, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who was running for a second term, urged voters in the midterms to support Proposal 3, a measure to enshrine freedoms in the state\u2019s constitution, including \u201call decisions about pregnancy.\u201d Kiessling spent the fall touring Michigan to mobilize the opposition, giving speeches at prayer rallies and, outside one Detroit church, at a graveside vigil for what a tombstone called \u201cunborn babies murdered in the holocaust of abortion.\u201d But, as in every state facing ballot measures, voters in Michigan chose to protect access to the procedure. Whitmer won re\u00eblection, and Proposal 3 passed by a comfortable margin. Democrats also flipped both chambers of the state legislature, giving the Party complete control for the first time since 1983.The day after the elections, Kiessling wrote on Facebook that Michigan was set to become \u201cas bad as New York and California,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very dark, very evil, very ugly.\u201d For Kiessling, though, the success of Dobbs and the setback of the midterms are two wayposts in a struggle that will stretch on for as long as it needs to. \u201cChild sacrifice was going on since the days of antiquity,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a battle for life. It\u2019s gone on for thousands of years, and I think it\u2019s never gonna end.\u201d She spoke hopefully of a future, a few decades from now, when infants who have yet to be conceived will come of age to discover that post-Dobbs abortion bans protected them, just as the Michigan law protected her. Their mothers may not have wanted to give birth, but they will love their babies in the end. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be hard to deny this whole generation of children who will be born,\u201d Kiessling said. She added, \u201cYou can\u2019t deny a person\u2019s life.
