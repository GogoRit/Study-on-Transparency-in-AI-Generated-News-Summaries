Wade if she joins the nation's highest court.\nA recently uncovered ad from 2006 signed by the now-nominee may give pro-choice activists more reason to fear for the future of Roe should the senate approve Barrett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination.\u00a0\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nSupreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett signed her name to a 2006 ad that claimed life starts at fertilization, according to a report from The Guardian\n\nThe report is sure to fuel concerns of pro-choice activists that Roe v. Wade will be in jeopardy should Barrett be confirmed to the court\n\nThe ad came from the St. Joseph County Right to Life and encouraged viewers to \"pray to end abortion\"\n\nBarrett has previously said that her personal views will have \"no bearing\" on her judicial decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong before Trump appointed her to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, Barrett reportedly allowed her name to appear underneath an ad in the South Bend Tribune in support of anti-choice group St. Joseph County Right to Life, according to a report from The Guardian. The ad reportedly read in part: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion for any reason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the ad continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAccording to The Guardian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report, the ad also contained language stating that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscarding of unused or frozen embryos created in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process ought to be criminalized.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBarrett and her husband Jesse were reportedly among the signatures below the ad.\u00a0\nAt the time, Barrett was serving as a law professor at Notre Dame.\u00a0\nThe ad is likely to fuel the concerns of pro-choice activists that Barrett could aid in overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision from 1973 that protects a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government interference.\u00a0\nWhile Barrett has maintained that her personal beliefs will have \u00e2\u0080\u009cno bearing\u00e2\u0080\u009d on her decisions should she be nominated to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest court, her judicial record tells a conflicting story: Several of her past academic writings suggest she might be open to overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAs a judge, Barrett has reviewed two abortion cases, where she joined the dissenting opinion in both instances and called for tighter restrictions on abortion access.\u00a0\nIn Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc., in which the court voted to block an Indiana law that would have required doctors notify parents if a minor sought an abortion, Barrett joined a dissent saying that law should have been allowed to go into effect.\u00a0\nIn Commissioner of the Indiana State Department of Health v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc., the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately declined to re-hear the case, which involved an Indiana law that would have banned abortions on the basis of sex, race, or disability.\u00a0\nBarrett called for the case to be reheard.\nAlternatively, Barrett said that she believes the Supreme Court will not overturn Roe during a discussion at Jacksonville University in 2016. At the time, Barrett said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe core case, Roe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core holding that women have a right to an abortion, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that would change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, you know, how many restrictions can be put on clinics, I think that will change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nNotably, Barrett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal mentor was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who was famous for his frequent and blistering dissents on abortion cases.\u00a0\nIn one instance, Scalia delivered a scathing dissent in Stenberg v. Carhart, a 2000 Supreme Court case that declared Nebraska\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ban on the so-called \"partial birth\" abortions is unconstitutional.\n\"I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scalia wrote in part. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe method of killing a human child \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one cannot even accurately say an entirely unborn human child \u00e2\u0080\u0094 proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSpeaking at the White House during her nomination ceremony, Barrett said of Scalia: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis judicial philosophy is mine too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cJudges are not policymakers and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDuring Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential debate, President Trump tried to downplay the possibility that Roe v. Wade could be overturned should Barrett be appointed. When former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that overturning Roe v. Wade is \u00e2\u0080\u009con the ballot\u00e2\u0080\u009d due to Barrett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential confirmation, Trump immediately pushed back.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not on the ballot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump interjected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing happening there. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know (Barrett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) view on Roe v. Wade.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut other Republicans seem to have made up their mind on Barrett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and many like what they see.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think her record\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awfully clear. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one where she meets my standard of having evidence in the record, out there in public, on the record that indicates that she understands Roe was really an act of judicial imperialism and wrongly decided,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Missouri Senator Tom Hawley said on Tuesday, just hours before the presidential debate.\u00a0\nAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the president has promised to appoint justices who will uphold conservative values, even explicitly stating he would choose \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro-life\u00e2\u0080\u009d candidates.\u00a0\n\"That will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court,\" Trump said of overturning Roe v. Wade during a 2016 presidential debate. \"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            Contact\n        \n\n\n\n            About\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            Sitemap\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n            CERTIFICATIONS\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
