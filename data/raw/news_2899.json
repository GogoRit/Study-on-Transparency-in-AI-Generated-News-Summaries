The defect is known as Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, in which a right heart valve sits lower than normal. In past legal proceedings, officials with Cook Children's said the condition makes it difficult for her heart to pump properly and causes blood to flow backward through the heart. Her lungs were also underdeveloped, which is common in premature births.\nLawyers for the hospital\u00a0said in court documents\u00a0in 2020 that Tinslee\u2019s body had become stiff because she was unable to move and that her brain functions were permanently impaired because of her treatment.\nHer mother, Trinity Lewis, announced that the child had returned home on social media on Tuesday.\n\n\nGet DFW local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox.

The hospital said it went to \"extreme\" lengths to keep her alive. While in the hospital, Tinslee was breathing with the assistance of a ventilator and was sedated but conscious.\nKimberlyn Schwartz is the Director of Media and Communication for Texas Right to Life, a pro-life organization that has been advocating for Tinslee and her family for the past nearly three years.\n\"It\u2019s just so surreal to be at this point. Whenever we first got her case in 2019, I don\u2019t think any of us knew that it would end in victory like this. We always knew there was a chance this could go south,\" Schwartz said. \"This shows that whenever fight for life, we can win. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve been so blessed to be part of Tinslee\u2019s life. She is such a fighter, and I can\u2019t wait to see what she does going forward.\"\nSchwartz, whose organization provided attorneys for Tinslee's family, said the now three-year-old is using a portable ventilator. Tinslee still has appointments with doctors along with home healthcare and respiratory therapists, she said.\nTheir fight isn't over, Schwartz said Wednesday.\n\"Our goal was to immediately save her life. We sought attorneys to try to win her a temporary restraining order that would prevent this 10-day rule from prematurely ending her life,\" she said.\nThe \"10-day rule\" gives families 10 days to find a new hospital if they disagree with doctors who decide to take a patient off life support. \n\"We want the court to see that Tinslee was saved. Tinslee is a success story. We need to protect more patients like her,\" Schwartz said.\nIn the Facebook post announcing Tinslee's return home, her mother thanked her lawyers as well as Cook Children's Medical Center. A statement from the medical center was sent to NBC 5:\n\u201cThe medical teams at Cook Children\u2019s have dedicated their lives to healing children, and go to tireless lengths to do what they believe in their hearts and minds to be the very best decision for each and every patient.\u201d - Cook Children\u2019s Health Care System\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under:\nTinslee LewisFort WorthCook Children's Medical Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTrending Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFort Worth\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFort Worth's Panther Island to become a mixed-use waterfront district, plan shows\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDallas\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shoots her 80-year-old grandmother in the head, Dallas Police say\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething good\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFort Worth vet participates in world renowned Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLewisville\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRare parrot flies the coop in Lewisville\u2026 again\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprosper\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u2018Please come back home': Family, Police search for missing man, Lexus SUV last seen in Prosper\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWeather Forecast\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nOur News Standards\nNewsletters\nTV Listings\nSubmit Photos or Video\nKXAS Public Inspection File\nKXAS Accessibility\nKXAS Employment Information\nFCC Applications\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Privacy Choices\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nAdvertise with us\nSend Feedback\nCA Notice\nAd Choices\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.
