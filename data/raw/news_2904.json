ADF attorneys, along with counsel at The Smith Appellate Law Firm and Smith Haughey Rice & Roegge, filed the brief on behalf of Right to Life of Michigan and the Michigan Catholic Conference.\n\nThe brief was filed in\u00a0Planned Parenthood of Michigan v. Attorney General of the State of Michigan, a case in which Planned Parenthood and Attorney General Dana Nessel are apparently working together to invalidate a 1931 state law that protects unborn lives. The lawsuit\u2019s premise is that the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0might\u00a0overturn\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0later this year.\n\n\u201cMichigan\u2019s elected officials have a duty to uphold the law and protect all their citizens, including the innocent lives of unborn children,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel and Vice President of Appellate Advocacy John Bursch. \u201cYet what we\u2019re seeing is the state\u2019s top attorney engaged in an unacceptable effort to attack a pro-life law that has existed peaceably with the state constitution for more than half a century. We urge the court to swiftly dismiss this case because it not only lacks jurisdiction\u2014both sides of the case are arguing for the exact same outcome\u2014but also because it is based on a hypothetical situation. No matter how someone feels about abortion, they should be gravely concerned that Michigan\u2019s attorney general refuses to defend a validly enacted and longstanding law.\u201d\n\nThe brief also explains that the presiding judge should recuse herself because this case was brought by Planned Parenthood, represented by the ACLU, to invalidate all of Michigan\u2019s pro-life laws, and the judge previously worked as an ACLU attorney, litigating cases on behalf of Planned Parenthood and its allies, seeking to invalidate Michigan\u2019s pro-life laws. The judge has received an award from Planned Parenthood and makes annual contributions to Planned Parenthood of Michigan.\n\n\u201cGiven her long history of working with the ACLU in support of Planned Parenthood and its collaborators on substantially similar matters \u2026 and the fact that her charitable contributions are effectively helping fund this litigation, there can be no doubt that this conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge\u2019s ability to oversee this case with impartiality has been compromised,\u201d requiring recusal, the brief summarized.\n\nThe brief continues: \u201cIf the presiding judge declines to recuse and further declines to dismiss an unripe case that lacks adverse parties, the People of Michigan will reasonably ask whether the Michigan judiciary really serves as an independent arbiter of justice or is instead merely a tool for parties to obtain political goals they have been unable to achieve through ordinary, democratic processes.\u201d\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building, non-profit legal organization committed to protecting religious freedom, free speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life.\n# # #\n\n\n\n\nRelated Press Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 27th, 2022\n\n\n\nMichigan groups seek to intervene in defense of state's pro-life law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 1st, 2022\n\n\n\nMichigan pro-life groups, county prosecutors take legal battle to state's high court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1st, 2022\n\n\n\nMI Court of Appeals confirms county prosecutors have full authority to enforce state's pro-life law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 20th, 2022\n\n\n\nComplaint asks MI appeals court to stop runaway lower court decision in pro-life law case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Profiles\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Bursch\n      \n\n        Senior Counsel, Vice President of Appellate Advocacy\n      \n\n        John Bursch is senior counsel and vice president of appellate advocacy with Alliance Defending Freedom.\r\n\n      \n\n\n          View Profile \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
