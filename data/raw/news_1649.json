Wade was overturned.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nKentucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supreme Court on Thursday refused to allow abortions to resume in the state, rejecting a request to halt enforcement of a near-total ban on abortion\n\nThe court, which was weighing challenges to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near-total ban and a separate one that outlaws abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, sent the case back to a lower court for further consideration of constitutional issues related to one of the bans\n\nThe court weighed in on the issue after Kentucky voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion\n\nKentucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near-total trigger law ban was passed in 2019 and took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court, which was weighing challenges to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near-total ban and a separate one that outlaws abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, sent the case back to a lower court for further consideration of constitutional issues related to one of the bans.\nThe court weighed in on the issue after Kentucky voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion. The Republican-led Legislature passed both of those laws.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be clear, this opinion does not in any way determine whether the Kentucky Constitution protects or does not protect the right to receive an abortion, as no appropriate party to raise that issue is before us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deputy Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing in this opinion shall be construed to prevent an appropriate party from filing suit at a later date.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe challenges revolve around the state's near-total trigger law ban and the separate six-week ban. The trigger law was passed in 2019 and took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It bans abortions except when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re carried out to save the life of the mother or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.\nAttorney General Daniel Cameron's office released a statement shortly after the ruling broke, expressing pleasure that the high court allowed the abortion restrictions to remain in place. \"This is a significant victory, and we will continue to stand up for the unborn by defending these laws,\" Cameron said.\nIn July, Louisville judge Mitch Perry halted enforcement of the new bans because he found that they likely violated the state constitution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights to privacy and self-determination. He said it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role to determine whether the state constitution guarantees the right to abortion, but it is its role to decide whether the new bans violate constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.\nBut the state Court of Appeals reinstated enforcement of the bans and the state Supreme Court opted in August to keep them in place while it reviewed the case.\nOn Thursday, the high court ruled that the two Louisville abortion providers that challenged the near-total and six-week bans on the argument that they violated patients' constitutional rights lacked the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird-party standing\" to do so.\nLambert, though, wrote that the abortion providers have \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst-party\u00e2\u0080\u009d constitutional standing to challenge the trigger ban, specifically. As a result, the justices sent that part of the case back to the circuit court in Louisville to review the plaintiffs' claims that the trigger ban violated the state constitution.\nAddia Wuchner, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life, was attending a rally for Faith and Family Day steps away from\u00a0the Kentucky Supreme Court when the court released its ruling.\u00a0\n\"We are elated in the ruling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \"We still have work to do, but for\u00a0right now, the\u00a0facilities in Kentucky remain closed. We are at day 198 without effectively having abortions taking place here in the commonwealth of Kentucky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nThe ACLU of Kentucky expressed \"extreme disappointment\" with the Kentucky Supreme Court's latest ruling.\n\"Once again, the Kentucky Supreme Court failed to protect the health and safety of nearly a million people in the state,\" leaders from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU said in a statement. \"Even after Kentuckians overwhelmingly voted against an anti-abortion ballot measure, abortion remains banned in the state.\"\nAngela Cooper, communications director of ACLU of Kentucky, added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately, it does mean that abortion care cannot resume in the state of Kentucky at this time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cooper. \"However, the ruling was very clear in that it was not a decision on whether the constitution does or does not protect the right to an abortion in Kentucky so that argument is\u00a0still on the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nThirteen states have current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, including Wisconsin, where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a legal question over which law is in effect but where clinics have shut down. Bans and tight restrictions are currently on hold because of court action in at least six states.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nBill that would raise abortion to homicide draws swift pushback from GOP, anti-abortion group\n\nKentucky voters reject Amendment 2, leaving future of abortion in limbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n            Spectrum News App\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
