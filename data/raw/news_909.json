They also are not happy with the new abortion bill passed in the state House of Representatives last week. The acceptance of legal sports gambling is growing, and a majority said they favored the legalization of marijuana for personal use.Recommended VideosFlorida\u2019s House of Representatives passed a bill last week banning abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, with narrow exceptions to protect the life of the mother and for fetal abnormalities. Respondents were asked whether they support or oppose this bill being passed into law, and the sample was split between two different ways of framing the question. Half of respondents were asked whether they support or oppose the bill effectively banning abortions after fifteen weeks. The other half received the same question but with the added information that it does not include exceptions for rape or incest. In both samples, the majority of respondents (57%) opposed the bill either strongly or somewhat, with 34% supporting either somewhat or strongly. Opposition was five percentage points stronger among those respondents who received the full question, at 60%, compared to 55% who received the shorter version.\u201cOpposition to the abortion ban was five points higher with the \u2018no exceptions\u2019 version, but the fact that the responses weren\u2019t terribly different speaks to the highly partisan and emotional nature of the abortion debate,\u201d commented Dr. Michael Binder, PORL faculty director and UNF professor of political science. \u201cPeople tend to know where they stand on the issue and question wording doesn\u2019t change very many peoples\u2019 minds.\u201dRespondents were asked about another recently passed bill in the Florida State Senate that would prohibit school districts from encouraging discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in grades Kindergarten through 5, or in a way that is deemed age or developmentally inappropriate. The total sample showed overall opposition to the passage of the bill, with 49% opposing and 40% supporting either somewhat or strongly.\u201cSupport for the so-called \u2018Don\u2019t Say Gay\u2019 bill is only about 40%, despite it being passed in the State Senate last week,\u201d said Binder. \u201cWhen we break it down by party registration, we see 54% of Republicans supporting the bill, which is more in line with Florida\u2019s Republican controlled legislature.\u201dIn addition, respondents were asked about a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution that would require school board candidates to run in partisan elections. Currently, district school board elections in Florida are nonpartisan, meaning candidates are not associated with a political party. Forty-nine percent of respondents indicated they oppose the passage of this amendment either strongly or somewhat, with 32% supporting. Sixteen percent of respondents said they don\u2019t know.\u201cOften very little information is available for down ballot candidates\u2014school board races in particular\u2014and simply adding a party identifier will increase the partisan voting in those races,\u201d Binder commented. \u201cThe amendment has pretty weak support among survey respondents at just over 30%, which seems to indicate Florida voters want to keep politics out of the education system.\u201dIn another split-sample question, respondents were asked whether they support or oppose legalizing sports and event betting for individuals age 21 or over at professional sports venues or online betting platforms. Half of the total sample received just this wording, while the other half were asked their support if tax revenue would go toward education in Florida. In the first version, without the education stipulation, 50% of respondents said they support sports betting either somewhat or strongly, with 35% opposing. When the education language was added, support jumped 10 percentage points to 60%, with just 28% opposing.\u201cThe stark differences in the two versions of the question shows just how important wording can be when it comes to public opinion,\u201d Binder noted. \u201cIf people see a benefit for the state, such as increased funding for education, they\u2019re more likely to support a variety of policies. One of the big reasons lotteries were legalized at the state level in the first place was that a large chunk of those revenues went toward education and online gambling supporters are simply following in those footsteps.\u201dRespondents were also asked whether they support or oppose allowing adults in Florida to legally possess small amounts of marijuana for recreational use. The overwhelming majority (76%) said they support the idea either somewhat or strongly, with just 20% opposing. Support for recreational marijuana has increased by 12 percentage points since November of 2019, when 64% of respondents said they support it strongly or somewhat.\u201cPrevious polls we conducted have shown support in the mid-60s for marijuana legalization but Floridians are now highly supportive of recreational marijuana,\u201d noted Binder.Respondents were also asked if they believe that politicians and elected officials should be required to publicly disclose their COVID-19 vaccination status, to which 58% said no, 38% said yes, and 3% said they don\u2019t know.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much support for mandatory disclosure of vaccination status, which isn\u2019t too shocking considering the lack of statewide COVID restrictions,\u201d commented Binder.In addition, survey respondents were asked what they think is the most important problem facing Florida. The most frequent response was the economy, jobs and unemployment, with 21% of respondents indicating it is the most important problem. This was followed by immigration with 14%, education with 12%, and COVID-19 with 11%. Respondents were also given the opportunity to write in \u201cother\u201d issues, a few of which were then recoded into additional categories. Among these issues were politics and politicians with 4%, and housing costs with 2%.\u201cFolks seem to be more worried about jobs and unemployment than the last time we asked this question, at just 9% in February of 2020,\u201d Binder noted. \u201cBack then the most important issue was healthcare, which has dropped seventh place this year. Affordable housing and politics seem to be emerging as two issue areas of concern.\u201d\nCopyright 2022 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.Click here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.TV ListingsContact UsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionCareers at WJXT / WCWJTerms of UseWJXT Public FileWCWJ Public FileFCC ApplicationsPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoCookie PreferencesFollow UsyoutubefacebookinstagramtwitterrssGet Results with OmneFor assistance with WJXT\u2019s or WCWJ's FCC public inspection file, call (904) 393-9801.Copyright \u00a9 2024 News4JAX.com is managed by Graham Digital and published by Graham Media Group, a division of Graham Holdings."
