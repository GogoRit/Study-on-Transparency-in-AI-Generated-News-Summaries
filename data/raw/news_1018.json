7, 2022.\n\nRogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Abortion services have stopped in Mississippi and Louisiana now that so-called trigger laws enacted by the states are in effect following the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n    \n\n            Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, has been forced to close its doors this week after the state\u2019s ban took effect Thursday. And in Louisiana, an Orleans Parish Civil District Court judge on Friday lifted a temporary restraining order, allowing the state to enforce its near-total ban on the procedure there.  \n    \n\n            The moves underscore the struggle over abortion access at the state level. Legal fights over abortion bans and other laws that greatly limit the procedure are underway in more than a dozen states, as Americans navigate rapidly changing laws and court developments in a post-Roe era.\n    \n\n    \u2018This was a very busy clinic\u2019\n\n\n            Known as the \u201cPink House\u201d for operating out of a pink stucco building, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization had provided abortion services for decades and was the provider that had brought the lawsuit against Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, which led to the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last month.\n    \n\n            Mississippi\u2019s trigger ban, enacted in 2007, prohibits abortions in the state with only exceptions in cases of rape or to preserve the life of the pregnant person. It took effect Thursday after a Mississippi judge earlier in the week denied a motion by the clinic to block the law. \n    \n\n            Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u2019s owner Diane Derzis told CNN that the clinic saw 69 patients on Wednesday and did procedures through the day until they had to close, with some follow-up appointments on Thursday.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gather to protest against the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health case on June 24, 2022, in Austin, Texas.\n\nMaggie Boyd/Sipa/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhere state abortion bans stand amid legal challenges\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cThis was always a very busy clinic. So we realize the numbers of women who are going to be left in the lurch and will have to travel out of state, or continue a pregnancy, or do something themselves. It\u2019s the latter that worries you more than anything else. Because there\u2019s definitely desperation,\u201d Derzis told CNN. \n    \n\n            Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization referred more than 100 patients to its Columbus clinic in the last two days, according to Derzis.\n    \n\n            She said they had begun packing Friday to move to a new clinic in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where she expects they will be opened by next week.\n    \n\n            \u201cPeople should see what has been wrought here with this ruling and how it\u2019s going to affect women, children and their families in this country. This is an outrage in 2022 that women are forced to skulk out of state into another state to receive medical care. It\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d Derzis told CNN. \n    \n\n            The clinic has appealed to the state\u2019s Supreme Court.\n    \n\n            \u201cMississippians still have a separate and independent right to privacy under the Mississippi Constitution that the Mississippi Supreme Court held encompasses a right to abortion,\u201d Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization argued in the lawsuit filed last month.\n    \n\n    \u2018This case is by no means over\u2019\n\n\n            During a court hearing in Louisiana on Friday, Judge Ethel S. Julien lifted the temporary block on a restrictive abortion ban in the state, clearing the way for the state\u2019s trigger law to immediately take effect and blocking abortion clinics in the state from operating. \n    \n\n            Last month, a Louisiana state court blocked the state\u2019s trigger law from being enforced by issuing a temporary restraining order. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry appealed, asking the state Supreme Court to dissolve the lower court\u2019s order. The court denied that appeal and kicked it back to the lower courts for a hearing. \n    \n\n            Julien on Friday agreed with the state, that the challenge against the state\u2019s abortion laws should be brought in a Baton Rouge state court, instead of New Orleans, Walt Pierce, the court\u2019s public information officer told CNN.   \n    \n\n            Abortion providers then asked the judge to continue the temporary restraining order while the case was being transferred to the 19th Judicial District Court. After retiring to her chambers to study the request, Julien ruled she did not have the authority to extend the temporary restraining order, citing her earlier ruling that New Orleans was not the proper venue for the case, Pierce told CNN.   \n    \n\n            The challenge to the law by abortion providers will now be transferred to the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge.   \n    \n\n            \u201cToday the judge got it right,\u201d Landry said during a news conference after the hearing, adding, \u201cWe certainly intend to continue to defend the laws of the state and to enforce the laws.\u201d\n    \n\n            The Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the litigators in the case, said it plans to \u201cask the new court in Baton Rouge to block the bans again as soon as possible.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cToday\u2019s ruling was on a technicality, and did not touch the merits of this case. I am personally devastated for patients in Louisiana  who are now panicking trying to figure out how to get care. But to be clear, this case is by no means over,\u201d Jenny Ma, the group\u2019s senior staff attorney, said in a statement Friday.\n    \n\n            \u201cSince Roe fell last month, abortion services have ceased in nine other states, and that number is continuing to grow. With every state that bans abortion, the distance patients in the south have to travel grows exponentially. So losing access in Louisiana, even for a day, is contributing to a growing health crisis not only for people in Louisiana but across the south.\u201d\n    \n\n    Texas\u2019 largest independent abortion provider closes clinics\n\n\n            Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization isn\u2019t the only southern abortion provider moving its operation.\n    \n\n            While abortion is effectively banned in Texas with very limited exceptions following the high court decision, abortion is legal in New Mexico.\n    \n\n            Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the largest independent abortion provider in Texas, announced on Wednesday that it is closing four clinics in Texas and is seeking a clinic site at a New Mexico border city to provide first and second trimester abortions.\n    \n\n            Abortions up to around six weeks into pregnancy had been allowed to resume in Texas after a state court issued a temporary restraining order against the state\u2019s nearly century-old abortion ban. But late last Friday, the Texas Supreme Court paved the way for Texas\u2019 pre-Roe abortion ban to be civilly enforced, prompting the clinics to again cease providing abortion services.\n    \n\n            The state\u2019s trigger law also goes into effect in the next few weeks.\n    \n\n            Other clinics in the state, such as Planned Parenthood\u2019s three Texas affiliates, Houston Women\u2019s Clinic and Houston Women\u2019s Reproductive Services, have said they are unable to provide abortion care in the wake of Roe being overturned. \n    \n\nCNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed and
