They conceived easily \u2014 just as they had the first time around \u2014 but then Bindeman miscarried. That reframed her thinking around pregnancy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just, you get pregnant and have a baby, which had been my first experience,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, you can get pregnant and not have a baby, and that can happen really early.\u201d\nThe couple decided to try again. Bindeman was anxious during the first trimester, bracing for another miscarriage. But that didn\u2019t happen, and things seemed to be proceeding well. Then, at the 20-week mark, they received devastating news after a routine ultrasound: The fetus\u2019s brain was not developing properly. If the fetus were to survive to term, it would never develop beyond a 2-month-old \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be able to walk, talk, or feed itself. \u201cOur lives completely turned upside down,\u201d Bindeman said.\nAfter much conversation and reflection, and after consulting with their doctor, rabbi, and family, the Bindemans decided that they would terminate the pregnancy. Even though the couple lives in Maryland, which has scant restrictions on abortion and a relative wealth of providers, the Bindemans faced obstacles.\nJust weeks earlier, in the spring of 2009, Dr. George Tiller, a world-renowned abortion provider based in Kansas who specialized in the type of later-term abortion that Julie Bindeman would need, had been assassinated in a church by an anti-abortion extremist. The killing sent a chill through providers across the nation. As a result, the closest abortion provider the Bindemans could find was in New Jersey, meaning that\u00a0Julie would have to travel hundreds of miles to a state where she knew no one. That was unsettling, so in the end,\u00a0she was forced to terminate her pregnancy in a local hospital via induced labor and delivery as opposed to the dilation and extraction method, which is safer, performed in a clinic, and used in 95 percent of later-term abortions.\nIt was a painful and traumatic experience that took several days, and yet Bindeman still understood that she was fortunate: She had resources and connections and, even though Tiller\u2019s murder had spooked local providers, she still lived in a state that respected her right to decide whether or not to continue her pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad Bindeman been living in another state \u2014 like Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Missouri, or Alabama, among others \u2014 not only would she have had to deal with the emotional and physical pain of losing a wanted pregnancy, but she would also have been forced to navigate a hostile legal landscape rife with the kinds of abortion restrictions that have proliferated across a large swath of the country, including arbitrary waiting periods, coercive counseling requirements, and, importantly, gestational abortion bans at 20 weeks \u2014 or even earlier.\nAnd, if the state of Louisiana gets its way in a lawsuit currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, women in Bindeman\u2019s position living in hostile states could have an extra burden to carry: In order to get access to the abortion services they need, they may personally have to challenge those restrictions in court.\nLouisiana\u2019s suit, which the court will consider during oral arguments on March 4, threatens not only to undo decades of precedent allowing abortion providers to mount legal challenges on behalf of their prospective patients, but also dismantle a century of precedent in other kinds of cases\u00a0in which plaintiffs similarly seek to vindicate the rights of third parties.\nIt is the latest salvo in the ongoing effort of anti-abortion\u00a0lawmakers to erode reproductive rights. Without ever ruling on the constitutionality of any particular abortion restriction, the Supreme Court, by ruling in favor of Louisiana, could make it practically impossible to challenge states\u2019 increasingly draconian and punitive restrictions on abortion and ultimately eviscerate reproductive autonomy.\nTo Bindeman, the notion that she would have been able to navigate the legal system in order to gain her right to an abortion while simultaneously dealing with her medical circumstances is absurd. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the emotional or cognitive wherewithal; I was grieving,\u201d Bindeman said. \u201cIt would have been too much to try to bring the challenge myself.\u201d\nDouble Trouble in Louisiana\nWhen the Supreme Court convenes on March 4, it will actually be considering two abortion-related challenges arising out of Louisiana. The first, known as June Medical Services LLC et al. v. Gee, is the kind of case that has become all too familiar. The Center for Reproductive Rights is representing a handful of Louisiana providers on behalf of themselves and their patients challenging a 2014 state law that requires all abortion doctors to have hospital-admitting privileges within 30 miles of clinics where they provide services. Abortion is a supremely safe procedure and rarely produces the kind of medical complications that necessitate a hospital stay, which is in part why it is so difficult for abortion doctors to obtain hospital privileges unless they have a broader area of practice. Only one Louisiana abortion provider has admitting privileges.\nThe Louisiana law is identical to one passed the previous year in Texas that was partly responsible for the closure of half the state\u2019s abortion clinics \u2014 a consequence that Louisiana lawmakers clearly understood. In an email to the Louisiana bill\u2019s sponsor, an anti-abortion activist noted that Texas\u2019s admitting privileges law had \u201ctremendous success\u201d in closing clinics and restricting access to health care.\nIn upholding abortion rights, the Supreme Court has allowed leeway for states to pass laws that serve to restrict access in various ways, including when a restriction has some legitimate health benefit for women. After the Center for Reproductive Rights sued Texas on behalf of providers and patients, the state argued that the admitting privileges were necessary to protect women and provide continuity of care in the event that something should go wrong \u2014 among the same arguments Louisiana subsequently made in defending its law.\nThe federal district court in Texas disagreed with the state, finding that there was no health benefit and the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortion. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, teeing up the case before the Supreme Court. In 2016, the court reversed the 5th Circuit, deciding in a landmark 5-4 opinion in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt that the law was unconstitutional.\nFollowing that opinion, the district court in Louisiana made similar findings in striking down the state\u2019s admitting privileges law. And despite the Supreme Court\u2019s clear mandate in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the 5th Circuit again disagreed with the lower court and upheld Louisiana\u2019s law \u2014 thus pitching to the Supreme Court the exact question it had resolved a few years earlier.\nWithout saying much at all on the issue of admitting privileges or the underlying right to abortion, the court could nonetheless do devastating damage.\nIn the interim, just one thing has changed: There are two new white male judges on the Supreme Court to solidify a conservative majority. The fact that the court is now potentially reconsidering Whole Woman\u2019s Health makes many people nervous that it may take the opportunity to do additional damage, including by revisiting Roe v. Wade, as a contingent of more than 200 conservative members of Congress has encouraged.\nBut without saying much at all on the issue of admitting privileges or the underlying right to abortion, the court could nonetheless do devastating and lasting damage to reproductive rights in the way that it decides the second Louisiana case: a counter-petition filed by the state, Gee v. June Medical Services LLC et al., which attacks a longstanding legal doctrine that allows plaintiffs to assert the rights of a third party that would otherwise face an impediment to vindicating their own rights.\nIn abortion-related litigation, this has been accepted practice for nearly 50 years, since individual women, such as Julie Bindeman, have a right to access abortion but lack a meaningful ability to assert that right in court \u2014 or a means to have that right upheld in a timely way. The Louisiana admitting privileges lawsuit, for example, has been pending for more than five years.\nIn order to assert the rights of others, a plaintiff must personally face injury from the regulation at issue and have a relationship with the third party. There also needs to be some obstacle to the third party raising its own rights. The courts have long held \u2014 including in Whole Woman\u2019s Health \u2014 that abortion providers satisfy these three conditions when challenging state abortion restrictions.\nBut now, in briefs filed with the Supreme Court, Louisiana is arguing that the courts have granted standing to abortion providers based on \u201cunexamined assumptions\u201d that should be \u201cabandoned.\u201d They argue that abortion providers don\u2019t have a sufficiently close relationship with their patients \u2014 as the state sees it, they don\u2019t spend enough one-on-one time with them \u2014 and that there is no good reason that a woman couldn\u2019t assert her own rights in court. They shrug off the notion that a woman might fear stigma or other harm in bringing a suit herself. \u201cThe notion that women considering abortion are unable to assert their own rights is a legal fiction,\u201d lawyers for the Louisiana Department of Justice write in their petition, which notes that Roe v. Wade and its related cases were brought by individual women. Of course, in those cases the women filed suit using pseudonyms like \u201cJane Roe\u201d precisely to protect their identities.\nLouisiana also argues that when a health and safety regulation such as the admitting privileges law is at stake, there is an inherent conflict of interest between providers and patients that should preclude the providers from filing suit \u2014 after all, the law is meant to protect women from allegedly unfit doctors, they argue. \u201cThere is no basis to simply assume that women \u2026 get \u2018what they want\u2019 when the court allows a doctor to use women\u2019s rights to challenge health and safety standards designed to protect women from those very doctors.\u201d\nTo allow third-party standing in this case \u2014 and others like it \u2014 improperly grants abortion providers \u201cfavored\u201d status, Louisiana argues.\n\nIllustration: Chiara Ghigliazza for The Intercept\nShifting the Burden\nOn all these points, Louisiana\u2019s arguments are lacking, according to Columbia University law professor Gillian Metzger. For starters, decades of precedent on third-party standing cut against the state\u2019s claims. \u201cThey frame it as, \u2018Third-party standing here is an example of abortion exceptionalism.\u2019 But actually, third-party standing here is pretty standard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the effort to deny third-party standing here that would be exceptional.\u201d\nMetzger is one of seven federal courts scholars who have signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief that aims to set the record straight on the history, scope, and application of third-party standing.\nMetzger argues that standing is a distinct question divorced from the strength of the case and that Louisiana \u201ccollapses\u201d these two things \u201cin a way that is problematic.\u201d By claiming that there is a conflict between providers and patients when it comes to the admitting privileges law, the state presumes that it is correct in its assertion that the law actually protects women\u2019s health. Historically, she notes, such regulations \u201crarely actually do that.\u201d\nAnd the state overlooks a crucial point, according to Metzger: The providers also have a right they seek to vindicate. \u201cThe idea is that I may not have direct reproductive rights that I\u2019m asserting here, but I have a right, as a doctor, to only be subjected to \u2026 a rule or statute that is constitutionally valid,\u201d she said. In other words, the rights of doctors and patients are intertwined and cannot be uncoupled. So if a regulation of doctors is meant to disrupt a woman\u2019s ability to access abortion, it is unconstitutional. Therefore, as Metzger and her colleagues put it in their brief, if \u201ca statute violates women\u2019s due process rights, then it is not a valid rule of law and physicians should not be subject to penalties pursuant to it.\u201d\nIf doctors aren\u2019t allowed to bring suit, then individual women would have to carry the weight.\n\u201cIn this context, you can\u2019t separate these out,\u201d Metzger emphasized. \u201cIt\u2019s the very application of the regulation to the doctors that\u2019s also injuring the women.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t only abortion rights cases that could be impacted by a reversal of course on the application of third-party standing. Third-party standing has been accepted in a variety of other contexts, including\u00a0when the relationship between the plaintiff and the third party is tenuous. In a seminal 1976 case, a beer vendor was allowed to rely on the rights of her potential customers in challenging an Oklahoma law. In criminal cases, defendants have been granted standing to assert the equal protection rights of potential jurors who were rejected for service based on race. Homeowners have been able to assert the rights of potential homebuyers of color targeted by racist neighborhood covenants, and teachers have been allowed to fight for the due process rights of students and their families.\nHow these types of cases might be impacted by a ruling in favor of Louisiana isn\u2019t clear. But, if the court were to carve out some exception to the general rules on third-party standing to single out and deny abortion providers the ability to challenge regulations, Metzger said the immediate impact would be that the challenge to Louisiana\u2019s admitting privileges law would be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction. That would unravel five years of litigation and require an entirely new lawsuit to be filed. And if doctors aren\u2019t allowed to bring suit, then individual women would have to carry the weight and likely only after the law has taken effect.\n\u201cIf you work that through, how are women affected by the regulation? Well, they\u2019re affected if there are not available doctors,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cSo it may have to go into effect, and you have to lose the ability to get access to a doctor before you can sue.\u201d\nSince 2014, when Louisiana\u2019s admitting privileges law was enacted, lawmakers in states across the country have passed a total of 278 abortion restrictions, according to Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute. The Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood, and the American Civil Liberties Union have challenged these restrictions in dozens of pending cases, nearly all of which involve third-party standing.\nThe Court\u2019s Puzzling Logic\nWhy the Supreme Court has decided to hear Louisiana\u2019s third-party standing challenge isn\u2019t entirely clear. Indeed, over five years of litigation, the state never raised the issue of standing until the underlying case was accepted for the high court\u2019s review. And that in itself is unusual, because the court would ordinarily rely on the fact-finding of the lower court and subsequent review by the appeals court before deciding whether to get involved. (In its brief to the court, the Center for Reproductive Rights argues that Louisiana\u2019s silence on third-party standing over the years means that\u00a0the state waived its right to mount a challenge now. The Supreme Court is being asked to decide who is right on this issue.)\nThere is one member of the court who has expressed clear disdain for allowing third-party standing in abortion cases.\nBut there is one member of the court who has expressed clear disdain for allowing third-party standing in abortion cases: Justice Clarence Thomas. A staunch opponent of abortion rights, Thomas wrote a dissent in the Whole Woman\u2019s Health case that chastised the majority for allowing standing to groups it \u201cfavored.\u201d The court \u201chas erroneously allowed doctors and clinics to vicariously vindicate the putative constitutional right of women seeking abortion,\u201d he wrote in 2016. And, as Louisiana has done in its counter-petition to the court, Thomas\u00a0has said there is no reason individual women cannot come to court to vindicate their own rights. None of the other justices joined Thomas\u2019s dissent. Nonetheless, the court could have accepted the case as a nod to Thomas.\nOr it could be that the court wants to reassert its authority to decide when and if it will hear a particular issue. Here, the 5th Circuit subverted the Supreme Court\u2019s Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision in order to allow the Louisiana regulation to stand, thus pushing back on the high court. (Another friend-of-the-court brief penned by a group of constitutional law scholars urges the court to reassert its authority over the circuit courts.)\nMetzger suggested that the court may have accepted the third-party standing dispute as something of a \u201coff-ramp,\u201d a case that it could decide without having to weigh in directly on the admitting privileges question. But that logic is also flawed, she said. In deciding not to disrupt precedent by revisiting Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the court would be deciding instead to disrupt precedent on third-party standing. \u201cThat would have a huge impact and totally overturn a lot of litigation that has been going forward on the reliance of a very well-established doctrine,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re being institutionally consistent.\u201d\nWhat People Need\nAs Julie Burkhart sees it, Louisiana\u2019s challenge to the legal standing of abortion providers is just another in a long line of tactics meant to erode reproductive choice. Burkhart is the founder and CEO of Trust Women, which runs several abortion clinics across the country. She\u00a0worked with Dr. George Tiller for years, and her clinic in Wichita, Kansas, is in the same building that housed Tiller\u2019s practice until his murder in 2009.\n\n\n\n \n\n        Related      \nAs Trump Fans the Flames of Anti-Abortion Rhetoric, Kansas Offers a Cautionary Tale\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s concerned about what a change to the precedent could mean for her and her patients. \u201cPutting the burden on women who are seeking abortion services is unrealistic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s challenging for individuals to bring suit. And then we\u2019re also dealing with pregnancy: You have a pregnancy, and as we all know, pregnancy doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d She said that Trust Women and providers like it across the country have decades of experience and routinely act as advocates for their patients. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly one of the ways that we seek to represent our patients, not only by giving them the high-quality medical care they deserve, but also by defending them in the judicial system and in the legislature,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMedical practices, physicians being able to bring suit on behalf of their patients is commonplace,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something extraordinary. This is the way we operate, and it\u2019s not broken.\u201d\nNot long after Julie Bindeman terminated her pregnancy, she and her husband conceived again. She was heavily monitored by doctors who were watching out for any sign that something was wrong with the fetus. At 18 weeks, they discovered the same brain deformity. Again, the couple was crushed and decided to terminate the pregnancy. This time around, Bindeman was able to find a local abortion provider and undergo a standard termination.\nTalking to her doctor, Bindeman expressed feelings of isolation \u2014 she\u2019d lost three pregnancies in a row; she didn\u2019t know anyone like her. The doctor connected Bindeman with a woman who\u2019d faced similar loss. The two talked for hours, became friends, and ultimately both carried additional pregnancies\u00a0successfully to term. Bindeman and her husband now have three children.\nShe reflects on all the ways in which her doctors advocated for her: staying late to see her, pulling strings to help make arrangements, connecting her to others she could confide in. Bindeman, a licensed psychologist, says it\u2019s similar to what she does for her patients. \u201cAs a provider, I fight for my patients too,\u201d she said. \u201cI do it because it\u2019s what people need.\u201d\nAnd she sees no difference in what abortion providers do for their patients in court. \u201cThe idea that a physician can\u2019t advocate for their patient is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jordan Smith          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      jordan.smith@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @chronic_jordan                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        As Trump Fans the Flames of Anti-Abortion Rhetoric, Kansas Offers a Cautionary Tale      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Lies, Damn Lies, and Abortion      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Louisiana Tests the New Supreme Court on Abortion      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Millions of Women Already Live in a Post-Roe America: A Journey Through the Anti-Abortion South      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
