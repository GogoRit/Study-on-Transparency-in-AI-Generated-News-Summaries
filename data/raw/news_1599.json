(AP) \u2014 An abortion provider filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to overturn West Virginia\u2019s near-total ban, saying it is unconstitutional, irrational and causes irreparable harm to the state\u2019s only abortion clinic and its patients.The lawsuit asks for a halt to the four-month-old abortion ban while the case is heard in federal court. Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Sept. 16 signed a bill passed earlier that week making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling overturning its constitutional protection.The law requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital \u2014 a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women\u2019s Health Center of West Virginia. It has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state\u2019s sole abortion clinic.\n\nUnder the law, providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison. According to the lawsuit, the law \u201cseverely restricts the circumstances in which abortion can be provided and imposes new, irrational requirements on how abortion care can be provided.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia lawmakers OK bill drawing back one of the country\u2019s strictest child vaccination laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex ed classes in some states may soon watch a fetal development video from an anti-abortion group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia advances bill requiring foundation distributing opioid money to hold public meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Women\u2019s Health Center by the American Civil Liberties Union and its West Virginia chapter, Mountain State Justice, and the Cooley law firm. It said the law\u2019s care restrictions \u201care out of touch with modern medicine, lack any rational justification, and are not logically connected to any legitimate government interest and are therefore unconstitutional\u201d under the 14th Amendment\u2019s due process and equal protection rights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Charleston clinic suspended abortions shortly after lawmakers passed the bill and provided West Virginia women with resources to book appointments out-of-state and funding to help cover travel and the procedure, clinic Executive Director Katie Qui\u00f1onez said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the law\u2019s care restrictions are \u201ccontinuing to inflict irreparable harm not only on Plaintiffs\u2019 mission, purpose, and ability to practice their profession and their constitutional rights, but also on the health and wellbeing of their patients and West Virginians seeking access to this essential care.\u201d The lawsuit names West Virginia Board of Medicine President Ashish P. Sheth and board Secretary Matthew Christiansen as defendants. An after-hours message left Wednesday evening with the board seeking comment on the lawsuit was not immediately returned.Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said his office was ready to defend the law, which \u201creflects the will of the majority of the citizens of the state as relayed by their elected representatives in the State Legislature.\u201dThe state\u2019s abortion ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police.\n\nWhen he signed the legislation, Justice described it as \u201ca bill that protects life.\u201dQui\u00f1onez said the law \u201cpushes essential abortion care out of reach.\u201d\u201cWith each day this ban remains in effect, we are forced to turn patients away because politicians took away their power to make the best medical decisions for themselves during pregnancy,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the statehouse or courthouse, we will never stop fighting to ensure our patients can access essential care they need.\u201d More than a dozen states now have abortion bans, though most were approved before the Supreme Court ruling and took effect once the court threw out the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
