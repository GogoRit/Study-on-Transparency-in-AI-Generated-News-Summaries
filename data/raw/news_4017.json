Over 17,500 of the IDPs are women of reproductive age.\nIn addition to continued drops in temperature, women face hazardous living conditions and increased risks. \nAnd without adequate health care and other services, internally-displaced women and girls are more likely to suffer gender-based violence. \n\"Women and girls face multiple protection and reproductive health risks in northeast Syria. The risk of gender-based violence is particularly high in camps such as Al Hol, where 96 per cent of the camp population are women and children\u201d, explained Karen Daduryan, UNFPA Representative in Syria. \nFurthermore, \u201cwomen with disabilities are particularly vulnerable and require special attention\u201d, he\u00a0said.\n\n\n\nUNFPA Syria/2019\n\nThe UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is providing services to displaced women and girls across northeast Syria. \n\nHope in crisis\nUNFPA, through its implementing partners, operates six \u201csafe spaces\u201d for women and girls in the wartorn region, to ensure safety and support. \nThey provide essential services to address gender-based violence, including psychosocial support, case management, awareness raising, vocational training, and access to more specialized services such as mental health and reproductive healthcare. \nThe safe spaces serve newly-displaced women, as well as those living in host communities, and there are also mobile teams and clinics, taking treatment to where it\u2019s needed most.\nLifelines for women in need\nAsma\u2019a Al Issa, 32, was one of many women who received life-saving access to reproductive healthcare through UNFPA and partner organizations. \n\u201cI was worried before giving birth\u201d, explained Ms. Al Issa. First displaced three years ago when her house in Al Qadisia Village was demolished, she now lives in Al Tapqqa, a city in Raqqa governorate, in a home which is still being rebuilt. \n\nIt is a great mission to have saved her and her new baby\u2019s life \u2013 UNFPA-supported midwife, Hanan\n\nMs. Al Issa received maternal health services from a clinic operated by the non-profit organization Al Mawada with support from UNFPA. She went into labour on 25 October, amid rising hostilities in the area. \nWith the skilled care provided by Hanan, a midwife at the clinic, her pregnancy went smoothly despite the violence and turmoil around her. \n\u201cAsma\u2019a gave birth without any complications,\u201d Hanan later explained. \u201cIt is a great mission to have saved her and her new baby\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201cNow I am very happy to have a baby girl,\u201d Ms. Al Issa told UNFPA. She was discharged with her and her daughter in healthy condition and high spirits. \nMore than 42,000 women beneficiaries\nSince October last year, UNFPA and partners have provided reproductive health services, including safe childbirth, antenatal and postnatal care and family planning, to over 42,000 women of reproductive age. More than 39,000 services were provided to prevent, mitigate and respond to gender-based violence.\u00a0 \nPeople living in 45 shelters and four IDP and refugee camps throughout the region were helped and between October and mid-January, UNFPA supported 40 deliveries. \n\u201cAsma\u2019a is not a special case or an exception,\u201d explained Dr. Adnan, a reproductive health coordinator working in the area. She\u2019s proud of the healthcare that has been provided through international humanitarian efforts.\n\nShe is one of thousands displaced and deprived families that we serve every day \u2013 Dr. Adnan, reproductive health coordinator\n\nA sense of safety and hope, is another vital byproduct of the access to care that women have been given, amidst too much violence and despair: \u201cShe is one of thousands displaced and deprived families that we serve every day.\u201d\nBetween March 2019 and mid-January, 189,463 services were provided in the Al-Hol camp alone. \nReproductive health and gender-based violence services as well as sanitary napkins and dignity kits have been provided, and literacy courses, in coordination with UNICEF. \n\u201cIn certain cases, UNFPA and its partners deal with radical cultural and social norms while delivering gender-based violence and reproductive health services. And this requires tailored and innovative ways of reaching out to affected women and girls\" noted the agency\u2019s Syria Representative, Mr. Daduryan. \nDedication to safety and access\nRelocations and continued displacement create obstacles for healthcare access, in addition to insufficient supplies of materials and overcrowding. \n\u201cThe scope and severity of needs, as well as geographic spread in the northeast, require urgent scale-up of UNFPA's humanitarian response\u201d, he added. \n\u201cDue to generous support of multiple donors and dedicated work of partners, UNFPA has been able to reach out to most vulnerable women and girls with lifesaving and life sustaining reproductive health and gender-based violence services.\u201d\nUNFPA cites a number of challenges to continued support for women in North East Syria. These include overcrowding in collective shelters, insufficient supply of winterized clothes and limited specialized expertise in the provision of services to respond to gender-based violence. \n\u00a0\u201cIt is time to assess the results and gaps in outreach and quality of services to ensure that women and girls who need these services in camps, shelters, out-of-camp settlements and communities, have access to quality gender-based violence and reproductive health services and supplies,\u201d urged Mr. Daduryan. \n\u201cWe count on continued support of our donors and partners in this challenging task of ensuring health and dignity of all women affected by the crisis in northeast Syria.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreproductive healthsyria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              LISTEN TO UN RADIO\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nUN reproductive health agency appeals for $1.2 billion to support crisis-affected women and girls \n\n\nHorn of Africa: UNFPA launches $113 million appeal for drought-impacted women and girls \n\n\n$683 million appeal to deliver reproductive health services, where they\u2019re most needed \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nSyrian conflict has \u2018erased\u2019 children\u2019s dreams: new UN report 16 January 2020\nHuman RightsNearly nine years of\u00a0conflict in Syria have\u00a0robbed boys and girls of their childhood and subjected them to\u00a0\u201cunabated violations of their rights\u201d,\u00a0including\u00a0being killed, maimed, displaced, forced to fight or subjected to\u00a0torture, rape and sexual slavery.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSecurity Council beats midnight deadline, renews Syria cross-border aid in contentious vote10 January 2020\nHumanitarian AidThe Security Council on Friday evening renewed a UN operation delivering humanitarian aid across the Syrian border to millions of civilians, but some of the body\u2019s members expressed disappointment that the \u201cwatered down\u201d measure cut in half the number of crossing points and duration of the authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
