Aisha\u2019s firm resolve to focus on her education and to reach her ambition was ignited during comprehensive sexuality education sessions at her school in Mangochi District, Malawi, where she is in Grade 7.\nIn a country with one of the highest adolescent birth rates in Africa \u2013 one in three girls have had a baby by the age of 19, and one in two girls are married before the legal age of marriage, which is 18 years \u2013 the provision of accurate and timely information to adolescent girls and boys is having a positive effect.\nAisha\u2019s determination is a beacon of hope for girls in Malawi. She represents the country\u2019s progress in ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights for all. Her aspirations for a successful future \u2013 and that of millions of girls like her \u2013 are echoed by parents, teachers, village elders, traditional and political leaders across the nation. Together, they are joining forces to keep girls in school and out of marriage, confident that with a concerted effort, they can reduce adolescent pregnancy and eliminate child marriage in their communities.\nIn November 2019, at the Nairobi Summit celebrating 25 years of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), Malawi adopted ten bold commitments, which reaffirmed their promise to create a society in which every woman and girl can exercise her rights and choices, by 2030. This included pledging to end child marriage, reducing unmet need for family planning to under 11 per cent, and decreasing maternal deaths to 110 per 100,000 live births.\nFollowing Malawi\u2019s democratic transition of power earlier this year, the new Tonse Alliance administration has committed to continuing the momentum of the ICPD agenda, and achieving the ten commitments made in Nairobi. On 3 November 2020, Malawi launched its National ICDP25 Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Health,  Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda. This demonstrates a strong commitment by Malawi to champion sexual and reproductive health and rights, with young people at the heart and with a clear promise to ensure the necessary financial investments to fulfil the ICPD agenda.\nLessons learned in the 25 years since the ground-breaking Cairo Conference have given the Malawi National ICPD25 Steering Committee the necessary markers to develop a roadmap that will advance Malawi\u2019s efforts to reach zero maternal death, zero unmet need for family planning, zero new HIV infections and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices.\nThe Government is on the right track.\nThere is the feeling of a fresh start and the people have high expectations. Civil society is doing their part, rallying behind a mind-set change agenda, and community leadership is very active, including looking at by-laws to back up laws such as age of marriage.\nTo keep the momentum, Malawi needs to further build the partnerships and collaborations it has to ensure adequate and targeted resources in the provision of quality and integrated sexual and reproductive health services, including youth-friendly services. Partnership with young people must be deliberately pursued, creating more platforms for them to engage and be heard.\nWhile Aisha\u2019s story is encouraging, there are still millions of women and girls across the country who are economically dependent and vulnerable to cultural norms and gender stereotypes that increase their risk of experiencing violence and harmful practices. It is important to continue to work towards ensuring that all girls and boys can complete their education so that they can achieve their dreams and aspirations, and contribute meaningfully to the prosperity of their families, communities and the nation.\nSafeguarding the ICPD25 commitments and protecting the gains made is of paramount importance. This includes being prepared to tackle emerging challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate-related phenomena such as cyclones, flooding and drought that have the potential to reverse years of progress, especially among the most vulnerable.\nTherefore, as we commemorate the first anniversary of the Nairobi ICPD25 Summit, we must recall that there are many others in Africa like Aisha, whose voices need to be heard, and whose rights and choices need to be protected. Together, we can ensure that the collective potential of young people can transform the continent to fully achieve the African Union\u2019s vision of inclusive sustainable development driven by unity, self-determination, freedom, progress and collective prosperity.\nThe march continues in Africa.\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nMalawi\n\nSource\n\nUnited Nations Population Fund\n\nFormat\n\nNews and Press Release\n\nThemes\n\nHealthProtection and Human Rights\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nMalawi\n\nMalawi | Floods 2024 - DREF Operation (MDRMW020)\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nIFRC\n\nPosted\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalawi\n\nUNICEF Malawi Flood Response Update No.1 - 14 March 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nUNICEF\n\nPosted\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalawi\n+ 3 more\n\nMalawi Assistance Overview, March 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            News and Press Release          \nSource\n\nUSAID\n\nPosted\n\n4 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n4 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalawi\n+ 2 more\n\nMalawi - 2024 IFRC network country plan\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Appeal          \nSource\n\nIFRC\n\nPosted\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
