It found that almost half of people feel men are superior political leaders and more than 40% believe men make better business executives. Almost a third of men and women think it\u2019s acceptable for a man to beat his wife.The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which published its findings on Thursday, is calling on governments to introduce legislation and policies that address engrained prejudice.\u201cWe all know we live in a male-dominated world, but with this report we are able to put some numbers behind these biases,\u201d said Pedro Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, director of the UNDP\u2019s human development report office. \u201cAnd the numbers, I consider them shocking.\u201cWhat our report shows is a pattern that repeats itself again and again. Big progress in more basic areas of participation and empowerment. But when we get to more empowering areas, we seem to be hitting a wall.\u201dConcei\u00e7\u00e3o said the data show that perceptions and expectations in society about the role of women are prejudiced against them.\u201cWhile in many countries these biases are shrinking, in many others the biases are actually sliding back. If you take the overall average of the information we have, we show that on average we are sliding back \u2013 that biases, instead of shrinking, are growing back.\u201dThe figures are based on two sets of data collected from almost 100 countries through the World Values Survey, which examines changing attitudes in almost 100 countries and how they impact on social and political life. The figures cover periods from 2005-09 and 2010-2014, the latest year for which there is data.Of the 75 countries studied, there were only six in which the majority of people held no bias towards women. But while more than 50% of people in Andorra, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden were free from gender prejudice, even here the pattern was not one of unmitigated progress.Sweden, for example, was one of several countries \u2013 including South Africa, India, Rwanda and Brazil \u2013 in which the percentage of people who held at least one bias increased over the nine years the data covered. More than half of people in the UK and the US held at least one bias.\u201cUNDP is very conscious of the backlash against women\u2019s rights. We are aware and we are concerned, so we think the report \u2026 is an answer to push back the pushback,\u201d said Raquel Lagunas, acting director of UNDP\u2019s gender team. \u201cWe cannot pick and choose, [saying]: \u2018These human rights are for women, and these ones are not.\u2019\u201dLagunas said it was difficult to predict whether attitudes have changed more recently, but suggested the report\u2019s findings \u201cmay make the road ahead more difficult\u201d.\u201cWe can see big progress in the next five years [in some countries] and still at the same time see pushback in other countries,\u201d she said.\u201cWe need to invest and double efforts to address the hardcore areas of power \u2013 political power, economic power \u2013 and we think, we hope, this publication is going to have impact in the countries we [UNDP] work, and open conversations with governments, because gender equality is a choice.\u201dGirls stay longer in school but obesity, suicide and sexual violence remain risksRead moreThe report comes as rights campaigners call on world leaders to accelerate action to meet global targets on gender equality.\u201cAs representatives of leading organisations championing gender equality, we\u2019re raising the alarm about the pace of progress. There is no time left for business as usual: gender equality can be achieved for billions of girls and women by 2030, but it requires everyone to move faster,\u201d read an open letter, signed by nine presidents and CEOs of organisations including Plan International, Women Deliver, the One Campaign and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\u201cWe\u2019ve found that, if the current pace continues, 67 countries \u2013 home to 2.1 billion girls and women \u2013 will not achieve any of the key gender equality targets we studied by 2030.\u201dThese countries are not just the poorest. If trends over the past two decades continue, the US will be among them.In June, a gender index published by the Equal Measures 2030 partnership found that no country was on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, the deadline to achieve the UN sustainable development goals.Explore more on these topicsWomen's rights and gender equalityGenderUnited NationsWomennewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
