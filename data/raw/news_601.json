This is true for everyone, including those with an extra chromosome,\u201d Gov. Kristi Noem, R, of South Dakota said at her 2021 State of the State address in Pierre.\nNoem received a standing ovation after that line, from legislators and audience members in the house chamber of the state capitol.\nShe then asked legislators to \u201cpass a law that bans the abortion of a preborn child just because that child is diagnosed with Down syndrome,\u201d a request that also received applause from audience members.\nOn Fox News on Tuesday, Noem said that \u201cevery single life is precious, regardless of what situation the family is facing, and that every life is a blessing.\u201d\nShe invited the family of former Wisconsin congressman Sean Duffy, a Catholic, to be present at her address; the youngest child of the Duffy family, Valentina, has Down syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cValentina has given me as much joy and pride as any of my other little babies, and she\u2019s an American, and she has a right to live just like everybody else,\u201d Rachel Duffy said on Fox News on Tuesday, appearing alongside Sean and Valentina Duffy, and Noem.\n\u201cI would tell you it\u2019s scary, because we were scared,\u201d Sean Duffy recalled of receiving the Down syndrome diagnosis for their child. Yet, he added, \u201cthis little girl is the favorite of our family.\u201d\nNoem mentioned Iceland in her address on Tuesday, as one of the European countries \u201con pace to virtually eliminate children with Down syndrome\u201d through abortion.\n\u201cNow as South Dakotans, and frankly, as human beings, we should all be appalled by this. We are better than that,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Iceland, according to a 2017 CBS News report, nearly 100% of babies diagnosed with down syndrome are aborted. As CNA reported, only 18 children with Down syndrome were born in Denmark in 2019, the lowest number on record there.\nIn contrast, according to CDC estimates, around 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born annually in the United States, although abortions based on a prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis are still common.\nOther states in recent years, including Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Mississippi, have enacted bans on abortions conducted because of a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome.\nSouth Dakota was one of the states to sign on to a brief supporting Tennessee\u2019s discrimination abortion ban before the courts. In November, 18 states supported Tennessee\u2019s law banning abortions based on an unborn child\u2019s race, sex, or Down syndrome diagnosis. The legislation is facing legal challenges.\n\n\nKeywords: \nsouth dakota\ndown syndrome abortion ban\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota Bans Trans Drugs, Sex-Change Surgery for Minors\n\nWhile most states do not have bans on transgender surgery or drugs for children, lawmakers throughout the country have begun introducing such bills amid a growing conversation about the effects these measures could have on minors.\n\n\nTyler Arnold/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoadside Attraction: Wall Drug Is a Success Story Rooted in the Catholic Faith\n\nThe South Dakota landmark has been welcoming travelers since 1931.\n\n\nPatti Maguire Armstrong\nTravel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota Hears Pro-Life Testimony on \u2018Discrimination Abortion\u2019 Ban\n\nIn her testimony, Liebel said that a society which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness should never view Down syndrome as a \u201cdeath sentence.\u201d\n\n\nCNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Banning Transgender Hormones and Surgeries Falters in South Dakota\n\nBut a dozen more state bills, and thousands of recanting \u2018transgenders,\u2019 indicate the battle is far from over.\n\n\nCeleste McGovern\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland\u2019s Controversial New Hate Crime Law Set to Come Into Effect April 1\n\nStirring up racial hatred by threatening, abusive, or insulting behavior was already illegal under Scotland\u2019s Public Order Act 1986, but the bill expands the law to other protected categories.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPontifical Gregorian University Announces Merger With Biblical, Eastern Institutes\n\nThe Gregorian currently has an enrollment of about 2,700 students, 70% of whom come from outside Italy.\n\n\nDaniel Payne/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome to the (St. Joseph) Table: Feasts Overflow With Food and Faith\n\nThe tradition originated in medieval Sicily about a thousand years ago.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chef Lauren Marchetti, With a Recipe for Meatloaf\n\n\u2018The mission is to bring peace and joy into the home,\u2019 she said.\n\n\nAlexandra Greeley\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A Purposeful Day\u2019: Helping Those With Down Syndrome Thrive Beyond the \u2018Cliff of Adulthood\u2019\n\nAs so many resources dwindle down as children with special needs grow older, Kate Ashbrook is working overtime to help young adults reach their potential.\n\n\nAlyssa Murphy\nCulture of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\nAfter her prodigious output in the early 1900s, Alice Guy moved to America and launched a movie studio in New Jersey.\n\n\nJames Day\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\nVatican Authorizes Opening of Cause for Canonization for 13-Year-Old Filipina Girl\n\n\nIreland\u2019s Snakes of Secularization\n\n\nPope Francis: God\u2019s Glory Does Not Correspond to Human Success\n\n\nIs \u2018Christian Nationalism\u2019 Really a Problem?\n\n\nBishop Barron on the Spiritual Crisis: Get In the Army of Christ\n\n\nSan Antonio Archbishop Bans Retreat Center for \u2018False Teachings\u2019 Against Pope Francis\n\n\nRiley Gaines, Other Female Athletes, Sue NCAA for Allowing Transgender Competitors\n\n\nWhat Was the Counter-Reformation?\n\n\nA Catholic School Named for St. Patrick That\u2019s Totally Free and Totally Faithful\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Social media \n\n Facebook\n\n Twitter\n\n Instagram\n\n Youtube\n\n\n\n\n Tools & Features \n\n E-Newsletters\n\n RSS Feeds\n\n Register News Widget\n\n Register Radio Podcast\n\n College Guide\n\n\n\n\n Print Subscriptions \n\n Subscribe\n\n Manage a Subscription\n\n Give a Subscription\n\n Order Bulk Subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n Marketplace \n\n Advertise\n\n Job Board\n\n EWTN Religious Catalogue\n\n\n\n\n More \n\n About Us\n\n Contact Us\n\n Support Us\n\n Archives\n\n Submissions\n\n Submit Letter to Editor\n\n Reprints and Permissions\n\n Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 EWTN News, Inc.
