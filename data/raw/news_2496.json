    "text_headers": "The life and career of Candace Owens, the Black conservative activist who attacked Black Lives Matter and said George Floyd was 'not a good person'\nOwens was born in 1990 in Stamford, Connecticut. She studied journalism at the University of Rhode Island, but dropped out after her junior year due to a student loan issue.\nIn 2010, she worked at Vogue magazine, and in 2012, joined a private-equity company in New York City.\nIn 2016, she started a website called SocialAutopsy.com, which identified and exposed online bullies. She said she made the site after experiencing racialized bullying and harassment in high school.\nHer rise to fame in the far-right world started in 2017, when she founded her YouTube channel. In her videos, he criticizes the Democratic Party, the Black Lives Matter movement, feminism, and expresses support for President Donald Trump.\nShe also opposes gun control, and referred to the #MeToo movement as a \"political witch hunt.\" She even questioned the validity of climate change in an interview with Joe Rogan.\nIn 2018, she started the \"Blexit\" movement, a campaign to encourage African-Americans to end their historical allegiance to the Democratic Party.\nBetween 2017 and 2019, she also served as communications director for Turning Point USA, a conservative, pro-Trump non-profit.\nIn 2019, she married George Farmer, the son of a British Conservative Party peer. Their wedding was held at Trump Winery in Virginia and attended by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.\nOwens' tweets reveal many of her conservative opinions on the state of Black America, the Democratic Party, and her support for Trump.\nOwens is a frequent guest on Fox News, often discussing ways in which she thinks the Democratic Party is failing Black Americans.\nOwens' advocacy has earned her attention and praise from Trump himself. The president has invited her to multiple White House events in recent years.\nIn 2018, rapper Kanye West tweeted \"I love the way Candace Owens thinks\" \u2014 though he has since distanced himself from her.\nIn 2020, Owens has been in hot water for spreading coronavirus conspiracy theories on Twitter, including saying that hospitals and states were inflating the death toll for financial gain.\nAnd in June 3, Owens recorded a Facebook video critical of George Floyd and the protests in the wake of his death.\nLater that day, she went on Glenn Beck's radio show and expounded on her opinion, saying \"George Floyd was not a good person\" and \"the fact that he has been held up as a martyr sickens me.\"\nShe also started a GoFundMe campaign for an Alabama business whose co-owner was widely criticized for calling Floyd a \"thug.\" GoFundMe later kicked her off the platform, saying she violated its policies.\nWhat's next for Owens? A book, apparently. \"Blackout: How Black America Can Make Its Second Escape from the Democrat Plantation\" is expected to publish in September 2020.",

I don\u2019t know her personally but I think her gowns are beautiful, timeless, and delicate. I went with long sleeves down the aisle and for the reception because I think modesty is always en Vogue.. Princess Grace of Monaco was/is the most elegant bride of all time. A beautiful bride is a kind bride. I\u2019ve seen a lot of women treat their vendors, bridesmaids, make up artists, parents, (and sometimes even their grooms) terribly leading up to their wedding days. The most important thing for both George and I was to make sure every single person that played a role in our wedding, from the vendors to the guests, knew how grateful, excited and blessed we were to have them be a part of our wedding. Our policy was kindness and love throughout the entire process. There are a lot of people I will thank in later posts but first and foremost, to our wedding planner: @justalittleditty Dickie Morris, we love you so much. From start to finish just the most wonderful person in the entire world. You are now our planner for everything, forever and always.
