They are ranked as the bloc\u2019s worst two places for access to contraception in the annual Contraception Atlas created by the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights.\nThe launch of the Geneva Consensus came just as abortion was yesterday almost completely banned in Poland by the country\u2019s top constitutional court, sparking protests from women\u2019s rights groups.\n\nConstitutional court ends almost all legal abortion in Poland\n\nThe new declaration\u2019s core supporters, alongside the US and Hungary, are Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia and Uganda. Other signatories include Belarus, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Sudan, South Sudan and Libya.\nMany of the countries rank among the bottom twenty in the Women, Peace and Security Index published by Georgetown University, notes The Guardian, while none of them are among the index\u2019s top twenty.\nThe document was signed during a \u201cvirtual gathering\u201d organised by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. It aims to \u201cdefend the unborn and reiterates the vital importance of the family,\u201d said Pompeo.\n\n\nLive Now! @SecPompeo participates in a signing ceremony of the Geneva Consensus Declaration with @HHSgov @SecAzar. https://t.co/G7SaBK4Aod\n\u2014 Department of State (@StateDept) October 22, 2020\n\nAlthough it has no binding legal force, the declaration is seen as an attempt by states that champion conservative values to influence international discussion on human rights.\nThe document begins by affirming that the \u201chuman rights of women are an inalienable, integral, and indivisible part of all human rights\u201d and that \u201cwomen and girls must enjoy equal access to quality education, economic resources, and political participation\u201d.\nHowever, it also states that \u201cthere is no international right to abortion nor any international obligation on the part of states to finance or facilitate abortion\u201d. The signatories emphasise that \u201cin no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning\u201d.\nThey say that decisions \u201crelated to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level\u201d, and that \u201ceach nation has the sovereign right to implement programs and activities consistent with their laws and policies\u201d.\nThe countries also pledge to \u201csupport the role of the family as foundational to society\u201d and \u201cexpress the essential priority of protecting the right to life\u201d.\n\n\nFM @RauZbigniew confirmed \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 support for the Geneva Consensus Declaration signed today by 30+ countries.\nThe declaration aims to reaffirm commitment to protect human life, strengthen family as the foundational unit of society and to achieve better health for women. pic.twitter.com/vQeThH3XNc\n\u2014 Ministry of Foreign Affairs \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@PolandMFA) October 22, 2020\n\nAnnouncing Poland\u2019s participation in the declaration, foreign minister Zbigniew Rau explained that Poland supports the \u201cimportant initiative\u201d because it believes \u201cthat family is of fundamental importance to any strong society\u201d and that \u201cevery woman deserves to lead a healthy life\u201d.\nPoland\u2019s national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government has placed great emphasis on family policy, including its flagship child-benefit programme. A number of local authorities in Poland have also signed a \u201cCharter of Family Rights\u201d that rejects same-sex marriage and calls for the \u201cprotection of children from moral corruption\u201d.\nEarlier this year, the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, began the process of withdrawing Poland from a European convention on combating violence against women. He argued that the treaty \u201cpromotes LGBT\u201d and that Poland can protect women without being a signatory.\n\nPoland to begin withdrawal from international convention on violence against women\n\nIn response to the Geneva Consensus, Amnesty International has condemned the declaration as\u00a0a \u201cgiant step backwards\u201d that \u201ctramples on every person\u2019s right to choose\u201d.\n\u201cEvery person has a right to their individual personal and bodily autonomy,\u201d including the right to abortion, said Tarah Demant, Amnesty\u2019s director of gender, sexuality and identity.\n\u201cThe United States\u2026joins a list of countries willingly endangering people\u2019s health and lives,\u201d she added. \u201cThis administration doesn\u2019t seem content to stop until it has fully trampled on the rights, autonomy, and dignity of women and girls everywhere.\u201d\n\n\nThe anti-abortion Geneva Consensus Declaration, signed yesterday by the U.S. and others, is another giant step backwards for reproductive rights globally. pic.twitter.com/nsHnTu62wx\n\u2014 Amnesty International (@amnesty) October 23, 2020\n\nSome groups have also expressed concern that the document, with its emphasis on the family as \u201cthe natural and fundamental group unit of society\u201d, will reinforce the anti-LGBT rhetoric and policies pursued by many of the signatories, including Poland.\n\u201cThis will undoubtedly bring harm to LGBTQ people and roll back the established global consensus about the necessity of protecting the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls in all their diversity,\u201d David Stacy, government affairs director of the Human Rights Campaign, told the Washington Post.\n\nPoland ranked as worst country in EU for LGBT people\n\nOn the same day as Rau announced Poland\u2019s support for the declaration, the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal \u2013 an institution seen as being under the influence of PiS \u2013 issued a ruling that in effect introduces a near total ban on abortion.\nIt found that abortions in cases where the foetus has birth defects \u2013 which make up around 98% of all legal terminations in Poland \u2013 are unconstitutional.\nThe ruling immediately set off protests around Poland, including a march through Warsaw as thousands made their way from outside the tribunal towards PiS headquarters. Many carried banners with slogans such as \u201cyou have blood on your robes\u201d and \u201cthe law should defend us\u201d, reports Polityka.\nLater that evening, a large group of protesters gathered outside the home of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, PiS\u2019s chairman and Poland\u2019s de facto leader. Some of the demonstrators clashed with police, who repeatedly used tear gas against the crowds. Police said objects including stones had been thrown at them.\n\n\nFurther clashes outside Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski's house between protesters and police, who continue to use tear gas (via @marcinterlik) pic.twitter.com/SOyAgpec4T\n\u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) October 22, 2020\n\nKaczy\u0144ski has, like other leading PiS figures, expressed support for ending what they call \u201ceugenic abortions\u201d, meaning those justified by birth defects detected in the foetus.\n\u201cWe will strive to ensure that even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is condemned to death, is severely deformed, will end in birth, so that the child can be christened, buried, given a name,\u201d said Kaczy\u0144ski in 2016.\nThe leaders of last night\u2019s protests have announced that they will restart at 7 p.m. tonight in the \u017boliborz district of Warsaw where Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s house is located.\nUnder current coronavirus restrictions, organised gatherings are supposed to be limited to 10 people. From tomorrow, a new limit restricting gatherings to no more than five people not from the same household goes into force.\n\n\nThe president welcomes yesterday's ruling that abortions due to birth defects \u2013 which constitute almost all legal terminations in Poland \u2013 are unconstitutional\n\"Abortion for eugenic reasons should not be allowed. I believe every child has a right to life\" https://t.co/RJvRExOcsc\n\u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) October 23, 2020\n\nMain image credit: American Life League/Flickr (under CC BY-NC 2.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria WilczekMaria Wilczek is deputy editor of Notes from Poland.
