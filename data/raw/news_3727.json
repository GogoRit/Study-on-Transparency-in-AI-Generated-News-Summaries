An additional 49 million women in 132 middle- and low-income countries would not access the contraceptives that they require, the report, published on Thursday found. It also estimated an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies would take place.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Some governments are using coronavirus to restrict women\u2019s rightslist 2 of 3US appeals court allows Texas coronavirus abortion restrictionslist 3 of 3UN: Pandemic disrupts women\u2019s access to reproductive servicesend of list\nChildbirth could also become more dangerous \u2013 1.7 million women and 2.6 million newborns would suffer \u201cmajor complications\u201d, the researchers warned, leading to 28,000 more maternal deaths and 168,000 newborn deaths.\nIt also estimated an increase of three million unsafe abortions, and 1,000 maternal deaths from botched procedures.\n\u201cThese numbers are devastating and reflect the potential suffering of millions of people around the world,\u201d Zara Ahmed, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s associate director for federal issues, said in a statement. Researchers describe the 10 percent figure as a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate \u201cmeaning that the impact could be far greater.\u201d\nRegardless of the magnitude, vulnerable groups will bear the brunt. Those groups include, adolescents, people who identify as LGBT, refugees, imprisoned people, those in violent relationships, with disabilities or living in poverty.\nThere is already evidence of how the pandemic is affecting reproductive health. Contraceptive supply chains have been disrupted as manufacturers focus on COVID-19, leading to shortages of condoms. Abortion clinics have been forced to close because governments have not deemed them essential services during lockdowns. As countries throw everything they can at the pandemic, worries grow that it could come at the expense of other healthcare.\n\nAbortion rights activists holding a banner that reads \u2018No more death for clandestine abortion\u2019 during a demonstration as part of national strike after International Women\u2019s Day on March 9, 2020, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

And fear over contracting the virus itself could be keeping women from seeking the care they need.\n\u201cPrevious public health emergencies have shown that the impact of an epidemic on sexual and reproductive health often goes unrecognised, because the effects are often not the direct result of the infection, but instead the indirect consequences of strained healthcare systems, disruptions in care and redirected resources,\u201d the authors of the Guttmacher report wrote.\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is critical that governments safeguard essential sexual and reproductive health services,\u201d Guttmacher Institute senior research scientist Elizabeth Sully said in a statement.\nThe report uses evidence from the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa from 2013 to 2016 to illustrate what can happen to reproductive health during crises. Fear of seeking treatment during the epidemic and disrupted services contributed to 3,600 maternal and neonatal deaths, and stillbirths in Sierra Leone, the report stated, which is close to the number of deaths caused directly by the viral outbreak in the country. Studies found that Ebola outbreaks caused a decline in the use of contraception, and family planning visits in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\u2018An essential service\u2019\nThe Guttmacher Institute called on governments to define sexual and reproductive healthcare as essential, to strengthen supply chains, ensure contraception is available without a prescription, adopt remote models of care, such as telehealth, and ensure resources are not diverted. The needs of the vulnerable must be addressed, it added. It also called on the US government to step up its funding of global programmes.\n\u201cBy learning from prior epidemics, putting in place critical resources and systems, and promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights, we can prevent health system disruptions that have disastrous, lasting impacts on individuals, families and the global community,\u201d said Ahmed.\nDr Alok Banerjee, technical adviser for Parivar Seva Sanstha, a reproductive health organisation in India, has already seen the effects of COVID-19 on access. The organisation had to close its 31 clinics that provide family planning and abortion services under the government imposed lockdown.\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign outside the US Supreme Court as the court is set to rule on a legal challenge by abortion providers to a Texas law requiring doctors performing the procedure to have \u2018admitting privileges\u2019 at local hospitals and clinics to meet hospital-grade standards [File: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]\u00a0\n\nPublic facilities have remained open, but with transit at a standstill, it\u2019s virtually impossible for many women to get to the care that they need, Dr Banerjee told Al Jazeera. He said the government has decided to relax some restrictions, which means that 10 Parivar Seva Sanstha clinics are expected to open next week in areas that are not considered COVID-19 \u201chot zones\u201d. The government has also enabled a better flow of contraceptives, he said, which are running low because imported raw materials weren\u2019t being allowed in and manufacturers had shifted efforts to the pandemic.\n\u201cDefinitely, there is a crisis in reproductive health, particularly those who are seeking abortion and those who are willing to continue the contraception, a replenishment is necessary, that is a concern to all of us,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cAcross the world, this is a crisis period,\u201d he said, one that he hoped would end soon.\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
