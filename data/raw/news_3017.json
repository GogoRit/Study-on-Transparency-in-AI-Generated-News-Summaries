The home\u2019s front-door handle was also spray-painted red and a window pane was broken, according to a report at Macomb Daily.\nThe same morning, the pregnancy center itself was also discovered to have been defaced by red-painted messages reading \u201cliars,\u201d \u201cfake clinic,\u201d and \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge.\u201d\u00a0\nThe center\u2019s board member was awoken at 2 a.m. by noises outside her home. The woman saw two masked and darkly clothed individuals fleeing her home into a Prius, according to\u00a0the report.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to CNA, Pregnancy Aid Detroit Executive Director Nancy Anter said: \u201cI think what happened to us and our board member in particular is rightfully seen as a hate crime. And I think it should be investigated as such, and I think it should cause alarm nationally, regardless of your political or moral views on abortion.\u201d\n\u201cClearly, they don\u2019t know what we do. I\u2019m not really sure what the point was. We\u2019re not political,\u201d Anter told CNA. \u201cWe\u2019re moms, we\u2019re a small staff of part-time people and a bunch of volunteers, and we offer free pregnancy tests, free ultrasounds, maternity clothes, baby clothes, baby equipment, classes, support groups, referral information, diapers, wipes, formula \u2014 as much as we can to any woman who thinks she\u2019s pregnant, who is pregnant \u2026 our goal is to help them, give them practical support.\u201d\nSince the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the group \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge\u201d has claimed responsibility for a string of acts of vandalism and attacks on pro-life groups and churches.\u00a0\nOne Jane\u2019s Revenge statement archived on the website The Anarchist Library states: \u201cFrom here forward, any anti-choice group who closes their doors, and stops operating will no longer be a target. But until you do, it\u2019s open season, and we know where your operations are,\u201d and \u201cthrough attacking, we find joy.\u201d\u00a0\nAs of Sept. 22, CNA has recorded attacks on 33 churches, 55 pregnancy centers, three political organizations, and one maternity home since early May where the public evidence points to a pro-abortion motive. The crimes include vulgar graffiti, property damage, threats, theft, and even arson.\nSome pro-life organizations have faced much more than just graffiti. CNA reported the Life Choices pregnancy center in Longmont, Colorado, sustained fire and heavy smoke damage in an arson attack. The front of the building was defaced with pro-abortion slogans, including \u201cBans Off Our Bodies.\u201d The threatening phrase \u201cIf abortions aren\u2019t safe neither are you\u201d was also written with spray paint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy Aid Detroit\u2019s website states: \u201cWe hope all women marvel at the miracle of life and feel empowered by choosing life for their unborn child.\u201d\nLocal police are investigating the incident, according to WJBK-TV Fox 2 Detroit. \n\n\nTags:\nVandalism, \nCatholic News, \nMichigan, \nPro-life pregnancy centers, \nprolife2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Pinedo is a DC Correspondent for CNA.
