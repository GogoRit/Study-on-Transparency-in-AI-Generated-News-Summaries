But his ruling indicated he believes the laws he has enjoined them from enforcing may not actually be in effect at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lawsuit, filed two months after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was brought by abortion funds, nonprofit groups that help pay for abortions and related expenses, including out-of-state travel, hotels and child care. \nAfter the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the funds stopped paying for Texans to leave the state, citing their fear of being prosecuted under the state\u2019s intersecting abortion bans. In the lawsuit, they cited examples of Attorney General Ken Paxton and state lawmakers expressing an intent to bring charges against abortion funds. \nBut Pitman ruled Friday that Paxton could not enforce Texas\u2019 abortion bans against anyone who helped pay for an abortion out of state and dismissed him from the suit. \nPitman analyzed Texas\u2019 three abortions laws: the ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, commonly known as Senate Bill 8; the so-called trigger law, which went into effect in July; and the pre-Roe statutes, which were in effect before the U.S. Supreme Court deemed them unconstitutional in 1973. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince SB 8 is enforced through private civil lawsuits, neither Paxton nor local prosecutors play any role in enforcing that statute, Pitman noted.\nPaxton and the district attorneys do have the power to enforce the trigger law, which comes with a sentence of up to life in prison and a minimum $100,000 penalty. The law criminalizes anyone who performs an abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person. \nBut it cannot be enforced beyond state lines, Pitman found. \nThe law \u201cdoes not express any intent, much less a clear one, to apply extraterritorially,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccordingly, there is no plausible construction of the statute that allows the Attorney General or local prosecutor to penalize out-of-state abortions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat leaves only the pre-Roe statutes, which come with sentences of two to 10 years in prison for anyone who performs or \u201cfurnishes the means for\u201d an abortion. Pitman found that the laws could potentially be interpreted to criminalize someone in Texas who helped someone pay for an abortion out of state. \n\u201cIn other words, if an abortion takes place outside of Texas, a plausible (albeit unlikely) construction of the statute authorizes prosecution for \u2018furnishing the means\u2019 of that abortion if that \u2018furnishing\u2019 takes place in Texas,\u201d Pitman wrote. \u201cThe pre-Roe laws prohibit \u2018furnishing the means\u2019 within the state, and do not necessarily limit that prohibition to abortions which occur in Texas.\u201d \nPitman enjoined the named district attorneys \u2014 who represent Travis, Washington, Blanco, Burnell, Llano, San Saba and Caldwell counties \u2014 and a county attorney, representing Burleson County, from enforcing the pre-Roe statutes against the abortion funds while the case proceeds. \nThere is no civil penalty associated with the pre-Roe statutes, so Pitman dismissed Paxton from this line of inquiry \u2014 and thus the entire suit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the ruling, Pitman also argued that the pre-Roe statutes have been repealed and therefore cannot be used to prosecute anyone. \nIn 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas\u2019 abortion laws were unconstitutional, it said that \u201cthe Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall.\u201d The state removed the statutes from the penal code, and in 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found that they had been \u201crepealed by implication.\u201d \nThe state went on to pass myriad other abortion laws that would have been at odds with the pre-Roe bans, were they still in effect. \nBut in 2021, in the text of both SB 8 and the trigger law, the Legislature affirmed that Texas \u201cnever repealed, either expressly or by implication, the state statutes enacted before the ruling in Roe v. Wade.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Roe was overturned last June, Paxton issued guidance indicating the pre-Roe statutes were immediately in effect. He tweeted, \u201cTexas\u2019s pre-Roe statutes criminalizing abortion is 100% good law, and I\u2019ll ensure they\u2019re enforceable.\u201d \nThe question went to the Texas Supreme Court, which temporarily allowed the pre-Roe statutes to go into effect, but the case was dismissed before a final ruling. \nIn Friday\u2019s ruling, Pitman rejected the idea that the pre-Roe statutes are still in effect. \n\u201cLegislative findings are insufficient to revive a law that has been repealed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mere finding that its pre-Roe laws were not repealed is not a \u2018statutory amendment\u2019 and does not render the decision [by the 5th Circuit] clearly wrong.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temporary injunction indicates that Pitman believes the abortion funds will likely prevail in arguing that they should not be prosecuted under the pre-Roe statutes. \n\u201cOur clients are very pleased with this order,\u201d said Elizabeth Myers, a Dallas attorney representing the abortion funds. \u201cJudge Pitman confirmed there can be no liability for funding or supporting abortions outside of Texas under the trigger ban or SB 8 \u2026 and it makes it clear he thinks pursuing criminal charges by any district attorney or county attorney against this type of behavior is improper.\u201d \nPaxton\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
