Trump created barriers to full equality and rolled back workplace protections against discrimination and sexual harrassment. Under Trump, it is increasingly difficult for women to succeed in the workplace, at school, and at home.\nTrump has blocked women\u2019s access to health care through legislation, regulations, judicial appointments, and legal action.\n\n\nIn 2016, Trump called for an abortion ban with \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women \u2014 which was too extreme even for many anti-abortion activists.\n\n\nTrump tried to limit access to reproductive health care by supporting legislation that would institute a restrictive 20-week abortion ban and block insurance plans that cover abortions.\n\n\nTrump slashed funding for family planning programs and health care providers that provide abortion services or referrals.\n\n\nTrump issued a regulation allowing employers to refuse to provide no-cost contraception coverage as previously required under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\nAfter promising to \u201cautomatically\u201d overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump has packed the Supreme Court and circuit courts with extremist opponents of abortion rights.\n\n\nTrump is fighting to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which could allow insurers to charge women more and not cover maternity care.\n\n\nTrump chose the anti-abortion extremist Mike Pence as his running mate and Betsy DeVos, who compared the choice to have an abortion to the choice to own slaves, as his secretary of education.\n\n\nAs president he has aggressively touted his anti-abortion agenda, and the president of the Susan B. Anthony List called Trump \u201cthe most pro-life president in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\nTrump revoked protections against sexual harassment, sexual assault, and discrimination at work and school.\n\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump said women would make the same as men if they \u201cdo as good a job.\u201d\n\n\nTrump revoked protections against workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault, discrimination, and pay disparities.\n\n\nTrump rescinded Obama-era campus sexual assault guidelines, which required colleges to take allegations more seriously and hold perpetrators accountable, and narrowed the definition of sexual harassment.\n\n\nTrump has failed to reduce the cost of childcare and made little progress on paid family leave.\n\n\nTrump has defended employers who pay mothers less than men and called pregnancy an \u201cinconvenience\u201d for employers, so it\u2019s not surprising he has failed to follow through on his promise to \u201csolve\u201d childcare.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s tax scam reduced the value of the childcare credit for low- and moderate-income families even as it gave huge tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest 1%.\n\n\nIn the midst of a pandemic in which women are disproportionately losing their jobs, Trump scaled back paid leave requirements, leaving 75% of workers at risk of not receiving paid leave for childcare.\n\n\nTrump touted an insufficient paid family leave proposal that \u201cdoes not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.\u201d\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\n\n\n\nJoin Us\n\n\nEmail address*\n\n\n\nPhone number\n\n\n\nZip code*\n\n\n Sign up to get texts.
