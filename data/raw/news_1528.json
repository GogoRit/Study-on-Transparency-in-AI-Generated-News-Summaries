(AP) \u2014 When the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a ban on most abortions this week, the majority wrote that they were leaving \u201cfor another day\u201d a decision on when, exactly, the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d limit begins during pregnancy. Doctors practicing under the strict law cannot similarly punt on that question.Physicians say the statute\u2019s unclear guidance is already chilling medical practice at the few abortion clinics that operate in the conservative state. With potential criminal charges hanging in the balance, most abortions are being halted as doctors wrestle with the murky legal definitions.\u201cThese medical definitions they tried to put forward are legislative and put forward by people who don\u2019t practice medicine,\u201d said Dr. Dawn Bingham, chair of the South Carolina section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or AGOC. \u201cThis language creates uncertainty among medical providers who may be unsure they\u2019re legally allowed to terminate a pregnancy.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina and Georgia are the only two states with such bans on the books. An Ohio court is weighing another one, and a six-week ban is pending in Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South Carolina, the measure passed by the Republican-dominated General Assembly bans abortion after what it calls a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is identified. The law defines that term as \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d Medical professionals can usually detect cardiac activity around six weeks of pregnancy, which is before most people know they are pregnant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat language is clinically inaccurate according to medical consensus, which holds that such \u201ccardiac activity\u201d is not a heartbeat and an embryo has not yet become a fetus at that stage. A 2013 University of Leeds study determined that the four clearly defined chambers in the heart that appear from the eighth week of pregnancy remain \u201ca disorganized jumble of tissue\u201d until around the 20th week. \n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s law requires that providers perform an ultrasound on any patient seeking an abortion, display the images and record a description of any present \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d But the justices left legally undecided the question of whether \u201ccardiac activity\u201d and the described \u201crhythmic contraction of the fetal heart\u201d refer to the same point or two separate points in a pregnancy.From a medical standpoint, the ACOG says that while electronic impulses signifying \u201ccardiac activity\u201d can be recognized early on, an actual heart is not detectable by ultrasound until roughly 17 to 20 weeks of gestational age.Charleston-based OB-GYN Jessica Tarleton said the presence of the word \u201cor\u201d between the terms in the law\u2019s language creates two different definitions and is \u201cvague.\u201d It always takes lawyers some time to put together advice following any restrictions on abortion, she added.\u201cDefining a structure as a heart would put the definition later in pregnancy than earlier when you would see rhythmic contractions of some kind of cardiac structure,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his dissent, South Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Donald Beatty questioned how doctors and their lawyers could comply with the law without \u201ca determination of this key point.\u201dState Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, a Republican, dismissed the idea that the definitions lack precise guidelines for medical professionals. He said the state has long required that doctors perform ultrasounds to provide an opportunity for patients to see the images before having an abortion.\u201cNow it just says if there is cardiac activity that is present on that ultrasound \u2014 if you can hear the heart beating \u2014 then you can\u2019t perform that abortion,\u201d Massey told reporters Wednesday.On Thursday, abortion providers filed a petition for a rehearing based on what they called the ambiguity arising from the definition of \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d While some South Carolinians will remain eligible for abortions under the law, Planned Parenthood attorney Catherine Humphreville predicts widespread confusion resulting from the ruling. \n\nIn the meantime, doctors have been cancelling abortion appointments.A handful of the 30 or so people scheduled for abortions Wednesday had been served at a Planned Parenthood location in Columbia when the ruling was delivered. The remaining appointments got put on hold, according to Dr. Katherine Farris, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. The Center for Reproductive Rights reported similar postponements at another clinic upstate, and Farris heard the same from colleagues in hospitals.Abortion providers who violate the law could face felony charges carrying up to two years in prison and the loss of professional licenses. That threat has them interpreting these types of laws very conservatively, according to Tarleton, meaning many abortions have stopped altogether.\n\n\u201cIn the setting of very high penalties,\u201d Farris said, \u201cthe only option for providers is to pause as we try to figure this out.\u201d ___Associated Press writer Jeffrey Collins contributed to this report.
