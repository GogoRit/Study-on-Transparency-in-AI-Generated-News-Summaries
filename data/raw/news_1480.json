Joni Albrecht of Thurston at the Nebraska State Capitol on Jan. 11, 2023, discussing her proposal to restrict abortion in Nebraska to about six weeks of gestation. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014 A legislative bill that supporters and opponents agree would outlaw abortions in Nebraska before many women know they\u2019re pregnant heads into Wednesday\u2019s first round of debate with just enough votes to overcome cloture \u2014 33 \u2014 but no wiggle room.\u00a0\nState Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston appears to have held together a coalition of 32 Republicans and one Democrat, State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, to pass Legislative Bill 626.\n  State Sen. Danielle Conrad (center) speaks at a rally of abortion rights earlier this year in the State Capitol Rotunda. Nebraskans, she said, don\u2019t want additional restrictions on abortion. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\nThe bill would outlaw abortions after an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity. This commonly occurs at about six weeks of gestation, which advocates and opponents acknowledge is before many women will know they\u2019ve missed a menstrual period.\nBecause of this, abortion rights advocates say Albrecht\u2019s bill is effectively an outright ban.\nAlbrecht has said she seeks to end what she calls \u201celective abortion,\u201d or abortion by choice. She has told the Nebraska Examiner that she negotiated exceptions for rape, incest and the life or health of the mother, but she would prefer the total ban the Legislature sought in 2021.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can change some hearts on the floor,\u201d Albrecht said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s about elective abortions. We want to stop that from happening \u2014 women who it\u2019s inconvenient for them to have it, not wanting to have it. \u2026. This is the right thing to do for the people.\u201d\nChanges possible, if unlikely\nOpponents of LB 626 say they\u2019re hoping some supporters of the bill, who privately express reservations about it being too extreme, will drop their support of the bill.\n\n\nComing Wednesday:\nDoctors say legislation could affect patients with pregnancy complications.\n\n\nThe fact that an alternative to LB 626 \u2014 a proposed ban after 12 weeks \u2014 was introduced shows that even some senators who have signed onto the \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill are listening to their constituents who say it goes too far, said Scout Richters of the ACLU of Nebraska.\n\u201cWe are asking them, and hoping, that they will take that next step and vote no more restrictions on abortion,\u201d Richters said.\nOmaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, a legislative opponent, said that the fiscally responsible course would be for Nebraska lawmakers to wait before considering LB 626 until they see how legal challenges to similar laws in other states play out.\n  Hundreds packed the hearing room to testify for and against Legislative Bill 626, the bill that would ban abortions in Nebraska after an ultrasound can detect embryonic cardiac activity. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\nIn a \u201cminority statement\u201d on the bill, Cavanaugh and Gretna Sen. Jen Day raised several concerns about LB 626, including that while it does not provide for criminal prosecution of doctors who perform an abortion, it doesn\u2019t repeal other laws that do allow criminal charges.\nLikely to pass first round\nSenators and outside political observers expect the bill to secure enough votes for first-round passage this week, once it overcomes the eight hours of debate required by a promised filibuster from Cavanaugh and fellow Omaha Sen. Megan Hunt.\u00a0\nBut people on all sides of the abortion debate will be watching what happens in the second round of debate. That\u2019s when State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator, plans to discuss an amendment he offered that would shift LB 626 to an abortion ban after 12 weeks.\u00a0\nSeveral conservative senators have told the Examiner in recent weeks that they have seen polling from Nebraska that echoes findings in other states. The polling indicates public support for abortion bans starts peeling off with bans shorter than 12 weeks. \nPolitical observers said they would be watching five Republican senators and one Democrat to see if the 12-week ban has a chance: The Republicans are Christy Armendariz of Omaha, Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Myron Dorn of Adams, Jana Hughes of Seward and Riepe.\u00a0\nEach has committed to support the bill, Albrecht said. But several represent districts where constituents are divided about the proposed cardiac ban.\nThe Democratic senator is Justin Wayne of Omaha. He has told some colleagues he opposes the bill, but he has not indicated where he stands on voting for cloture. He could be a backup 33rd vote if supporters of the bill fall short. He did not return calls Monday seeking comment.\n  Then-State Sen. Mike Flood addresses an anti-abortion rally in Lincoln. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)\nThe path forward\nSupporters of the cardiac ban said privately they don\u2019t see a path to approval for the 12-week ban. They think conservatives will hold, several said. But a single senator who wants to change the measure to a 12-week ban could push a change.\nAlbrecht said Riepe has told her he will support her bill as long as he gets debate on his amendment, which he confirmed Monday. Riepe told the Examiner if his choice is between keeping Nebraska\u2019s current 20-week abortion ban or LB 626, he\u2019d pick LB 626.\nThe key question during the second round of debate, which can last\u00a0up to four hours, is whether a filibuster will leave time for any amendments to be heard beyond the ones filed by Hunt and Cavanaugh and other senators who object to a stricter ban.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m the 33rd vote, I would give her that vote for cloture,\u201d he said. \u201cI simply want to have it be discussed. I\u2019m not working the bill, not vote-counting, not lobbying. If push comes to shove, I don\u2019t like the 20 weeks. I think it\u2019s excessive.\u201d\nAndi Curry Grubb of Planned Parenthood said she expects to hear a \u201cvery robust debate.\u201d She said she hopes that senators are paying attention to the consequences of abortion bans in other states, including trauma for women seeking care and the loss of doctors to other states.\n\u201cWe know that there are some senators that have said they will be listening to determine where they land, and we hope that\u2019s true,\u201d Curry Grubb said. \u201cBecause I think there\u2019s a lot of information about how harmful these types of bills are.\u201d\nSandy Danek of Nebraska Right to Life said she expects each of the senators who have signed on to support the bill and some who have chosen not to advocate for the bill publicly to honor their word and stick to their answers to the anti-abortion group\u2019s candidate surveys.\n\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged and very impressed with the senators who support this bill,\u201d Danek said. \u201cI think we feel confident that the pro-life senators who have signed onto the bill will remain with us. \u2026 We feel very good about our commitments.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXDebate begins this week on Nebraska abortion ban timed to cardiac activity\nby Aaron Sanderford, Nebraska Examiner April 11, 2023\nDebate begins this week on Nebraska abortion ban timed to cardiac activity\nby Aaron Sanderford, Nebraska Examiner April 11, 2023\n LINCOLN \u2014 A legislative bill that supporters and opponents agree would outlaw abortions in Nebraska before many women know they\u2019re pregnant heads into Wednesday\u2019s first round of debate with just enough votes to overcome cloture \u2014 33 \u2014 but no wiggle room.\u00a0\nState Sen.
