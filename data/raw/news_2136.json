That, to me, is the only reason why they would remove the movie.\u201d\nThe 2019 pro-life documentary BABIES ARE STILL MURDERED HERE, follows the history of abortion in America, showcases voices from pro-life commentators and, according to the IMDb description, \u201cgoes into the deep underpinnings of major national lobbyist groups to find out why after 46 years, babies are still murdered here?\u201d\u00a0\nPittman is deeply involved in the pro-life movement and is an advocate for End Abortion Now, which seeks to help churches fight against abortion. Pittman also directed the movie\u2019s prequel, which is titled BABIES ARE MURDERED HERE.\u00a0\u00a0\nPittman asked fans of the movie to gain Amazon\u2019s attention, as his efforts to contact Amazon to ask them what happened were unsuccessful.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no recourse. There\u2019s nothing I can do. I can\u2019t call up Amazon and say, \u2018hey, why\u2019d you take my movie off Amazon Prime?'\u201d Pittman said. \u201cThe only thing I can rely on is for people to go and demand Amazon to at least look at it and see if it was a mistake and reverse course.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I would like people to do. Tag Amazon and ask them what\u2019s going on with this because I still believe that Amazon is under the thumb of the free market and people\u2019s shopping decisions, so if there\u2019s enough outrage it can be fixed,\u201d Pittman explained.\nThere is growing suspicion from Christians and conservatives alike, that Amazon and other big tech companies are unequally censoring. Attention to the vague community guidelines, which leads to removal, seems more readily applied to Christian and conservative content and rarely impacts left-leaning content. \nNow more than ever we\u2019re bombarded by darkness in media, movies, and TV.
