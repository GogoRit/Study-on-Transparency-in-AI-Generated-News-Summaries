Across the nation, women continue to fight for their rights in legal, social, political and economic contexts. Although work remains, local organizations have made great strides in improving the status of women\u2019s rights in Morocco.\nWomen\u2019s Rights On Paper\nMorocco\u2019s Constitution addresses the issue of women\u2019s rights.\u00a0Article 19 of the 2011 Constitution states, \u201cThe man and the woman enjoy, in equality, the rights and freedoms of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental character.\u201d This is a general guarantee of gender and matrimonial equality. Moreover, there have been numerous other ratifications in the Moroccan legislature that correlate to this statement.\nMoroccan women now have protections against male guardian requirements, rape-marriage allowances and sexual harassment. The government passed all of these laws after 2004, with one as recent as 2018. Yet, there are still a few loopholes in the legal system. For example, the Family Law allows forced marriage if a judicial waiver is provided. Many believe that there is still progress to be made.\nStatus of Women\u2019s Rights in Morocco (Social Contexts)\nWhile the Moroccan Constitution is promising and shows progression, conservative ideals remain common in social institutions. This includes the hierarchy of power held by males and gender-based discrimination. Socially, the need is the greatest for reform and change, which law or legislation do not often achieve.\nWomen are fighting for equality in Morocco today by seizing opportunities, including education, economic and financial freedom and leadership positions. By holding higher positions in society, these conservative assumptions may begin to dissipate in family and cultural contexts.\nStatus of Women\u2019s Rights in Morocco (Political Contexts)\nWomen gained both the right to vote and the right to stand in an election on the same date in May 1963. The assumption of leadership by women is historical and considered to be a great gain for Moroccan women. Bassima Hakkaoui, a veiled political leader, is now in charge of the Ministry of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development. She is the first veiled woman to hold this position.\nUnfortunately, most women struggle to gain access to political leadership positions today. As of 2018, only 81 out of 395 parliamentary members were held by women. This begs the question of whether Moroccan women can be accurately and meaningfully represented by their government voices. Many activists call for more female representation in parliament and\u00a0other positions of power.\nStatus of Women\u2019s Rights in Morocco (Economic Contexts)\nAccording to USAID Morocco, ranks 141 out of 149 countries in women\u2019s economic participation and opportunity. Women make up 50% of Morocco\u2019s population but only 26% of the labor force. Also, the female labor force participation rate in Morocco decreased by 6% between 1999 and 2010. Moroccan women remain a largely untapped resource within the very borders of the country.\nOne of the results of the 2011 Constitution includes positive advancements in girls\u2019 education. Increasing access and encouraging girls to finish school has led to more women contributing to the labor market and the economy. The accumulation of generational wealth is an example of this influence.\nFighting for Women\u2019s Rights\nTo continue improving the status of women\u2019s rights in Morocco, the strengthening of the justice system is crucial. Addressing social and cultural barriers is also important, as many gender limitations stem from conservative or patriarchal views.\nTwo notable organizations are fighting to raise the status of women\u2019s rights in Morocco and both reside in Rabat. The Democratic Association for Moroccan Women and the Mobilizing for Rights Associates (MRA) work within the community and advocate for legal reforms. These reforms promote women\u2019s social, economic and political equality, monitor international human rights compliance and assist women\u2019s rights campaigns.\nMRA also tracks the implementation of the newly signed Elimination of Violence Against Women law, which was recently enacted in September 2018. This law has shown the world that Morocco is willing to make progress in gender equality. Furthermore, it exemplifies the importance of these women\u2019s rights organizations in making progress.\nMoving Forward\nAlthough Morocco has made improvements in women\u2019s rights, work remains. Women across the country are continuing to fight for equality in all contexts. Moving forward, women\u2019s rights organizations continue to advocate for the safety and liberty of all Moroccan women.\n\u2013 Savannah Gardner\nPhoto: Flickr\nOctober 31, 2020Share this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on TumblrShare on VkShare on RedditShare by Mail\n\nhttps://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg\n0\n0\n\n\nKim Thelwell\n\nhttps://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg\n\nKim Thelwell2020-10-31 07:30:382020-10-30 19:23:59The Status of Women\u2019s Rights in Morocco\n\n\n\n\nGet SmarterGlobal Poverty 101\nGlobal Poverty\u2026 The Good News\nGlobal Poverty & U.S. Jobs\nGlobal Poverty and National Security\nInnovative Solutions to Poverty\nGlobal Poverty & Aid FAQ\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake ActionCall Congress\nEmail Congress\nDonate\n30 Ways to Help\nVolunteer Ops\nInternships\nThe Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cThe Borgen Project is an incredible nonprofit organization that is addressing poverty and hunger and working towards ending them.\u201d\n-The Huffington Post\n\n\n\n\nInside The Borgen ProjectContact\nAbout\nFinancials\nPresident\nBoard of Directors\nNewsletter\n\n\n\nGet SmarterGlobal Poverty 101\nGlobal Poverty\u2026 The Good News\nGlobal Poverty & U.S. Jobs\nGlobal Poverty and National Security\nInnovative Solutions to Poverty\nGlobal Poverty & Aid FAQ\u2019s\nWays to HelpCall Congress\nEmail Congress\nDonate\n30 Ways to Help\nVolunteer Ops\nInternships\nThe Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElderly Poverty in Mexico: The Forgotten Generation4 Initiatives to Alleviate Poverty In Syria\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
