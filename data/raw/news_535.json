The House voted 79-35 in favor of the \u201cSouth Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act.\u201d The measure was passed after nearly all the Democratic members of the caucus walked out of the chamber in protest. (Feb. 17)APGREENVILLE, S.C. \u2013 South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed the Fetal Heartbeat Bill into law Thursday afternoon, banning the abortion of a fetus with\u00a0a detectable and audible heartbeat.\"If there's not a right to life, then what rights is there,\" McMaster said before signing the bill.\u00a0\"What rights exists, if not the elementary, fundamental, profound right to life.\"The bill will be\u00a0challenged in court by abortion rights groups.\"The Attorney General\u2019s office has already been named by plaintiffs in a legal action to block this law from taking effect,\" South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson\u00a0said in an emailed statement. \"My office will vigorously defend this law in court because there is nothing more important than protecting life.\"The bill passed with 30 votes in the state Senate and 79 votes in the House.Live updates: Pregnant women at higher risk for COVID infection, study says; New York City could run out of vaccine todayJudge issues temporary restraining orderJust one day after the bill was signed, a federal court has placed a temporary restraining order on the Fetal Heartbeat Bill on Friday.The restraining order granted by\u00a0U.S. District Court Judge Mary Geiger Lewis lasts 14 days and will likely be renewed before the March 9 hearing on a preliminary injunction.State Attorney General Alan Wilson said, \"we believe the Heartbeat Law is constitutional and deserves a vigorous defense to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary,\" in an emailed statement.The Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood said Thursday that they\u00a0intend\u00a0to challenge the bill in federal court.\"By banning abortion at just six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they\u2019re pregnant, the law targets South Carolinians who already struggle to access health care,\" the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release.The lawsuit includes\u00a0Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and the\u00a0Greenville Women\u2019s Clinic.What the Fetal Heartbeat Bill doesThe bill, S.1,\u00a0took effect as soon as McMaster signed it into law just before 2\u00a0p.m. Thursday. It requires an ultrasound test for a detectable fetal heartbeat before an abortion\u00a0is performed and it prohibits performing an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected.A person\u00a0found guilty of performing an abortion that violated this bill\u00a0would receive a prison sentence of up to\u00a0two years or\u00a0a $10,000 fine, or both.A woman who had an abortion performed against these new rules\u00a0would be able to sue for $10,000 in damages and court and attorney fees.An abortion after an ultrasound test did not detect an audible fetal heartbeat would not be a violation. There must also be an hour between the ultrasound and the abortion.There are exceptions in certain medical emergencies that \"necessitates the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death without first determining whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat\" or if testing for a fetal heartbeat would create a delay that puts the mother at serious risk of \"substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions.\"A physician would have to keep a record of their medical rationale to support the conclusion that an abortion was necessary. Physicians are required to keep records for at least seven years.Other exceptions include pregnancies resulting in either rape or incest and if the fetus was under 20 weeks old from conception\u00a0\u2013 in these situations, the physician would be required to report the woman's case to law enforcement.Abortion rights groups plan to challenge the billThe Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood intend\u00a0to challenge the bill in federal court and said they will file a lawsuit by the end of Thursday.\"By banning abortion at just six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they\u2019re pregnant, the law targets South Carolinians who already struggle to access health care,\" the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release.The lawsuit includes\u00a0Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and the\u00a0Greenville Women\u2019s Clinic.Abortions in South CarolinaThere were 5,101 abortions performed in the state in 2019, according to the Department of Health and Environment Control.Most abortions were performed under 14 weeks from conception\u00a0\u2013 45.5% were under six weeks and 53.9% were between seven to 13 weeks. Every abortion performed in 2018 and 2019 used ultrasound to determine the age of the fetus.Over half of the women who had abortions in 2019 were in their 20's\u00a0\u2013 56.9%, or 2,903 women. About 10% were under 20 years old\u00a0\u2013 10 were under 15, 58 were 15 or 16, and 441 were 17 to 19-years-old.There were three abortions past 20 weeks of conception performed because of a medical emergency and two were due to fetal anomaly\u00a0\u2013 conditions that would make the unborn fetus unable to sustain life after birth.Follow reporter Marcus Navarro on Twitter:\u00a0@MarcusQ_Navarro.
