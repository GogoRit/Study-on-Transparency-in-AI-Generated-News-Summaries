Wade. They will not succeed, as they do not have the votes to overcome or kill the Senate filibuster. However, even if Republicans take control of the House and the Senate in the 2022 midterms, President Biden\u2019s veto pen will prevent them from passing national abortion restrictions through the end of his term in January 2025.\nBut what happens then? The path is treacherous for those hoping to preserve reproductive rights in at least some parts of the United States. It\u2019s entirely possible that Republicans will emerge from the 2024 election with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. And under those circumstances, the GOP will be under intense pressure from its base to enact federal laws that outlaw abortion even in \u201cblue\u201d states. Mitch McConnell even acknowledged on Sunday that once Roe is overturned a national abortion ban is \u201cpossible.\u201d\nRepublicans are very likely to flip the House in 2022, and that means it\u2019s likely to stay flipped in 2024. As Cook Political Report recently noted, the last time control of the House flipped in consecutive elections was 1954. Meanwhile, the Senate landscape in 2024 is truly horrible for Democrats. They\u2019ll be defending 23 Senate seats, including six in states Trump carried in 2016 or 2020. Republicans, on the other hand, will only be defending ten Senate seats, all in states Trump carried twice.\nSo the 2024 presidential election will likely be the ball game when it comes to power in Washington. And while both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama came back from midterm \u201cshellackings\u201d to win reelection, it\u2019s hardly a solid betting proposition for Joe Biden (or whoever the Democratic nominee is if he decides to retire).\nEven if Donald Trump or some other Republican is inaugurated in January 2025, and the party controls Congress, the size of the GOP Senate majority could limit their options for curtailing reproductive rights at the federal level. Republicans would have to get really lucky to emerge from the 2024 election with a 60-vote Senate supermajority. But Republicans could plausibly gain a Senate majority so comfortable that abolishing the filibuster would be more feasible than it is for Democrats today.\nToday Republicans passionately defend the filibuster whenever Democrats complain that it\u2019s arcane and obstructionist. So in this 2025 scenario, could they actually flip and nuke it themselves? Absolutely. Mitch McConnell\u2019s term as Senate Republican leader runs through 2027, and he\u2019s shown time and again that he is shameless when it comes to the pursuit and exercise of power. And if he\u2019s retired by then, his successor will likely be even more ideologically attuned to the GOP\u2019s activist base, which is intensely opposed to legalized abortion.\nTo be sure, giving up the filibuster would be difficult for a party that has relied heavily on anti-majoritarian mechanisms to thwart the popular will on so many occasions. But it was a Republican Senate that nuked the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmations in 2017, and the drive to reverse Roe v. Wade \u2014 now apparently at its omega point \u2014 was the single most powerful reason that happened. If Republicans find themselves with an opportunity to sweep away blue-state \u201cabortion sanctuaries,\u201d the pressure to end what many GOP activists call an \u201cAmerican Holocaust\u201d would be hard to overestimate. Don\u2019t let talk about Republicans caring more about tax cuts or destroying environmental or labor regulations than about \u201cdivisive\u201d cultural issues fool you. The anti-abortion movement, which supplies much of the party\u2019s grassroots energy and small-dollar contributions, has held a mortgage on the soul of the GOP for many years; it\u2019s perfectly capable of calling it in.\nPerhaps the most difficult question for Republicans on the brink of enacting federal abortion restrictions would be where to draw the line. In the past they have promoted a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the specious theory that this is the point at which a fetus can feel pain. If the Supreme Court opens the door to any restrictions lawmakers choose to impose, there\u2019s no reason to think that they will continue to advocate for a standard under which most abortions would remain legal. But do they move to 15 weeks? Six weeks? A total abortion ban? And do they recognize exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or situations where the health of the mother is at risk? There are no obvious answers to any of these questions, other than to observe that those who think of zygotes as babies will not be satisfied by half-measures.\nSenate action on abortion could also be beside the point before too long. By 2025, the anti-abortion movement may have moved on to what will almost certainly be its ultimate goal: convincing the Supreme Court to recognize a constitutional \u201cright to life\u201d for the \u201cunborn\u201d that no state and no Congress could violate.\nIn other words, all of today\u2019s Republican rhetoric about \u201cletting the states\u201d or \u201cletting the people\u201d decide abortion policy isn\u2019t going to last very long. And those blue-state residents who are consoling themselves with the thought that only red-state governments will force every pregnancy to term may not be safe for long.\n\n\nMore on Life After Roe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Republicans Have More Than a \u2018Brand Problem\u2019 on Abortion\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Can Democrats Make 2024 the Abortion Election?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Arizonans Asked to Block Themselves From Voting on Abortion\n            \n\n\n\n\nSee All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer\u00a0Newsletter\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n          Privacy Policy and\n          Terms of Service apply.\n        \nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\npolitics\n\n\nearly and often\n\n\nlife after roe\n\n\nabortion\n\n\nrepublicans\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nWhen Could Republicans Ban Abortion Nationwide?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Middleton Was Spotted in Public, With Video to Prove It\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Says He Can\u2019t Get a $464 Million Bond.
