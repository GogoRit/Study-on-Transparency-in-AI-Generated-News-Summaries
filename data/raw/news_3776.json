Today, her work comes on top of a new threat: the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\nAround the world, as governments implement lockdowns and movement restrictions, women\u2019s centres and safe spaces are closing their doors \u2013 even as evidence mounts that gender-based violence may be increasing.\u00a0\n\n\nTweet URL\n\n\nLet\u2019s spread the word, not the virus.@UNFPA is ramping up efforts to tackle #COVID19 in humanitarian settings.See how we are mobilizing in #Syria to raise awareness of the pandemic & infection-control measures: https://t.co/3KPcpkp80Y#InvestInHumanity pic.twitter.com/2E0ydAxSBt\n\n\nDr. Natalia Kanem\n\nAtayeshe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries are also seeing their reproductive health services being curbed as resources are diverted to the pandemic response. Where reproductive health care remains available, movement restrictions and fears of the virus are keeping women from seeking attention.\nAnd communities affected by humanitarian crises are particularly imperiled by these conditions. Many are already struggling with poverty and limited access to health services. Infection-control measures are even harder to implement in densely packed settlements with limited water and sanitation resources.\u00a0\nThese challenges are greatly exacerbated for women who are pregnant, require family planning supplies or need protection from violence.\nNowhere to hide\u00a0\nIn Jordan, where nearly 400 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, a curfew has been imposed to slow transmission of the virus. This has added hardship in Azraq Camp, where an average of seven people are crowded into each prefabricated shelter.\u00a0\nShe painted a picture of shop owners struggling to import essential food items, scant livelihood options and families facing difficult choices as they try to put food on their tables.\u00a0\nAnd as social life increasingly takes place online, so does sexual harassment, one woman told UNFPA.\u00a0\nThe camp\u2019s safe spaces for women and girls, run by the International Rescue Committee with support from UNFPA, have been closed.\u00a0\nAs Ms. Amin and her colleagues race to find new means of providing services to women and girls in need, she is offering counselling via telephone \u2013 but many lack the privacy needed to speak on the phone about sensitive issues while others simly do not have their own phones.\u00a0\nMs. Amin also provides assistance via text message and WhatsApp.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the women texted me on the dedicated WhatsApp number, and when I responded to her, she said, \u2018I\u2019m fine now, as I know that you are there for me in case I need you.\u2019 This meant everything to me,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a9 UNFPA Syria\n\nChallenges are exacerbated for vulnerable women and girls in humanitarian settings, including pregnant women, during the pandemic. \n\nResources vital\nIn humanitarian situations, women\u2019s vulnerability to violence and exploitation escalates. And even before the pandemic, hundreds of women and girls in humanitarian and fragile settings died each day from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Now, as health systems and protection services are stressed by the pandemic, conditions for women are poised to worsen.\u00a0\nUNFPA has urgently called for funding to the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, with a requirement of $120 million for UNFPA to ensure the health and safety of women and girls affected by humanitarian crises. In addition, UNFPA has appealed for $67.5 million to support COVID-19 preparedness efforts through March and April.\u00a0\nThis amount \u2013 a total of $187.5 million \u2013 will go, among other things, towards strengthening health systems and ensuring continuity of services for survivors of gender-based violence. It is separate from the humanitarian funding needed for UNFPA\u2019s ongoing support to crisis-affected countries.\u00a0\n\nCoronavirus Portal & News Updates\nReaders can find information and guidance on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from the UN, World Health Organization and UN agencies here. For daily news updates from UN News, click here.\nFor both UNFPA\u2019s humanitarian appeal and its COVID-19 response plan, flexible funds are needed to ensure an agile response as conditions on the ground evolve.\u00a0\nUNFPA is already ramping up efforts to address the pandemic in humanitarian settings, including in central-western Syria. Also under curfew, outreach workers are raising awareness of the pandemic, infection-control measures and women\u2019s rights.\u00a0\nIt is an uphill battle, said Ghadeer Mohammed Ibrahim Qara Bulad, director of the Women\u2019s Development Project at the Islamic Charitable Association in Homs. \u201cThe majority of the families we visit are awfully poor and cannot even buy sterilizers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nShe has also seen widespread gender-based violence and fears it will only intensify.\u00a0\n\u201cDuring my visits, I saw a woman being beaten by her husband during the curfew,\u201d said Ms. Bulad. \u201cI think the percentage of gender-based violence will increase and increase dramatically\u201d.\r\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19coronavirussyriahealth care services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              LISTEN TO UN RADIO\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nProtect \u2018healthcare heroes\u2019 from COVID-19, urges UN rights expert\n\n\nUN leads call to protect most vulnerable from mental health crisis during and after COVID-19\n\n\nEnable \u2018all out effort\u2019 to counter COVID-19 in war-ravaged Syria, urges top UN envoy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nPut women and girls at centre of COVID-19 recovery: UN Secretary-General9 April 2020\nWomenLimited gains in gender equality and women\u2019s rights made over the decades are in danger of being rolled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Secretary-General said on Thursday.\n\n\n\nUN backs global action to end violence against women and girls amid COVID-19 crisis6 April 2020\nWomenThe United Nations is advocating immediate global action to end all forms of violence against women and girls in the midst of a global upsurge related to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
