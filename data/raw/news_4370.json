Due to her advocacy including with the UN Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), she is facing intimidation, judicial harassment and defamation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Mail\n Linked in\n Whats App\n\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Mendoza, President of Associaci\u00f3 Stop Viol\u00e8ncies, is facing at least two judicial proceedings related to her activism. In one case where she received formal notification, she is facing charges of slander against the government, defamation against the co-princes and crimes against the State institutions due to statements she made to the media and her engagement with CEDAW. These charges carry up to four years imprisonment. In a separate case in relation to organising a protest in September 2019 calling for decriminalising abortion, she was brought before the police to testify in November 2019, but has not yet received a formal notification of the charges she is facing\nDuring the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Andorra, which took place on 5 November 2020, the State delegation of Andorra said that Mendoza \u2018is not risking in any case a jail sentence\u2019. ISHR urges Andorra to drop all charges against Mendoza, provide assurances that she will no longer face any intimidation, threats or judicial harassment, and guarantee her right to an effective remedy for the reprisals that she was subjected to.\nISHR welcomes the Netherlands\u2019 and Luxembourg\u2019s statements at the UPR raising concerns about the reprisals against Mendoza for her engagement with CEDAW, and recommending that the Andorran government \u2018stop the judicial harassment, the reprisals and intimidation against human rights defenders in relation to the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms and engagement with the UN\u2019, and \u201cguarantee rights in the area of sexual and reproductive health by providing access without obstacles to information, education and services on sexual and reproductive health, ensuring that persons in this sector can work without fear of reprisals\u201d, respectively.\nThe UN Secretary-General, in his 2020 annual report on reprisals, documented that the Andorra Government is taking \u2018disproportionate measures\u2019 against Stop Viol\u00e8ncies and its President for their participation with the CEDAW.\nPhoto: @aunamotionsfoto\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\nTopic\n\nFreedom of expression, association & assembly\nWomen's rights\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nEurope\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\nAndorra\n\n\n\n\nMechanism\n\nTreaty bodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inter-American Court evaluates Escaz\u00fa Agreement's protection for environmental defenders\n07 March 2024\n\n\nThe Inter-American Court of Human Rights examines the Escaz\u00fa Agreement's role in safeguarding environmental defenders, a landmark move for climate justice and human rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCivil society demands immediate intervention and thorough investigation in South Kordofan, Sudan\n01 March 2024\n\n\nCivil society organisations demand a swift, decisive action and a comprehensive investigation into the crisis in South Kordofan, Sudan, highlighting the urgent need for global intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSudan: calling for protection of women defenders amidst rising attacks against them\n13 February 2024\n\n\nCivil society is deeply concerned about reports of shrinking civic space, attacks on freedom of expression, rising militarisation, and ongoing communication disruptions in Sudan, threatening the work of women human rights defenders and women\u2019s rights groups.
