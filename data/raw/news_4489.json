Here are three of her most lasting legacies.\nUSA TODAY\n\n\nEven in death, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is making history for women.\nThe Supreme Court associate justice,\u00a0a driving force for gender equality in the United States who died\u00a0last week at age 87, will be the first woman\u00a0to lie in state\u00a0Friday in the the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0Thirty-four men have been so honored\u00a0since 1852.\nThe honor comes after Ginsburg lay\u00a0in repose at the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday,  a final visit to the high court she served for 27 years.\u00a0\nDuring those decades, Ginsburg helped act as a voice for women\u00a0\u2013 and men \u2013 in countless ways, from education to workplace discrimination and health care.\u00a0\nShe famously co-founded the Women\u2019s Rights Project at the ACLU as a lawyer, and brought and argued the cases that led the high court to affirm protections against gender discrimination.\n\n\n\n\nThough it would be impossible to list every triumph\u00a0that Ginsburg helped achieve,\u00a0we're looking back to trace some of the impact she's had on women's lives in America.\nHere are just some of the contributions \u00a0she made for women, both on a legal and personal level.\n\n\n\n1. Before \u00a0Ginsburg, state-funded schools didn't have to admit women\n\nIn the 1996 United States v. Virginia case,\u00a0Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion that it is unconstitutional for schools funded by taxpayer dollars to bar women.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no reason to believe that the admission of women capable of all the activities required of (Virginia Military Institute)\u00a0cadets would destroy the institute rather than enhance its capacity to serve the \u2018more perfect union,\u2019 \u201d Ginsburg wrote.\nSpeaking to USA TODAY, women's rights attorney Gloria Allred described Ginsburg's opinion in the case as \"groundbreaking.\"\n\"She was clear that state-sponsored educational institutions could not exclude women on account of their gender,\u201d Allred explained.\n\n\n\n2. Women couldn't sign a mortgage or have a bank account\u00a0without a male co-signer\n\nGinsburg paved the way for the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which passed in 1974 and\u00a0allowed women to apply for\u00a0credit cards and mortgages without a male co-signer.\nNaomi Mezey, law professor and co-founder of the Gender+ Justice Initiative at Georgetown University, told USA TODAY that Ginsburg's work surrounding women's financial independence laid a base for further issues of equality and independence.\u00a0\nAthia Hardt, a former Arizona Republic reporter and current consultant with\u00a0Hardt and Associates, told USA TODAY about her personal experience with a bank telling her she could no longer have her account in her name after she married, but instead\u00a0needed to be under \"Mrs. Charles Case.\"\n\"I said, 'I'm not taking his name,' and they said, 'That\u00a0doesn't matter,' \" she recalled, saying she felt \"both frustrated and angry at the system.\"\nIn a post to her Facebook page\u00a0following Ginsburg's death, Hardt shared her story\u00a0and encouraged other women\u00a0to do the same\u00a0as a way to \"honor RBG with our memories of something we encountered before she changed the world.\"\nGloria Feldt,\u00a0author and former president of Planned Parenthood, was another woman to share her experience on the Facebook post.\n\"I had been employed full time for several years and was earning more than my ex. I went to buy a car and couldn\u2019t get a loan without my husband\u2019s signature,\" she wrote.\u00a0\"That was my tipping point to feminist activism.\"\n\n\n\n3. Ginsburg helped women make strides toward equal pay\n\nIn 2007,\u00a0Ginsburg famously dissented from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the pay discrimination case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.\n\"When she was in the minority, she was a powerful voice in dissent in ways that changed the game,\u201d said Emily Martin, general counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center in Washington. \u201cFor example, when five justices ruled against Lilly Ledbetter in her pay discrimination case, Justice Ginsburg's call to action inspired the public and Congress to change the law and strengthen equal pay protections.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. Her presence on the court preserved a woman's right to choose\n\nShe was a crucial vote on the current court to keep Roe v. Wade.\u00a0Even though she had doubts about the way the monumental case was decided, she was in no doubt about women's right to choose.\nRandall Kessler, a family law and trial lawyer in Atlanta, says Ginsburg was an indispensable brick in the legal wall that has protected Roe v. Wade since the 1970s, and not just on the Supreme Court.\n\u201cNow she\u2019s gone, it means pro-choice proponents are scared to death of the unknown,\u201d Kessler says. \u201cThey believe (her death and replacement) will empower state legislatures to pass new laws or reintroduce those laws already struck down by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. She\u00a0pushed to protect pregnant women in the workplace\n\nIn 1972, Ginsburg argued that excluding a pregnant woman from the Air Force, like in the case of\u00a0Struck v. Secretary of Defense, is sex discrimination.\n\"It was standard 50 years ago for women to be fired from their jobs when they were pregnant,\" Mezey explained. \"(Ginsburg)\u00a0herself hid her pregnancy while she was teaching at a law school in order not to be told that she couldn't teach.\"\nBut as a litigator and on the Supreme Court, Martin\u00a0explained, Ginsburg changed \"what was possible for women in the U.S.\u201d\nMezey added that Ginsburg was able to identify and help address stereotypes, both positive and negative, that \"nonetheless end up creating self-fulfilling prophecies of unequal distribution of work.\"\n\"In her life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0including as a daughter, a woman, a lawyer and a mother\u00a0herself\u2013\u00a0she actually saw so much of what turned out to be profoundly unjust and unequal,\" Mezey said.\n\n\n\n6. Ginsburg argued women should serve on juries\n\nDuring the 1979 case Duren v. Missouri, jury duty was optional for women in several states because it was viewed to be a burden for women whose role was seen as the \"center of home and family life.\" Ginsburg, who represented  Billy Duren in the case, argued that women should serve on juries on the basis that they are valued the same as men.\nIn a 2009 interview with USA TODAY, Ginsburg upheld this notion, saying, \"Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.\u00a0\u2026 It shouldn't be that women are the exception.\u201d\n\n\n\n7. She was a key vote in granting same-sex marriages\n\nThe 2015 case\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges, which allowed queer women and the rest of the\u00a0LGBTQ community the right to same-sex marriages\u00a0in all 50 states, ended in a\u00a05-4 ruling. Without Ginsburg, the outcome may have been different.\nImani Rupert-Gordon, the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, told USA TODAY that Ginsburg's impact on queer women spans far beyond just the issue of gay marriage.\n\"She really was responsible for helping us expand the concept of gender discrimination,\" she said. \"It's those same types of principles that led to\u00a0the intellectual foundation that would extend\u00a0discrimination protections to other considerations\u00a0like gender identity and sexual orientation, which is important in general but especially important to LGBTQ people.\"\nMezey added\u00a0that in Ginsburg's gender advocacy, she \"opened up space for protection of people on the basis of gender identity.\"\nMore: Supreme Court grants federal job protections to gay, lesbian, transgender workers\n\n\n\n8. Ginsburg made it cool to be\u00a0a confident, hard-working female leader\n\nThough Ginsburg left her mark on\u00a0the legal world, she also had a lasting influence on women on an individual level by\u00a0being an example of a powerful woman in her writing, speaking\u00a0and work as a judge.\nAnd Ginsburg's impact on empowerment didn't stop with her generation or the next\u00a0\u2013 she's continued to energize young women. Her rise\u00a0as a pop culture icon has inspired books, movies\u00a0and even Halloween costumes for young girls.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\tA child in a Supergirl costume pays respects as Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lies in repose in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 23.\n\t\tAlex Brandon/Pool\n\n\n\u201cThat grief is about\u00a0her, about people\u2019s connection to her,\u201d said Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the ACLU who heads its newly renamed Ruth Bader Ginsburg Center for Liberty. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what an icon she became in the last 20 years \u2013 I own an RBG bracelet because someone sent it to me! I can\u2019t think of any other justice who became a pop culture icon in that particular way.\u201d\nHardt says Ginsburg's legacy has also taught others\u00a0to \"continue to do the hard work.\"\n\"She really kept going on the good fight for her whole life,\" she said. \"She really is a heroine.\u201d\nIn an interview with USA TODAY in 2013, Ginsburg exemplified this ideal, insisting\u00a0she would continue working even as others\u00a0pressured her\u00a0to step down as the oldest justice on the court.\n\u201cAs long as I can do the job full-steam, I would like to stay here,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to take it year by year at my age, and who knows what could happen next year? Right now, I know I\u2019m OK.\u201d\nContributing:\u00a0Richard Wolf;\u00a0photo illustrations by Veronica Bravo\nMore: 'I Dissent': Six books to read about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n'RBG': How Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a legit pop-culture icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n45 photos\nView the full gallery\n\nFull screen icon\n\n\n\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg lies in repose at US Supreme Court\nHer casket will be at the US Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday.
