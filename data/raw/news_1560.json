Wade last year, Louisiana Republican state Sen. Beth Mizell looked for a way to address her state\u2019s abysmal record on infant and maternal mortality, preterm births and low birth weight. Louisiana has one of the nation\u2019s strictest abortion bans, with no exceptions for rape or incest.\nMizell and her colleagues borrowed an idea from neighboring Mississippi: a state tax credit program that sends millions each year to nonprofit pregnancy resource centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers. They\u2019re private anti-abortion organizations, often religiously affiliated, that typically offer free pregnancy tests, parenting classes and baby supplies. They are not usually staffed by doctors or nurses, though some offer limited ultrasounds or testing for sexually transmitted infections.\n\u201cI see [pregnancy resource centers] as a touchpoint for pregnant women who may not know where to go for services or where to begin,\u201d Mizell said. Louisiana has roughly 30 to 40 pregnancy resource centers scattered across the state. \u201cIf we don\u2019t use everything with an open mind to give women the services they need, we\u2019re only hurting women in our state.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegislators in states with some of the strictest abortion bans are pouring millions into pregnancy resource centers, painting them as solutions to poor birth outcomes and the lack of access to adequate prenatal and postpartum care. But while Republican lawmakers have increasingly positioned pregnancy resource centers as a backstop for maternal health care, critics say those taxpayer dollars should be used to shore up more comprehensive medical and social services.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        What abortion looks like in every state \u2014 right now\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nMizell\u2019s bill, which was signed into law in June and went into effect August 1, allows both individuals and corporations to claim an income tax break for donations made to pregnancy resource centers, which the law calls \u201cmaternal wellness centers.\u201d The tax credits\u00a0are capped at $5 million\u00a0per year. Mississippi passed a similar tax credit law last year and expanded its cap this year to $10 million annually.\nIn 2017, Missouri became the first state to issue tax credits for donations to pregnancy resource centers and it recently removed its limit on how many tax credits the state can issue. Alabama, Kansas and Nebraska considered their own tax credits in this year\u2019s legislative sessions.\nThe tax breaks are much larger than those awarded for donations to most other types of charities.\nSome critics of Louisiana\u2019s new law question its cost, when so many residents struggle to get prenatal care.\n\u201cWe have many areas around the state where there are no obstetricians, no birthing centers and it\u2019s very difficult for people to get access to prenatal care,\u201d said Michelle Erenberg, executive director of Lift Louisiana, a reproductive rights advocacy organization.\n\u201cI think these centers are trying to rebrand as being maternal care centers. But they\u2019re not providing any actual medical services. They\u2019re not licensed. They\u2019re not regulated. Is that a good value for $5 million a year of Louisiana\u2019s tax dollars?\u201d\n\u2018What could be bad?\u2019\nMatt Mitchell, the CEO of Oasis Medical Center in Corinth, Mississippi, calls his center \u201cthe best first stop for pregnancy concerns.\u201d\nLocated in the rural northeast corner of the state, Oasis is a pregnancy resource center that does not offer comprehensive medical care, but does provide pregnancy tests, non-diagnostic ultrasounds, testing for sexually transmitted infections, adoption referrals, parenting classes and community resource referrals, all for free.\nMitchell doesn\u2019t think his center\u2019s role has changed since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, he told Stateline in a written statement, \u201cbut I think more people are aware of the important role we play.\u201d\nThe Southeast is home to about 900 pregnancy resource centers, more than a third of the national total, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map created by University of Georgia researchers Andrea Swartzendruber and Danielle Lambert.\n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, I think awareness about what crisis pregnancy centers are, their mission and goals, is really low,\u201d Lambert said. Her work with Swartzendruber has focused on the public health impact of pregnancy resource centers, which they found tend to be more common in states with abortion bans.\n\u201cWhen we talk to policymakers and advocacy groups,\u201d Lambert said, \u201cthe narrative is, \u2018What could be bad about helping women who are in need and pregnant?\u2019 They have images on their websites of people in white coats.\u201d\nSwartzendruber has noticed a \u201csignificant increase\u201d recently in the number of pregnancy resource centers that offer limited, non-diagnostic ultrasounds or have changed their names in ways that suggest they provide health care. \u201cBut we\u2019ve found on the whole, the services they\u2019re offering aren\u2019t in line with national medical standards,\u201d she said.\nLouisiana\u2019s new tax credit law requires \u201cmaternal wellness centers\u201d to provide certain resources to their clients, including a list of the closest OBGYNs, as well as information on applying for Medicaid and federal food assistance programs. And, as with the Mississippi and Missouri laws, the centers can\u2019t be associated with abortion providers or refer clients for abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        How data from abortion rights fights in 2022 could shape 2024\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I had put a requirement on the bill that they had to have a licensed medical provider there, I wouldn\u2019t have had buy-in from the pregnancy resource centers because that\u2019s too much of a financial burden on them and that\u2019s not the role of the center,\u201d Mizell said.\nCritics of pregnancy resource centers say they often use a bait-and-switch approach, targeting vulnerable people by offering \u201cabortion consultations\u201d or \u201cpre-abortion screenings\u201d that spread false claims about the dangers of abortion. Swartzendruber and Lambert said they\u2019ve documented instances of centers providing misinformation about reproductive health, including about contraceptives.\nSome centers, such as Oasis in Mississippi, offer \u201cabortion reversal\u201d treatment. It\u2019s a controversial practice that uses doses of the hormone progesterone to stop a medication abortion after a patient has completed the first part of the two-step abortion process. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says the treatment is not supported by science and does not meet clinical standards.\nA small 2019 study designed to test the effectiveness of abortion reversal was halted after three of the 12 participants required a trip via ambulance to the hospital to be treated for severe bleeding.\nBut Mizell said she hasn\u2019t seen evidence of danger or misinformation from the centers.\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s a paper tiger of an argument,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 40-something of these centers all over the state, including in the rural areas. They\u2019re not intimidating, and they have all of these buckets of information available and can point the pregnant person in the right direction.\u201d\nMore bang for your buck\nThe tax credit programs are structured to make donations to pregnancy resource centers far more lucrative for donors than contributions to other types of charities, said Lillian Hunter, a research assistant at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who has studied how states have amended their tax policies in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling that struck down constitutional protections for abortion.\nThis is because a tax credit allows filers to reduce their taxes owed, as opposed to reducing their taxable income.\nIf you\u2019re a Louisiana resident and you donate $500 to a pregnancy resource center and apply for a state tax credit, you\u2019ll reduce the total amount of state taxes you owe by $250, because the tax credit for that donation is 50 percent of the donated amount. If you donated that same $500 to any other charitable organization, you\u2019d save yourself just $21.25. This is because your donation would reduce your taxable income by $500, and Louisiana\u2019s top state tax rate is 4.25 percent.\n\u201cIt really privileges this type of donation over donations to every other charity,\u201d Hunter said. And while a handful of states have tax credits for other types of charitable donations, \u201cthey\u2019re not typical.\u201d\nFor example, Missouri offers a 50 percent tax credit for donations of $100 or more to diaper banks. Its tax credit for donations to pregnancy resource centers is 70 percent, which means a donation of $100 to a diaper bank would result in a $50 reduction in state taxes, but the same donation to a pregnancy resource center means a $70 reduction.\nAfter Missouri lawmakers removed the limit on how many tax credits the state could issue for donations to pregnancy resource centers, Missouri authorized more than $7 million in tax credits for the centers in the first quarter of 2022, according to an analysis by ProPublica. That jump was more than three times higher than in any other quarter.\nIn Mississippi, Mitchell said donations to his center increased after the state passed its tax credit law last year, and he hopes more businesses and individual taxpayers will take advantage of the expanded tax credit this year.\nTransparency and oversight\nIt\u2019s hard to say what the impact of the tax credits will be on birth outcomes. States with strict abortion bans and high numbers of pregnancy resource centers, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest, already tend to be states with some of the worst birth outcomes.\n\u201cMy biggest concern is that states enact these tax credits and don\u2019t invest in programs that we know work, like expanding earned income or child tax credits,\u201d said Hunter, the research assistant at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. They might spend less on maternal health or food assistance programs, she said, \u201cbecause they already have something they can point to that they\u2019re doing to help families.\u201d\nThe principal author of Mississippi\u2019s tax credit expansion this year was Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn, a vocal opponent of abortion rights. Last year, he twice blocked bipartisan efforts to expand Medicaid coverage in Mississippi for mothers up to 12 months postpartum.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        The 19th Explains: What are \u2018late-term abortions\u2019 \u2014 and why are politicians talking about them?\u00a0\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the new tax credit programs, at least 18 states\u00a0directly fund pregnancy resource centers\u00a0through state grants and by funneling federal welfare dollars to them \u2014 and many have bumped up their funding, according to Equity Forward, a research and watchdog group focused on reproductive rights.\nSome notable increases in state spending on pregnancy resource centers from\u00a02022 to 2023 include Florida\u2019s increase from $4.5 million to $25 million and Tennessee\u2019s from $3 million to $20 million, according to Ashley Underwood, director of Equity Forward.\nThe cascade of funding is thanks, in part, to organized national pregnancy center groups that \u201cshop tactics across state lines,\u201d she said. She pointed out that Louisiana\u2019s law even requires pregnancy resource centers to be affiliated with a national pregnancy center organization before they can go on the state-approved donation list.\nThe Louisiana law also requires pregnancy resource centers to self-report that they meet the criteria to be eligible for tax-credit donations, including that they offer information about local obstetricians and how to apply for government assistance programs. But the law does not give the state department of health regulatory authority over the centers.\n\u201cI just think that if our tax dollars are being put towards this, whether it\u2019s a direct program or a tax credit program, there needs to be more requirements that they show they\u2019re actually doing something to improve maternal health outcomes,\u201d Lift Louisiana\u2019s Erenberg said.\nStateline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
