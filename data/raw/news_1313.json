(AP) \u2014 South Carolina senators again Tuesday\u00a0rejected a proposal\u00a0to ban nearly all\u00a0abortions\u00a0in the state but left open a small chance that some compromise could be reached in the less than four weeks the General Assembly has left to meet this year.\nThe stalemate in the Republican-dominated Legislature hasn\u2019t changed over the past month. The Senate voted 26-17\u00a0to insist on its bill\u00a0keeping South Carolina\u2019s current ban on abortions after cardiac activity is present, which is usually around six weeks.\nThe House in September insisted on its own version\u00a0of a full ban\u00a0on abortions with exceptions only for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or if the life of the mother was threatened.\nAgain, lawmakers didn\u2019t slam the door shut Tuesday on changing abortion laws in a special session called after the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to pass whatever they wish about abortion. A conference committee of three House members and three senators has been appointed to work out differences with the bill.\nWATCH: Ahead of midterms, Biden vows abortion legislation as top priority next year\nBut the gap is quite wide, Republican Senate leaders insist they can\u2019t get a few more moderate conservatives to approve a full ban like the House proposed. The group would have to meet, reach a deal and have it approved by both the full House and Senate by Nov. 13, when this year\u2019s General Assembly\u2019s term ends by law.\n\u201cObviously it is a stiff challenge. The clock is ticking,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Richard Cash, a staunch abortion opponent and a member of the conference committee of four Republicans and two Democrats.\nSouth Carolina\u2019s current abortion ban at about six weeks isn\u2019t being enforced at the moment after\u00a0the state Supreme Court suspended\u00a0it. The justices will hear arguments Wednesday on whether that law violates a right to privacy in the state constitution.\nSenate Republicans said their version of the abortion bill solves the possible right to privacy argument. It also cuts the time that victims of rape and incest who become pregnant can seek an abortion from 20 weeks to about 12 weeks and requires that DNA from the aborted fetus be collected for police.\nDemocrats have largely stayed quiet during the debate, letting the Republicans fight among themselves and pulling in more moderate senators. They said people who support women\u2019s rights were going to lose no matter what happened because the state\u2019s abortion rules are so restrictive. They encouraged voting for Democrats for governor and other positions in November.\nFor decades, South Carolina\u2019s Legislature voted at the forefront of more restrictive abortion laws that challenged Roe v. Wade. The state led the way in the U.S. by requiring ultrasounds,\u00a0parental consent\u00a0and\u00a024-hour waiting periods\u00a0\u2014 and a ban on\u00a0abortions at 20 weeks\u00a0into a pregnancy that is right now the law.\nBut when faced with the real-world consequences of bans that have played out in the other states after the U.S. Supreme Court rulings, some Republicans in South Carolina\u00a0paused at the brink.\nREAD MORE: As states ban abortions, more people may turn to self-managed abortion care\nRepublican Sen. Katrina Shealy is the fiercest advocate for children in need in the Senate and unabashedly calls herself pro-life. But she couldn\u2019t support a total ban. She said exceptions are needed and adds time is needed to see what the roughly six-week ban does to the state\u2019s social services and health networks.\n\u201cPeople come from happy homes with lots of children and everything has been wonderful,\u201d Shealy said. \u201cBut they need to go spend days at (the Department of Juvenile Justice) or they need to go to the (Department of Social Services) and sit in the waiting room. They don\u2019t do that. They go back to their happy homes.\u201d\nTwenty-four of the 46 senators voted last month for an amendment that would have passed a similar version of the total ban approved by the House. But supporters didn\u2019t have enough votes to overcome a threatened filibuster, and the ban didn\u2019t pass the Senate.\n\u201cOnce the Supreme Court said here, y\u2019all can now make the law, some people who maybe voted more strongly pro-life in the past all of the sudden weren\u2019t so interested in voting that strongly,\u201d Cash said.\nOne thing all Republican senators agreed on Tuesday is the debate isn\u2019t over, even if they never meet again in 2022. Some Republicans want the state to declare an embryo is a person at the moment of conception, which would change a host of laws from tax policy to child support.\n\u201cEven if we work something out, we\u2019ll be back at it next year,\u201d Shealy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                South Carolina Senate members listen as Sen.
