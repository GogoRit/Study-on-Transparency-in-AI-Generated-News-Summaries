(Lily O\u2019Shea Becker/Lawrence Journal-World)\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPEKA \u2014 A regional director of the Value Them Both Coalition told a meeting of Reno County Republicans last month that the organization has legislation ready to ban abortion in Kansas if voters adopt a constitutional amendment Aug. 2.\nA state senator also told the crowd he wanted to pass laws \u201cwith my goal of life starting at conception.\u201d\nThe expressed intent to ban abortion stands in direct contrast with public statements by supporters of the constitutional amendment, who have repeatedly insisted the Aug. 2 vote is not about banning abortion. The comments support the fears of those who are working to defeat the amendment.\n\u201cWe are pleased that a Value Them Both representative was finally honest and forthright about their real goal to ban abortion completely in Kansas,\u201d said Ashley All, spokeswoman for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which opposes the amendment. \u201cWe now have confirmation \u2014 from their own campaign staff and legislative leaders \u2014 that if this amendment passes, the Kansas Legislature will move quickly to pass the most extreme ban on abortion possible.\u201d\nThe Kansas Supreme Court in a 2019 ruling said the state constitution\u2019s right to bodily autonomy includes the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Passage of the Value Them Both amendment would invalidate the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and give the Legislature unlimited authority to pass restrictions on reproductive rights \u2014 or a complete abortion ban, without exceptions.\nComments from the June 14 meeting in Haven were captured on audio obtained by Kansas Reflector.\n\n\n \nIn the audio, Lori Chrisman identifies herself to the crowd as an 18-county regional director for the Value Them Both Coalition.\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of in getting out the vote with, and knocking on doors, and making phone calls, working on grassroots initiatives on this,\u201d Chrisman said.\nAn unidentified man in the audience then asks if someone can explain what happens when the constitutional amendment passes.\n\u201cWe do have one ready \u2014 HB2746 \u2014 so we\u2019ll move that up,\u201d Chrisman said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s out there,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s not voted on or anything yet.\u201d\nThe bill she referenced was introduced this past session by Rep. Trevor Jacobs, a Fort Scott Republican. The legislation would criminalize all abortions from the moment of fertilization until birth. The felony level would be the same as murder. There are exceptions for miscarriages, stillbirths and ectopic pregnancies, but not for rape, incest, or to save the life of a mother.\nMackenzie Haddix, a deputy spokeswoman for the Value Them Both Coalition, said Chrisman is no longer with the organization and didn\u2019t speak on behalf of the coalition.\nThe proposed constitutional amendment, Haddix said, \u201cis not a ban on abortion.\u201d\nDanielle Underwood, a spokeswoman for Kansans for Life, said the organization had nothing to do with the drafting of HB2746 and that the legislation has nothing to do with the constitutional amendment. She didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether Kansans for Life would support the bill if the amendment were to pass.\nDuring the meeting, Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican who is running for state treasurer, clarified that the bill would have to be re-introduced next year, because all bills died when the session ended in May.\nSen. Mark Steffen, a Hutchinson Republican, said the state Supreme Court \u201chijacked the abortion issue\u201d with its ruling in 2019. After the amendment passes, he said, the Legislature can take action.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to make further laws, further refinement, with my goal of life starting at conception,\u201d Steffen said.\nHis comments were answered by loud applause.\nThe meeting took place 10 days before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving each state to determine its own rules on abortion. Because the Kansas Supreme Court ruling was based on the state constitution, abortion remains legal in Kansas.\nRepublican lawmakers and leaders of the Value Them Both Coalition, which includes Kansans for Life and faith-based groups, have been careful to avoid saying what legislation they intend to pursue if the amendment passes. Instead, they have focused their messaging on preserving restrictions in state law that could be challenged under the 2019 ruling. It isn\u2019t clear which restrictions, if any, would be found unlawful.\nThe restrictions currently in place include a ban on abortions beyond 22 weeks from gestation, except when a mother\u2019s health is severely compromised. Taxpayer money can only be used in cases that involve rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXKansas abortion ban is the plan, officials pushing constitutional amendment tell GOP crowd\nby Sherman Smith, Kansas Reflector July 15, 2022\nKansas abortion ban is the plan, officials pushing constitutional amendment tell GOP crowd\nby Sherman Smith, Kansas Reflector July 15, 2022\n TOPEKA \u2014 A regional director of the Value Them Both Coalition told a meeting of Reno County Republicans last month that the organization has legislation ready to ban abortion in Kansas if voters adopt a constitutional amendment Aug. 2.\nA state senator also told the crowd he wanted to pass laws \u201cwith my goal of life starting at conception.\u201d\nThe expressed intent to ban abortion stands in direct contrast with public statements by supporters of the constitutional amendment, who have repeatedly insisted the Aug. 2 vote is not about banning abortion.
