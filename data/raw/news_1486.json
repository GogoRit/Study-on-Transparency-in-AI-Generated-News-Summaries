Wade and eliminated constitutional protections that guaranteed abortion rights nationwide, the conservative majority fashioned its ruling as returning the matter of abortion policy-making to elected officials, particularly in state legislatures. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Roe, abortion access has dropped in the US, but support has not, survey finds\n\n\n\n\n            But the battle lines now being drawn around the Reconstruction-era federal law \u2013 the Comstock Act \u2013 are an example of how the picture after Roe v. Wade is far more complicated as abortion opponents are challenging the means of abortion, such as the drug mifepristone, in court.\n    \n\n            The most sweeping Comstock Act arguments from anti-abortion activists could at the very least end the availability of medication abortion, which make up the majority of abortions in the US today, and could have the effect of eliminating surgical abortions as well by restricting the shipment of medical instruments and supplies used in the procedure.\n    \n\n            \u201cComstock is really the backdoor way to remove access to abortion across the whole country,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh Law School professor who specializes in abortion law.\n    \n\n            A fight over the reach of the law and how it can be deployed is beginning to brew in court. It has also been on the radar of state and local officials. But the end goal is a GOP-led federal government willing and empowered to wield the law in a way that could make it impossible for abortion providers to operate.\n    \n\n            If the current proxy legal battles over the statute\u2019s meaning unfold in the way abortion opponents hope, enforcement of the law could be a central issue in the 2024 White House race and congressional campaigns, given federal lawmakers\u2019 power to repeal it.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nWoman calls out absent Senators Cruz and Cornyn at abortion hearing\n\n\n                            01:25\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u2018Now that Roe is gone\u2019\n\n\n            The Comstock Act, first passed in 1873, is named after Anthony Comstock, who was a special agent of the US Postal Service and an anti-vice crusader. \n    \n\n            The law\u2019s critics say it\u2019s discriminatory against women, pointing out that at the time of its adoption, women could not vote and the Supreme Court had not yet interpreted the Constitutional Equal Protection Clause to prohibit sex discrimination. \n    \n\n            The statute bans the mailing of articles or things \u201cdesigned, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use,\u201d and in a separate section, describes its prohibition as being on \u201cany drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.\u201d \n    \n\n            Prosecutions under the law were bought in the first few decades after its passage, but by the 1930s, courts began whittling down some of its provisions and enforcement of the law ceased. Congress meanwhile amended it in the 1970s to remove its ban on mailing birth control. \n    \n\n            Anti-abortion activists contend, however, that the part of the statute having to do with abortion-inducing drug remains good law, even if there was no appetite for enforcing it while the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent \u2013 which protected abortion rights nationwide \u2013 was on the books. That precedent was overturned by the high court\u2019s conservative majority last June. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Democrat unveils bill aimed to end tactic of judge-shopping to block federal policies\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cNow that Roe is gone, the law springs back into life,\u201d said Roger Severino, the vice president of domestic policy at the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, who also served as a top civil rights lawyer in the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration. \n    \n\n            Severino argued that, at least when it comes to the Comstock Act\u2019s prohibitions on mailing abortion pills, Congress is well within its powers to regulate those shipments.\n    \n\n            While prominent anti-abortion lawyers are focused on how the law applies to the mailing of abortion drugs, the maximalist interpretations being put forward by some abortion foes would mean that tools and medical instruments that facilitate surgical abortions that are shipped in the mail to clinics and other facilities would be caught in the Comstock Act\u2019s net. \n    \n\n            \u201cIf Comstock comes to life, it has power to ban abortion nationwide. \u2026 It\u2019s not just pills,\u201d Donley said. \u201cAny abortion provider in the country is going to use the mail to get the things that they need for the provision of abortion.\u201d \n    \n\n    \u2018The Supreme Court is going to have to address this issue\u2019\n\n\n            Already, the Comstock Act has played a cameo role in the ongoing, high-stakes lawsuit over the US Food and Drug\u2019s Administration regulation of abortion pills, which made it up to the Supreme Court once and is likely to land with the justices again. \n    \n\n            The Supreme Court froze lower court orders that would have curtailed access to a medication abortion drug, but litigation over its use will continue, raising the possibility that the Comstock Act could play a more central role in that case. Depending on how the legal battle plays out, it could empower the Justice Department in a possible future Republican administration to bring prosecutions under the law, which could complicate \u2013 or perhaps even end \u2013 access to abortion. \n    \n\n            In the meantime, the anti-abortion movement appears to be looking for ways to tee up disputes over whether the law is enforceable and how far it reaches. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe Supreme Court is going to have to address this issue, sooner rather than later,\u201d said Mark Lee Dickson, an anti-abortion activist who has been involved in local efforts to seize upon the US law. He sees the Comstock Act as a \u201cde facto federal abortion ban.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nCNN looks at the latest polling on how Americans see abortion rights\n\n\n                            01:57\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n            Both sides of the abortion debate acknowledge that the clearest test of what the Comstock Act means likely wouldn\u2019t emerge until a Republican takes the White House and puts in place Justice Department leadership that would be willing to enforce the law. \n    \n\n            The Biden administration has adopted a legal posture that takes a narrow view of the law\u2019s applicability, arguing that it does not prohibit the mailing of abortion drugs if they\u2019re not intended for an unlawful use. \n    \n\n            If the Supreme Court endorses the broad interpretation of the law put forward by anti-abortion activists, it would raise the stakes \u201csignificantly\u201d for the 2024 election, said Mary Ziegler, a UC-Davis School of Law professor and author of \u201cAbortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cYou would have essentially on the ballot the question of both Comstock enforcement and also potentially Comstock repeal,\u201d Ziegler said. \n    \n\n            \u201cDo I think, under a Trump presidency, they\u2019re going to confiscate surgical gloves because they could be adapted for use in abortion? No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d Ziegler added. \u201cBut the language is so broad that it really would be the license to go after a lot of things beyond just abortion pills.\u201d\n    \n\n            The Biden administration, in an internal advisory opinion released by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, argues that the law does not apply to the mailing of abortion pills if they\u2019re not being sent with the intent of unlawful use. The opinion pointed to how 20th century courts had interpreted it narrowly as excluding drugs mailed with legitimate intent. \n    \n\n            (OLC opinions dictate how executive branch agencies approach legal questions but do not have any binding effect in the court of law.) \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: Abortion-rights supporters stage a counter protest during the 50th annual March for Life rally on the National Mall on January 20, 2023 in Washington, DC.

Wade now takes it slow on abortion \n\n\n\n\n            The opinion was rolled out just before the FDA unveiled new rules around abortion pills that allow pharmacies to dispense the drug. \n    \n\n            The Comstock Act has been invoked in the challenge to the FDA\u2019s 2000 approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone, where the plaintiffs \u2013 anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations \u2013 are arguing that the FDA broke the law by failing to take its criminal prohibitions into account when approving the drug.  \n    \n\n            There are also questions about whether the law applies not just to medication abortion, but to the tools used for surgical abortions as well. A lawyer representing the anti-abortion doctors in the current FDA case told CNN they\u2019re not focused on that question while their assertions about mailing abortion pills play out in court. \n    \n\n    Under-the-radar cases touting the law\n\n\n            The challenge to the FDA\u2019s 2000 approval of the drug used for medication abortion is not the only case where courts are being asked to expound upon the Comstock Act\u2019s reach. \n    \n\n            Several towns, some in New Mexico and elsewhere, have passed local ordinances that cite the Comstock Act and prohibit business within those jurisdictions from shipping or receiving items used for abortions in the mail, as covered by the Comstock Act. Dickson, who is director of Right to Life of East Texas and has advocated for the passage of the ordinances, said part of the focus in where the ordinances are being passed is towns in the border regions of blue states that abortion clinic organizations may be eying for new facilities. \n    \n\n            The lawsuits in New Mexico state court that those ordinances have prompted may provide for another opportunity for courts to elaborate on what the Comstock Act means. The state Supreme Court is dominated by Democratic justices. But getting multiple courts to interpret the law and create judicial disagreement about its meaning appears to be part of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s strategy for encouraging the US Supreme Court to weigh in. \n    \n\n            One case is a challenge to some of the ordinances that New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez filed to the state Supreme Court early this year. His briefs argue that the Comstock Act is irrelevant to the questions before the high New Mexico court, and he is asserting that the ordinances run afoul of state law and the state constitution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendees bow their heads in prayer at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's forum in Waukee, Iowa, April 25, 2015.   REUTERS/Jim Young\n\nJim Young/Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion dominates as GOP 2024 hopefuls court evangelical voters in Iowa\n\n\n\n\n            However, a second case has been brought by the city of Eunice \u2013 a New Mexico town near the Texas border that passed its own ordinance that was not covered in Torrez\u2019s lawsuit. Eunice is asking for a court ruling that would interpret the Comstock Act as outlawing \u201call shipment and receipt of abortion pills and abortion-related paraphernalia throughout the United States, regardless of whether the sender\u201d intends the items to be used unlawfully. The city argues that the ordinance should be allowed to stand because the federal 1873 law trumps New Mexico law and the state constitution.\n    \n\n            In Texas, the Comstock Act has been raised in a wrongful death lawsuit that a man has filed against friends of his ex-wife who allegedly helped her procure abortion drugs to terminate a pregnancy. The lawsuit claims that the manufacturer of the pills has criminal liability under the law while alleging that criminal liability extends to the two people who are accused of helping the ex-wife procure the pills. \n    \n\n            Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of Texas\u2019 ground-breaking civil enforcement six-week abortion ban, is involved in both the Texas wrongful death case and the lawsuit Eunice has brought. \n    \n\n            A coalition of Republican state attorneys general, meanwhile, invoked the Comstock Act in a February letter to pharmacy chains, warning the companies that private litigation could be used to enforce the law against them if the pharmacies seek to dispense abortion pills in their states. \n    \n\n            \u201cI really believe the abortion industry is going to find themselves Comstock-ed, one way or the other,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to find these federal statutes coming down upon them one way or the other.\u201d \n    \n\n    The Comstock Act\u2019s role in the blockbuster abortion pill case\n\n\n            While those cases percolate, the case against the FDA for its approval of mifepristone will move forward and is almost guaranteed to land back before the Supreme Court. The lawsuit, however, does not make for the perfect vehicle for settling the questions about the Comstock Act\u2019s prosecutorial potency, as the FDA plays no role in enforcing the law. \n    \n\n            Instead, the plaintiffs are using the Comstock Act to argue that the FDA should have never approved the drug, which has been on the marketplace for nearly 23 years, in the first place.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe FDA went above and beyond just approving the drug,\u201d Erik Baptist, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told CNN while pointing to the distribution plan submitted to the FDA at the time showing how the drugs would be shipped. \u201cIt actually requires something of the drug manufacturer that is explicitly illegal.\u201d \n    \n\n            At least in the very conservative pockets of the judiciary where the first two rounds of the litigation over the abortion pill\u2019s FDA approval played out, the anti-abortion movement has gotten some traction with its assertions about the Comstock Act\u2019s breadth.\n    \n\n            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who issued a now-frozen ruling that would have halted the approval of the drug, agreed with the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions about the Comstock Act, calling the narrower reading of the law being pushed by the DOJ \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d \n    \n\n            The US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2013 when it put some aspects of Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling on hold but left untouched parts of the order that blocked FDA\u2019s policy allowing the drugs to be mailed to patients \u2013 suggested it was inclined to view the law the same way, even as it stopped short of fully adopting Kacsmaryk\u2019s holding that mailing the drugs violated the 1873 law. \n    \n\n            The Supreme Court, in the emergency order it issued last week, did not say anything about the Comstock Act. But legal experts anticipate that abortion foes will continue to tout the law in this and other cases.\n    \n\n            \u201cThey are going to use every effort to try to get the question of the Comstock Act before the Supreme Court,\u201d said David Cohen, a professor at the Drexel Kline School of Law and co-author of the book \u201cObstacle Course: The Everyday Struggle to Get an Abortion in America.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
