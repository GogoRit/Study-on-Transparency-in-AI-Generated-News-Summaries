Pic: AP\n        \n\n\n\nThe constitutional court issued a justification on Wednesday of a ruling in October that said aborting foetuses with congenital defects violated the constitution - only permitting terminations in cases where there is a risk to the woman's life or in instances where a crime has taken place, such as rape or incest.But in 2019, 98% of abortions carried out in Poland were due to congenital defects.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the court published its explanation, the country's right-wing nationalist government published it in a government journal, meaning a near total ban has taken legal effect. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:02\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober: Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across Poland.\n\n\n\nThe October decision prompted almost two weeks of huge protest rallies - some of which led to clashes with police. \n\nMore on Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Holyrood hears evidence from campaigners against buffer zones outside abortion clinics\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  France becomes first country in 50 years to make abortion a constitutional right\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  MPs fear watering down of buffer zone rules at abortion clinics\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nAbortionPoland\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther protests are planned in the next couple of days across the country by women's groups, as more Poles show their discontent with the government. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nProtesters marched with signs of the leading \"Women's Strike\" group and pro-LGBT rights rainbow flags.

Here's why it matters.\n\n\n\nAnother opposition leader, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, tweeted urging the government to \"save the economy, don't set Poland ablaze\".A prominent lawmaker for Law and Justice, Marek Suski, said work would begin on an entirely new abortion law that will take into account lethal defects. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nPeople light flares as they march near the ruling Law and Justice party headquarters in Warsaw, Poland.
