Planned Parenthood.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            If Margaret Sanger sounds familiar, it\u2019s because you might have encountered her in history class. \n    \n\n            A nurse and educator, Sanger opened in 1916 the first birth control clinic in the United States, which was illegal at the time. Her arrest and conviction led to a court ruling said that physicians could prescribe contraceptives to women for medical reasons. In 1923, Sanger opened a new clinic staffed by female doctors which eventually became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n    \n\n            But your history book may not have mentioned the darker side of Sanger, like her views on eugenics, a discredited belief in improving the human race through selective breeding. Eugenics practices targeted the disabled, people of color, and poor people. Sanger died in 1966.\n    \n\n            On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (PPGNY) announced that it would be removing Sanger\u2019s name from their Manhattan Health Center. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe removal of Margaret Sanger\u2019s name from our building is both a necessary and overdue step to reckon with our legacy and acknowledge Planned Parenthood\u2019s contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color,\u201d said Karen Seltzer, the chair of PPGNY\u2019s board. \u201cMargaret Sanger\u2019s concerns and advocacy for reproductive health have been clearly documented, but so too has her racist legacy.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYears before Nazi Germany tried to built a master race, millions of Americans tried to built a better, and whiter, race. A new PBS film looks at \"The Eugenics Crusade.\"\n\nEugenic and Health Exhibit, Fitter Families Contest, Kansas Free Fair\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhen Americans tried to breed a better race: How a genetic fitness 'crusade' marches on\n\n\n\n\n            Planned Parenthood is one of the country\u2019s largest providers of reproductive health services for poor women; 40% of American women who receive health care via Title X get that care at Planned Parenthood. The organization, however, is dropping federal funding over the Trump administration\u2019s rule blocking the reproductive rights organization from talking to patients about abortion services.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. She championed birth control and she supported racist ideas. Both of those things are true,\u201d said Merle McGee, chief equity and engagement officer at PPGNY, in a statement emailed to CNN. \u201cThis is about saying while we value the work that Margaret Sanger did, we recognize that in the process she caused harm. So we don\u2019t want to commemorate \u2018our heroes\u2019 in a way that doesn\u2019t reflect their actions fully, especially since women of color continue to be shamed for accessing health services and for supporting our organization,\u201d \n    \n\n            Planned Parenthood of Greater New York said it is working with a community board, the New York City Council and the community to rename an honorary street sign that marks Margaret Sanger Square at the intersection of Bleecker and Mott Streets in the East Greenwich Village area of Manhattan. \n    \n\n            The organization said the new name would be announced soon.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
