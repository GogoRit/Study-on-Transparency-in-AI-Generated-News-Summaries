Rebecca Reimer on the third floor of the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernor Kristi Noem\u2019s push to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy had the support of prominent national anti-abortion groups.But the proposal lacked support from a key organization that has held sway over state abortion policy for years. And that helps explain the proposed bill\u2019s failure.Governor Noem made abortion policy a focus of her State of the State address during the start of this year\u2019s legislative session. She called on state lawmakers to pass a Texas-style abortion ban, which prevents abortions after six weeks.\u201cThere\u2019s more we can do,\" Noem said during her speech in January. \u201cI\u2019m asking all of you to protect the heartbeats of all these unborn children. I am bringing legislation to ban all abortions once a heartbeat can be detected.\"Noem then received one of the longest standing ovations of her speech. It lasted for nearly half a minute.\n\n\n\n\n2022 State of the State Address - South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem\n\n\nBut that fanfare was short-lived. A few weeks later, the governor could not get her proposed bill introduced.When the governor\u2019s office asked a committee comprised of House leadership to take up the bill, the group didn\u2019t budge.Later that morning, Governor Noem took questions during an impromptu press conference outside of legislative hearing rooms.\u201cI was not expecting them to deny a hearing to a bill, especially from Republican leadership,\u201d Noem said.Right to Life's roleWorking quietly behind the scenes against the proposal was Dale Bartscher, the executive director of South Dakota Right To Life.When the Texas abortion law was upheld by the courts last year, Bartscher publicly called it \u201can important bill.\u201dWhen the House declined to take up Gov. Noem\u2019s bill, Bartscher said the group appreciates the governor\u2019s anti-abortion stance. But he added, \u201cPredominantly, South Dakota Right To Life, our number one goal is do no harm to a piece of litigation we have in the 8th Circuit Court, currently,\" Bartscher said. \"And that\u2019s Noem v. Planned Parenthood.\u201dThat\u2019s a case stemming from a state law passed in 2011. That law requires a pregnant woman consult with a pregnancy help center and wait for three days before an abortion. It\u2019s been enjoined in the courts since 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy\n/\n SD Right to Life Dale Bartscher\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that the passage of a Texas-style heartbeat bill will moot the litigation that we currently have in the 8th Circuit Court,\" Bartscher said. \"For that reason, we cannot support a Texas-style heartbeat bill verbiage.\u201dSome say the litigation over the 2011 law is one of the most important abortion cases in the country. Another case, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization v. Dobbs, is before the U.S. Supreme Court currently, giving the court a chance to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. That right was established by the court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.State Rep. Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, who is vice-president of South Dakota Right To Life, said the litigation regarding South Dakota\u2019s 2011 case is another opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201cAnd so, we want to make sure we preserve that case and don\u2019t do anything to harm our efforts there,\u201d Hansen said.'They're very powerful'When South Dakota Right To Life testifies on an abortion bill \u2014 whether for or against \u2014 the supermajority Republican Legislature listens.\u201cThey\u2019re very powerful and rightfully so,\" said House Majority Leader Kent Peterson, R-Salem. \u201cThey\u2019re a very strong organization and people respect their opinion on all matters that they weigh in on.\u201dPeterson said the organization represents an issue that\u2019s dear to many South Dakotans. Introducing the governor\u2019s bill could have put Republican lawmakers in a bind. Voting against the bill would have put them at odds with the governor. Voting for it would have put them at odds with South Dakota Right To Life.Voting against South Dakota Right To Life is a political risk for lawmakers. The group sends out voter guides that are influential during elections.Governor Kristi Noem still praises the organization, even after it worked to reject her Texas-style abortion ban.\u201cSouth Dakota Right To Life, for years, has been a warrior for protecting unborn lives. I\u2019ve always appreciated the integrity they\u2019ve brought to every discussion,\" Noem said. \"The challenge this year is we had a bill here to deal with protecting life and we didn\u2019t have a debate on it. I don\u2019t necessarily place the blame on Right to Life.\u201dAll eyes on Supreme CourtChanges to the state\u2019s abortion laws are an annual occurrence, and South Dakota Right To Life is a perennial force in state politics. That frustrates some, like State Sen. Troy Heinert, D-Mission.\u201cObviously they\u2019re a huge political arm,\u201d Heinert said. \u201cPeople use this issue to raise money.\u201dHeinert said the state already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. He said annual bills are used to score political points.\u201cWhat is right to life? Is it right to birth? Or is this something that we should be looking at the whole aspect of childbirth?\u201d Heinert said. \u201cIt is frustrating.\u201dThe number of abortions in South Dakota has declined since 2011, from 600 that year to 400 in 2019. There is one abortion clinic in the state. It\u2019s in Sioux Falls.Kristin Hayward is with Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Hayward said the clinic adapts to any laws the Legislature passes. She\u2019s also watching the Dobbs case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201cAnd we keep working and the clinic will continue to be open until we know what happens with Dobbs,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cJust in general, we will stay open until the last light stays on. It\u2019s important for the people of South Dakota to know we are not going anywhere.\u201dNeither is South Dakota Right To Life, which seeks to end abortion in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nPolitics\nLegislative Session 2022Top Stories\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLee Strubinger\n\n\n                \n                    Lee Strubinger is SDPB\u2019s Rapid City-based news and political reporter.
