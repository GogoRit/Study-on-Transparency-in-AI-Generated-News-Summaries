After 24 weeks, those same three exceptions apply.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single woman in Colombia who doesn\u2019t know someone who has had to get a clandestine abortion,\u201d said 29-year-old Marisol Rivera, who stood outside the court building Monday with a green handkerchief symbolising the pro-abortion rights movement.\n\u201cBut little-by-little, we\u2019re changing that.\u201d\nThe case came as a feminist \u201cgreen wave,\u201d referring to the bright green bandanas pro-choice advocates sport, sweeps across Latin America.\nWhile it is built off of decades of work by feminist activists across the region, the recent wave first gained speed in Argentina, which in December 2020, passed a law to legalise abortion and Mexico, which decriminalised the procedure in September.\nOther countries such as Ecuador also recently loosened laws to decriminalise abortion in situations of rape.\nAdvocates said it represented a major step forward for women\u2019s rights across the region, especially as other Latin American countries consider similar cases.\nWomen in Bogota celebrate in the wake of the ruling that makes abortions legal in Colombia [Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters]\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awakening of women\u2019s rights,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guillen, executive director of Women\u2019s Equality Center. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at a moment in which we were tired of being left behind \u2026 and just started reclaiming our rights. For many years we were just waiting.\u201d\nConservative ex-President Alvaro Uribe and other anti-abortion groups decried the decision with Uribe saying on Twitter \u201cthis ruling deeply offends the highest group of (Colombian) citizens.\u201d\nJose Jaime Usc\u00e1tegui, a conservative congressman, tweeted a video standing outside the court Monday throwing toilet paper rolls at the court building.\n\u201cThis is a crime. Why do Colombian citizens have to sit here silent \u2026 while five judges make a decision on behalf of 50 million Colombians,\u201d he said in the video.\nColombia\u2019s case was based on a lawsuit filed by an umbrella group of 100 organisations, called Causa Justa Por el Aborto (\u201cJust Cause for Abortion\u201d), which sought to eliminate abortion from Colombia\u2019s criminal code, and have abortion regulated under health laws instead.\nPro-abortion rights demonstrators have been campaigning for change in the abortion law in \u2013 here in front of Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court building on November 11, 2021, in Bogota, Colombia [File: Megan Janetsky/Al Jazeera]\nPreviously, women could face anywhere from 16 to 54 months in prison for interrupting a pregnancy that did not fall under the three exceptions.\nFor decades, the procedure was completely banned in the South American country.\nBeatriz Quintero, the co-founder of La Mesa por la Vida y la Salud de las Mujeres (\u201cTable for the Life and Health of Women\u201d), one of the organisations signed on to the case, got a clandestine abortion she was 18 years old in the 1970s when the procedure was criminalised.\nQuintero, now 69, said she was lucky to have sanitary conditions during her procedure, but was scared knowing that she could face criminal charges and that she had no safety guarantees.\n\u201cMany women don\u2019t have the same conditions [in their abortions], and they suffer for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are women who scrape together resources, who hide it from their families, who don\u2019t have any support.\u201d\nAnnually, 760,000 women in Latin America are treated for complications from clandestine abortions, data from the Guttmacher Institute shows. Such abortions account for one in 10 maternal deaths in the region.\nIn 2006, Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court overturned that ban and partially decriminalised abortions under the three conditions as above. On paper, Colombia\u2019s laws appeared more liberal than neighbouring countries.\nBut women \u2013 especially in poorer and rural areas \u2013 face a labyrinth of legal and physical obstacles, and stigmatisation that make access to the procedure virtually impossible.\nWhile women in more left-leaning urban centres like Bogota have easier access to the procedure, in more conservative rural areas, women often do not know their rights and restrictions are often interpreted far more rigidly.\n\nSome worry that access and enforcement of the regulations will continue to be split down that divide.\nMost abortions carried out in Colombia are done clandestinely, according to Causa Justa, making them unsafe.\nCriminal cases of abortion have only gone up since the law was changed in 2006, according to a recent report by La Mesa por la Vida y la Salud. Criminal cases of abortion jumped 320 percent from 130 in 2005, when there was still an all-out ban, to 416 in 2018.\nMinors and women from rural areas were disproportionately criminalised, the report said, and at least 42 percent of those prosecuted were victims of gender-based violence.\nThe court decision on Monday marked a symbolic step forward for the region, and could ripple to countries like Chile, where abortion is highly restricted and whose president-elect, Gabriel Boris, has promised to make the procedure freely available.\nYet the issue has still been divisive in Colombia and much of the region.\nAbout 60 percent of Colombians support the legalisation of the procedure, but only a fourth believe abortion should be completely legalised without limits like the ones currently in place, according to a September IPSOS poll.\n\nIn 2020, when the court was last considering another abortion case that maintained previous law, the country\u2019s right-wing President Ivan Duque said expanding abortion access would be a \u201cvery hard change\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life. I believe life starts at conception,\u201d he said.\nDespite Argentina\u2019s legalisation, many doctors in the country have continued to refuse to perform the procedure on moral grounds, spurring on concerns by observers that the same could happen in Colombia or Mexico.\n\u201cThere is always going to be a doctor that is going to exercise conscientious objection,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guillen of the Women\u2019s Equality Center.\nStill, for Quintero, who had a clandestine abortion decades ago, the decision marks a sign of change not just in her country, but across the region.\n\u201cThese decisions show that the world is moving forward,\u201d Quintero said.\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
