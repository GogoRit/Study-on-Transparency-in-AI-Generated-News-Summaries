Wade, alarming stories have emerged of pregnant people being denied necessary medical care in some of the 15 states that now ban all or most abortions. To name a few: a woman in Wisconsin bled for 10 days due to an incomplete miscarriage when emergency room staff refused to remove the fetal tissue; one Texas physician said they were told by hospital management not to treat ectopic pregnancies until they ruptured (a life-threatening event); and a Louisiana woman was forced to endure painful labor after her water broke at just 16 weeks, because doctors were told they could not do an abortion procedure.\u201cThese laws are doing exactly what they were intended to do, which is to cause confusion and fear among clinicians, hospitals, and health systems,\u201d said Dr. Biftu Mengesha, an OB-GYN and director of Innovating Education in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. In addition to the chilling effect abortion bans have on doctors and other medical providers, experts worry they could also make patients hesitate to seek medical care when experiencing complications related to pregnancy or self-managed abortion.  Related StoryAbortion Bans Mean More Postpartum AnxietySome of the horrifying stories in recent news also seem to be a result of hospital legal departments interpreting abortion bans in the broadest possible way, trying to avoid liability. \u201cI think the extremely detrimentally conservative advice that some lawyers are giving medical providers in states with abortion restrictions will result in death,\u201d said Lauren Paulk, senior research counsel at the legal advocacy organization If/When/How.But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. For one thing, there are federal laws that protect patient privacy and access to emergency medical care. Experts say that hospitals could be doing a better job of upholding them, and the federal government could do more to enforce them. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the rights you should have if you end up in the hospital with complications related to a pregnancy\u2014and what still needs to change in order to keep you safe:You have a right to emergency medical care.In the last month, the Biden administration has taken some steps to remind hospitals of their responsibilities to pregnant patients under existing federal law. On July 8, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take action to protect reproductive health care. In response, the Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance clarifying a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. This law requires that hospitals provide stabilizing medical care to any patient who is experiencing an emergency.The document states: \u201cIf a physician believes that a pregnant patient presenting at an emergency department is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment. When a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant person\u2014or draws the exception more narrowly than EMTALA\u2019s emergency medical condition definition\u2014that state law is preempted.\u201dRelated StoryDonate to an Abortion Fund NowEMTALA\u2019s definition of an emergency includes \u201cserious impairment or dysfunction of bodily functions or any bodily organ,\u201d which is more broad than the exceptions to many state abortion bans. But this will only empower doctors to do the right thing if the Biden administration follows up its statement with action. \u201cThe federal government took the first important step in issuing this guidance. The next important step is to enforce the statute,\u201d said Greer Donley, assistant professor of law and director of the joint degree program in law and bioethics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. \u201cThey need to make the complaint process user-friendly and go after hospitals that are violating EMTALA.\u201d Though the federal government hasn\u2019t taken action against any individual hospitals, it has signaled a willingness to go after states that try to circumvent federal law: On Aug. 2, the Department of Justice sued the state of Idaho, arguing that its abortion ban violates EMTALA. However, the state of Texas has also sued HHS, claiming that EMTALA does not cover abortion. There will likely be a lot of legal back-and-forth here, and even with federal protections, doctors say they need more support from their employers. \u201cFor individual clinicians, the potential consequences are weighty. If you are found to have violated an abortion ban, you could lose your license, face thousands of dollars in fees, or even be looking at jail time,\u201d Mengesha said. \u201cWe need hospital leadership and system leadership to support clinicians who are acting within their rights and within the law.\u201d Related StoryWho Will Protect Abortion Providers?Dr. Tani Malhotra, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Cleveland who recently joined a group of over 1,000 Ohio physicians in speaking out against the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban, agrees. \u201cWe need hospitals to say, \u2018We will back you up.\u2019 We need pro-choice legal counsel who understand the nuances of these situations. While they are there to interpret these laws in the broadest sense and understand potential legal risks, they should also be there to help physicians fulfill their obligations under the Hippocratic Oath,\u201d she said. Small hospitals without large legal departments on call may need help figuring out what new state laws mean for them, she added. President Biden\u2019s executive order mentioned convening volunteer lawyers to help protect patients, abortion providers, and hospitals, but it\u2019s not clear yet what those services may look like.You have a right to necessary medications.Even outside of hospitals, overly broad interpretations of abortion bans are affecting people\u2019s access to health care. \u201cWe also see it trickling into pharmacies, because pharmacies are concerned that they will be criminalized for providing people with the medications they need,\u201d Mengesha said. Following Roe\u2019s reversal, many patients reported having trouble accessing methotrexate, a drug that can be used to terminate a pregnancy but is also used to help control autoimmune conditions. Mengesha also worries about patients struggling to access misoprostol, which is one of the drugs used in medication abortion and miscarriage management but also has many other uses: it causes the cervix to soften and open more easily, so it\u2019s often prescribed before procedures that require instruments to be placed inside the cervix, like IUD insertion and certain cancer screenings. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, CVS\u2014the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chain\u2014directed pharmacists in several states to verify the reason patients were being prescribed both of these medications before dispensing them.The Biden administration has taken some steps to address this problem, reminding pharmacies that refusing to dispense medications related to reproductive health could violate federal law. Under the Affordable Care Act, pharmacies that accept federal dollars through programs like Medicaid and Medicare are prohibited from discriminating against patients on the basis of sex. That includes \u201cdiscrimination based on current pregnancy, past pregnancy, potential or intended pregnancy, and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.\u201d Again, how effective this guidance is will depend on how aggressively it is enforced. If a pharmacist is refusing to fill a prescription because of the possibility that you could be pregnant, remind them it\u2019s a violation of your civil rights, and let them know you\u2019ll be reporting it to HHS.Health care workers should not report you to the police for self-managed abortion.While only three states explicitly ban self-managed abortion, there are a number of other laws\u2014such as fetal harm laws originally intended to protect pregnant people\u2014that have been used to criminalize some for ending their own pregnancies or helping someone else do so. According to If/When/How, there were 61 such cases between 2000 and 2020. Shockingly, most of these people were reported to the police by health care workers. The most recent example was the case of Lizelle Herrera, who was arrested for allegedly self-managing an abortion in Texas in April. (Charges against her were ultimately dropped.) It\u2019s a common misconception among medical providers that they have to report self-managed abortion because of mandatory reporting laws. However, according to Paulk, not only is this unnecessary, in most cases it\u2019s a violation of federal law. While mandatory reporting laws vary from state to state, \u201cthere is generally no reason for a health care provider to report someone for a self-managed abortion,\u201d said Paulk. There are a few narrow exceptions to this: for instance, some states have injury reporting laws, so if someone were to resort to a less safe method of self-managed abortion, a hospital may be required to report a resulting injury to the police. \u201cFor example, if someone were to introduce a sharp object into their uterus, a hospital may have to report that injury to law enforcement. However, they would only need to report the injury itself, not the reason behind it,\u201d said Paulk.Remember that you do not have to disclose to medical providers that you took pills to end your pregnancy.\u201dThe Biden administration agrees and is taking steps to educate medical professionals about what they should and shouldn\u2019t disclose to police. HHS recently issued new guidance clarifying the much-talked about federal privacy law HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, confirming that the law prohibits health care providers from reporting suspected self-managed abortions to the police unless state law explicitly requires it.Many people who self-manage abortions now do so using pills, a highly safe and effective method that is medically indistinguishable from a miscarriage when pills are taken orally. However, some people who take abortion pills will need follow-up care, and fears around criminalization, particularly for people of color, are valid. If you end up in this situation, remember that you do not have to disclose to medical providers that you took pills to end your pregnancy.Related StoryEverything to Know About the Abortion Pill\u201cThe treatment for complications from self-managed abortion is no different than miscarriage management, so it shouldn\u2019t be treated differently under the law. No one needs to disclose that their medical emergency was the the result of a self-managed abortion,\u201d Donley said. Paulk added that providers in ban states can help protect patients by being mindful of what information they put in medical charts.It\u2019s also important to take care with your own digital security when seeking information about abortion. While HIPAA prevents health providers from disclosing information they obtain from you digitally, it doesn\u2019t protect things like your search history or smartphone location data. You can learn more in this guide to abortion privacy from the Digital Defense Fund or this fact sheet from HHS.Hospitals need to expand abortion access.Even before abortion was banned at six weeks in Ohio, hospitals in the state provided very few. According to Malhotra, they typically only did so when a case was so complicated that it would have been unsafe for the abortion to be done in an outpatient setting. This is common; nationwide, only four percent of abortions take place in hospitals. But now, as more and more patients travel to access care, hospitals in states where abortion will remain legal need to expand their abortion services, said Dr. Jody Steinauer, an OB-GYN, researcher, and director of the UCSF Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. There are many ways that hospitals can make abortion more accessible in their own communities, thereby taking some of the burden off of overbooked clinics. For example, Steinauer said some emergency departments are piloting programs where they offer medication abortion to patients who want it right in the emergency room, with no need for a referral elsewhere.Hospitals in ban states could also create referral networks to help physicians connect their patients with trusted abortion providers, said Malhotra. \u201cI used to know the clinics here in Cleveland, but I don\u2019t have all the information for clinics out of state, and with all the crisis pregnancy centers out there, it\u2019s a lot of information even for me as a physician to sift through,\u201d she said. \u201cFor patients, it could be impossible.\u201d (The federal government should also put protections in place for providers who refer patients out of state so they don\u2019t fear being sued for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d abortion, said Mengesha. President Biden recently issued another executive order directing federal agencies to \u201cstudy\u201d how they can protect patients who need to travel for abortions, but details were sparse.)One 2021 study estimated that if abortion were banned entirely in the United States, there would be a 21 percent increase in pregnancy-related deaths in subsequent years.\u201dAnd though abortion isn\u2019t banned in every state, restrictive laws are clearly already endangering people\u2019s lives, and hospitals need to be prepared to do everything they can to save their patients. One 2021 study estimated that if abortion were banned entirely in the United States, there would be a 21 percent increase in pregnancy-related deaths in subsequent years, with as much as a 33 percent increase in deaths among Black people, who already have the highest rates of pregnancy-related death in the United States. \u201cWe anticipate an increase in obstetric patients who didn\u2019t have access to prenatal care or who are experiencing complications and people who might have sought abortions because they have medical problems but weren\u2019t able to get one,\u201d Steinauer said. \u201cHospitals need to convene specialists in various areas of medicine that take care of pregnant people with comorbidities to make sure everyone is ready to respond to that.\u201d She added, \u201cClinicians should be proactively meeting with hospital leadership to make sure everyone is prepared to do the right thing for patients. We need to think about how hospitals can be a safety net and provide the highest quality care.\u201dAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowNews & PoliticsOlivia Giving Out Condoms at Gigs Is PerfectionThe Gender RefugeesBooks About Abortion That Aren\u2019t \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019The Making of the Modern First LadyAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat the Alabama Ruling Means for Future of IVFMore Women Could Be Forced to Get C-SectionsKamala Harris Launches Abortion Rights TourSanna Marin Is Still Dancing Today Should Be the 51st Anniversary of Roe v WadeKaitlan Collins Is in Her PrimeThe Candidate Running to Fight Abortion BansThe Sisters Who Survived Sandy HookAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowNewsletterContact UsMedia KitPress RoomSite MapCommunity GuidelinesAdvertise OnlineCustomer ServiceSubscribeGive a GiftEvents & PromotionsOther Hearst SubscriptionsGiveawaysA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\u00a92024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.
