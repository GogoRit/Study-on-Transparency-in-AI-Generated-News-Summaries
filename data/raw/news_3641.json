Newsroom, Oct 13, 2022 / 10:45 am\nThe 2023 theme for the annual March for Life was announced Thursday in preparation for the first march after the historic overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide.\nThe theme of the 50th annual march \u2014 which will take place on Jan. 20, 2023 \u2014 titled \u201cNext Steps: Marching in a Post-Roe America,\u201d seeks to orient the national pro-life movement as it moves to dismantle abortion across all 50 states.\nJeanne Mancini, March for Life president, said in opening remarks at an event to announce the theme that she believed the testimony of marching every year was critical in changing the hearts and minds of Americans and leading to the reversal of what many deemed to be \u201csettled in law.\u201d\n\u201cYour testimony, marching in Washington, D.C., shutting down the city every year for the largest human rights demonstration worldwide has borne fruit!\u201d she told the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo God be the glory \u2014 in overturning Roe; and he uses his faithful instruments, which is all of you,\u201d she said.\nLeaders remember the \u2018scar\u2019 on America\nThursday\u2019s event was hosted by the March for Life in partnership with the Heritage Foundation.\nIn attendance as featured speakers were Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, Jonathan Keller from the California Family Council, and Dr. Marguerite Duane, a family physician. A video from Dr. Alveda King, who couldn\u2019t be in attendance, was also played.\nDuring a question and answer session, Roberts recounted an emotional moment at a Louisiana March for Life when he was leading a student group and a young woman turned to him and asked when he thought Roe would be overturned.\n\u201cI turned to her and I said, \u2018Tiana, in your lifetime \u2014 but not mine.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Why are you such a pessimist?\u2019\u201d he recalled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe was right. I had tears in my eyes for many reasons a few months ago, as we all did, thinking about Tiana and how right she was. It's that optimism that really does inspire the next phase of work we have to do.\u201d\nWhen asked why the march wouldn\u2019t be moved to June 24 \u2014 the day Roe was struck down \u2014 Mancini explained the decision to continue marching on Jan. 22, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade\u2019s enactment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hall of remembrance in the Holocaust Museum,\u201d Mancini told the audience. \u201c[It] reminds us how important it is to remember our history and to tell the story \u2014 to tell it to our children and our children\u2019s children so that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSadly, Roe and 63 million Americans [are] a scar in our country\u2019s history,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile we celebrate that we\u2019re at this new moment, we don\u2019t not think [about] or commemorate D-Day because we got past World War II.\u201d\nFuture of the pro-life march\nKeller focused his remarks on how the battle for eradicating abortion in the years ahead was not over.\u00a0 \n\u201cWe cannot simply abandon blue states and retreat to red states,\u201d he said, warning specifically about California\u2019s intent to become a sanctuary tourism state for abortion.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nState attorneys general threaten lawsuit over Maine abortion, transgender bill\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[They] are not content to simply allow the rest of the country to become pro-life. They are fighting tooth and nail to preserve and even expand abortion,\u201d he said of recent efforts in California \u2014 like S.B. 1142 \u2014 to pay for out-of-state women to receive abortions in the state.\n\u201cThe next steps in marching in a post-Roe America are going to involve every single one of us, at every single level of government, every single level of our churches and every single level of our families,\u201d he said.\nDuane focused her remarks on combating the widespread disinformation that has emerged after the ruling, referring to false information being spread to raise fears that abortion bans will endanger women who have miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies.\n\u201cIt is simply a lie that we cannot provide appropriate medical care,\u201d Duane said, explaining that treatments for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages are not abortion, which is the intentional destruction of a human life prior to birth.\u00a0\nMancini said that the March for Life plans to be in 10 states next year, with the goal of 20 by the next. \nThe 2023 annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., will feature Tony Dungy and his wife, Lauren. Dungy served as a head coach in the National Football League for 13 seasons and is known for his pro-life stance and story of adopting eight children. \nThe musical group We Are Messengers will be back by popular demand to perform at the march, and Jonathan Roumie, who plays Jesus in the TV series \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d will be the keynote speaker at the March for Life\u2019s Rose Dinner.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nAccording to a press release, the march will end at the steps of the United States Capitol instead of the Supreme Court, where it ended every year previously, symbolizing that \u201cthe power to protect the unborn\u201d has been returned to Americans in a \u201cnew front\u201d in the battle for life.\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nMarch for Life, \nRoe v.
