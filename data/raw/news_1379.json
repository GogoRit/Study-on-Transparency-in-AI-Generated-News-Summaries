Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.That\u2019s because a long-dormant Wisconsin law banning most abortions took effect following the overturn of a national right to the procedure.But Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul is suing to block that state law.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about that lawsuit and how it could affect abortion rights in Wisconsin.What is Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion law?A Wisconsin law, first enacted in 1849, makes it a felony to perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless it\u2019s done to save a pregnant person\u2019s life.Who filed the lawsuit, and what is it seeking?Kaul filed the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court in June, just days after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. The Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services, the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and Dr. Sheldon Wasserman, an OB-GYN who chairs that board, joined Kaul as plaintiffs.The suit makes the case that the 1849 ban on most abortions shouldn\u2019t be enforced by arguing that it conflicts with and is superseded by state laws passed after the 19th century legislation was approved. That includes a law passed in 1985 that criminalizes providing an abortion only if it\u2019s done past the point of \u201cfetal viability,\u201d or the point when a physician determines it\u2019s reasonably likely that the fetus will survive for a sustained amount of time outside the womb.Who\u2019s being sued? Why has that changed?Kaul originally sued the Republican leaders of state Legislature. But those lawmakers \u2014 Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and state Sen. Chris Kapenga \u2014 asked to be dismissed from the case, arguing they aren\u2019t the proper targets, in part, because they aren\u2019t responsible for enforcing the law.Dane County judge Diane Schlipper agreed in late September to dismiss Vos, LeMahieu and Kapenga from the case after Kaul amended the lawsuit to instead name three district attorneys as defendants. Those DAs are the top prosecutors in the only three Wisconsin counties where abortions were legally provided just before the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Kaul said. Sheboygan County DA Joel Urmanski has indicated he would enforce Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban if a case presented himself, but Dane County DA Ismael Ozanne and Milwaukee County DA John Chisholm are both Democrats who\u2019ve called the 1849 law archaic and pledged not to use it to prosecute providers. What\u2019s next in the case, and what\u2019s the timeline?None of three DAs being sued responded to requests for comment from Wisconsin Public Radio on Friday. They have until Nov. 7 to respond in court to Kaul\u2019s amended lawsuit. Kaul tried unsuccessfully to speed up that timeline, but the judge denied his request to shorten the response deadline by 25 days. Having Ozanne and Chisholm as defendants could be \u201cstrategic\u201d for Kaul, because those attorneys are unlikely to put up much of a fight to defend a law they don\u2019t want to enforce anyway, said Barbara Zabawa, an attorney who owns a firm that specializes in health law compliance.Circuit court cases typically take months to resolve. And after that, Zabawa said, the case is very likely to head to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201cThe Supreme Court typically is willing to hear cases that have a lot of public interest,\u201d she said.What hurdles might the lawsuit face?Kaul said Thursday he\u2019s not aware of anyone who\u2019s been charged under the 1849 law in Wisconsin since Roe\u2019s reversal.That\u2019s one reason why Republican lawmakers argued in August that the case should be tossed \u2014 they noted the law had yet to be enforced against anyone in recent history. The lack of prosecution under the law could present a \u201cslight challenge\u201d to Kaul\u2019s case, Zabawa said.\u201cWhen a court is willing to hear a case, they\u2019re bound to only hear live cases and controversies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are restricted in their duties to only take on cases that are actually what we call \u2018ripe,\u2019 that there is an actual person that has been harmed.\u201dBut, Kaul says his suit is asking the judge for clarity, because there\u2019s a legal controversy that needs to be resolved. And, even though the DAs from Dane and Milwaukee counties have pledged not to enforce the law, prosecutors with a different approach could be elected in the future, Kaul said.\u201cThe possibility of enforcement is out there now,\u201d Kaul said in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio. \u201cWhat that has meant is that Planned Parenthood is no longer providing services in those three counties. If we get an order blocking enforcement of that law, that would allow them to resume services.\u201dWhat\u2019s the political backdrop of the case?The case is likely to drag beyond the Nov. 8 general election, when Kaul is running against Fond du Lac District Attorney Eric Toney, a Republican who\u2019s said he would enforce the 1849 abortion law.Also running for reelection is Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, a proponent of abortion rights who\u2019s lent his administration\u2019s support to Kaul\u2019s lawsuit. Evers faces Republican businessman Tim Michels, who previously said he supports the 1849 abortion law as it stands, but subsequently amended that position to say he\u2019d support exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.Gracie Skogman, the legislative director of Right to Life of Wisconsin, said Kaul has been \u201cderelict in his duties\u201d by engaging in a court battle to block the abortion law. \u201cOur hope is that voters vote in favor of candidates who would enforce the law who would do their duty,\u201d she said. \n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide abortion lawsuit without lower court ruling \n\n \n\n\n\nSheboygan County DA to appeal ruling that abortions are legal to Wisconsin Supreme Court \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA vows to appeal Dane County ruling on Wisconsin abortion law \n\n \n\n\n\nIn victory for abortion rights, Dane County judge rules 19th century law does not ban abortions in Wisconsin \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
