I. McBurney\u2019s courtroom. Both sides will file more briefings next month, pushing a ruling on the controversial law out beyond the Nov. 8 election.\nThe attorneys representing the health care providers and abortion rights advocates who are challenging the law argue the law is far too restrictive and has left health care providers skittish to perform an abortion that may qualify under the exceptions allowed.\nThey argue the law, which took effect in July after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, should be thrown out and the issue put on the ballot for voters to decide.\u00a0\nUnder the law, medical providers risk being charged with a felony \u2013 and potentially losing their license.\n\u201cThe medicine hasn\u2019t changed, and the counseling and the risks are the same,\u201d said Dr. Martina Badell, who is the director of the Emory Perinatal Centers. \u201cThe difference is that now as (health care) providers in the state, we have to balance the risks of criminal prosecution if we were to proceed with an abortion versus what we think might be the best medical decision that a patient makes for her body.\u201d\nBadell said she has stopped offering what is called a multifetal pregnancy reduction, which is a procedure that reduces the number of fetuses if, for example, a woman is expecting triplets.\nThe lack of certainty surrounding what exactly qualifies as a medical emergency has left Badell feeling like her hands are tied, she said.\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking to tell someone \u2013 and if they\u2019ve come to the conclusion that that\u2019s the right thing for their family \u2013 that I have to say, \u2018Well, I wish you the best and good luck. I hope you have the resources and the wherewithal to navigate getting the care that you desire,\u2019\u201d she said.\nEven more harrowing, she said, is trying to decide when a threat to a woman\u2019s life is sufficient for medical intervention under the law.\n\u201c\u2018Necessary to prevent a death\u2019 \u2013 is that a death that we think is 1% likely? 10% likely? 20%?\u201d Badell said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at what risk of death to the pregnant person would qualify as \u2018necessary.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nBut a North Carolina physician testifying in defense of the law argued the restrictions do not prevent Georgia physicians from performing a multifetal pregnancy reduction since not doing so could potentially harm a woman\u2019s reproductive system.\nIn addition to life-threatening situations, Georgia law allows an abortion if it is deemed necessary to prevent \u201csubstantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of a pregnant woman.\u201d\nThe law also still allows abortions if the fetus is considered \u201cmedically futile\u201d based on \u201creasonable medical judgement,\u201d which critics of the law argue is also too vague.\n\u201cWe make gut-wrenching decisions all day long every day,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Wright, a specialist in maternal fetal medicine who does not practice in Georgia. \u201cI mean, when I answer that call, it ain\u2019t gonna be no kitty or puppy, right? It\u2019s gonna be another gut-wrenching decision and that\u2019s what we do as maternal fetal medicine specialists.\u201d\nAnti-abortion advocacy ties\nAnother witness for the state, Dr. Ingrid Skop, argued caring for pregnant women has always been a risky field.\nSkop is the director of medical affairs for the Charlotte Lozier Institute, which is affiliated with the anti-abortion advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. A Florida judge questioned Skop\u2019s credibility after she defended the state\u2019s 15-week ban this summer.\n\u201cIt is part of our job to recognize we may make a decision and someone may second guess that decision,\u201d Skop said Tuesday in the Atlanta courtroom. \u201cSo that has always been the case.\n\u201cI understand the word \u2018felony\u2019 is scary. I get that. But there is nothing that this law is telling doctors to do or not do that we haven\u2019t always done. We\u2019ve always intervened when we needed to to save a woman\u2019s life.\u201d\nAnother supporter of Georgia\u2019s law, Priscilla Coleman, also brought her controversial argument that abortions are harmful to women\u2019s mental health. Georgia\u2019s law excludes psychiatric illnesses from the medical emergency exception, including if the woman is at risk of committing suicide.\n\u201cYou\u2019re likely to feel even worse if you abort. It\u2019s not going to fix your problem,\u201d Coleman said.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, who are with the ACLU of Georgia and the Center for Reproductive Rights, also cast doubt on Coleman\u2019s credibility by showing some of the reviewers of her study are affiliated with anti-abortion advocacy groups.\nThe judge questioned the rationale for the mental health exclusion in the law.\u00a0\n\u201cBut if the medical professional \u2013 a psychiatrist \u2013 the medical professional determined, \u2018Hey, this is someone who will not feel better if she carries to term, and it\u2019s my diagnosis that she\u2019s likely going to kill herself if she is not able to end the pregnancy.\u2019 How is that a better outcome to say that\u2019s not a medical exception? I\u2019m just trying to understand the data that would support that outcome,\u201d McBurney said.\nColeman dismissed the scenario as an individual case.\n\u201cWhen laws are made, they should be made to address what\u2019s best for most individuals in the state,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCourt witnesses debate role of exceptions in Georgia abortion law; judge\u2019s decision to come later\nby Jill Nolin, Georgia Recorder October 26, 2022\nCourt witnesses debate role of exceptions in Georgia abortion law; judge\u2019s decision to come later\nby Jill Nolin, Georgia Recorder October 26, 2022\n Health care providers at the center of a lawsuit challenging Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban say the new law has limited their ability to care for patients whose wellbeing may be at risk.\u00a0\nBut attorneys for the state invited out-of-state medical providers \u2013 including a Texas obstetrician and gynecologist whose credibility was questioned by a Florida judge this summer \u2013 to make the case that Georgia\u2019s law leaves room for physicians to use their best judgment when faced with a medical emergency threatening the life of a pregnant woman.\nThe debate over the narrow exceptions included in Georgia\u2019s abortion ban were at the center of a two-day proceeding focused on whether the state\u2019s six-week ban on most abortions runs afoul of the state constitutional right to privacy.\u00a0\nThe trial played out in downtown Atlanta \u2013 just a couple blocks away from where the law was passed in 2019 \u2013 in Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert C.
