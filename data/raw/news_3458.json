Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, one of the last lawmakers on Capitol Hill calling himself a \u201cpro-life Democrat,\u201d said Tuesday he would support a bill to write abortion rights into federal law following the Supreme Court\u2019s leaked draft decision that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.Casey, serving his third term, is not just any Democrat in the abortion debate. His father, a former two-term governor of Pennsylvania who opposed abortion rights, signed legislation that spawned another landmark abortion case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your morning with today's news on Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Sen. Casey is in the position of watching the Supreme Court potentially overturn Roe v. Wade two years before he faces reelection while his party\u2019s activists mobilize against any such decision.He is casting his new position as a reaction to what he characterizes as an unforeseen move by Republicans in Congress to try to effectively ban abortion nationwide.Casey said he will support the Democrats' bill, if there is a final vote on it. And he said he has never voted for \u2014 and does not support \u2014 a complete ban on abortion.\u201cI think a lot of Americans are just beginning to understand the Republican position, which is, in many cases, not just a ban, but in a lot of states a ban without exception,\u201d Casey said in an interview.He told Politico in 2018 \u201cthat the description of pro-life Democrat is accurate:\" for him.But he told the AP on Tuesday that Republicans in Congress have moved from decades of saying they wanted states to have a say over abortion to pursuing legislation to ban it everywhere after six weeks \u2014 before many women even know they are pregnant.\u201cI think that\u2019s a new and substantial development in their approach,\" he said.A vote on legislation by Senate Democrats to preserve abortion rights nationwide will not come to the floor if Democrats can't come up with the votes necessary to bypass procedural hurdles. They are expected to fail on a Wednesday test vote.Casey has won his Senate races campaigning as an anti-abortion Democrat, even as advocates accuse him of abandoning the cause through his more moderate positions.\u201cBecause of his actions and words, I think Sen. Casey has abandoned legitimate use of the pro-life label,\u201d said Michael Geer, president of the Pennsylvania Family Institute, which opposes abortion rights.\n\n\nNews from WESA\n\n\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro wants to spend $80M to attack Pennsylvania's housing crisis. Here's how.\n\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s climate emissions aren\u2019t falling quickly enough to meet 2030 climate goals\n\n\nAllegheny County agrees to settlement in ballot drop-off case\n\n\n\n\nAfter the draft opinion emerged last week, Casey said he had \u201cserious concerns about what overturning almost 50 years of legal precedent will mean for women in states passing near or total bans on abortion.\u201dAs for the Senate, he said, \"Congress should be working to reduce the number of abortions and unintended pregnancies and doing much more to support women and families.\u201dIn the past, he has pushed for policies that he says are proven to reduce the number of abortions, such as boosting support for health care, contraception and programs that support women and children.Still, Casey, in 2018 and 2020, broke with Democrats in voting to advance bills to ban abortions after 20 weeks and has said he supports the so-called Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion.But he also has voted with Democrats to support federal funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception.Casey opposed all three of former President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees for the Supreme Court who now form half of its conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nPolitics & Government\nTop StoryBob CaseyAbortion Rights\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarnoush Amiri | Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\n                        See stories by Farnoush Amiri | Associated Press\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc Levy | Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\n                        See stories by Marc Levy | Associated Press\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a tip for the WESA newsroom?
