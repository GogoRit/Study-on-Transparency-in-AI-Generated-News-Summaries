The top prize is a $1,000 scholarship to a Catholic high school in the archdiocese.\nThe student who places second will receive a $700 scholarship and the third-place award is a $300 scholarship.\nAn announcement about the contest said it\u2019s meant to \u201cengage young people in our Catholic faith, help them grow in their relationship with Christ and come to a better understanding of what it means to become a living witness to the gift of life.\u201d\nSpecifically, the contest lists three objectives that flow from the theme of this year\u2019s Respect Life Month, which is celebrated in October: \u201cLive the Gospel of Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo help young people deepen their understanding of our God-given human dignity.\u201d\n\u201cTo move hearts and minds with the joyful Gospel of Life through the written expressions of the young participants.\u201d\n\u201cThrough learning and writing about the spectrum of Pro-Life issues, these students will be prepared and motivated to become involved in actualizing the corporal and spiritual works of mercy.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church in the United States will continue to observe the theme through September of 2021. Catholics, according to the announcement, are called to \u201c \u2018Live the Gospel of Life,\u2019 whereby we are called to imitate Christ and follow in his footsteps,\u201d carrying out the works of mercy, which are \u201cthe foundation of what it means to be Pro-Life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTags from the storyArchdiocese of Louisville\u2019s Family Ministries, knights of columbus, live the gospel of life, Respect Life Essay Contest\n\n\n\n Facebook \n\n Twitter \n\n Pinterest \n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWritten By\n\r\n            The Record        \n\n\n\n\n\r\n                More from The Record            \n\n\n\n\nPastors, administrators appointed\n\n\n\r\n                        Archbishop Joseph E.
