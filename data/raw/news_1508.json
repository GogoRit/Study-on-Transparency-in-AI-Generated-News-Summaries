Sign up for our daily newsletter.\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday signed into law a bill that repeals a 1931 abortion ban, cementing access in the state and fulfilling a promise she made during her reelection campaign.\nWhitmer signed the legislation surrounded by Michigan doctors, lawmakers and abortion advocates.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a long overdue step, and it proves that when we keep fighting to protect everyone\u2019s ability to make their own decisions about their bodies, we can win,\u201d she said.\nWhitmer, who has called the policy a \u201czombie law,\u201d wrapped her remarks by asking the audience: \u201cWho would like to watch me slay a zombie?\u201d\nThe 1931 law, which banned most abortions except to \u201cpreserve the life\u201d of the pregnant person and included criminal penalties for health providers, had been in legal limbo for months following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last June that overturned Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50-year-old ruling that affirmed federal abortion rights.\n\u201cThis 1931 law, it\u2019s been sitting here, sort of ominously staring at us, waiting for the moment when the Supreme Court did the awful thing they did,\u201d said Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes. \u201cThis is really how you show that Democrats deliver. We\u2019ve been talking about doing this work, making sure that we can protect the rights of women in this state, for a very long time. And finally, today, the governor gets to sign the law that does that.\u201d\nRep. Laurie Pohutsky, who sponsored the bill to repeal the ban, noted that the legislation dated back to 1846, before it was codified in 1931. She said documented debate back then around the policy makes it clear that it was never about the health or safety of anyone.\n\u201cIt was created by men in power to control and stifle the independence of women, plain and simple,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s really satisfying that there is a group of women holding power that are about to repeal it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Threats against Michigan women leaders highlight ongoing concerns over political violence\n                \n\n\n\n                    Democrats who flipped statehouses in 2022 are prioritizing abortion access in 2023\n                \n\n\n\n                    Democrats went all-in on abortion. For many, it worked.\n                \n\n\n\n\nMichigan Democrats\u2019 work to repeal the ban goes back months before they gained a trifecta of power in state government last November. After the Supreme Court ruling, Republicans sought to revive decades-old abortion restrictions \u2014 like Michigan\u2019s 1931 law \u2014\u00a0that were never formally taken off state statutes. Whitmer was among the Democratic governors who then took legal action and committed to shore up abortion access in their states.\nEven before the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Whitmer was vocal about what she saw as the importance of campaigning on abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a choice here. We have to talk about it,\u201d Whitmer told The 19th just days before the Supreme Court overturned Roe. \u201cThis is going to have a dramatic impact on the lives of millions of people in my own state and not much less across the country. Abortion care is health care.\u201d\nThe legal questions about the 1931 law were playing out at the same time that advocates in Michigan got enough public signatures to bring a ballot measure to voters that would enshrine abortion protections to the state constitution. The measure overwhelmingly passed, one of several ballots around the country that favored abortion rights. The ballot measure ensured that the 1931 law would not go into effect. The repeal bill cemented that.\nAmong the attendees at Wednesday\u2019s signing was Dr. Omari Young, an obstetrician gynecologist from Flint, Michigan, and a member of the Committee to Protect Health Care, which advocated for the ballot measure.\nYoung called the signing a \u201csignificant\u201d day for physicians and patients in the state given how uneven the access landscape has become following the overturning of Roe. He noted that surrounding states have further restricted abortion, making Michigan a haven for out-of-state residents.\n\u201cThe efforts by physicians, advocates, Governor Whitmer and our policymakers showed that there\u2019s overwhelming support for access to safe abortion care and allowing patients and women to make informed decisions with their providers and their family regarding access to abortion care,\u201d Young said.\nWhitmer signing the legislation comes a day after liberals flipped control of the state Supreme Court in neighboring Wisconsin, where abortion is currently inaccessible. The Wisconsin high court, soon to be dominated by liberal justices, is likely to hear a legal challenge to the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban that went back into effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Midwesterners, though, have shown we are the practical people we always knew,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get discouraged, we get to work.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nBarnes said if Democrats win political power in other states, they should heed that advice. She noted the range of policy moving through the Michigan legislature this year.\n\u201cThese folks ran on these issues, made promises to the voters that they would take care of these issues \u2014 LGBTQ issues, abortion, right to work, the whole list \u2026 I think that\u2019s the message that other Democrats around the country could pick up: Let\u2019s get it done\u201d she said.\nBarnes also predicted that abortion would continue to impact elections around the country.\n\u201cI think that voters are going to hold Republicans accountable at the ballot box again for attempting to block women\u2019s rights to this sort of health care, this sort of access,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThis is going to continue to be a conversation they have not just here in Michigan but nationally.\u201d\nGrace Panetta contributed to this report.\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan court extends block on 1931 abortion ban\n\n\n\n\nWith Roe overturned, governors in states like Michigan will shape what comes next\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats in statehouses look to ensure abortion rights as future of Roe v.
