ReeseAugust 04, 2020(AP Photo/Alex Brandon; CNS photo/Bob Roller)\u00a0RNS) \u2014 Many Americans assume the U.S. Catholic bishops are diehard supporters of Donald Trump. True, when it comes to pro-life issues and religious freedom, the bishops are in Trump\u2019s corner, but on several issues, they strongly criticize the administration.\u00a0This nuance is what sets the Catholic bishops apart from white evangelical leaders, who tend to support the president on almost every issue. Nor do the bishops as a whole endorse any candidate. Bishops as individuals, like other citizens, can legally make endorsements as long as they don't use church money in doing so. Since the bishops do not endorse candidates, each party emphasizes the points on which the bishops agree with them, especially in a presidential election.\u00a0To examine just how the bishops have responded to Trump, I looked at over 160\u00a0press releases\u00a0dealing with public policy issues from January 2019 through July 2020, published on the website of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the authoritative voice of the U.S. bishops on public policy.\u00a0There's no doubt that the bishops make a priority of abortion and other pro-life issues: More than 30 press releases addressed life topics in the past 19 months. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the President\u2019s pro-life commitment,\" one release said, \"and for all the actions this administration has taken to protect unborn children and their mothers from the violence of abortion.\u201d\u00a0The bishops made clear their opposition to fetal tissue research, assisted suicide, government funding of abortion, as well as their support for state and federal restrictions on abortion. They welcomed the re-institution of the Mexico City Policy \u201cto ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not used to perform or promote abortion internationally.\u201dThe bishops consistently sided with the administration on issues of domestic and international religious freedom.Seven releases address freedom of conscience protection. They hailed measures allowing healthcare workers to opt out of performing or assisting with abortions or other procedures they see as immoral. They were also delighted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in favor of the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns who opposed the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate.Another dozen or so releases stood by the administration's positions on issues affecting LGBTQ persons. The bishops voiced opposition to the Equality Act, which would extend the discrimination protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to gay and transgender people, and which passed the House in May. They were disappointed when the Supreme Court, in June's landmark decision in\u00a0Bostock v. Clay County, Georgia, ruled that LGBTQ individuals were covered by the act.The bishops also commended a proposed rule change that would allow faith-based adoption agencies to decline services to gay married couples without being excluded from federal aid as a result.\u00a0In a dozen other press releases, the bishops supported expanding government aid to faith-based agencies, including education, another issue on which the bishops and the administration saw eye to eye.\u00a0None of these points of intersection with the Trump administration policies is surprising, but they are only half the story. The bishops and Trump were often in conflict on immigration, foreign policy, the death penalty and the environment, among other issues.In 22 press releases on immigrants and another 13 on refugees, the bishops attacked the administration\u2019s policies as \u201cmisguided and untenable,\u201d \u201cunacceptable,\u201d \u201cappalling,\u201d \u201cdevastating,\u201d \u201cvery concerning,\u201d \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d \u201cunlawful and inhumane,\u201d \u201cterrible,\u201d \u201ccallous,\u201d \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201ccontrary to American and Christian values.\u201dThese are not words used by starry-eyed supporters.The bishops spoke out strongly and frequently in support of the DACA program that protects from deportation those who were brought to the United States illegally as small children. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that the Administration continues to push forward to end DACA,\" they said.\u00a0They consistently argued that migrants and refugees should be welcomed and treated with compassion, arguing that instead the administration\u2019s actions have \u201ccreated a climate of fear in our parishes and communities across the country.\u201dIn all the bishops made more than 40 statements defending immigrants and refugees and opposing travel bans and family separation.\u00a0For example, the bishops were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the impact of the administration\u2019s changes in the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule, making it easier to deport immigrants who tried to access government services.\u201cIn our experience serving the poor and vulnerable,\u201d they reported, \u201cwe know that many immigrant families lawfully access important medical and social services that are vital to public health and welfare.\u201dThe bishops also found fault with a new rule from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that would take away housing benefits from any household with an undocumented member.RELATED STORIES How Trump and Biden are courting Catholic votersMichael J. O\u2019Loughlin On their call with Trump, the bishops were right to highlight the plight of Catholic schoolsMatt Malone, S.J.\u201cThe proposed rule would have terrible consequences for thousands of mixed-status families,\u201d complained the bishops. \u201cIt would force these families to make a heartbreaking choice \u2014 endure family separation so that eligible members can continue to receive critical housing assistance or stay together and forfeit any such assistance. This choice between unity and stability is one no family should have to make.\u201dThey railed against the facilities used to detain immigrants.\u201cReports of overcrowded and unsanitary conditions are appalling and unacceptable for any person in U.S. custody, but particularly for children, who are uniquely vulnerable,\u201d said the bishops. \u201cSuch conditions cannot be used as tools of deterrence. We can and must remain a country that provides refuge for children and families fleeing violence, persecution, and acute poverty.\u201dThe bishops, along with their Mexican counterparts, also opposed Trump\u2019s wall, saying it \u201cfirst and foremost is a symbol of division and animosity between two friendly countries.\u201d They were also \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the president circumventing \u201cthe clear intent of Congress to limit funding of a wall.\u201d The bishops said that they \u201cremain steadfast and resolute in the vision articulated by Pope Francis that at this time we need to be building bridges and not walls.\u201dThe treatment of asylum seekers at the border was also a major concern of the bishops in opposing new rules and regulations that \u201ceviscerate our current asylum system.\u201dThey further noted that \u201cthe Catholic Church teaches us to look at the root causes of migration, poverty, violence, and corruption.\u201dThe bishops frequently disagreed with the administration on foreign policy as well. They opposed withdrawing from the INF Treaty and allowing the START Treaty to expire and urged more efforts toward nuclear disarmament. They called \"on our national and world leaders to persevere in their efforts to abolish these weapons of mass destruction, which threaten the existence of the human race and our planet.\"They also continued to encourage trade, tourism and cultural exchanges with Cuba, calling the embargo \u201cunproductive.\u201dAnd while the president was escalating his rhetoric against Iran, they called for \u201cnecessary diplomacy, courageous dialogue, and tireless efforts toward peace to resolve such global conflicts.\u201d They also stated that the unilateral withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement and the imposition of added economic sanctions have \u201cexacerbated tensions with close allies and other world powers.\u201dWhile not radical, the language of the bishops on \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protests is much more sympathetic than the president\u2019s.\u201cThe killing of George Floyd was senseless and brutal, a sin that cries out to heaven for justice,\u201d said the president of the bishop\u2019s conference, Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez, the archbishop of Los Angeles. \u201cWe should all understand that the protests we are seeing in our cities reflect the justified frustration and anger of millions of our brothers and sisters who even today experience humiliation, indignity, and unequal opportunity only because of their race or the color of their skin.\"In another release, seven USCCB chairs wrote, \u201cRacism is not a thing of the past or simply a throwaway political issue to be bandied about when convenient. It is a real and present danger that must be met head on.\u201dFinally, when it came to addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the bishops were most concerned about getting healthcare and economic help \u201cfor those most vulnerable: the poor, the elderly, the homeless, those in prison or detention facilities, immigrants and refugees, and those with severe underlying health conditions.\u201dThe chair of the USCCB Domestic Justice and Human Development Committee said he had \u201csent five letters to express this touchstone principle to Congress and its various committees.\u201d \u00a0The bishops noted the need for \u201csufficient protective equipment for all essential workers, protection of familial well-being and integrity, additional research on the link between air pollution and coronavirus health outcomes, and the need to address disruptions to the food supply chain and its impact on farmers and farmworkers, food waste and public health.\u201dThey supported increases in paid sick leave and food security programs, including SNAP and the Emergency Food and Shelter Program.Although they praised the CARES Act, they found it \u201cdisappointing that certain aid and relief was not extended to the undocumented, and extremely concerning that testing and access to health care coverage was denied to certain immigrants.\u201dWhen it comes to abortion and religious freedom, the bishops are allies of the Republicans and President Trump, but on many other issues the bishops are his strong and vocal opponents. Catholic Democrats, like Joe Biden, are cheered by the bishops' positions on social justice, but Republicans have been much better at portraying the bishops as being in their corner.RELATED STORIES How Trump and Biden are courting Catholic votersMichael J. O\u2019Loughlin On their call with Trump, the bishops were right to highlight the plight of Catholic schoolsMatt Malone, S.J.Clearly the bishops take social justice issues much more seriously than does the president, but this may be overshadowed in the media when bishops attack Catholic Biden for his positions on abortion. The media tends to give much more attention to the bishops' disagreements with Biden than to their differences with Trump.\u00a0More: US Church / US Politics / Donald Trump / BishopsThomas J.
