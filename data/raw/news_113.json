Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, in the Senate Chamber in Salt Lake City on Thursday Dec. 12, 2019 as lawmakers hold a special session focusing on tax reform.By Benjamin Wood\u00a0\u00a0| Feb. 29, 2020, 1:41 a.m. | Updated: 4:11 p.m.Members of the Utah Senate voted overwhelmingly, and along party lines, in favor of legislation that would ban elective abortions in the state in the event that Supreme Court precedent on the subject is overturned.But while the outcome of Friday\u2019s vote was unsurprising, the debate over SB174 took something of a turn when Salt Lake City Democratic Sen. Luz Escamilla attempted to add an amendment that would legally prohibit any male ejaculation that occurs outside of a vagina.\u201cMy amendment, what it does is make sure that men play a part and are accountable for their actions as well,\u201d Escamilla said.The bill\u2019s sponsor, Riverton Republican Sen. Dan McCay, initially responded with levity to Escamilla\u2019s motion, saying he would have to \u201cdeclare a conflict,\" which drew laughter from some senators.The amendment\u2019s language would add \u201cmasturbation; coitus interruptus; or any other method used to cause an ejaculation\u201d to the definition of an abortion.McCay went on to speak against the amendment, saying it could be insensitive to \u201cour LGBTQ community.\u201dSen. Dan Thatcher, R-West Valley City, said that while some may have reasons to oppose the underlying abortion ban, he didn\u2019t find it appropriate or funny that Escamilla was using her amendment to oppose the bill.He compared his opposition to abortion to his opposition to the death penalty, saying the sanctioned murder of human being should be allowed only in the most extreme circumstances.\u201cA sperm is not a human life \u2014 any more than an egg is \u2014 and we\u2019re not talking about sperm and we\u2019re not talking about eggs,\u201d Thatcher said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about human life. We are talking about a living being and whatever other problems may exist with this legislation, at the end of the day, how can I say that I believe it is ethical or moral or correct to end a human life.\u201dEscamilla protested that her motion was \u201cnot a joke \u2014 it\u2019s a serious issue\u201d to draw the role of men, who are so often left out of the equation, into the debate over responsibility.Senators overwhelmingly rejected Escamilla\u2019s amendment, before voting 21-6 to approve the abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of a mother. The bill requires a final vote of the Senate before moving to the House for consideration.Before receiving an abortion in Utah, a woman must complete a 72-hour waiting period and watch an information module that says the state prefers childbirth to abortion. Lawmakers are also considering legislation this year that would require the burial or cremation of fetal remains and force women to receive an ultrasound before an abortion.Even though SB174 would not take effect in the state until the U.S. Supreme Court revisits the subject of abortion, Sen. Lyle Hillyard, R-Logan, said the bill has merit because it indicates the state\u2019s thinking on the topic.\u201cI think by passing this law, we give a signal to the courts that we as the state of Utah are willing to go back to where it was or where it should be, and don\u2019t want it to go any further,\u201d he said.Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, urged his colleagues to oppose the bill. He said that if Roe v. Wade \u2014 the nation\u2019s landmark court case on abortion \u2014 is ever overturned, McCay\u2019s legislation would not end abortions in the state, but instead would end safe abortion.\u201cRoe v. Wade did one thing, it told women you don\u2019t have to go to those back alleys,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go and find a coat hanger and maybe a young lady, a friend of yours, who knows how to use it on you.\u201dMcCay, who said he sponsored the legislation because he \u201cwas prodded gently by [his] loving wife,\u201d said that government\u2019s primary function is to protect life, and that a person\u2019s rights end where they cause pain to another person.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night for the definition we currently have for a baby,\u201d he said.bwood@sltrib.comFollow @bjaminwoodDonate to the newsroom now.
