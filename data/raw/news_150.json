Under a new law, which has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge, criminal charges could be brought against doctors who perform abortions, but not women receiving them.\n\n\nFull Story\u00a0\nA popular Instagram post attempts to shed light on a controversial abortion law approved in Alabama last year, but it doesn\u2019t get all the facts right.\n\u201cIn Iran if a 12-year-old girl is raped and impregnated by her father, she must carry the baby to term, or be thrown in prison for life. Wait, sorry, no. That\u2019s Alabama,\u201d the post reads.\nAlabama\u2019s abortion law \u2014 known as the Alabama Human Life Protection Act \u2014 would indeed ban most abortions. It was signed by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey on May 15, 2019.\nBut the law is not currently in effect, an important detail the social media post leaves out. While the law was scheduled to take effect in November 2019, a U.S. district court judge in October temporarily blocked the law, which he referred to as a \u201cnear-total ban\u201d on the procedure.\nThe law is designed to challenge the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion until a fetus becomes viable, or can live outside the womb. In a statement after she signed the legislation into law, Ivey said: \u201cThe sponsors of this bill believe that it is time, once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter, and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur.\u201d\u00a0\nIt is true, as the post suggests, that the Alabama law \u2014 if it takes effect \u2014 would not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The law only permits abortions in cases where a \u201cphysician licensed in Alabama determines that an abortion is necessary in order to prevent a serious health risk to the unborn child\u2019s mother,\u201d a determination that must also be confirmed in writing by a second physician.\nThe law defines \u201cserious health risk\u201d this way: \u201cIn reasonable medical judgment, the child\u2019s mother has a condition that so complicates her medical condition that it necessitates the termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\nIt further says such a risk \u201cdoes not include a condition based on a claim that the woman is suffering from an emotional condition or a mental illness which will cause her to engage in conduct that intends to result in her death or the death of her unborn child.\u201d But it includes a caveat allowing for an abortion if \u201ca second physician who is licensed in Alabama as a psychiatrist, with a minimum of three years of clinical experience\u201d documents that the woman \u201chas a diagnosed serious mental illness\u201d that will lead her to \u201cengage in conduct that could result in her death or the death of her unborn child.\u201d\nHowever, the Instagram post is wrong to claim the hypothetical 12-year-old rape victim could be \u201cthrown in prison for life\u201d for getting an abortion illegally. The law explicitly does not penalize women who illegally have abortions.\nThe law states: \u201cNo woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable. Furthermore, no physician confirming the serious health risk to the child\u2019s mother shall be criminally or civilly liable for those actions.\u201d (The law defines women as females \u201cwhether or not she has reached the age of majority,\u201d which is 19 years old.)\nThat said, the law would subject doctors who perform abortions \u2014 unless a \u201cserious health risk\u201d is documented \u2014 to criminal charges. Providing an illegal abortion would be a Class A felony, which is punishable in the state with imprisonment of up to 99 years. Attempting an illegal abortion would be a Class C felony, which is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison.\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

New guidance from the CDC advises people to isolate until they have been fever-free and with symptoms improving for at least 24 hours, and then take precautions for five days, which covers the period when \u201cmost people are still infectious.\u201d\nRead the full question and answer View the Ask SciCheck archivesHave a question?
