But Pepsi disputes the claims regarding when the donation was made.Texas' ban\u00a0is the strictest in the nation and allows private citizens\u00a0to sue individuals who assist women in obtaining abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0The report came from the site Popular Information, a progressive news outlet, and claims that PepsiCo donated $15,000\u00a0to the Texas GOP on Aug. 5, 2021.The funds would go toward the reelection campaigns of\u00a0Republicans in the state legislature, such as Gov. Greg\u00a0Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, according to Popular Information.PepsiCo responded to USA TODAY saying that the donations were actually made in August 2020 and supported political convention costs, far before the abortion ban was put in place. PepsiCo also pointed out that it donated to\u00a0conventions for both Democrats and Republicans. More specifically, it donated $15,000 to the Republican Party and $25,000 to the Democratic Party.Abbot and Patrick did not immediately respond to phone requests to comment.Texas doctor performs abortion:\u00a0Texas abortion law critics are targeting these corporate donors and Texas-based companiesPepsiCo is not the largest corporate donor by far.Corporate Accountability Action (CAA), another progressive site,\u00a0reported that Dallas-based telecom company AT&T donated more than $645,000 over the past two years to nearly 22 lawmakers who sponsored the measure.
