Katey Zeh is done trying to prove that she\u2019s \u201cright\u201d in the abortion debates. \u201cAbortion always happens within the context of a person\u2019s full life; why would we talk about it as an \u201cissue\u201d and not as the human reality that it is?\u201d \u2014Rev. Katey Zeh (@kateyzeh) As Baptist minister and CEO of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Zeh has participated in plenty of \u201ccircular conversations regarding the moral absolutes of abortion.\u201d But as she writes in her new book,   A Complicated Choice: Making Space for Grief and Healing in the Pro-Choice Movement, these debates often overlook how abortion always \u201chappens within a person\u2019s real, full, and complex life.\u201d So while Zeh is an unapologetically pro-choice Christian who aims to \u201cdismantle abortion stigma,\u201d her new book doesn\u2019t try to outline a comprehensive Christian argument for abortion. Instead, Zeh wants readers \u2014 especially Christians \u2014 to get better at listening to folks who have had abortions, including the 17 people who gave Zeh permission to share their abortion stories. The storytellers in A Complicated Choice include folks with a variety of backgrounds and identities: white, Black, Asian, Latinx; straight, queer; cisgender, transgender; abled, disabled; single, partnered; folks with and without kids; those living in poverty and those with financial means; people who are Christian, Jewish, or atheist.\n For readers who have had an abortion, Zeh hopes these 17 stories help de-stigmatize their experience and offer space to express complicated feelings about abortion, including feelings of relief, loss, gratitude, and anger. And for readers who haven\u2019t ever had to decide whether to end a pregnancy, Zeh hopes the book sheds light on how to show up \u201cfully and lovingly for the people in our communities who have abortions.\u201d Sojourners\u2019 Betsy Shirley spoke with Zeh about the stories Christians tell about abortion \u2014 and the stories we\u2019ve often left out. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Betsy Shirley, Sojourners: In your book, you write that both pro-choice and pro-life advocates often lapse in to over-simplified \u201cscripts\u201d about what an abortion experience is like. What are those scripts?  Katey Zeh: For the anti-abortion side, the narrative is that abortion is always harmful to the pregnant person. It\u2019s murder of a child and people who have them are hurt by them and they regret them.\n On the pro-choice side, there is this idea that people need to have access to abortion and it is their right to have it, it\u2019s essential to their bodily autonomy, and it\u2019s always a positive experience \u2014 or one that people don\u2019t have mixed experiences about. We don\u2019t acknowledge the emotional experience of having an abortion; we talk about it as something that\u2019s empowering, which it is, but it\u2019s also something that people have a lot of feelings about. What do these scripts leave out? Because I\u2019m a minister, I think many people feel comfortable sharing their stories with me. And what I\u2019ve often heard from people who\u2019ve come to me is, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I can actually share my experience with my colleagues or with my peers. I\u2019m afraid that my story might be detrimental to the pro-choice movement because part of my experience are some difficult emotions or feeling of grief about it, or wishing that the circumstances had been different and that I would have been able to make a different decision.\u201d Even if they feel, at this point, at peace about their decision, they don\u2019t feel like their narrative is welcomed in a public way because it bumps up against those scripts of what abortion is \u201csupposed\u201d to be. Alex, one of the folks whose stories you share, articulates that fear in the book: that in sharing their complicated feelings, their story would be twisted or used to ultimately deny folks abortion. And I\u2019m sure that something you had to wrestle with in writing this book. What made you continue?  Because we don\u2019t create spaces for people to share their [abortion] experiences \u2014 especially these more complex feelings about it \u2014 there is this gap that people have; there\u2019s a need for community, for support. And any time we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re allowed to process something that is causing emotional distress or something that we\u2019re wrestling with, people turn to whatever is available to them. And the people who are  offering that support often have anti-abortion agendas underneath.\n [In the book] I talked about Project Rachel, a space that the advertises itself as a post-abortion retreat that\u2019s free, widely available, and even calls itself therapy, even though the people providing care are not trained therapists. Then they give those folks who are feeling vulnerable a framework, or another script, of why they\u2019re feeling that way: \u201cThe reason that you\u2019re feeling this way is because you killed your baby.\u201d We all should have the spaces we need to heal and to make sense of the things that happen in our lives so that we can move forward. And I think people need a lot more support around this particular issue because of the silencing and the shame and the public messages around it. Did you grow up in a faith community that was supportive of folks who wanted to have abortions?  I was never really exposed to church life until my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she wanted to go back to church and she invited me to come with her. After she died, I was very much immersed in white conservative, evangelical Christian culture in a small town in the South. And while I don\u2019t specifically remember abortion being talked about, I think it was implied that, that we were opposed to it,   especially given the emphasis on purity culture at the time. However, when I think about my mother in particular, really raising me to be someone who had compassion for people whose experiences were different, I don\u2019t know that I ever personally was opposed to abortion. However, I did have that abortion stigma and judgment that I continued to dismantle within myself. And what has helped you do that dismantling work?\n Honestly, other reproductive justice activists really helped me understand what's problematic about not examining my whiteness in this movement and pushing me to understand abortion within the broader frame of reproductive justice. I suspect when many folks hear reproductive justice, they hear a synonym for \u201cpro-choice.\u201d What does reproductive justice mean to you?  It is really important to talk about the reproductive justice framework as having been created by Black women in the 1990s in response to the predominantly white-led reproductive rights and health movement. Black women felt like their experiences were really overlooked. The emphasis simply on access to abortion really left out all of the different ways\u00a0that Black women and other communities of color have not had reproductive freedom \u2014 reproductive oppression and coercion takes lots of different forms and is often racially inspired. READ: As a Pastor, I Can't Define Life's Edges. Neither Can Lawmakers Reproductive justice is that human rights framework that says we have the right to have children, the right to not have children, and the right to raise our children in safe and healthy environments. It\u2019s not simply enough just to have legal access to abortion; it\u2019s not reproductive justice if we can\u2019t parent our children and thrive and have all the resources that we need. So it\u2019s a much more holistic frame that connects lots of different movements and justice issues. In your first book, Women Rise Up, you talk about stories from scripture and kind of highlight some of their liberative potential for women. What scripture stories offer a liberating view of reproductive justice? \n For me, the most liberating story is the gospel story of the hemorrhaging woman (Mark 5:25-34). She is experiencing a reproductive issue and she has tried everything that\u2019s socially prescribed to make her better and it\u2019s only made her worse, sicker, and poorer. All she has left is to reach out for this man named Jesus who is going to be walking through the community \u2014 a space she\u2019s not allowed to occupy because of her condition. Yet she still reaches out for the thing that she needs and she\u2019s the catalyst for her own healing, which is a thing that Jesus both feels and then is curious about and is shaped by in the story. She is the catalyst for her own healing and he affirms that and her willingness to share the truth of what has happened to her, not just that day, but in her life, that is healing for her and the community around who hears it and [they are] healed, too. I often hear folks in progressive Christian circles echo Bill Clinton, saying \u201cWe want abortion to be safe, we want it to be legal, and we want it to be rare.\u201d Is that phrasing helpful or not?  It is unhelpful for a lot of different reasons. The first that comes to mind is that it\u2019s not a very humanizing way to talk about abortion, because again, abortion always happens within the context of a person\u2019s full life; why would we talk about it as an \u201cissue\u201d and not as the human reality that it is? \u201cSafe, legal, accessible\u201d is how I would reframe it; just because something is \u201csafe and legal,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s available to everyone. \u201cReproductive oppression and coercion takes lots of different forms and is often racially inspired.\u201d \u2014Rev. Katey Zeh (@kateyzeh) When we say that abortion should be \u201crare,\u201d that\u2019s adding this\u00a0idea that abortion is bad, that it\u2019s morally wrong, and it\u2019s to be avoided at all costs. And what I\u2019ve learned in [from] talking to people is that abortion can be a blessing. Abortion can save lives. Abortion can affirm life. Abortion can be a positive parenting decision. So using a word like \u201crare\u201d in that context is actually quite harmful to the broader reproductive freedom movement. I suspect that when many folks hear \u201cabortion can be a blessing,\u201d they have a real strong reaction. What would you say to those folks?  I think strong reactions are good things. They\u2019re opportunities for us to examine why we feel that way. It never feels good to sit in an uncomfortable feeling like that, but I think my invitation would be just to stop and \u2014 rather than suppress that and move on \u2014 really take the time to honor that. And start interrogating or asking: Why do I feel that way? What has my experience with abortion been? Do I know anyone who\u2019s had one? What were the messages that I got? I really think it's an opportunity to start asking why we have almost a physical response to an idea like \u201cabortion is a blessing.\u201d Erin, one of the folks you interview in your book, notes that people know how to care for someone who\u2019s just had surgery but have no idea how to show up and care for folks who\u2019ve had abortions. What does that look like?  There are many different ways, of course, but I think the first is to understand what it can be like for someone to access an abortion to begin with. For people who are going to an abortion clinic, it can often be a very traumatizing experience just to enter the doors. It can be really difficult to get the money for it because so often that portion isn\u2019t covered by insurance. So there can be that financial strain. And there can be the emotional strain of making a decision to terminate a pregnancy, especially if the person doesn\u2019t have the support they need, or maybe they\u2019re making that within the context of an abusive or dysfunctional relationship. So just try and understand: What was that like? And if that person can\u2019t share it with you, do your own work by reading stories. With that understanding, people can respond a lot more compassionately. Is there a unique role for people of faith? I think it is tending to those spiritual questions or concerns. So many people, regardless of what faith tradition they were brought up in, an abortion experience can bring back some of those really negative messages that they heard from protestors or from anti-abortion activists. Questions like, \u201cIs God going to punish me for this?\u201d Those are real questions that people have. And a lot of times it\u2019s connected to feelings they have, emotions that they then attach to a theological question. And so I think people of faith in particular can help people rediscover that inner truth that I was talking about in the story of the hemorrhaging woman. You can ask folks: \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d [You can] also say the truth is that God is with us in all of our experiences. Provide that theological frame: You are deeply loved and cared for by God, no matter what. That\u2019s something that people really need because of the language that they hear and are so shamed by. This year, the Supreme Court is set up to deliver a verdict on a case that could challenge what Roe v. Wade established. If this does happen, how would you like to see the community of faith respond?  I always like to answer this question with just some broader context: Roe is an incredibly important decision, but it never guaranteed that everybody who has needed access to abortion could get it. The dismantling of access to abortion has been going on for decades. It has escalated in recent years and we\u2019re certainly at a moment where the implications could be very, very broad in terms of how many people are impacted. But I think it\u2019s always important to remember that these stories of lack of access have been going for decades. Even some of the people in the book talk about how it was a near miss for them in terms of actually being able to get access to care. It was very cumbersome. If abortion becomes illegal in many states, all at one time \u2014 which is what could happen \u2014 we\u2019re going to see a lot more people needing to travel a lot farther to get where they need to go. The clinics that are still available and providers are going to be inundated. People are going to endure even more of the kind of stress and distress \u2014 in addition to going to a clinic, they\u2019re going to be [paying] out of pocket even more and traveling by plane, in a pandemic to get the care they need. I think it\u2019s going to be about listening to the people who\u2019ve been preparing for this moment for a long time and then asking specifically what can people of faith contribute in partnership with the leadership on the ground? How do you hope this book shifts the conversation around abortion?  Because of the moment that we\u2019re in, I think people are paying more attention to how abortion has impacted so many people and how difficult it\u2019s becoming to access. There is a real opportunity for us to build our skills around how we listen to someone\u2019s experience that we might not understand \u2014 and respond with compassion. I hope that the book will provide like almost a practice ground for us to learn how to suspend judgment, to bring our full attention to the person who is experiencing this or has experienced this, practice that pause when that judgement or knee-jerk reaction comes up, and then respond in a way that centers the needs of the person who has been courageous enough to come and tell us their abortion story.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Betsy Shirley \n Betsy Shirley is the editor of sojo.net.\n  \n\n \n\nGot something to say about what you're reading?
