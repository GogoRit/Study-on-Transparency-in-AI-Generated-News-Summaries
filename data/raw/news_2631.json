The vote dashed the hopes of supporters of legal abortion in the predominantly Catholic country, homeland of Pope Francis. (Credit: Agustin Marcarian/ Reuters via CNS.)\nListenROSARIO, Argentina\u2014Self-described as the \u201clight blue majority\u201d and backed by polls that show most Argentines oppose legalization of abortion pushed by the government, thousands of families rallied in 400 cities across Pope Francis\u2019s native country Saturday to voice support for the life of the unborn child and that of the expectant mother.\nThe idea of a \u201clegal, safe and free\u201d abortion greatly divided Argentina in 2018, when it was first debated and rejected by Congress. Leftist President Alberto Fernandez promised to bring it back on the campaign trail last year, and it\u2019s front and center in Argentine politics now.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed the debate: Fernandez decided not to present it after he asked Argentines to lock themselves at home for over 200 days to combat spread of the disease, arguing the economy can rise up again but a life lost is forever.\nThough the anti-abortion rallies were organized through social media, they had the support of both the Catholic bishops\u2019 conference in Argentina and a union of Christian churches. Indirectly they had the pope\u2019s backing too, since Francis last week answered a request from a network of mothers who live in the slums of Buenos Aires who\u2019d asked him to \u201cbe our voice\u201d in a debate in which pro-choice forces claim it\u2019s women who live in poverty who want abortion and die having it in clandestine clinics.\nOn Saturday, the cathedral church of Merlo in Buenos Aires woke up sprayed with green painting and graffiti saying things such as, \u201cNeither Fernandez nor Bergoglio: Legal Abortion.\u201d\n(\u201cBergoglio\u201d is Pope Francis\u2019s given last name, Jorge Mario Bergoglio.)\nAbortion is only legal in some states of Argentina in cases of rape or threats to the life of the mother. The bill presented by Fernandez would make it legal and free under all circumstances in public and private hospitals across the country for girls as young as 13 up until week 14 of pregnancy, and then up the ninth month if it was product of rape or endangers the \u201cphysical or mental\u201d health of the mother.\nRallies opposed to the bill took place in every state capital but also in many other cities, always under the premise of social distance- with thousands joining from their cars adorned with the Argentine flag, balloons and light-blue handkerchiefs, the color of the pro-life camp, in opposition to the green one the pro-abortion supporters\u2019 sport.\nThe platform \u201cUnidad pro-vida,\u201d an umbrella group that brings together 150 NGOs helped coordinate the information on times and places for each city.\nWriting in Argentina\u2019s daily of record, La Nacion, journalist Marino De Vedia argued that this year ecclesiastical structures, from the pope to the parishes, will focus their energies on rejecting a bill that is even more radical and negative, in their view, than the one rejected two years ago.\nThis might become problematic, the journalist who specializes in Church affairs argued, as the government took for granted the institution\u2019s support not for legalizing abortion but for containing the social unrest likely to explode in Argentina at the end of a bad year.\nIt happened, for instance, back in 2001, when protests brought down a government.\nThrough soup kitchens, Caritas offices, a bishops-coordinated dialogue table and homilies from the many priests who live and minister in the slums of Buenos Aires, the left-wing government hoped to avoid a civil revolt this December. It\u2019s expected to happen taking into account that after the world\u2019s longest lockdown and some of the highest per-capita deaths due to COVID-19, between 50 to 60 percent of Argentines will greet the new year living under the poverty line.\n\u201cThe bishops are conscious that the Government will aim to score a success with the \u2018Legal Abortion\u2019 operation, at the end of a year in which it practically did not achieve successes, conditioned by the pandemic, the deepening of the crisis and, as if that were not enough, the recent scandal of the incidents in the Casa Rosada itself during the funeral of Diego Maradona,\u201d wrote De Vedia, referring to incidents in the government house during the funeral of the soccer star who passed away last week.\nMany observers and commentators saw the fact that people temporarily took over the house of government as a sign of the simmering anger and discontent, and many are already warning the government that abortion is an ideological battle fought mostly by artist and middle-class Argentines, but it won\u2019t help feed the poor.\nFrancis got involved in the debate not only through a hand-written letter to the women in the slums, which he sent through a national legislator from the opposition party, but also by calling the head of the opposition block-PRO- in the chamber of deputies, Cristian Ritondo, to express his support. This is another explicit blow by the head of the Catholic Church to a government that saw the pope as an ally.\nBack in 2018, Francis was mostly in the margins, with no known attempts to interfere in the vote, and the bishops had a \u201clet the laity act\u201d attitude. Yet this time around, he decided to get involved. The reasons for this are plenty, including the fact that virtually every time he\u2019s spoken about the legalization of abortion, Fernandez brought the pope to the debate, saying that he hoped Francis \u201cwon\u2019t get angry at me\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m Catholic but trying to resolve a matter of public health.\u201d\nThe president even brought St. Agustin and St. Thomas to claim that, once upon a time, the Church didn\u2019t see abortion as a murder.\nFernandez presented the bill last week, and Congress is hoping for an \u201cexpress\u201d debate, meaning to have it legalized before the end of the year.\nJorge Nicolas Lafferriere, a pro-life lawyer and faculty member of Argentina\u2019s Pontifical University, underlined that this is the first time that it\u2019s the president who presents a project to legalize abortion, and its \u201cnot easy in this country for Congress to reject a proposal when the Executive is so involved.\u201d\nOn the need to have the debate now, Lafferriere said he supposes it\u2019s due to the fact that next year there will be mid-term elections and in such years, abortion is generally avoided as it\u2019s heavily divisive.\n\u201cIt is very surprising that the issue is incorporated into [Congress\u2019] extraordinary sessions, after such a difficult year, with so much poverty and care for life due to the pandemic,\u201d he said on Saturday, after taking part in the rallies in Buenos Aires. \u201cA distraction can\u2019t be ruled out: having social platforms and the media discuss abortion while they reform the justice system.\u201d\nLafferriere notes opinion in the capital and the rest of the country is very different, explaining why the Senate, which represents the \u201cinterior\u201d rejected the abortion project in 2018 and could do so again. The numbers are not clear, explaining nationwide mobilizations on both sides: in the interior, there\u2019s a clear \u201clight blue\u201d majority, and a poll released last week showed that there are more people in Argentina rejecting abortion today than in 2018.\nAsked about a possible domino effect should the pope\u2019s own country legalize abortion, Lafferrire said that \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt Argentina is a point of reference in the region,\u201d visible, for instance, by the light blue and green handkerchiefs that have spread like powder throughout Latin America.\n\u201cThere is something ideological in wanting to legalize abortion in Pope Francis\u2019 country, who reminds us of the need for a political system that looks for the common good and takes into consideration the dignity of each person, from the unborn life to the poorest among us or the elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cRegrettably, we see a radicalization of an ideology that tries to legitimize the throw-away culture.\u201d\nFollow In\u00e9s San Mart\u00edn on Twitter:\u00a0@inesanma\nShareLatest StoriesA Wisconsin ruling on Catholic Charities raises the bar for religious tax exemptionsMar 19Todd Richmond,\u00a0Associated PressCatholic nuns support women\u2019s rights in Central African RepublicMar 19Nirmala CarvalhoA priest who refused to stay silent still speaks to the world todayMar 19John L.
