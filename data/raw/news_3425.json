That\u2019s the opposite of true feminism which believes a woman can be successful while being a mother,\u201d said Students for Life Action and Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins. \u201cThe abortion lobby has co-opted the women\u2019s movement and is pushing the idea that women can\u2019t multitask, but we know women don\u2019t need to kill their children to be successful.\u201d\nAUSTIN, TX, & WASHINGTON D.C. (03-08-22) \u2014 \u00a0In order to confront the pervasive idea that \u201cabortion rights\u201d are women\u2019s rights, Students for Life Action will be counter protesting a RiseUp4AbortionRights protest that is occurring on International Women\u2019s Day in Austin. SFLAction will be peacefully protesting, carrying signs and highlighting the violence and \u00a0injustice of abortion that ends preborn life in the U.S. and worldside in the millions. The Texas protest will be led by Students for Life Action Regional Manager for Texas Sarah Zarr.\nMEDIA ADVISORY: Counter Protest begins at 1 p.m CT at West Mall, University of Texas, 2250 Guadalupe Street, Austin, Texas 78705.\n\nSFLAction rejects the idea that abortion is healthcare or a constitutional right as deliberately ending innocent life is in direct opposition to both the tenets of life-saving treatment and our Constitutional freedoms. Instead of abortion liberating women, reports show that 64% of abortions are committed through coercion where a woman does not want an abortion but feels pressured to ultimately abort. Abortion also has many health risks for women such as hemorrhaging, infection, increased risk of future ectopic pregnancies, etc. After abortion, studies show that women are 81% more likely to have mental health problems, such as suicidal thoughts, loss of self-confidence, substance abuse, depression, etc.\nAdditionally, according to recent polling, the majority of the younger generations (millennials and Gen Z) do not support abortion on demand for all nine months. This shows that the RiseUp4AbortionRights group is in direct conflict with the majority of the young voting bloc.\n\u201cSFLAction will be counterprotesting to show support for all women, both born and preborn. Abortion never helps women\u2014 it only harms and kills them\u2014and we will not stand by as it is falsely portrayed as the savior of women. We don\u2019t need abortion; we just need it gone,\u201d said SFLAction President Kristan Hawkins.\nLearn more about Hawkins\u2019 view on fake feminism HERE\nLearn more about the health risks of all abortion for women, HERE.\nLearn more about how the pro-life movement helps women HERE\nLearn more about the grassroots work of Students for Life Action\u00a0HERE\nFor interviews, contact\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\n\u201330\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages. Together they work to end abortion \u2014 the human rights issue of our day \u2014 and provide political, legal, and community support for women and their children, born and preborn.
