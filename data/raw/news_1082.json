(AP) \u2014 A federal court on Tuesday allowed Tennessee\u2019s ban on abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy to take effect, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last week overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights case.The action by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes before Tennessee\u2019s other abortion ban, the so-called trigger ban, is expected to restrict abortion almost entirely by mid-August, according to a newly detailed legal interpretation by the state attorney general. Both measures would make performing an abortion a felony and subject doctors to up to 15 years in prison if convicted.Republican Attorney General Herbert Slatery filed an emergency motion Friday to let state to begin implementing the six-week ban. GOP supermajorities in the Legislature passed the law in 2020 with Republican Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s backing, and it was quickly blocked in federal court.\n\nSpecifically, the ban halts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks in pregnancy\u2014 when most women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant.\u201cThere are a lot of things that I am very passionate about and take very personally in this job that I have, but ... this was the most important thing that I could do as governor,\u201d Lee said while speaking virtually with anti-abortion religious leaders Friday, after the Supreme Court ruling.\nLee said Tuesday that the federal appeals court\u2019s decision marked \u201canother significant protection for unborn children in our state.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt only makes an exception when an abortion is necessary to prevent the woman\u2019s death or \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d However, it specifies that a woman\u2019s mental health does not qualify for an exemption.\u201cAbortion bans rob people of their ability to make the decisions that are best for themselves, their lives, and their futures,\u201d said Ashley Coffield, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi, in a statement. \u201cIt is unconscionable that Tennesseans will lose access to abortion in their communities because of this decision.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood was not performing abortions at its facilities in Nashville and Memphis on Monday in anticipation of court action to unblock the six-week ban, said spokesperson Matt Anderson. Separately, abortion provider carafem \u2014 which has a clinic in Nashville \u2014 announced Tuesday that its staff had been flooded with calls from patients trying to understand Tennessee\u2019s new legal landscape.\u201cIn my more than 30 years in health care, nothing has been as hard as turning away patients from the care they need because politicians interfered with private health care decisions,\u201d said Melissa Grant, carafem\u2019s chief operations officer, in a statement. An even more restrictive ban is set to take effect soon, according to the attorney general\u2019s guidance Tuesday. Tennessee\u2019s trigger law \u2014 set to go into place 30 days after the end of Roe \u2014 would ban all abortions statewide, with essentially the same limited exceptions as the six-week ban. \n\nThat law requires the attorney general to certify that Roe has been overturned. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, but indicated Tuesday that he plans to do so when the corresponding judgment is filed in the Supreme Court case, by no later than mid-July. That puts the effective date at around mid-August, Slatery\u2019s office said. The law ties the effective date to the judgment filing, not the timing of the attorney general\u2019s action. Democratic lawmakers at the time attempted to amend the measure to allow exceptions for incest and rape -- including rape of a child -- but Republicans ultimately spiked those suggestions.Bans pegged to the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d concept \u2014 such as Tennessee\u2019s six-week ban \u2014 have been signed into law in more than a dozen states. Supporters commonly argue that abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy \u201cstops a beating heart,\u201d but medical experts say those claims are false.That\u2019s because at the point where advanced technology can detect that first flutter, as early as six weeks, the embryo isn\u2019t yet a fetus and it doesn\u2019t have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy, medical experts say.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last week is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half of the states.Additionally, in Tennessee, voters approved an amendment in 2014 declaring that the state\u2019s constitution doesn\u2019t protect or secure the right to an abortion or require funding for abortions.Trigger laws, like Tennessee\u2019s 2019 version, are also being targeted by lawsuits in other states. In Louisiana on Monday, a state district judge in New Orleans temporarily blocked enforcement of that state\u2019s trigger-law ban on abortion, after abortion rights activists argued that it is unclear. The ruling is in effect pending a July 8 hearing.Tennessee\u2019s 2020 law includes the six-week ban and bans longer into the pregnancy, in the event that the Supreme Court did not fully overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
