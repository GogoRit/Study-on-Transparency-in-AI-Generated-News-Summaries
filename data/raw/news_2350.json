annual March for Life rally in Washington that \u201cunborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\u201d\n    \n\n            Trump, making history as the first President to attend the event since it began nearly a half-century ago, looked to strengthen his ties to a key coalition of his political base, which he\u2019ll need as he seeks reelection this year. He used his remarks to not only express support for the movement but to paint those supportive of looser abortion laws as radicals, often employing language that mischaracterized the views of most Democrats.\n    \n\n            \u201cTogether we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to Democrats \u2013 and you know this \u2013 you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened. Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you can even say for centuries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNearly every top Democrat in Congress now support taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth.\u201d\n    \n\n            Trump\u2019s claim is false. Although Democrats generally favor looser abortion laws and several states allow so-called \u201clate-term\u201d abortions, the procedures do not occur \u201cup until the moment of birth,\u201d as Trump claimed. He also reiterated an incendiary and false accusation against Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, saying he would \u201cexecute\u201d a baby even after it is born, a mischaracterization of a remark Northam made last year in which he was discussing fetuses that are nonviable. No Democrat has signaled support for killing infants after birth, as Trump suggested.\n    \n\n            \u201cSadly, the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cThey are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice, and we will win because we know how to win.\u201d\n    \n\n            The Trump administration has consistently worked to regulate or restrict abortion access, appointed two Supreme Court justices seen as holding anti-abortion views and on Friday announced it will take legal action against California over the state\u2019s mandate that insurers, including private health insurance policies, cover abortions. \n    \n\n    Annual event\n\n\n            The march aligns with the week of the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade this year, as per tradition, in an anti-abortion response to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide. The event was founded in 1974 by anti-abortion activist Nellie Gray, and typically attracts about 100,000 participants hailing from across the country. The plan is to continue the event until Roe is overturned, according to the march\u2019s organizers.\n    \n\n            Crowds had assembled on the National Mall on Friday morning well ahead of the event\u2019s 12 p.m. ET kickoff time. There was a festival-like atmosphere as music blared from speakers near the main stage. Many in attendance, including priests and school tours, had come from across the country to attend, some wearing pins and buttons. Among the messages on printed signs were \u201cLove Life / Choose Life,\u201d \u201cSave the Baby Humans\u201d and \u201cPro-Life Voices for Trump.\u201d\n    \n\n            Nancy Weber, 57, of St. Charles, Illinois, told CNN she left home at 4 p.m. Thursday in order to make the 15-hour drive to Washington to \u201cshow our support for life.\u201d She said an unplanned pregnancy earlier in her life, which resulted in her giving the child up for adoption, helped change her views.\n    \n\n            \u201cWhat is a world without children? Our greatest asset is people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do believe adoption is the loving option.\u201d\n    \n\n            The Nieves family of Connecticut, calling themselves \u201clifelong pro-lifers,\u201d made the decision to attend this year\u2019s march before they knew Trump was speaking.\n    \n\n            Although he\u2019s \u201cnot a huge Trump fan,\u201d said 22-year-old Matthew Nieves, \u201cit\u2019s fantastic that he\u2019s supporting this.\u201d\n    \n\n            After the rally\u2019s featured speakers concluded, attendees took to the streets for the march itself. With several blocks closed off to traffic, thousands of marchers sporting signs, flags, banners and clothing representing their group or home state flooded Constitution Avenue. \n    \n\n            While some groups posted graphic abortion-related images alongside the route, the march in many ways resembled a parade, with several groups singing and dancing \u2013 one group with yellow sweatshirts featured a drum line. Chants of \u201cwe love babies yes we do, we love babies how \u2018bout you?\u201d and \u201cI believe that we will win\u201d burst out among marchers.\n    \n\n    An ally of anti-abortion rights movement\n\n\n            Trump is the first president to attend the march, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said. He was also the first president to speak at the march via satellite feed when he addressed participants in 2018.\n    \n\n            Trump regularly discusses the need to restrict abortion rights on the campaign trail and has taken numerous actions in office to do so.\n    \n\n            Since taking office in 2017, Trump has reinstated a ban on US government funding for international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions, appointed anti-abortion judges and opposed abortions later in pregnancy. The Department of Health and Human Services has also advanced multiple measures to regulate or restrict abortion access, some with the professed aim of protecting health care providers\u2019 religious freedom, during his tenure.\n    \n\n            The Trump campaign will also create another anti-abortion rights coalition going into the 2020 election, as it did in 2016, to be helmed again by anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group\u2019s national spokeswoman announced on the eve of the march.\n    \n\n            The Friday event \u2013 themed \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman\u201d \u2013 features a rally on the National Mall followed by a march that concludes at the steps of the Supreme Court. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, and GOP Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey also spoke at the march.\n    \n\n            The march has enjoyed support from multiple Republican administrations in the past and Trump\u2019s has been no different. In 2017, Vice President Mike Pence and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway both spoke at the event, with the vice president doing so again in 2019. Former presidents have made telephone calls in to the march, with both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush addressing the event via phone.\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Maegan Vazquez, Allie Malloy and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
