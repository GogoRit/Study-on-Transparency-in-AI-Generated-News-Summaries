An embryo's initial cardiac activity is detectable at about that time \u2014 often before a person knows they\u2019re pregnant. Under current Texas law, abortion is illegal after those pulses can be detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still legal in other states, however, if a pregnant Texan has the means to get there.\nThe new state law includes a novel civil enforcement mechanism \u2014 so new it\u2019s even confusing to some prosecutors \u2014 that deputizes citizens to report anyone who helps a pregnant Texan obtain an abortion. That keeps the state from being sued, since it\u2019s not enforcing anything, and it pays a bounty of $10,000 to the people ratting on their fellow Texans. It\u2019s a backhanded way to punish anyone assisting, in any way, in an abortion \u2014 excluding the pregnant person.\nIt\u2019s got a good chance of becoming a model enforcement tool for other states \u2014 Idaho\u2019s version is being contested in court, for instance \u2014 but someone should probably explain it to prosecutors first.\nConsider the case of Starr County District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez, who asked a grand jury to indict a woman for murder over a self-induced abortion, got her arrested on a Thursday and then released her the next Saturday with this astonishing admission: \u201cIn reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms. [Lizelle] Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s not against Texas law, Ramirez said when dropping the indictment.\nHad someone helped her, they might have been open to prosecution. That makes traveling to other places for abortions riskier for helpers, but not for pregnant people. And there\u2019s evidence Texans seeking abortions have been traveling to other states.\nOklahoma was initially the most popular option, but that\u2019s about to end, now that the Oklahoma Legislature made it a felony to perform abortions there. The new law will take effect this summer, assuming their governor signs it as expected. That\u2019ll move attention elsewhere, but there are still states where the decision on whether to have an abortion is left to people who are pregnant.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is considering a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks into a pregnancy. The justices could alter the constitutionally protected right to abortion that has been in place since the court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, based on fetal viability, or about 23 weeks into a pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther states have followed Texas and Mississippi into stricter laws, and many have approved so-called \u201ctrigger laws\u201d \u2014 bans on abortion that would take effect if and when the Supreme Court abandons the Roe v. Wade precedent. Oklahoma\u2019s law is pending. So is Idaho\u2019s. Kentucky lawmakers approved a 15-week ban that includes restrictions on medication abortions this month. A new Florida law, based on the Mississippi law, will take effect this summer.\nA map of what\u2019s legal in each state is taking shape. In one example, The Washington Post is tracking abortion laws \u2014 both restrictive and permissive \u2014 that are in effect now or are working through various state legislatures. It\u2019s a geographic guide to the legal obstacle course that could come into focus when the high court rules in the Mississippi case later this year.\nFor people seeking abortions who live in states where the procedure is not allowed, it points to the places where it is allowed. Some states are considering variations of the Texas law, hoping to make it illegal to perform abortions on their residents even in other states. Missouri is an example. Texas doesn\u2019t have anything like that \u2014 yet.\nInstead, the state has virtually banned abortions within its borders, effectively taking away what is currently a constitutionally protected right \u2014 until and unless the Supreme Court rules otherwise \u2014 from anyone unable to travel to a state where abortion is still allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor pregnant Texans with means, a trip to an out-of-state doctor is an expensive option. But it\u2019s still an option \u2014 one that most Texans don\u2019t have.\nWe can\u2019t wait to welcome you in person and online to the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival, our multiday celebration of big, bold ideas about politics, public policy and the day\u2019s news \u2014 all taking place just steps away from the Texas Capitol from Sept. 22-24.
