Wade. The leaked opinion was first published by POLITICO.\n\"Given the political climate that we have today, it's really hard to think that they will improve access instead of restricting access,\" said Dalia Vidunas, the executive director of Equality Health Center in Concord.\nOver the winter, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu signed into law a ban on abortions after 24 weeks of gestation. The law also requires women to undergo an ultrasound before receiving an abortion. The law only lists danger to the life of the mother as an exception to the 24-week ban.\nVidunas worries that New Hampshire lawmakers, spurred by the Supreme Court's draft opinion, will further restrict abortions.\n\"This year alone we had two bills for codifying Roe v. Wade, and those got shot down,\" she said.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Governor Sununu maintained that he would protect access to abortion as governor of New Hampshire. \n\"I'm a pro-choice governor and as long as I'm governor, we're going to remain a pro-choice state,\" he said.\nHe dismissed the argument by some that the state's abortion law is extreme and said he will sign a bill getting rid of the ultrasound requirement and including fatal fetal abnormalities as an exception to the 24-week ban.\n\"The majority of pro-choice individuals do support a ban after 24 weeks. We have it, Massachusetts has it, New York has it. Those aren't extreme states either,\" Sununu said.\n\n\nSununu also said he would not support a move by some lawmakers to ban buffer zones which keep protestors at certain distances from abortion clinics.\nIn a statement the New Hampshire House Majority Leader, Jason Osborne (R-Auburn) said, \"As a Representative of the People, I am committed to advocating for policy supported by Granite Staters. In the past year, pro-choice and pro-life legislators came together to settle on a prohibition of the most extreme and unnecessary late-term abortions. Any forthcoming Supreme Court decision will not change New Hampshire's position.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lake Winnipesaukee ice-out declaration is earliest on record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Miami murder-suicide victims identified as New England College graduates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dartmouth College refuses to work with newly formed basketball players' union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Boston police officer saved by bulletproof vest, accused shooter due in court\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Abortion\n\nFirst published on May 3, 2022 / 5:40 PM EDT\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
