Many women\u2019s lives are already at risk, every day, often in their own homes.\nAcross the region, even before the pandemic\u2019s onset,\u00a0one in five women\u00a0experienced domestic violence. A 2014\u00a0survey\u00a0found that one in three women in the European Union had experienced sexual or physical violence since reaching the age of 15. Women\u2019s rights groups have boldly called out governments\u2019 inadequate response to this\u00a0\u201cshadow pandemic\u201d\u00a0amid mounting\u00a0evidence\u00a0that pandemic-related lockdowns bring a\u00a0heightened\u00a0risk of domestic abuse and create barriers to seeking help.\nFor example, France had a 30%\u00a0increase\u00a0in domestic violence reports during the first two weeks of its COVID-19 lockdown in March. Despite the government\u2019s efforts to encourage domestic violence survivors to seek help, women\u2019s groups told Human Rights Watch that some measures reflected a lack of expert input and that insufficient resources left service providers struggling.\nIt\u2019s an ongoing problem, exacerbated but not caused by the pandemic. According to French government\u00a0data, 146 women were killed by a current or former partner in 2019 \u2013 a rate of one every two and a half days, and 20% more than in 2018.\u00a0Rates\u00a0of domestic violence increased in the same time period by 16%, with 142,310 reports to authorities. A national consultation in 2019 on domestic violence in France\u00a0promised\u00a0large-scale measures, but funds are\u00a0lagging\u00a0far behind.\nA year ago, thousands took part in\u00a0demonstrations\u00a0across France calling for urgent action against femicide and domestic abuse under the\u00a0#NousToutes\u00a0(All of Us) movement. The protest has continued\u00a0online. In August, activists graphically\u00a0marked\u00a0a year of anti-femicide protests by covering a Paris wall with the names of 122 murdered women. Having effective measures in place is all the more urgent because France, like many European countries, recently entered a second lockdown.\nWomen take to the streets in Turkey and Poland\nDespite the surge in domestic violence, some governments in Europe have threatened to cancel commitments to address violence against women. Again, women\u2019s rights groups have answered en masse.\nLarge-scale\u00a0protests\u00a0erupted in Turkey following the killing of 27-year-old Pinar Gultekin by her former partner in July, one of\u00a0at least 234 women\u00a0killed in Turkey since the beginning of the year.\u00a0Some politicians\u00a0from President Erdogan\u2019s ruling party have suggested that Turkey should withdraw from the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the\u00a0Istanbul Convention. This would be a worrying step backwards in a country where hundreds of women are killed by current or former partners or male relatives every year.\nTurkish women\u2019s rights groups have\u00a0called\u00a0for action to address the country\u2019s high rate of\u00a0femicide, failure to protect women at risk, and lack of punishment for their killers. The number of femicides has\u00a0risen\u00a0annually since 2011 \u2013 the same year that Turkey signed the Istanbul Convention. Women\u2019s groups have long criticised the government\u2019s poor track record on implementing the treaty\u2019s requirements, which establishes minimum standards for prevention and protection from violence and prosecution of offenders. These groups organised\u00a0widespread protests\u00a0across Turkey in August, expressing anger that, even as deaths mount, the government might seek to withdraw from a treaty meant to keep women safe from violence.\nActivists in Poland also launched\u00a0protests\u00a0in the summer when the justice minister announced plans to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention. But this was only one of many mass demonstrations in the country in a busy year for women\u2019s rights groups. The protests moved\u00a0online\u00a0in April because of COVVID-19 lockdown measures, creating a surge of public opposition to\u00a0bills\u00a0that would have further curbed abortion and sexuality education. The bills were sent back to committees for further work.\nIn October, when the constitutional tribunal announced a decision that will virtually eliminate legal abortion (despite Poland already having some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe), the Women\u2019s Strike (Strajk Kobiet) movement organised what became the biggest demonstrations\u00a0since the fall\u00a0of communism in 1989. Fed up with the ruling Law and Justice Party\u2019s repeated attacks on women\u2019s and LGBT rights and the rule of law, crowds show no signs of fading, in spite of risks brought on by the pandemic and threats of prosecution or even violence.\nWomen have harnessed the power of protest elsewhere too. In Ukraine, they\u00a0marched\u00a0to urge their government to ratify the Istanbul Convention. And women in Spain\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0in their tens of thousands to call attention to violence against women and gender discrimination.\nSpikes in domestic abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic and growing crowds may have garnered the world\u2019s attention, but tackling violence against women requires long-term, systemic investment. Women\u2019s groups are working to ensure that national leaders can\u2019t look away when the pandemic subsides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia France Poland T\u00fcrkiye \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nCoronavirus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nHealth Women's Rights Domestic Violence Reproductive Rights and Abortion Sexual Violence and Rape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 2, 2020\n\n          Statement\n        \n\n\n Poland: Drop Charges Against Women Rights Defenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal Rolls Back Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Felt So Stuck\u201d\n\n\nInadequate Housing and Social Support for Families Seeking Asylum in the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 2, 2020\n\n          Statement\n        \n\n\n Poland: Drop Charges Against Women Rights Defenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal Rolls Back Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
