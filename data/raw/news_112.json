Naples. Joaquin. Tenaha. Rusk. Gary. Wells. These names might sound unfamiliar now, but you\u2019ll be hearing more about them soon enough.\nThey are seven cities in East Texas that, within the last several months, each passed so-called \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d ordinances \u2014 moves that are blatantly unconstitutional.\nWaskom, Texas was the first municipality to pass such an ordinance in July 2019. Soon after, other east Texas cities followed suit. The ordinances attempt to ban abortion within the cities if Roe v. Wade is overturned, and some of them even try to ban emergency contraception.\nThe ordinances also declare organizations working to protect the right to abortion, including our clients Lilith Fund and Texas Equal Access Fund (TEA Fund), as \u201ccriminal organizations,\u201d even though they have done absolutely nothing wrong. The ordinances function to silence abortion advocates, preventing them from operating and even speaking about abortion access within the city limits.\nThese ordinances constitute an outright attack on abortion and free speech, which is why today we filed a lawsuit against these seven cities.\nThe laws that claim abortion will be illegal if Roe is overturned have a dangerous chilling effect. They confuse residents about their rights and increase stigma against people who have abortions \u2014 even though abortion remains legal in Texas and everywhere in the country. And at the same time, the ordinances prevent any attempts to clear up that confusion, banning the kind of speech that could educate people about their rights and access to abortion in the cities.\nUnder these local laws, our clients cannot speak up about abortion rights, recruit volunteers to help them do their important work, or congregate to share informational materials in these cities without worrying about getting sued. The laws intentionally and unconstitutionally obstruct our plaintiffs\u2019 ability to do their jobs, impeding the advocacy work that is integral to their mission.\nIn contrast, anti-abortion organizations face no such restrictions, remaining free to undermine access to reproductive health care without legal ramifications. It\u2019s this targeted and discriminatory suppression of speech and assembly that violates our clients\u2019 First Amendment rights \u2014 and exactly what we are challenging in our lawsuit.\nLike most Americans, the majority of Texans believe that abortion should remain legal. Regardless of the efforts of anti-abortion extremists who are trying their best to spread their ideology across Texas \u2014 in some cases, going so far as to pressure town leadership to pass copycat anti-abortion ordinances \u2014 abortion remains a right.\nSo, we\u2019ll see the cities of Waskom, Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells in court. Abortion is health care, and the organizations that advocate for it should not be silenced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About the Issues on This Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Abortion                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Reproductive Freedom                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            State Abortion Legislation                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nIn Alabama, Embryos Are People and It Won't Stop There\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nACLU Calls Out Junk Science at the Heart of the Supreme Court Medication Abortion Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nBusy Philipps Is Fed up With Abortion Bans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nBusy Philipps Named as ACLU Artist Ambassador for Reproductive Freedom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
