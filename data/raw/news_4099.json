In June, New York-based international advocacy group Women Deliver launched an independent investigation into allegations of discrimination there. Its CEO, Katja Iversen, has taken a leave of absence until the investigation concludes.'White faux feminism': Women Deliver investigate internal racism allegationsRead moreThe IWHC move follows a series of allegations from former staff, who say their experiences caused \u201cracial trauma we continue to grapple with long after leaving the organisation\u201d.In an open letter published last week, a group of black women and women of colour called for the resignations of three senior staff members, including current president, Fran\u00e7oise Girard.Addressed to Kathleen Regan, chair of IWHC\u2019s board, the letter described a \u201ctoxic and racist organisational culture with almost all the power held in the hands of white women at the top of the organisation\u201d. It accused some managers of publicly humiliating, intimidating and belittling women, which they say has been \u201can open secret for far too long\u201d.\u201cWe, as former black women and women of colour staff at IWHC, have collectively chosen to break our silence to publicly name the institutional racism and bullying we faced, so that it can no longer be wilfully ignored,\u201d read the letter.\u201cWe have consistently found ourselves facing an institutional culture that inherently dismisses and discriminates against us.\u201dDemanding a public apology from the organisation \u201cfor participating in and upholding racist behaviours and wilfully ignoring reports of our experiences\u201d, the signatories called for resignations, higher staff salaries and for former staff to be released from non-disclosure agreements.Some of those behind the letter told the Guardian they wanted to remain anonymous because of their traumatic experiences.\u201cWe were humiliated in public meetings, and when we managed to speak up to share an idea or feedback, it was often ignored or repeated by somebody else, usually a white woman, who then got the credit. We were routinely gaslit in private meetings when we tried to reach out for help.\u201cAfter years of this, you have to dig real deep to keep showing up each day in order to pay rent.\u201dThe New York-based IWHC lobbies on sexual and reproductive health and rights internationally and provides grants to feminist groups. Its 2019 annual report shows it distributed more than $2.8m (\u00a32.2m) in grants to more than 100 organisations and activists around the world while 65% of IWHC\u2019s revenue came from foundations, including the Open Society Foundation, the Oak Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.The IWHC board said in a statement that it \u201ctakes discrimination, racism, and bullying seriously, and apologises to anyone impacted by such behaviour\u201d.Regan told the Guardian on Thursday she could not comment on specific allegations, but confirmed an investigation was underway.\u201cWe believe very strongly as a social justice organisation that we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard and we intend on doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are committed to coming out of this stronger. The organisation has critical work to do, we have a critical role to play.\u201dExplore more on these topicsWomen's rights and gender equalityRaceAidnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
