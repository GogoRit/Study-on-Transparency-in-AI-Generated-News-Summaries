But the infant was heavily sedated, her body swollen, partially paralyzed and hooked to the ventilator that has kept her alive for much of the past year.\nTinslee has never seen the outside of the intensive care unit of Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center in Fort Worth, and she may never get the chance. Tinslee\u2019s doctors, who say continuing treatment is futile and causing her to suffer, want to take her off life support. But her mother, Trinity Lewis, is battling the hospital in court in a desperate fight for Tinslee\u2019s life.\nLewis\u2019 efforts have attracted the backing of conservative elected officials and a prominent anti-abortion organization. They have painted Tinslee\u2019s case as a fundamental \u201cright to life\u201d issue in a legal battle to strike down a law that protects doctors\u2019 right to deny \u201cinappropriate\u201d medical treatment.\nTexas medical experts say conservative organizations and politicians are co-opting Tinslee\u2019s case in an effort that is more about advancing a political agenda than it is about preserving a child\u2019s life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis issue is about inflicting unnecessary pain on a patient. ... It\u2019s one of quality of life, and dignity,\u201d said Jon Opelt, executive director of Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a medical interest group that is supporting Cook Children\u2019s. He added that framing the issue as \u201cpro-life\u201d is misleading.\nThe staunch anti-abortion group Texas Right To Life has stepped in on behalf of the Lewis family, providing legal representation, funding attorney\u2019s fees and handling public relations for the family as the case gains national attention. The group called the law at the center of the battle \u201cunprecedented and unethical\u201d while questioning its constitutionality.\nYet two decades ago, Texas Right to Life spent more than a year helping write that very law.\n\u201cLife-or-death decision\u201d\nBorn with a rare heart defect named Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, a chronic lung disease and other medical conditions, Tinslee has undergone multiple open-heart surgeries since birth and required breathing assistance since July. Her physicians say she\u2019s terminally ill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a major surgery in July failed to improve Tinslee\u2019s condition, doctors began discussing the possibility of taking her off life support. Lewis firmly rejected ending her daughter\u2019s care.\nBy September, the Lewis family and the hospital were at an impasse. Doctors requested that the hospital\u2019s ethics committee review their decision to remove Tinslee\u2019s ventilator \u2014 the first step in an end-of-life dispute resolution process outlined in a state law called the Texas Advance Directives Act.\nAdvance directives are legal documents that spell out a person\u2019s wishes for end-of-life care. Patients like Tinslee, who are unable to decide their own medical treatment, must rely on family members.\nTexas Right to Life helped the Lewis family sue the hospital, asking for courts to declare parts of the state law unconstitutional in an effort to prevent the hospital from ending treatment. Attorney General Ken Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott, both Republicans, threw their support behind the Lewis family, calling for judges to stop the doctors from taking Tinslee off of life support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSimply put, this case presents a life-or-death decision,\u201d Abbott and Paxton said in a legal brief. \u201cThe issues raised by baby [Tinslee Lewis\u2019] appeal are of the utmost importance not only to her and her family, but also to all Texans: the right to life and due process guaranteed by the United States and Texas Constitutions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, left, and Attorney General Ken Paxton, both Republicans, have called for judges to stop doctors from taking Tinslee Lewis off of life support.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Bob Daemmrich \n        \n\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Abbott\u2019s office deferred to Paxton for comment on this story. Paxton did not respond to requests by The Texas Tribune to be interviewed.\nBut Texas anti-abortion groups are not in lockstep regarding Tinslee\u2019s case. Many groups outside of Right to Life are siding with the medical community on the law.\nJoe Pojman, director of Texas Alliance for Life, a more moderate anti-abortion group, took issue with the injection of politics into Tinslee\u2019s case. Pojman\u2019s group, along with other anti-abortion groups in the state, filed a brief in support of Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s a pro-life position \u2014 to advocate for prolonging a patient\u2019s death through means that cause pain and suffering,\u201d Pojman said. \u201cIf this law needs to be tweaked, that ought to be done by the Legislature.\u201d\nAccording to state law, when a family\u2019s wishes and medical judgement clash, the hospital\u2019s ethics committee reviews the doctor\u2019s decision. If the committee sides with the doctor, the doctor has protection from liability; if it sides with the family, the physician can act as he or she chooses but will not be protected if the family decides to sue.\n\u201cNo other state has that,\u201d Pojman said, calling the process \u201cabsolutely unique.\u201d\nPojman said if the law is struck down, doctors stand to lose their legal protection \u2014 a loss he said he fears would make hospitals much more unwilling to accept and treat terminally ill patients in the first place\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are going to harm the patients they claim to want to protect,\u201d Pojman said. \u201cI think there are people who are trying to make political hay out of an issue that is not appropriate for politics.\u201d\nMuch of the legal battle hinges on a hotly contested provision of the law that gives families 10 days to find facilities willing to take on the burden of a terminally ill patient, should a hospital decide against them.\nTexas Right to Life vocally supported the rule in 1999. But the group later changed its mind and now says patients should have an unlimited amount of time to find a new hospital.\nTexas Advance Directives Act\nIn the 1990s, the state\u2019s anti-abortion coalition came together, determined to strike the right balance between a doctor\u2019s medical authority and a patient\u2019s wishes. They were concerned that the laws on the books gave doctors little incentive to continue treatment in terminal cases for fear of being sued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives from Texas Right to Life and Texas Alliance for Life, along with physicians, hospital associations and medical providers, spent more than a year debating new legislation. In 1999, the Texas Advance Directives Act emerged.\nAt the bill\u2019s hearing before the House\u2019s Public Health Committee, opposition was scarce. Joe Kral, legislative director for Texas Right to Life at the time, spoke at that hearing and asked for no revisions.\n\u201cWe are really united behind this language,\u201d Kral said at the time. \u201cWe worked hard and we found common ground. I\u2019ll just ask everyone on this committee to always please respect this coalition. Because even though it\u2019s strong where it\u2019s strongly united behind this language, it is still fragile. Any kind of substantial change could cause it to fall apart, literally.\u201d\n\n\n\n    Reference\n  \n\n\n1999 testimony from Right To Life's Joe Kral at House Committee on Public Health\n\n(96.5\u00a0KB) DOWNLOAD\n\n\nKral said he left Texas Right to Life in 2003, citing a \u201cdifference of opinion.\u201d But in an interview, he said the group\u2019s insistence on dismantling the law it worked so hard to create is \u201cmystifying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we aren\u2019t seeing an influx of pro-life leaders rushing to their side on this issue,\u201d Kral said. \u201cI think a lot of them fundamentally understand you have to be consistent.\u201d\nKimberlyn Schwartz, a Texas Right to Life spokeswoman, said last week that the group had apprehensions about the Texas Advance Directives Act even while it was being shaped.\nSchwartz said Texas Right to Life leaders were misled at the time. Assured there would be more patient protections than there were, they had signed off on it. Once it passed, she said, the group realized how \u201cdangerous\u201d a law it was.\nThere\u2019s a lot to the law that Texas Right to Life wants to change, Schwartz said, but the main focus is eliminating the \u201ccountdown\u201d \u2014 the 10-day provision \u2014 and refusing any time limit on finding a new hospital for transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unethical to place a countdown on patients\u2019 lives,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cOnly God has that power, to say when somebody is going to die. It should not be left to ethics committees.\u201d\nQuestions about quality of life should not be decided by a hospital, Schwartz said. As for doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 concerns when prolonging treatment, Schwartz said, eliminating the 10-day deadline gives doctors more incentive to get patients transferred.\nThe family has already appealed to more than 20 hospitals to take Tinslee. All of them have said no.\n\u201cTinslee is a fighter\u201d\nTinslee is in near-constant pain and swollen from excess fluid, according to the hospital. Her nurses vigilantly monitor her bedside for fear that at any moment, her body will shut down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt one point in the past year, Tinslee experienced what doctors called \u201cdying events\u201d several times a week, during which her oxygen levels plummeted and nurses rushed to manually inflate her lungs. These events, sometimes triggered by something as routine as a diaper change, were avoided only by increasing her sedation levels.\nThe Lewis family\u2019s lawyers disagree on nearly all these points. According to their brief, Tinslee is not in pain, her condition is improving and she responds positively to her environment. Joe Nixon, one of the family\u2019s attorneys, said Tinslee is responsive to cartoons and her mother painting her nails; the atmosphere in the hospital room is \u201chappy and upbeat.\u201d\n\u201cThose folks are ill,\u201d Nixon said, referring to groups that have backed Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center. \u201cThey have nothing to do with this family and they are poorly informed.\u201d\nTinslee has health insurance through Texas Medicaid, which pays for her medical care, Nixon said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Trinity Lewis won\u2019t talk to reporters, Nixon said, she has been publishing statements to Texas Right to Life\u2019s website. On Feb. 4, a few days after the latest court hearing, Lewis refuted \u201cmisinformation in the media\u201d and wrote that it was her belief Tinslee was not suffering.\nAccording to the blog post, the family\u2019s ultimate goal is a tracheotomy and a transition to palliative care.\n\u201cA lot of the nurses that care for her tell me that they enjoy caring for her,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cThey pray for Tinslee before their shift is over, they decorate her room, and help me take good care of her.\u201d\nFor now, Tinslee\u2019s case is tied up in an appeals court, which is expected to make a decision sometime in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTinslee is a fighter,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cAs long as she keeps responding to us and showing she is fighting, as her mom I will keep fighting for her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
