But the explanation for, say, an alleged gaffe that overturning the constitutional right to an abortion is a \u201chistoric victory of white life\u201d or a concern that not enough white babies are being born in the U.S. can be found in the history of the anti-abortion movement.\nThe movement to end legal abortion has a long, racist history, and like the great replacement theory, it has roots in a similar fear that white people are going to be outnumbered by people believed to hold a lower standing in society. Those anxieties used to be centered primarily around various groups of European immigrants and newly emancipated slaves, but now they\u2019re focused on non-white Americans who, as a group, are on track to numerically outpace non-Hispanic white Americans by 2045, according to U.S. Census projections.\nIt\u2019s been decades since the anti-abortion movement first gained traction \u2014 and the movement has changed in certain ways \u2014 but this fundamental fear has never left, as demonstrated by attacks on people of color, such as the shooter in Buffalo, New York, who expressed concern about the declining birth rates of white people. That\u2019s because the anti-abortion movement, at its core, has always been about upholding white supremacy.\n\nThroughout colonial America and into the 19th century, abortions were fairly common with the help of a midwife or other women and could be obtained until the point that you could feel movement inside, according to Lauren MacIvor Thompson, a historian of early-20th-century women\u2019s rights and public health. Most abortions were induced through herbal or medicinal remedies and, like other medical interventions of the time, weren\u2019t always effective or safe. \nBut the dynamics surrounding the procedure changed by the mid-19th century, as America\u2019s elites began to fear a rising tide of immigrants from Ireland, Italy and other European countries (people often viewed as \u201cinferior\u201d), suffragists seeking new freedoms and recently freed Black people, whom these elites feared were reproducing at higher rates than the white population. Laws limiting abortion, it was believed, would ultimately force middle- and upper-class white women \u2014 who had the most access to detect and terminate unwanted pregnancies \u2014 to bear more white children.\n\u201cThere were concerns that these other groups were demographically outpacing white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant women. And so they thought to limit the bodily autonomy of white women and limit access to contraception in order to force them to have children. That they felt would keep up with the demographic birth rate,\u201d said Alex DiBranco, the co-founder and executive director of the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism.\nIt took time for the anti-abortion movement to attract supporters, and unlike today, religious groups were not originally an active part of it. Still, momentum built as a small but influential number of physicians began arguing that licensed male doctors \u2014 as opposed to female midwives \u2014 should care for women throughout the reproductive cycle. In the late 1850s, one of the leaders of the nascent anti-abortion movement, a surgeon named Horatio Robinson Storer, began arguing that he didn\u2019t want the medical profession to be associated with abortion. He was able to push the relatively new American Medical Association to support his cause, and soon they were working to delegitimize midwives and enforce abortion bans. In an 1865 essay issued by order of the AMA, Storer went so far as to say of white women that \u201cupon their loins depends the future destiny of the nation.\u201d\n\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolitics\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead Now\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat will Democrats do about the Supreme Court? | FiveThirtyEight Politics PodcastAll VideosYouTube\nDeclining white birth rates, along with the rising eugenics movement \u2014 a now-discredited pseudoscience focused on the genetic fitness of white Americans \u2014 were connected to the practice of abortion, and this helped bolster flawed, racist arguments for a total ban of the procedure. \u201cThe physicians trying to pass these anti-abortion laws were concerned about how abortion was a \u2018danger\u2019 to our society and the ways we want our country to be,\u201d said Shannon Withycombe, a professor of history at the University of New Mexico who studies 19th-century women\u2019s health.\nTheir tactics worked. By the 1900s, abortion was illegal in every U.S. state.\nDespite this, though, women continued to seek abortions. It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s and 1970s that women\u2019s access to safe and legal abortions began to change. Feminist activists, armed with college and law-school degrees, began to advocate for overturning or relaxing these bans. They argued that the existing laws made abortion less safe for women and that reproductive health, including abortion, was necessary for women\u2019s equality. Public attitudes started to shift then, too, and in 1967, Colorado became the first state to liberalize its abortion laws, allowing exceptions for the life or health of the pregnant person. Other states followed suit, and by 1972, a total of 13 had similar laws. Four states had repealed their anti-abortion laws entirely.\u00a0\nAnd, of course, in 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that abortion was a constitutional right. But while the decision in Roe overturned the nation\u2019s remaining abortion bans, it didn\u2019t address the underlying forces that had helped establish them, which brings us to today, as the anti-abortion movement is once again front and center following the court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe.\n\nThe political consequences of overturning Roe v. WadeAll VideosYouTube\nThese old fears have risen to the fore again in part because the country is experiencing a demographic change similar to what we saw at the turn of the last century. For instance, the U.S. birth rate has been declining, although this has more to do with women having greater access to contraception, education and career opportunities than it has to do with abortion rates. But immigration levels are also high, almost as high as they were at the turn of the 20th century, again spawning a fear that white Americans will be displaced in an increasingly multiracial nation.\u00a0\nPolling suggests these fears have taken hold among the American electorate, too. In a December 2018 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, a 38 percent plurality of Americans said the U.S. becoming more diverse would \u201cweaken American customs and values.\u201d This way of thinking is especially prevalent among Republicans, who said by 59 percent to 13 percent that having a majority nonwhite population would weaken rather than strengthen the U.S. (Twenty-seven percent said this would not have much impact either way.) According to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in December, 47 percent of Republicans (compared with 22 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of independents) agreed with the statement that \u201cthere is a group of people in this country who are trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants who agree with their political views.\u201d\nAnd these anxieties over immigration have become explicitly connected to the birth rate in some statements from prominent Republicans. In 2017, when he was representing Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District in the U.S. House, Steve King directly made the connection: \u201cYou cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies. You\u2019ve got to keep your birth rate up, and that you need to teach your children your values.\u201d More recently, in May, Matt Schlapp, the head of the Conservative Political Action Coalition, echoed a similar sentiment when he advocated for a ban on abortion. And in June, Illinois Rep. Mary Miller called the end of Roe a \u201chistoric victory for white life\u201d at a rally with former President Donald Trump, who still holds a tight grip on the Republican Party and may run for president again. The crowd responded to Miller\u2019s statement with applause, though her spokesperson later said she had misspoken and meant to say \u201cvictory for a right to life.\u201d (Miller did not try to correct herself onstage, however.) \nMoreover, other, more extreme far-right groups have visibly joined with the anti-abortion movement. This year, the white nationalist Patriot Front showed up at March for Life rallies in Chicago and Washington, D.C. \u201cThe white nationalist segment of anti-abortion organizing is really long-standing,\u201d said DiBranco, of the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism. \u201cAnd, in recent years, there\u2019s been more of an emboldenment about using great replacement rhetoric or similar kind of rhetoric around to what they might call \u2018white genocide\u2019 or demographic change.\u201d\nEven on its own terms, though, the logic of tying the anti-abortion movement to the racist great replacement theory is deeply convoluted \u2014 and downright inaccurate. For instance, fewer women are seeking abortions, and women of color \u2014 particularly those who are Black \u2014 are more likely than white women to seek an abortion. Moreover, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll see more women of color die as abortions become more limited, in spite of arguments from some on the far right that a near-total abortion ban is a good thing for people of color, primarily Black people. In fact, according to analysis published in the December edition of the population-research journal \u201cDemography,\u201d a hypothetical total abortion ban would lead to more pregnancy-related deaths among non-Hispanic Black people than among any other racial group. \n\nSupreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade | FiveThirtyEight Politics PodcastAll VideosYouTube\nBut logic is not the point in many of the mainstream racist arguments around restricting abortion access. \u201cThey tried to twist themselves into logical scientific explanations for all of these things. But they basically had to just make stuff up to justify what they wanted, which is for women \u2014 especially women of color \u2014 to not have any rights,\u201d said Thompson, the historian.\nAccording to Nicola Beisel, a professor emerita at Northwestern University who studies cultural sociology, sex and gender, women\u2019s ability to have children is treated as a resource instead of a matter of bodily autonomy or a right, which is why opposing abortion is part of the bigger conversation about who is having children. \u201cIf women\u2019s reproductive capacity is a resource, the question is, who\u2019s going to get to use it? And for whom?\u201d \nThis is why anti-abortion activists pressed until Roe was overturned, and they likely won\u2019t stop there. It\u2019s clear that the people who want to criminalize abortion also want to limit access to contraception, DiBranco said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a part of a political project and a cultural project around controlling women\u2019s autonomy, and in some cases, managing demographic change through that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Samuels was a politics reporter at FiveThirtyEight.   @AlexSamuelsx5\n\n\n\nMonica Potts is a senior politics reporter at FiveThirtyEight.   @MonicaBPotts\n\n\n\nFiled under\nAbortion (166 posts)\nRacism (27)\nConspiracy Theories (12)\nWhite Supremacy (4)\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Interactives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Abortion\n\n\n\n \nPolitics Podcast Politics Podcast: How Much Is Abortion Motivating Voters?\nAug 14, 2023\n\n\n\n \n2023 Election A Special Election In Ohio Shows Voters Still Care About Abortion\nAug 9, 2023\n\n\n\n \nPolitics Podcast Politics Podcast: Ohio Voters Weigh In On Abortion (Indirectly)\nAug 7, 2023\n\n\n\n \n2023 Election Everything You Need To Know About The Ohio Ballot Measure That Could Block Abortion Rights\nAug 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\nImpeachment What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry\nSep 14, 2023\n\n\n2024 Election The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans\nSep 13, 2023\n\n\n2024 Election Why 'Bidenomics' Isn't Working For Biden\nSep 12, 2023\n\n\nPolitics Podcast Politics Podcast: Polling Silly Season Begins\nSep 11, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGet more FiveThirtyEight\t\t\n\n\n\nStore\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nData\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @FiveThirtyEight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nMasthead\n\n\nPitch FiveThirtyEight\n\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPowered by WordPress VIP \n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\n\n\nInterest-Based Ads\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.
