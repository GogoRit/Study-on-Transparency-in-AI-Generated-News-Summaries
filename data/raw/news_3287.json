Wade. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin applauded Friday\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision abolishing the constitutional right to an abortion and said Virginia Republicans will get to work on legislation \u201cprotecting the life of unborn children\u201d by potentially banning most abortions after 15 weeks.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has rightfully returned power to the people and their elected representatives in the states,\u201d Youngkin said in a statement released roughly an hour after the court handed down the seismic ruling that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a pro-life governor and plan to take every action I can to protect life. The truth is, Virginians want fewer abortions, not more abortions.\u201d\nThe ruling, which gives states new power to restrict and regulate abortion, has no immediate impact in Virginia, where abortion remains legal largely because pro-choice Democrats have controlled the governor\u2019s mansion for most of the last decade and currently hold a narrow majority in the state Senate. But it will undoubtedly make abortion rights a top issue in a politically divided state, where Republicans won the upper hand in last year\u2019s elections and could potentially take full control of the statehouse in 2023.\nDemocrats and abortion-rights supporters reacted to the court ruling with horror, calling it a devastating blow to a fundamental right women have had for 50 years.\n \u2018We don\u2019t want to go back in time\u2019\n\nHannah Sellars, a 29-year-old Richmond resident who attended a pro-abortion rights rally at the state Capitol a few hours after the news hit, said she had hoped the draft version of the opinion leaked in May was just a threat or a \u201cfluke.\u201d Seeing it become real, she said, left her \u201cterrified.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be the beginning of the end for women\u2019s rights,\u201d Sellars said. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve come so far. We don\u2019t want to go back in time.\u201d\nSome protesters began an impromptu march on Capitol Square after the rally, but Capitol Police told them they weren\u2019t allowed to continue demonstrating on the statehouse grounds because the rally permit had expired. As activists began planning more protests Friday night, Youngkin called for civility and asked Virginians to \u201crespect the rule of law.\u201d\nWhile the area surrounding the Capitol will remain open for now, the state\u2019s Department of General Services announced it was taking \u201cpreparatory measures\u201d to secure Capitol Square, including installing additional protective fencing.\n\u201cI am in regular contact with the Supreme Court justices and my administration is in coordination with our mayors and local and state police to ensure we are ready to take appropriate action if need be,\u201d Youngkin stated. \u201cVirginia will not stand for lawlessness or violence.\u201d\nDemocrats and activists sought to rally supporters to protect and expand the slim Democratic majority in the state Senate and its ability to block imminent Republican efforts to roll back abortion access. Control of the House of Delegates, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority and have introduced several unsuccessful anti-abortion bills, will also be up for grabs in next year\u2019s elections.\n\u201cI\u2019m angry today,\u201d said Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who spoke at the same rally outside the Capitol. \u201cI\u2019m angry today because we are fighting the same fights that our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents fought. I\u2019m fighting because for the first time in my lifetime, the Supreme Court has taken away one of my rights. I am angry because my seven-year-old daughter will have less rights when she comes of childbearing age than I do.\u201d\n\u201cBut if we\u2019ve got to fight, we\u2019re going to keep on fighting,\u201d she added.\n\u00a0\n  Virginia Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, spoke at a Friday rally in Richmond opposing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)\n A \u2018bipartisan consensus?\u2019\n\nThe Family Foundation, one of Virginia\u2019s top anti-abortion groups, said it was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the ruling.\n\u201cToday, we pause to celebrate the right to life of babies around the nation being protected, but tomorrow the work begins in Virginia to protect life throughout the commonwealth,\u201d said Family Foundation president Victoria Cobb.\nYoungkin, who has expressed support for so-called pain threshold legislation that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks, said he\u2019s invited four Republican General Assembly members to help him \u201cbring together legislators and advocates\u201d to prepare a bill for consideration in the 2023 legislative session.\n\u201cWe can build a bipartisan consensus on protecting the life of unborn children, especially when they begin to feel pain in the womb, and importantly supporting mothers and families who choose life.\u201d Youngkin said.\n  Gov. Glenn Youngkin attended Virginia\u2019s fourth March for Life, an annual anti-abortion event held outside the Capitol, on April 27, 2022. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)\nThe governor\u2019s office said Youngkin supports abortion exceptions in cases involving rape or incest or where the mother\u2019s life is at risk.\nSpeaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said House Republicans \u201cstand ready\u201d to reduce abortions in the state.\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Democrats will end their use of scare tactics and work with Republicans as the people of Virginia expect,\u201d he said. \u201cThis decision places an enormous responsibility back into the hands of the General Assembly.\u201d\nThe prospects for bipartisanship on such a deeply felt issue appeared dim. Some Democratic lawmakers noted Youngkin had only named Republicans to the group that will ostensibly work toward a compromise.\n\u201cMake no mistake\u2014we will protect a person\u2019s right to choose in Virginia,\u201d the Senate Democratic Caucus said in a news release.\nA key vote in Senate Democrats\u2019 narrow majority is Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, who voiced \u201cgreat surprise\u201d Friday at the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to disregard its convention of respecting long-held precedents that are \u201cpart of the fabric of the court and society.\u201d Morrissey, whose Catholic faith informs his anti-abortion position, also emphasized his past votes in favor of women\u2019s rights.\n\u201cMy position, which I think is shared by many, many people in my district, is that I am personally opposed to abortion,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cHowever, as a legislator, I don\u2019t think I have the right to tell other women what to do with their body\u201d\nMorrissey disavowed \u201cextremists on the left and on the right\u201d\u2014 including his pro-abortion rights primary opponent Lashresce Aird \u2014 and said he believes his position aligns with the average person in his district.\n\u201cI think a suitable marker or middle ground is this \u2014 if the fetus can feel pain,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s 20 weeks, 22 weeks, 21 weeks, that might be the point where the state says \u2018we\u2019re going to prohibit abortion.\u2019\u201d\nHowever, he didn\u2019t fully commit to supporting potential legislation banning abortions based on a fetal pain threshold, saying he would give it \u201cdue consideration\u201d and there \u201cmust be exceptions for rape or incest.\u201d\nSen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, an OBGYN who was one of the four Republicans Youngkin named to work on the issue, said overturning Roe was \u201cthe right thing to do constitutionally.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to take a deep breath and have an authentic conversation in Virginia,\u201d Dunnavant said. \u201cI am committed to having tough conversations, listening, building consensus and doing the right thing.\u201d\n  Alexandra Walker, 17 (right), and Sonia Krishna, 16 (left), attended a rally outside the Virginia Capitol after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling to overturn abortion protections established under Roe v. Wade. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)\n \u2018Cruel, dangerous and devastating\u2019\n\nUnder current state law, women have largely unrestricted access to abortion in the first and second trimesters. Abortion in the third trimester, which begins around the 28th week, are allowed only when three doctors decide continuing the pregnancy poses a severe threat to the mother.\nAbortions have generally declined in Virginia over the last five years, dropping from 17,381 procedures in 2016 to 15,688 in 2020, according to data provided to the Mercury by the state\u2019s Department of Health, which includes both terminated pregnancies and procedures to remove stillborn infants from the womb.\u00a0\nThat number increased by roughly 3.5 percent in 2021, rising to 16,251 procedures, aligning with a recent reversal in national trends. But state data also shows that the vast majority of procedures in which gestational age is known occur within the first trimester, or 12 weeks into pregnancy. Since 2016, only 45 abortions are confirmed to have been performed in the third trimester, the latest stage of pregnancy (of 97,211 procedures performed since 2016, roughly 34 percent do not include information about the trimester in which they were performed, according to state data).\n\u201cMost abortions after 20 weeks, something has gone terribly wrong,\u201d McClellan said after the rally. \u201cMost of the time, you\u2019ve had a very devastating fetal diagnosis, and in those cases, the baby won\u2019t survive. So families are left with a devastating diagnosis, and now the governor would take away their ability to decide what\u2019s best for them.\u201d\nLike other pro-choice advocates, she described Virginia as a \u201csafe haven\u201d in the South thanks to the General Assembly\u2019s rollback of abortion restrictions under its former Democratic majority. Since the draft leak in May, providers and pro-choice advocates have warned that out-of-state patients are likely to drive up demand for the procedure.\u00a0\nBoth Kentucky and Tennesse have so-called \u201ctrigger laws\u201d to ban abortion within 30 days of Roe being overturned, and West Virginia \u2014 which outlaws the procedure after 20 weeks \u2014 still has a law criminalizing abortion on the books.\u00a0\nREPRO Rising Virginia, a statewide pro-choice advocacy group, is expecting thousands of out-of-state patients to seek care in Virginia following the decision, according to executive director Tarina Keene.\n\u201cToday\u2019s Supreme Court decision is cruel, dangerous and devastating,\u201d she said in a Friday statement. The Virginia chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also opposed the decision, describing it as a \u201cdangerous intrusion\u201d into the practice of medicine that could lead to doctors being criminalized for providing needed treatment.\n\u201cWe remain opposed to government interference in the patient-physician relationship,\u201d the organization said in a statement, adding that it was \u201cunacceptable for doctors and health care professionals to be punished, fined, or sued and face imprisonment for delivering evidence-based care.\u201d\nOther attendees at Friday\u2019s rally worried the decision could lead to the rollback of other rights under a Republican-controlled legislature \u2014 especially after Justice Clarence Thomas urged the Supreme Court to reconsider other rulings on access to contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage.\n\u201cThey came for women today,\u201d said 28-year-old Jared Rondeau, who drove from Petersburg to attend the rally. \u201cBut they said in the ruling they\u2019re coming for gay people tomorrow. And if I don\u2019t come out now, who\u2019s going to stand up for me?\u201d\u00a0\nAlexandra Walker, 17, and Sonia Krishna, 16, said even though they aren\u2019t old enough to vote yet, they\u2019ll do what they can to fight back.\n\u201cI think us coming out and making sure our legislators know this is not what Virginians want, this is not what Americans want\u2026 is so important,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt obviously didn\u2019t deter the Supreme Court.
