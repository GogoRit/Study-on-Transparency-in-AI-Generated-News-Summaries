Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys representing the North Carolina Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate\u00a0asked the court\u00a0to dismiss the case,\u00a0Planned Parenthood South Atlantic v. Moore, last week.\n\nNorth Carolina-based abortion providers and a national pro-abortion advocacy group were challenging the state\u2019s prohibition on telemedicine abortions, a 72-hour informed-consent period, facility safety codes, the requirement that facilities provide patients with informed-consent information, and a law ensuring that an abortion only be performed by a licensed physician. Now, after they filed a\u00a0voluntary dismissal\u00a0of the lawsuit Thursday, all five laws can remain in effect, helping ensure that women undergo serious procedures only when they are well aware of the risks and alternatives under the care of a licensed physician treating the patient in person.\n\n\u201cEvery woman deserves to have all the information she needs to make the healthiest choice for everyone involved in an unexpected pregnancy,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Denise Harle, director of the ADF Center for Life. \u201cTragically, many women turn to abortion as a last resort, unaware of the resources available to them or the harms of abortion. No one benefits more from this situation than abortionists and their facilities. We\u2019re pleased to have favorably closed this case on behalf of the legislators we represent, and to see these life-saving state laws that empower women remain in effect.\u201d\n\nPronunciation guide: Harle (HAR\u2019-lee)\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building, non-profit legal organization committed to protecting religious freedom, free speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life.\n# # #\n\n\n\n\nRelated Press Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7th, 2021\n\n\n\nNC legislators ask court to dismiss case challenging laws protecting women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Profiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
