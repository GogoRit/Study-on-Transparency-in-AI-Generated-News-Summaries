This kind of provision is not appropriate for a constitution.\u00a0\nHowever, there are other substantial objections to this amendment. First, let\u2019s look at the actual text:\n\u201c22. Regulation of abortion. Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother.\u201d\nThe Kansas Legislature is predominantly male, conservative Republicans. This would be workable if the members actually espoused traditional Republican principles.\nBut how are \u201cfamily values\u201d demonstrated by a Republican-led legislature interfering with the decision how many children a family should have, regardless of its economic circumstances; that a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest must be completed; that a woman must carry to term a fetus that has no prospect of life; or that a pregnancy endangering a woman\u2019s life or long-term health is acceptable.\nKeep in mind that this amendment offers no guarantee of any exceptions to an abortion ban. The wording in the amendment says that the Legislature may create exceptions. Many legislators have indicated that this is the first step toward eliminating all rights to abortions in Kansas.\nHow is this amendment consistent with \u201climited government?\u201d Supporters of the amendment apparently believe that government should be limited except for interventions that favor their worldview or religious beliefs. A legislature making medical decisions for women does not feel like \u201climited government.\u201d Such decisions, whatever the situation, should be made by the woman involved and whomever she chooses to include.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does this amendment \u201cvalue\u201d women? By taking away their ability to make fundamental decisions about their own lives? By forcing them to seek such care from illegal and unsafe sources, or subjecting themselves to self-treatments that are even more dangerous?\n\n\n\u2013 Guy McCormick\n\n\nHow does this amendment \u201cvalue\u201d women?

This amendment actually values women less.\nHistorians have told my wife and me that through their interviews with previous generations, Kansas cemeteries have many graves of women who died from botched or self-inflicted abortions. They took desperate steps when they saw no other course.\nOne of those women was my wife\u2019s grandmother, who died 106 years ago. I do not believe we should judge these actions. We should ensure that these tragedies never happen again. Will we once again see hospitals and morgues filled with women who saw no option other than an illegal abortion? Do we really want that?\nIn addition to an amendment that does not guarantee any exemptions, the propaganda from amendment supporters is spreading lies. The amendment supposedly is needed to prevent allowing abortions up to the moment of birth; allowing taxpayer-funded abortions; allowing partial birth procedures; or allowing health clinics to ignore health and safety standards.\u00a0\nHowever, none of these practices is allowed under current state law. The propaganda is designed to grab people who don\u2019t bother to read the actual amendment, and to make them believe that these practices are currently allowed.\n\u00a0It is important to reduce the number of abortions to as few as possible. No one is really \u201cpro- abortion.\u201d However, meaningful ways to reduce that number need to be expanded: availability of family planning information and materials; support for women with problem or unintended pregnancies to carry to term, which a vast majority of women want; and even economic policies that make it more possible to have and raise children.\u00a0\nThe vote on this amendment will be in the August 2 primary election.
