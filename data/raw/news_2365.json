COCC has historically drawn student criticism. This year\u2019s protests began Jan. 23 when student activists chalked messages in Red Square opposing the event.\nAlthough fighting for anti-abortion causes may become tiresome, people must seek to develop a society that protects and cherishes all life, according to one of COCC\u2019s keynote speakers Jonathan Reyes.\nCARDINAL O\u2019CONNOR CONFERENCE/FACEBOOK | Speakers at the 21st Annual Cardinal O\u2019Connor Conference for Life brought attention to the theme of morality behind recent anti-abortion state laws.\n\u201cThere\u2019s can be something romantic about finding a cause, falling in love with it. Caring for people. But romanticism about caring for the elderly, caring for the poor, caring for the unborn, caring for mothers, it will wear off,\u201d he said. \u201cBuild a culture of life. Give everything you have for it. Not just because the culture needs you but because you need it. Let\u2019s change the conversation that all may know they have an inherent dignity.\u201d\nReyes serves as the executive director for the Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development and the assistant general secretary for integral human development at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The second keynote speaker at COCC was Bethany Madonna, vocation director for Sisters of Life, a Catholic religious community of women dedicated to promoting anti-abortion causes.\nCOCC, which was originally founded by Georgetown University students in 2000, convenes students, clergy and activists from around the country to engage in discourse over a variety of anti-abortion topics, according to the COCC website.\nThe pro-abortion rights argument\u2019s emphasis on attaining greater dignity for all human beings is applicable to women who choose to get abortions, according to Madonna.\n\u201cWe see in their hearts the sorrow, the pain, the shame, the guilt, the depression, the anxiety, the anger,\u201d Madonna said. \u201cJesus comes. Jesus comes, and his mercy has real power to make them new, to restore innocence.\u201d\nFollowing the keynote addresses, the recipient for the Rev. Thomas King, S.J. Award was announced. The award, which was granted to two groups the University of St. Thomas Celts for Life this year, recognizes collegiate anti-abortion groups. The all-day conference also featured a panel discussion on the theme of consistent life ethic and the law later in the afternoon.\nH*yas for Choice, an unrecognized pro-abortion rights student group on campus, organized a protest in Healey Circle on the morning of COCC. The protest was supported by the Georgetown University College Democrats and GU Pride.\nThe purpose of the protest was to raise awareness about the harmful beliefs propagated by COCC and to demand that the university end its support of COCC, according to HFC President Talia Parker (COL \u201920).\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here today because we don\u2019t believe in anything the Cardinal O\u2019Connor conference stands for, and we think it\u2019s crazy that Georgetown funds and supports this and that administrators come to this,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re out here to show that this conference actively makes students on campus feel unsafe and that Georgetown should not be supporting this in any way. Ultimately, we want this conference to be gone from this school forever.\u201d\nCardinal John O\u2019Connor (GRD \u201970) has faced criticism for his condemnations of the LGBTQ community. He supported the prohibition of LGBTQ Catholics from the property of the Diocese of Brooklyn and opposed the 1986 passage of a New York City bill that would have banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, according to The New York Times.\nContinuing to host an event in the namesake of a person who held anti-LGBTQ beliefs tarnishes the work student activists have done to promote inclusion on campus, according to GU Pride Co-President Siena Hohne (COL \u201922).\n\u201cThe Cardinal O\u2019Connor Conference for Life has no place at Georgetown University, where we have worked tirelessly to foster an environment that is not only accepting, but celebratory of the LGBTQ+ community,\u201d Hohne said.\nMany OCC organizers and attendees were shocked by the heated nature of the protest against OCC, according to OCC Press Coordinator Sam Dubke (SFS \u201921).\n\u201cWe object to the particularly vitriolic rhetoric used by protestors this year,\u201d Dubke wrote. \u201cIt was particularly shocking to watch our Georgetown peers shout slogans like \u2018f**k the Church\u2019 at students and nuns as they attempted to enter our conference.We hope that, in the future, we can engage in more respectful dialogue with our fellow Hoyas.\u201d\nHoya Staff Writer Ashley Zhao contributed reporting.\nThis article has been updated to correct Cardinal O\u2019Connor Conference\u2019s abbreviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tView Comments (2)\n\n\nabortionAnna Ferrazicardinal o'connor conferencelgbtqpro-life\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate to The Hoya\n\n\nYour donation will support the student journalists of Georgetown University.
