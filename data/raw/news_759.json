She said that whether it\u2019s the Torah \u2014 the first five books of the Old Testament in the Hebrew Bible \u2014 or the Talmud \u2014 the central text of Rabbinic Judaism and the primary source of Jewish religious law and theology \u2014 those pieces of Jewish literature \u201creally draw the difference between life and potential life.\u201d\u00a0\nBut with the fall of Roe v. Wade in late June, some members of the Jewish faith as well as other religious groups find their beliefs in deep conflict with state laws that ban or greatly restrict abortion \u2014 especially if a pregnant patient\u2019s life is in danger.\u00a0\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision, states now are permitted to craft their own laws regarding abortion, and in Bogard\u2019s home state of Missouri, the procedure is banned.\u00a0\n\u201cOur congregants are heartbroken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really violating to be told what you can and can\u2019t do with your own self.\u201d\nLegal challenges are resulting. The enactment of state laws that ban or restrict access to abortion has already sparked a lawsuit in Florida from a liberal Jewish congregation in the Sunshine State. In Ohio, another liberal Jewish congregation is joining the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit against the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban.\u00a0\nA coalition of three dozen rabbis also filed a brief on a separate lawsuit in the Buckeye State, where physicians are challenging the new abortion law in the Supreme Court of Ohio.\nSimilar lawsuits are anticipated, not only from liberal Jewish congregations, but other religious groups as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAccording to Jewish law, a fetus is not considered a full human being and the biblical foundation for this is found in Exodus 21:22 of the Torah, a St. Louis rabbi pointed out in an interview. In fact, there are several passages in Jewish literature that make the distinction that the life of the person who is pregnant is prioritized.  \n\n\nThere\u2019s currently a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division filed by the Satanic Temple \u2014 not to be confused with the Church of Satan \u2014 on behalf of a member who argues the state\u2019s abortion ban violates that temple member\u2019s religious beliefs allowing access to an abortion ritual.\u00a0\nThe ritual involves members repeating verses in a mirror to affirm body autonomy and repel any guilt, shame or discomfort that can surface when undergoing an abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a wave of religious freedom lawsuits,\u201d Rabbi Daniel Bogard, who\u2019s married to Rabbi Karen Bogard, said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out if this country really believes in religious freedom, or whether this country believes in the freedom of a small minority to impose its will on the rest of us.\u201d\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s unclear if these religious-based lawsuits challenging state abortion laws can win in court.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much in the wild, wild west of abortion law and religious law,\u201d said Candace Bond-Theriault, the director of racial justice policy and strategy at Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Gender and Sexuality Law.\u00a0\nJewish law\nAccording to Jewish law, a fetus is not considered a full human being and the biblical foundation for this is found in Exodus 21:22 of the Torah, Rabbi Daniel Bogard said.\u00a0\nThe translation reads: \u201cWhen men fight, and one of them pushes a pregnant woman and a miscarriage results, but no other damage ensues, the one responsible shall be fined according as the woman\u2019s husband may exact from him, the payment to be based on reckoning. But if other damage ensues, the penalty shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\u2026\u201d\nRabbi Daniel Bogard said that the Jewish legal interpretation of these passages states that a fetus is not a person, because the miscarriage results in only monetary compensation, rather than the \u201clife for life\u201d punishment.\nThere are several other passages in Jewish literature that make the distinction that the life of the person who is pregnant is prioritized.\u00a0\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to live in a religiously free society, we are each allowed to interpret these verses on our own for our own traditions and a minority in this country can\u2019t impose their conservative white Christian religiosity on the rest of us,\u201d Rabbi Daniel Bogard said.\nThe lawsuits challenging abortion laws are predominately filed by congregations that practice Reform Judaism, but Conservative Judaism also supports access to abortion.\u00a0\nThe question of access to abortion gets more restrictive when it comes to Orthodox Judaism, but access to the medical procedure isn\u2019t barred, says Yedida Eisenstat, a fellow at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\u201cAbortion in Judaism absolutely does have a place, and within Jewish law, there absolutely is a place for abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cJudaism is not anti-abortion, like Christianity is, so it absolutely does make sense for Jewish congregations to be saying, \u2018Hey, this is a violation of our religious rights.\u2019\u201d\nEisenstat specializes in Jewish biblical interpretation and also works as an editorial associate at the Posen Library of Jewish Culture and Civilization.\n\u201cJudaism doesn\u2019t have one voice or one opinion or one ruling about everything,\u201d she said, adding that every situation is different and \u201cthere\u2019s all this other gray area,\u201d when it comes to theoretical cases in Jewish law pertaining to abortion.\u00a0\nAnd interpretations on abortion in Jewish law, or Halacha, vary across American Jewish denominations.\n\u201cWe use the theoretical cases to illuminate other cases \u2014 just like in American law \u2014 so there isn\u2019t one blanket answer for every situation, every situation has its own nuances,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd again, that\u2019s why this is a decision, a very personal decision, not one that the government should be making.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Rabbinical Assembly, a major institution of Conservative Judaism, condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs.\u00a0\n\u201cDenying individuals access to the complete spectrum of reproductive healthcare, including contraception, abortion-inducing devices and medications, and abortions, among others, on religious grounds, deprives those who need medical care of their Constitutional right to religious freedom,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\nOrthodox Judaism is typically more aligned with Christian conservative views on religious liberty issues, Eisenstat said, but differs on the belief that life begins at conception.\u00a0\nFollowing the Dobbs decision, the Rabbinical Council of America and Agudath Israel, large organizations that represent Orthodox Jewish communities, urged states to consider exceptions to expand abortion access.\u00a0\n\u201cAs the debate over abortion rights enters this new phase, we encourage states to craft policies that will simultaneously express the great value we place on life as well as protecting the rights to abortion when warranted by Jewish law,\u201d the Rabbinical Council of America said in a statement.\n  The interior of the Central Reform Congregation in St. Louis, is in the progressive tradition of Reform Judaism. Leaders say access to abortion care is a requirement of Jewish law and Missouri\u2019s abortion ban violates their members\u2019 religious freedom (Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent).\nFlorida lawsuits\nRabbi Barry Silver is a self-proclaimed \u201crabbi-rouser.\u201d\nHe\u2019s an attorney, a social activist, a former Democratic legislator in the Florida House of Representative and the leader of the Congregation L\u2019Dor va-Dor, a synagogue practicing progressive Judaism in Palm Beach, Florida.\u00a0\nSilver, along with three rabbis, a United Church of Christ reverend, a Unitarian Universalist minister, an Episcopal Church priest and a Buddhist lama, each have filed separate lawsuits challenging the state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban that went into effect July 1. Those suits argue that the new abortion law violates Florida\u2019s state constitution, as well as U.S. constitutional protections for freedom of speech and religion.\u00a0\nThe suits also claim the law creates \u201csubstantial\u201d burdens on individuals\u2019 ability to practice their faith, and creates a \u201cpotential\u201d burden on religious leaders to advise their members. Because of the vagueness of the law, Silver said, rabbis or other religious leaders who counsel their clergy members on abortion could face criminal charges.\n\u201cIt criminalizes the practice of Judaism as well as all the other religions that are not aligned with fundamentalist Christianity, which is pretty much everybody,\u201d Silver said of Florida\u2019s new abortion law.\u00a0\nSilver\u2019s Congregation L\u2019Dor Va-Dor also filed a separate suit in June in state court that argues the 15-week abortion ban violates the right to privacy guaranteed by the Florida state constitution.\n\u201cFor Jews, all life is precious and thus the decision to bring new life into the world is not taken lightly or determined by state fiat,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cAs such, the act prohibits Jewish women from practicing their faith free of government intrusion and this violates their privacy rights and religious freedom.\u201d\nSilver said he still plans to counsel his congregants who need or are considering abortion care, despite Florida\u2019s new law.\u00a0\n\u201cWe do the right thing and if they want to come after us, they can make our day, we\u2019re not going to stop saying what we need to say. We\u2019re not gonna stop practicing Jewish law,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nA spokesperson with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office did not answer questions from States Newsroom about whether the newly passed abortion law prevents Jewish people from practicing their faith.\n\u201cGovernor DeSantis is pro-life, and we believe HB 5 will ultimately withstand all legal challenges,\u201d a spokesperson with DeSantis\u2019 office wrote in an email to States Newsroom, referring to the abortion law. \u201cThe struggle for life is not over.\u201d\nCongregation L\u2019Dor Va-Dor\u2019s suit claiming Florida\u2019s constitution has an explicit right to privacy is \u201cfairly straightforward, and would generally be unremarkable,\u201d said Caroline Mala Corbin, a law professor at the University of Miami School of Law.\u00a0\n\u201cUnder the existing law, it\u2019s a no-brainer challenge,\u201d Corbin said.\nShe added that the Florida Supreme Court has interpreted that language to cover abortion.\n\u201cExcept that, like the U.S. Supreme Court, the Florida Supreme Court has taken a sharp turn to the right, so just as you have the U.S. Supreme Court completely remake abortion law, it\u2019s a possibility the Florida Supreme Court will as well,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nCorbin said the court could rule several ways in the congregation\u2019s case.\n\u201cThey might argue, \u2018We question your sincerity,\u2019 which would be shocking given how deferential they are to other claims of religious liberty,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe court could also rule that the congregation did not prove Florida\u2019s abortion law created a substantial burden, or that even if the law prevents someone from practicing their religion, \u201cthe state has a compelling reason for its law, and therefore, the state must prevail,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo the state might respond, even if this does affect your ability to live your religious truth, the state has a compelling interest in saving lives and therefore the state still prevails,\u201d Corbin said.\nFuture cases\nMicah Schwartzman, the director of the University of Virginia School of Law\u2019s Karsh Center for Law and Democracy, and the Hardy Cross Dillard professor of law, said lawsuits brought on behalf of a group of people, like the one from Silver\u2019s congregation in Florida, rather than a particular individual, will have more procedural hurdles to prove the group has standing to sue under state and federal law.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not terribly confident about these early lawsuits,\u201d Schwartzman said.\nHe pointed to the case in Texas, the one by the Satanic Temple, which the religious organization filed in federal court on behalf of one of its members, and said he expects to see similar cases.\n\u201cI think in the future, we\u2019re going to see cases that are brought on behalf of particular individuals who are burdened by abortion restrictions or prohibitions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those types (of cases) will have a stronger chance of surviving the preliminary stages of litigation.\u201d\nSchwartzman said there\u2019s also the question of religious exemptions, particularly in states that have enacted trigger law bans or near total bans on abortion, and whether those laws impose a burden on people trying to practice their religion.\nState abortion laws are going to have some exemptions for abortion, he said, such as in cases of rape and incest and to protect the life and health of the mother.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd in those circumstances, courts are going to face the question if these laws have certain secular exceptions, why shouldn\u2019t they also grant exceptions on religious grounds?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that will be the structure of many challenges that we will see in the future.\u201d\nElizabeth Sepper, a religious liberty, health law and equality scholar at the University of Texas School of Law, said that over the last couple of decades the Supreme Court has \u201creduced the establishment clause to rubble,\u201d which under the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing a religion.\u00a0\nWhen Roe v. Wade was initially issued, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to cover the cost of abortions, with some limited exceptions.\u00a0\nSepper said Congress\u2019 decision to pass a restriction related to abortion in the case of the Hyde Amendment, is an example of \u201can establishment of religion because when legislators pass abortion bans that say \u2018Well, human beings come into life at the moment of conception,\u2019 that\u2019s a doctrine \u2014 is a theological stance \u2014 that\u2019s rooted in a particular religious faith, and we all know religious faith that is.\u201d\n\u201cI think some large segment of the population on both sides of the abortion issue understands (that) to be the truth, which is that many abortion bans require religious reasoning,\u201d Sepper said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXJewish congregations mount legal challenges to state abortion bans\nby Ariana Figueroa, Tennessee Lookout August 26, 2022\nJewish congregations mount legal challenges to state abortion bans\nby Ariana Figueroa, Tennessee Lookout August 26, 2022\n \nWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of years of Jewish scripture make it clear that access to abortion care is a requirement of Jewish law and practice, according to Rabbi Karen Bogard.\n\u201cWe preserve life at all costs,\u201d she said in an interview with States Newsroom. \u201cBut there is a difference between that which is living, and that which is not yet living.\u201d\nBogard is a rabbi at Central Reform Congregation in St. Louis, which is in the\u00a0 progressive tradition of Reform Judaism.

Ron DeSantis\u2019 office did not answer questions from States Newsroom about whether the newly passed abortion law prevents Jewish people from practicing their faith.\n\u201cGovernor DeSantis is pro-life, and we believe HB 5 will ultimately withstand all legal challenges,\u201d a spokesperson with DeSantis\u2019 office wrote in an email to States Newsroom, referring to the abortion law. \u201cThe struggle for life is not over.\u201d\nCongregation L\u2019Dor Va-Dor\u2019s suit claiming Florida\u2019s constitution has an explicit right to privacy is \u201cfairly straightforward, and would generally be unremarkable,\u201d said Caroline Mala Corbin, a law professor at the University of Miami School of Law.\u00a0\n\u201cUnder the existing law, it\u2019s a no-brainer challenge,\u201d Corbin said.\nShe added that the Florida Supreme Court has interpreted that language to cover abortion.\n\u201cExcept that, like the U.S. Supreme Court, the Florida Supreme Court has taken a sharp turn to the right, so just as you have the U.S. Supreme Court completely remake abortion law, it\u2019s a possibility the Florida Supreme Court will as well,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nCorbin said the court could rule several ways in the congregation\u2019s case.\n\u201cThey might argue, \u2018We question your sincerity,\u2019 which would be shocking given how deferential they are to other claims of religious liberty,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe court could also rule that the congregation did not prove Florida\u2019s abortion law created a substantial burden, or that even if the law prevents someone from practicing their religion, \u201cthe state has a compelling reason for its law, and therefore, the state must prevail,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo the state might respond, even if this does affect your ability to live your religious truth, the state has a compelling interest in saving lives and therefore the state still prevails,\u201d Corbin said.\nFuture cases\nMicah Schwartzman, the director of the University of Virginia School of Law\u2019s Karsh Center for Law and Democracy, and the Hardy Cross Dillard professor of law, said lawsuits brought on behalf of a group of people, like the one from Silver\u2019s congregation in Florida, rather than a particular individual, will have more procedural hurdles to prove the group has standing to sue under state and federal law.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not terribly confident about these early lawsuits,\u201d Schwartzman said.\nHe pointed to the case in Texas, the one by the Satanic Temple, which the religious organization filed in federal court on behalf of one of its members, and said he expects to see similar cases.\n\u201cI think in the future, we\u2019re going to see cases that are brought on behalf of particular individuals who are burdened by abortion restrictions or prohibitions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those types (of cases) will have a stronger chance of surviving the preliminary stages of litigation.\u201d\nSchwartzman said there\u2019s also the question of religious exemptions, particularly in states that have enacted trigger law bans or near total bans on abortion, and whether those laws impose a burden on people trying to practice their religion.\nState abortion laws are going to have some exemptions for abortion, he said, such as in cases of rape and incest and to protect the life and health of the mother.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd in those circumstances, courts are going to face the question if these laws have certain secular exceptions, why shouldn\u2019t they also grant exceptions on religious grounds?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that will be the structure of many challenges that we will see in the future.\u201d\nElizabeth Sepper, a religious liberty, health law and equality scholar at the University of Texas School of Law, said that over the last couple of decades the Supreme Court has \u201creduced the establishment clause to rubble,\u201d which under the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing a religion.\u00a0\nWhen Roe v. Wade was initially issued, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to cover the cost of abortions, with some limited exceptions.\u00a0\nSepper said Congress\u2019 decision to pass a restriction related to abortion in the case of the Hyde Amendment, is an example of \u201can establishment of religion because when legislators pass abortion bans that say \u2018Well, human beings come into life at the moment of conception,\u2019 that\u2019s a doctrine \u2014 is a theological stance \u2014 that\u2019s rooted in a particular religious faith, and we all know religious faith that is.\u201d\n\u201cI think some large segment of the population on both sides of the abortion issue understands (that) to be the truth, which is that many abortion bans require religious reasoning,\u201d Sepper said.\n\n\n\n Tennessee Lookout is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
