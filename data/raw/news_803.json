One Texas Democrat hopes to give voters more of a say in abortion policy.\nState Rep. James Talarico, D-Round Rock, filed a joint resolution that would bar the Legislature from restricting abortion access any further. Talarico\u2019s proposal is different from a normal bill filed for the Legislature to consider. Joint resolutions, once passed by the Legislature by a two-thirds majority, must be approved by Texas voters in a statewide election as a ballot proposition before they directly amend the state\u2019s constitution.\nVoters have approved amendments to the state\u2019s constitution many times throughout the years, but Talarico\u2019s amendment is unlikely to end up at the ballot box anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s still a steep hill to climb,\u201d Talarico acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible \u2014 which I think proposing a total repeal of the abortion ban, I think that is impossible. This is not impossible, but it\u2019s still difficult.\u201d\nA steep hill to climb\nTalarico said that he knows that \u201cthe political reality\u201d of a Republican-controlled Legislature and a GOP governor means that proposing a total repeal of the laws banning abortion would be \u201cimpossible.\u201d Instead, he hopes that his approach will garner more bipartisan support since it does not inherently increase access to abortions.\n\u201c[This] is not necessarily a pro-choice or an anti-choice bill,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cIt takes the authority out of our hands and gives it directly to the people that we serve and represent, and I\u2019m hoping that that idea will start to gain traction amongst all my colleagues in this building.\u201d\nEven if the joint resolution does not pass in this legislative session, Talarico hopes it will spark a discussion that could be revisited in future legislative meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often the case that ideas need to be proposed in multiple sessions before they finally become law,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cNext session, maybe the session after that, as abortion continues to define our politics, as it increasingly becomes a difficult issue for some of my Republican colleagues since so many Texans are pro-choice, this may be an idea that can build momentum.\u201d\nTalarico\u2019s proposal certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time the state amended its constitution. While the United States Constitution has just 27 amendments, Texas\u2019 has more than 500. That doesn\u2019t include the 180 proposed constitutional amendments that voters have rejected throughout the state\u2019s history.\nAmending the state\u2019s constitution is much easier than amending the nation\u2019s \u2014 and is often necessary. The state\u2019s constitution is long, detailed and specific in the powers it grants lawmakers and public officials.\nIn 2019, for example, voters approved a state constitutional amendment that allowed retired service animals like police dogs to be adopted by their handlers. Lawmakers had to ask for voter approval because police dogs were considered state property, which the state\u2019s constitution requires be auctioned off or destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority of both the House and the Senate, while regular bills only require a simple majority. However, the governor doesn\u2019t wield veto power over joint resolutions \u2014 they head straight to the ballot once passed by both chambers.\nThe challenge facing Talarico\u2019s proposal lies in its subject matter.\nThough voters have overwhelmingly expressed in public polling that their stances on abortion do not align with current state laws, experts express skepticism that lawmakers will pass Talarico\u2019s resolution.\n\u201cLast session\u2019s Legislature passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, fully aware of what the public opinion landscape looked like because it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Josh Blank, director of research for The Texas Politics Project. \u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t changed since the Dobbs decision. Given that, there\u2019s very little reason to believe that the majority party in the Legislature would, one session later, significantly change its abortion policy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the wording of Talarico\u2019s proposed ballot item makes it less enticing for legislators to pass, according to Blank.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to tie the Legislature\u2019s hands. \u2026 Setting aside the fact that we\u2019re talking about abortion policy here, it\u2019s pretty rare that legislative bodies voluntarily agree to limit their own power,\u201d Blank said\nBallot propositions in other states\nIn 2022, six states across the country created abortion-related ballot measures that allowed citizens to vote directly on the issue, rather than a legislature determining abortion laws. In historically conservative states such as Kansas and Kentucky, voters rejected ballot initiatives that could have further restricted abortion access.\nTalarico is hoping his Texas version of the ballot initiative will receive similar support from voters if passed by the Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKentucky and Kansas are not blue states or purple states. They\u2019re deep red states. And still, their voters came together across partisan lines to protect access to abortion,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cI think Texans will do the same if they\u2019re given the chance.\u201d\nThe ballot initiative proposed by Talarico frames the issue differently than in Kansas and Kentucky. Talarico\u2019s initiative would allow voters to choose whether they think the legislature should have the ability to pass any additional laws that would further restrict access to abortion in Texas. The ballot initiatives in Kansas and Kentucky, on the other hand, allowed voters to affirm or deny that their state\u2019s constitutions do not inherently create a right to abortion.\nOther options\nSome Republican lawmakers have indicated that they are willing to consider legislation that would increase exceptions for abortions in the case of rape and incest.\nAnti-abortion groups, on the other hand, are happy to rest on their victories. Texas Right to Life President John Seago said that Talarico\u2019s bill is \u201ccompletely unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Texans really wanted to undo the pro-life victories, then they need to elect pro-abortion majorities in both chambers, and that obviously has not been what the electorate has decided to do in the last election,\u201d Seago said.\nInstead, Seago says the anti-abortion lobby will be focusing on \u201cenforcement\u201d of the state\u2019s current ban as it\u2019s main legislative priority \u2014 including addressing district attorneys who say they will not prosecute individuals who break the state\u2019s abortion laws.\nOther Democrats, meanwhile, have filed a number of traditional bills addressing abortion access, including one that would create an exception for rape and another that would essentially repeal current laws banning the procedure.\n\u201cWith anti-abortion politicians in the majority, advancing abortion rights will be a challenge, but we remain committed to exploring all viable options and working with partners in the long fight ahead,\u201d said Drucilla Tigner, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Texas Votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
