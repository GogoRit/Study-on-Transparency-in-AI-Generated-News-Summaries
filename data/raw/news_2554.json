It wasn\u2019t Residente\u2019s first time employing his fame to access a high-profile politician: Remember early in 2019, when he and Bad Bunny stormed the gates of the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Puerto Rico?\nThat effort resulted in an in-person, one-on-one convo with then-Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 (who later resigned, because #Rickyrenuncia). Topics discussed were conveyed by the interviewees, though\u2014the interview itself was not released to the public.\nIn this episode of #ResidentePregunta (yes, we made this up), the convo appears prescheduled; Bukele is a willing subject in the discussion, which was in part guided by questions sent to P\u00e9rez during the interview\u2014including one from Bad Bunny, apparently. The live amassed more than 150K viewers.\nA leading topic, of course, was Bukele and his administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The entirety of El Savlador is currently under quarantine, save for public servants, doctors, journalists, food distributors and others in industries deemed essential. (Military and police are also exempt from quarantine.)\nWhile the chat was probably scheduled, many of the questions P\u00e9rez asked did seem improvised. Bukele\u2019s response to two, in particular, were instantaneously condemned by the internet.\nThis is, approximately, when Bad Bunny comes in: \u201cRene, ask him what I told you,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by LGBT Puerto Rico on\u00a0Wednesday, March 25, 2020\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no concrete evidence as to what subject Benito wanted P\u00e9rez to broach. Because of the timing, though, the internet speculates it\u2019s related to El Salvador\u2019s LGBTQIA+ community.\nWrapped in an inquiry about how Bukele is protecting this population, P\u00e9rez asked Bukele for his thoughts on gay marriage: He is against any and all discrimination, but no, he does not support it.\n\n\nI caught the last few minutes. Ren\u00e9 asked Nayib about the LGBTQ community in El Salvador. I stopped paying attention for thirty seconds, then realized Nayib was describing each successive wave of European immigrants discriminating against those who came after them.\n\u2014 El Ticona  (@ni_soy_pastor) March 25, 2020\n\n\nMarriage is, by definition, meant for \u201ca man and a woman,\u201d according to Bukele. He notes, however, that he\u2019s in favor of other rights\u2014social security, hospital visitation\u2014for same-sex partners. Right now, El Salvador does not guarantee those rights by law.\nThen, Bukele\u2014on his own accord\u2014brings up the use of gender-neutral Spanish. Despite acknowledging the inherent machismo of the language, \u201ctodes\u201d is not a word you\u2019ll probably ever see him use. From Bukele\u2019s perspective, no positive change can be affected by adjusting the Spanish language for inclusivity.\n\u201cA letter wouldn\u2019t have [prevented] Alexa\u2019s murder,\u201d Bukele says, referring to the widely reported killing of a 28-year-old transgender woman in Puerto Rico last month.\n\n\nResidente is explaining to Nayib that Spanish is a machista language after Nayib went on a rant against the gender neutral \u201ctodes\u201d\n\u2014 Daniel Alvarenga (@_danalvarenga) March 25, 2020\n\n\nResidente rebukes: \u201cEvery detail, every letter counts.\u201d\nIn so few words, P\u00e9rez conveys the connection between how language can affect attitudes and perspectives, and also recognizes the historical pliability of all languages in response to sociological factors. Bukele, it seems, denies all that.\n\u201cInstead of wasting that time and resources in putting a different letter on words, maybe that time would be better used to persecute those criminals,\u201d Bukele returns.\nHis opinion on abortion\u2014which he\u2019s adamantly against, even in cases of rape\u2014is rooted in a similar line of thought. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t kill someone, especially someone defenseless, because of what their parents have done,\u201d he says. Fetuses are part of the \u201cmost vulnerable,\u201d along with children, people in poverty, the LGBTQI community, and the elderly, which he seeks to protect.\n\u201cI think, in the end, in the future, we\u2019re going to realize that [abortion] is a great genocide that we\u2019ve committed,\u201d Bukele says.\nThe interview between Rene P\u00e9rez and El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has been translated from Spanish to English. The acronym \u201cLGBTQI,\u201d rather than LGBTQIA+, is used here to reflect the subject\u2019s actual usage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreggaeton\nresidente\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\nSign up for our newsletter and receive the coolest updates!\n\nEmail\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nCareers\nAdvertising\nContact\nAgency\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\n\n\n              Most Popular\n          \n\n\nPHOTOS: Arca's Triumphant Homecoming at Bello Monte Acoustic Shell in Venezuela\n\n\nBy Joel Moya\n03.18.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
