The Kintnersville, Pa., resident was arrested Sept. 23, 2022, on federal charges for allegedly physically assaulting a volunteer escort at a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Philadelphia in October 2021. (CNS screen grab/TheKingsMen.org)FBI arrest of Pennsylvania pro-life leader called \u2018horrendous stunt\u2019\n September 26, 2022By Catholic News Service Catholic News Service\n\nFiled Under: Feature, News, Respect Life, World News\n\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA (CNS) \u2014 The head of the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia said the FBI\u2019s arrest of a prominent Catholic pro-life activist known for his sidewalk counseling outside a Philadelphia abortion facility is \u201ca horrendous stunt to intimidate pro-lifers.\u201d\nMark Houck, 48, was arrested at his home in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the morning of Sept. 23 for allegedly assaulting an abortion clinic volunteer a year ago in violation of the federal FACE Act.\nThe 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act prohibits intentional property damage and the use of \u201cforce or threat of force or \u2026 physical obstruction\u201d to \u201cinjure, intimidate or interfere with\u201d someone entering an abortion clinic.\n\u201cThere never was any blocking of access to an abortion center, and instead it was a moment of defense for the sake of his 12-year-old son,\u201d Tom Stevens, president and CEO of the Pro-Life Union, said in a statement Sept. 26. \u201cThis has been a consistent experience down at Planned Parenthood, where Mark and his family have been hassled.\u201d\nHouck made an initial appearance in federal court in Philadelphia the same day he was arrested. On Sept. 27, he was arraigned in the same court on two counts of allegedly violating the FACE Act.\nHe is being represented by Peter Breen, who is vice president and senior counsel at the Thomas More Society, a not-for-profit law firm based in Chicago.\n\u201cThis case is being brought solely to intimidate people of faith and pro-life Americans,\u201d stated Breen. \u201cMark Houck is innocent of these lawless charges, and we intend to prove that in court.\u201d\nSteve Ertelt of LifeNews.com, a pro-life news website, and other news outlets reported that Houck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie, said her husband was doing sidewalk counseling outside the Planned Parenthood-Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center Oct. 13, 2021, when a volunteer \u201cpatient escort\u201d leading women into the building to have abortions threatened the couple\u2019s son and yelled obscenities at him.\nRyan-Marie Houck said her husband pushed the man away from his son to protect the child after the man entered \u201cthe son\u2019s personal space\u201d and refused to stop hurling \u201ccrude \u2026 inappropriate and disgusting\u201d comments at the Houcks.\nPhiladelphia police records show officers responded to a report of assault at the Planned Parenthood facility.\nThe clinic volunteer, Bruce Love, was \u201cpushed to the ground \u2026 causing a scrape to his right arm,\u201d the police report said. News reports said later that police eventually decided there was a \u201clack of evidence\u201d that an assault took place \u201cand declined to pursue the issue any further.\u201d\nLove filed a criminal complaint against Houck last year, but according to various reports, the suit was dismissed because Love himself never showed up.\nAccording to the federal indictment, Houck allegedly twice assaulted \u201cB.L.,\u201d as he is identified in the court document, outside the center in two separate incidents on the same day.\n\u201cIn the first incident, B.L. was attempting to escort two patients exiting the clinic, when the defendant forcefully shoved B.L. to the ground,\u201d the indictment said. \u201cIn the second incident, the defendant verbally confronted B.L. and forcefully shoved B.L. to the ground in front of the Planned Parenthood center, causing injuries to B.L. that required medical attention.\u201d\nOn the morning of her husband\u2019s arrest,\u00a0 Ryan-Marie Houck said 25 to 30 armed FBI agents, who she said included SWAT members, raided the family\u2019s home at 7:05 a.m.\nShe said they entered the home, pointed rifles at her and her husband as the couple\u2019s seven children began screaming, and then arrested her husband, who is co-founder and president of the King\u2019s Men, an international laymen\u2019s apostolate.\n\u201cIt was all just very scary and traumatic,\u201d she told the National Review.\nA spokesperson with the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia office told Fox News Digital that claims about SWAT team members being involved in the arrest were inaccurate. \u201cFBI agents knocked on Mr. Houck\u2019s front door, identified themselves as FBI agents and asked him to exit the residence. He did so and was taken into custody without incident pursuant to an indictment.\u201d\nIn a later statement, the FBI said:\u00a0\u201cExtensive planning takes place prior to the service of any federal warrant. The FBI then employs the personnel and tactics deemed necessary to effect a safe arrest or search.\u201d\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s the FBI\u2019s standard practice not to discuss such operational specifics,\u201d the agency continued, \u201cwe can say that the number of personnel and vehicles widely reported as being on scene Friday (Sept. 23) is an overstatement, and the tactics used by FBI personnel were professional, in line with standard practices, and intended to ensure the safety of everyone present in and outside the residence.\u201d\nIf convicted of the offenses, Houck faces up to a maximum of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release and fines of up to $350,000.\nIn a Sept. 27 statement, the Thomas More Society said its attorneys notified the Justice Department \u201cthat case law in the same district\u201d where the Planned Parenthood center is located \u2014 and where Houck does sidewalk counseling \u2014 \u201chad held that the FACE Act does not cover one-off altercations like the one involving Houck, which was initiated by the abortion proponent who was harassing Houck\u2019s son.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department of Justice was also advised that if the decision was made to bring a charge against Houck despite lack of legal foundation, Houck would appear voluntarily,\u201d the release said, but Houck\u2019s \u201coffer to appear voluntarily\u201d was never accepted, it added.\nDuring a Dec. 1, 2021, prayer vigil in front of the same Planned Parenthood facility in Philadelphia, amid routine heckling and intimidation, Houck and other pro-life advocates stressed the need for prayer, fasting and a willingness to rejoice amid the inevitable rejection their pro-life advocacy incurs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been spit on, I\u2019ve been cursed at, I\u2019ve been mocked, I\u2019ve been pushed, I\u2019ve been shoved, I\u2019ve been knocked over,\u201d Houck told CatholicPhilly.com, the online news outlet of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. \u201cI give thanks for it, for the ability to suffer in a small way (for Christ).\u201d\nDuring the vigil, Planned Parenthood stationed an armed security guard outside the facility to take names and make notes on participants, who included moms, babies and senior citizens.\nContributing to this story was Gina Christian in Philadelphia.\n\nRead More Respect Life\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. bishops urge prayer as high court poised to hear cases on pill used in abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life group deplores Harris\u2019 historic visit to Planned Parenthood abortion clinic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody of preterm baby found in Virginia pond prompts prayers, resource reminders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople touched by adoption look to St. Joseph in national novena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarchers at Maryland March for Life call for defeat of constitutional amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSister of murdered French priest tells story of forgiveness, friendship with killer\u2019s mother\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Catholic News Service/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nCatholic News Service\n\nCatholic News Service is a leading agency for religious news.
