Bush similarly cast the pivotal fifth vote to reject the Trump administration\u2019s elimination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era initiative that protects young undocumented immigrants. He also voted to extend US anti-bias law to gay, lesbian and transgender workers. \n    \n\n            These recent actions reflect his broader choice, in the tumultuous time of coronavirus and racial strife under the presidency of Donald Trump this election year, to put the institutional integrity of the Supreme Court over personal ideology. \n    \n\n            Roberts, whose Washington career traces to the Reagan administration in the 1980s, has always held conservative instincts and social values. In very rare instances has he broken from those moorings. \n    \n\n            Overall, he has produced conservative rulings, including to curtail the reach of the Voting Rights Act, making it harder to prevent arguably discriminatory election procedures before they took effect. He joined the bare five-justice majorities that produced the 2010 Citizens United decision lifting limits on corporate and union money in elections and the 2008 decision declaring an individual Second Amendment right to bear arms. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient Roberto Martinez, left, celebrates with other DACA recipients in front of the Supreme Court on Thursday, June 18, 2020, in Washington. The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President Donald Trump's effort to end legal protections for 650,000 young immigrants, a stunning rebuke to the president in the midst of his reelection campaign. \n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhat the Supreme Court's ruling means for DACA participants and immigrants\n\n\n\n\n            For years the one exception to his pattern on the right wing was his 2012 decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, famously regarding the health care law\u2019s individual insurance requirement a tax. \n    \n\n            After that vote, Roberts faced right-wing wrath for joining the court\u2019s liberals to uphold the law. Last week several Republican members of Congress blasted him for blocking the Trump plan to phase out the DACA program shielding nearly 700,000 immigrants brought to the US as children. \n    \n\n            On Monday, the White House swiftly entered the fray, declaring that \u201cunelected Justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of State governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate abortion safety regulations.\u201d \n    \n\n            Roberts\u2019 decision, however, offered the Trump administration and anti-abortion forces some consolation as he advanced a legal standard that would weaken the rationale of the 2016 precedent and enhance the ability of states to defend regulations in the future. \n    \n\n    Previously tried to avoid the spotlight\n\n\n            When Roberts presided over the Trump impeachment trial in the Senate earlier this year, he rebuffed Democratic efforts to allow witnesses and other evidence for a more substantive hearing. He tried to avoid the limelight of that trial and national controversy. \n    \n\n            Now overseeing the final weeks of the high court\u2019s annual session, Roberts\u2019 pattern demonstrates that the strategic jurist has seriously recalibrated in the era of Trump, a president who gave the court two new justices and appeared to cement a 5-4 conservative-liberal lock for years to come. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Jr is seen during a group portrait session for the new full court at the Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., November 30, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Young\n\nJim Young/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nSamuel Alito dissents. A frustrating few months for the conservative justice\n\n\n\n\n            Roberts\u2019 recent moves on issues of great cultural relevance are distinct and of varying legal significance. In the LGBTQ case, for example, Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch cast the decisive fifth vote in the dispute over interpretation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The immigration decision was similarly grounded in a statutory, not constitutional, reasoning and can be reversed or altered in time by the Trump administration \u2013 or a Joe Biden administration. \n    \n\n            Yet, taken as a whole, the new moves reveal a chief justice trying to steady the bench and willing to seize national leadership as America struggles with imperatives related to coronavirus crisis and racial inequalities. \n    \n\n            In the past, Roberts has offered broad statements about the judiciary\u2019s place in America and his perch in the judicial hierarchy. \u201cYou wonder if you\u2019re going to be John Marshall or you\u2019re going to be Roger Taney,\u201d he once said, referring, respectively, to the great chief justice known as the forefather of judicial review and to the chief who wrote the Dred Scott decision that said slaves were not citizens. \u201cThe answer is, of course, you are certainly not going to be John Marshall. But you want to avoid the danger of being Roger Taney.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nToobin: Here's why Roberts sided with liberal justices\n\n\n                            02:10\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n    Rulings are often on procedure and precedent\n\n\n            Roberts\u2019 opinions joining with the court\u2019s liberals over the past two weeks lacked such lofty language as his comments on Marshall and Taney. (He did not even write a separate opinion in the LGBTQ case.) \n    \n\n            Still, in Monday\u2019s abortion case, the man who is known for holding his cards close to the vest put his current priority on the table. \n    \n\n            Past rulings matter, even if he was not part of those rulings. Adherence to precedence is important for stability in the law, perhaps, he might have been thinking, especially at such unstable times. \n    \n\n            Roberts emphasized that the Louisiana law, requiring doctors who perform abortions to have \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d at a nearby hospital, was identical to a credentialing requirement in a Texas statute invalidated by the court\u2019s 2016 ruling in the case of Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. \n\n\n            \u201cI joined the dissent in Whole Woman\u2019s Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided,\u201d he wrote Monday. \u201cThe question today however is not whether Whole Woman\u2019s Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case.\u201d  \n    \n\n            That echoed Roberts\u2019 sentiment in the dispute over young undocumented immigrants.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies. The wisdom of those decisions is none of our concern. We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action.\u201d He found that administration had not. \n    \n\n            After that ruling, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas declared, \u201cJohn Roberts again postures as a Solomon who will save our institutions from political controversy and accountability.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the Chief Justice believes his political judgment is so exquisite, I invite him to resign, travel to Iowa, and get elected. I suspect voters will find his strange views no more compelling than do the principled justices on the Court.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDACA recipients and their supporters rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court on June 18, 2020 in Washington, DC. \n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nFact check: Breaking down Trump's false claims about DACA and the Supreme Court's ruling\n\n\n\n\n            Yet Roberts, has not undergone a liberal transformation. On Monday, as he voted against the Louisiana abortion restriction, he also took the lead, over liberal justices\u2019 dissents, to curtail the independence of a watchdog agency set up to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive practices. The country is likely to see other 5-4 splits, with Roberts and conservatives prevailing, before the annual session ends in upcoming days. \n    \n\n            Early in his career as a government lawyer, Roberts had argued in favor of abortion regulations and cast doubt on the validity of abortion-rights landmarks.\n    \n\n            But Monday was not about Roberts\u2019 past, but, as he touted precedent,  the Supreme Court\u2019s past.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
