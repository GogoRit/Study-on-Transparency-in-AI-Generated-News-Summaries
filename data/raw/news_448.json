But better health care can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByJosh Moon\n\n\nPublished on October 27, 2020 at 7:51 am CDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(STOCK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith polls last week showing the race between incumbent Sen. Doug Jones and Republican challenger Tommy Tuberville tightening a bit, and with continued long lines outside voting precincts in heavily Democratic areas, the Alabama GOP, and its paid mouthpieces, have turned to their favorite talking point: abortion.\u00a0\nBy the end of last week, to hear them tell it, Jones would be sacrificing live babies on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s gold-plated kitchen table as Chuck Schumer looked on and AOC sharpened the knives.\u00a0\nIn ad after ad and planted story after planted story and social media post after social media post, they went on and on about \u201clive birth abortions\u201d \u2014 as if there is such a thing \u2014 and accusations that Jones supports abortion \u201cup to the point of birth.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s so silly and childish that it\u2019s hard to envision such gibberish actually affecting the way any sane adult would vote, but then, that\u2019s the beauty of the abortion issue \u2014 sanity, reason and facts took a hike a long, long time ago, and we\u2019re now left with only raw emotion.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter\nThe Day's Scoop: Your daily email briefing on all things Alabama politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to our privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact is the Alabama GOP \u2014 and the national Republican Party \u2014 has been responsible for millions more abortions and baby deaths than any Democrat or any Democratic policy.\u00a0\nJones, and his policies, would prevent hundreds of thousands of abortions in this state going forward.\u00a0\nNo, that\u2019s not an opinion. That\u2019s a fact that I can support with actual data.\u00a0\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\nAs Republicans scream about abortions, the thing they always fail to mention is that an abortion ban in America will not reduce the number of abortions performed. This has been proven over and over again in country after country, where full bans have been implemented.\u00a0\nInstead, when bans are implemented, desperate women turn to unsafe, back-alley abortions that often lead to the deaths of both mother and fetus. Findings from a 30-year Guttmacher Institute, released in July, show that abortion rates remain steady in countries where the procedures are legal and in the countries where they are banned or partially banned.\u00a0\nIn fact, the rates were often higher in countries with a ban in place.\nBut you know where the rates aren\u2019t steady?\u00a0America.\u00a0\nYou know why?\u00a0Obamacare.\u00a0\nOver the last 10 years, abortion rates have dipped to historic lows. That decline can be traced directly to Obamacare, which allows women to receive covered contraceptive care, which prevent pregnancies in the first place.\n\nA study from the University of Michigan in 2017 found that abortion rates dropped more than 10 percent among college-aged women following the passage of Obamacare, which, in addition to the contraceptive coverage, also allowed young people to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance longer.\u00a0\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\nOverall, across the county, abortions decreased by more than 200,000 between 2010 and 2017. The abortion rate plummeted to its lowest level since the procedure was legalized in 1973.\u00a0\nActually, that\u2019s not entirely true. They decreased across the country except for four states \u2014 North Carolina, Mississippi, Wyoming and Georgia. Care to guess what happened in those states?\u00a0They each implemented some level of an abortion ban during that time period.\u00a0\nBut Obamacare isn\u2019t the only Democratic policy that has reduced abortions.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Colorado, where state officials began a push to market free contraceptive care and also allowed pharmacists in the state to write prescriptions for birth control, abortion rate declines have exceeded the national average.\u00a0\nTeen birth rates in Colorado are down a whopping 59 percent over the last 10 years. And teen abortion rates are down more than 60 percent in that span.\u00a0\nKnow where else they\u2019re not down? Alabama.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re top five in teen pregnancy and teen birth rates in the country.\u00a0We\u2019re also top five for births by unwed mothers, low birth weights, pre-term births and infant mortality.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\nYet, these same Republicans who line up to talk about the sanctity of life have resisted both Obamacare implementation \u2014 refusing to participate in the marketplace and make care more affordable for citizens \u2014 and Medicaid expansion, which would provide coverage for about 200,000 poor, working Alabamians.\u00a0\nThey have resisted better sex education programs in schools \u2014 we still require abstinence-only programs \u2014 and refused to fund programs that would make contraceptives free and widely available.\u00a0\nThese programs and policies have proven to reduce abortions and save lives. They\u2019ve proven to provide women with decent care and support, instead of shame and ridicule.\u00a0\nThese are the policies that Jones and Alabama Democrats support. They\u2019re the policies that the GOP have tried repeatedly to kill or block.\u00a0Which means, if it\u2019s the reduction of abortions and saving human lives that you care about, there\u2019s one obvious choice to make.\u00a0Vote for Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Moon is an investigative reporter and featured columnist at the Alabama Political Reporter with years of political reporting experience in Alabama.
