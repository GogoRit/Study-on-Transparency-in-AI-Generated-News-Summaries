Credit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.org\n\n\n\n\nThe first March for Life in Connecticut drew an estimated 2,000 abortion opponents to the state Capitol on Wednesday, giving an anti-abortion movement with few political successes in the state a moment of celebration.\n\u201cToday marks a new beginning for the pro life movement in the state of Connecticut,\u201d said Peter Wolfgang, the president of the Family Institute of Connecticut.\n\nConnecticut is one of the most Catholic states in the U.S., yet one of the friendliest to the cause of reproductive rights with a dominant Democratic Party and a 32-year-old state law codifying the tenets of Roe v. Wade.\nBut a rally and a march organized by a national anti-abortion group, March for Life, comes as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs the potential reversal of Roe, which struck down state bans on abortion 49 years ago.\nConnecticut\u2019s not going to go backwards. We\u2019re not going to cower in fear of people who want to yell and scream. We\u2019re going to protect a woman\u2019s rights to choose, which is what the vast majority of Connecticut residents want.House Speaker Matt Ritter\nArchbishop Leonard Blair of the Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford gives a speech outside the state capitol.

Mancini, the president of March for Life Education and Defense Fund. \u201cWe\u2019re mothers, we\u2019re fathers, we\u2019re daughters, we\u2019re sons. We are Democrats, we\u2019re Republicans and we\u2019re independents.\u201d\nSubsequent speakers set a more aggressive and overtly political tone, asserting their time is near, and the opposing camp is scared.\n\u201cThey\u2019re scared because life is winning in America and life can win in Connecticut, too,\u201d Wolfgang said. \u201cFor years, we were told that abortion was not an issue in Connecticut, that there was no pro-life movement in Connecticut or no prior pro-life movement of any serious consequence. Well, look at all of you. Today, we prove them wrong.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMore STORIES in Politics\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSecretary of the State files Bridgeport election complaint with SEEC \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCT bill seeks transparency on \u2018junk fees\u2019 added to tickets, hotels \n\n\n\n\n\nCapitol police and an organizer each estimated the crowd at 2,000, many holding green and white \u201cLove Life, Choose Life\u201d signs provided by the Knights of Columbus. They filled the plaza and lawn on the north side of the Capitol for an hour of speeches, then marched down the hill around Bushnell Park and back.\nOpposition to abortion has been unusual among statewide office holders of both parties in Connecticut. Republican John G. Rowland, an opponent of abortion as a state lawmaker and congressman, famously dropped his stance before running for governor in 1990\nBut Leora Levy, a member of the Republican National Committee and a candidate for U.S. Senate,\u00a0campaigned in the throng, trailed by volunteers who gathered contact information from potential supporters.\n\n\u201cI am a pro-life Republican,\u201d Levy said. \u201cI\u2019m a very principled Republican.\u201d\u00a0\nHer appearance foreshadows abortion becoming a wedge issue in a Republican primary. Her main rival, former state House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, is a supporter of abortion rights with a voting record endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Connecticut.\nLen Suzio, a former Republican state senator working for Levy, said, \u201cThis is going to become a big issue.\u201d\n\nCredit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.orgCredit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.orgCredit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.orgCredit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.orgCredit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.orgCredit: Yehyun Kim / ctmirror.org\nRobert Hyde, another Republican running for U.S. Senate, had an information table at the rally.\nNo candidate was allowed to address the crowd. Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, the mother of two adopted children, was the only lawmaker given a speaking slot.\n \nA scathing report released this week found \u201can alarming lack of oversight\u201d of CT\u2019s ___.\nDo you know the answer? Play this week's news quiz to find out.\n\n\nThe legislature\u2019s Government Administration and Elections Committee is holding a hearing Friday on a resolution calling for a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights in Connecticut, but the amendment is not a priority of reproductive rights groups.\n\nInstead, the focus is on two bills addressing more immediate concerns: Would states where abortion remains legal have the capacity to serve women from states where it is banned? And could restrictions from banned states reach into Connecticut?\nA bill before the Public Health Committee would allow advanced-practice clinicians to perform abortions by suction, also known as vacuum aspiration. It is the most common method of in-clinic abortions and can be performed by clinicians other than doctors in more than a dozen other states.\nAnother measure before the Judiciary Committee essentially would bar Connecticut officials from assisting other states in enforcing bans on their residents from getting an abortion in a state where it is legal.\n\nChristina Bennett, one of the speakers, said\u00a0the latter bill \u201cwould allow abortion doctors who have broken laws in their states to come hide in Connecticut, making Connecticut a sanctuary state for abortion doctors.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he favors passage this session of the bill in Judiciary for both practical and symbolic reasons\n\u201cWe can act before the court rules,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cAnd as these other states roll things back, I think it sends a very strong message: Connecticut\u2019s not going to go backwards. We\u2019re not going to retreat. We\u2019re not going to cower in fear of people who want to yell and scream. We\u2019re going to protect a woman\u2019s rights to choose, which is what the vast majority of Connecticut residents want.\u201d\n\nCorrection\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Republican state Rep. Lezlye Zupkus represents Wolcott.
