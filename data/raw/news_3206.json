Gallagher is retiring at the end of January.\nA Long Island native, Kathleen Gallagher graduated from the New York Institute of Technology and joined the New York State Catholic Conference in 1984 after a brief stint working in the New York Legislature. (Photo: courtesy of NYSCC)\n\u201cNo one in New York State, or across the country, has done more to advocate on behalf of all human life from conception until natural death than Kathy Gallagher,\u201d Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York and president of the NYSCC, said in a statement. \nHe thanked Gallagher for her service in the organization that represents the state\u2019s bishops in areas of government and public policy and called her a \u201cgiant of the pro-life movement\u201d who fought for the \u201cmost vulnerable.\u201d\n\u201cIn that time, she has not only represented the New York State bishops, but has been a national leader in the pro-life movement, advocating against abortion, capital punishment, and euthanasia, and in favor of supports for pregnant women in need and people near the end of life,\u201d Cardinal Dolan added.\nEven in Gallagher\u2019s retirement, Cardinal Dolan said she will still serve as a consultant to the NYSCC: \u201cGod knows we need her voice.\u201d\nA Long Island native, Gallagher graduated from the New York Institute of Technology and joined the NYSCC in 1984 after a brief stint working in the New York Legislature. At that time, she served as the organization\u2019s pro-life lobbyist and spokesperson. Her initiatives helped spearhead pro-life advocacy groups including New Yorkers for Life and the New York Alliance Against Assisted Suicide.\u00a0\nShe has received the Diocesan Pro-Vita Award from the dioceses of Brooklyn, Rockville Centre, and Buffalo, and the Bishop Broderick Award from the Diocese of Albany.\n\u201cI am grateful to Cardinal Dolan and the bishops for allowing me to represent them for so long,\u201d Gallagher said, \u201cand blessed beyond measure to have received a salary to advocate for moral principles in which I deeply believe.\u201d\nIn addition to being an outspoken advocate for pro-life policies regarding abortion, the death penalty, and assisted suicide, Gallagher\u2019s efforts have resulted in several state-approved programs including the Prenatal Care Assistance Program that serves low-income mothers and their children; the continuation of the state-funded abortion alternatives; and the Health Care Proxy Law that allowed competent adults to appoint agents who can help decide health care options in the event they become unable to decide for themselves.\n\u201cPro-life work is not an easy vocation, but Kathy never lost faith,\u201d said NYSCC Executive Director Dennis Poust. \u201cShe has continued to put all of her passion into her work to implement policies that protect human life in the law and to convert hearts toward a culture of Life.\u201d\n\n\nTags: Kathleen Gallagher, New York State Catholic Conference, pro-life, Pro-life groups, pro-life lawmakers Login here to comment\nShare this article with a friend.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername or Email\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nRemember Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue with GoogleContinue with Facebook\n\n \n\n\nPrevious National News Story Next National News Story\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tablet Headlines Delivered Daily\n\n\n\nCatholic Headlines Widget Signup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\r\n        *\n\n\n\n\nYour email will be used to send you The Tablet newsletter.
