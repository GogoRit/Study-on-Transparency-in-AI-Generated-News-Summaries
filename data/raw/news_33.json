Instead they should fight the coronavirus pandemic while supporting Polish workers, and especially women, who are bearing the brunt of the crisis.\nS&D leader Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez said:\n\u201cThe Polish government is cynically taking advantage of the current situation of lockdown to get this bill through, as the restrictions in place won\u2019t allow people to take to the streets in the same way as the previous mass protests against these measures.\n\u201cPolish women live in fear for their health and lives and their loved ones, and they are scared of losing their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of helping them, the government aims to restrict their fundamental rights by tightening what is already one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the EU, and to deprive young people of comprehensive sexual education.\n\u201cThese measures will inevitably\u00a0lead to an increase\u00a0in\u00a0life-threatening\u00a0underground\u00a0abortions.\u00a0It is about time for\u00a0PiS\u00a0to\u00a0understand that sexual and reproductive rights are human rights and women must be free to decide about their own bodies regardless of the EU country they live in.\u00a0\u00a0The Socialists and Democrats\u2019 message to Polish women is clear: we stand by your side in solidarity, and we promise to continue our fight for your fundamental rights.\u201d\nRobert Biedro\u0144, vice chair of the women\u2019s committee\u00a0and the head of Wiosna delegation in the EP, added:\n\u201cLiving in a country with one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the EU, Polish women have already been through hell. The proposed measures are barbaric, as they would mean\u00a0almost a complete ban on abortion. As progressives, we won\u2019t rest until\u00a0women in Poland enjoy\u00a0the same rights as\u00a0other European women.\n\u201cThe second bill to be discussed in Sejm this week is equally\u00a0socially regressive. It seeks to criminalise the provision of comprehensive sexuality education to minors, and to impose the backwards views on reproductive health, under the false guise of preventing paedophilia. If adopted, it would go against the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and international standards, as well as\u00a0a 2013 EU Directive that calls on member states to take steps to reduce the risk of children becoming victims of sexual abuse or exploitation.\u00a0The European Parliament already condemned this bill in a 2019 resolution. The\u00a0Commission must act now. There is also the need to include what\u00a0is going on\u00a0with women's rights and LGBTI+ rights in the Article 7 procedure.\nNote to the editor:\u00a0 \nToday, women in Poland are only legally allowed to obtain abortions in three circumstances: if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, if the mother\u2019s life is at risk, or if there is a foetal abnormality. The new anti-abortion law would ban any abortion in the third case, resulting in practice to an almost complete ban on abortion.\nThe legislation to criminalise the provision of comprehensive sexuality education to minors would affect teachers, healthcare providers, journalists and even parents, threatening them with a prison sentence for providing sexual education, including information on contraception or the risks of sexual exploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEPs involved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGARC\u00cdA P\u00c9REZ Iratxe\n\n\n\nPresident\n\n\n\n\n\nBureau responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n                                                S&D Group Bureau, president\n                                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIEDRO\u0143 Robert \n\n\n\n\n                                                                            Head of delegation\n                                                                    \n\n\nMember\n\n\nPoland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS&D press contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCZERNY-GRIMM Inga \n\n\n\n\n\n              \n  Press Officer\n\n            \n\n\n\n              \n  Poland\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\nFind out more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n08/03/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  What's Left E07: Fighting for gender equality and women's rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n\n\n\n07/03/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  S&Ds push for the EU Charter of Women\u2019s Rights to standardise and protect women across Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n\n\n\n06/02/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Deal on the EU directive to fight violence against women: just a first step for the S&Ds!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n05/02/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Only Yes Means Yes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n15/12/2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Take a Left: Towards a consent-based definition of rape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n13/12/2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Review of the Spanish Presidency of the Council: opening statements by Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n29/11/2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  S&D event:  What were you wearing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n29/11/2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  S&D Group event: Gender-based violence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress & newsletters\nSubscribe to our mailing lists\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\nGet in touch\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo\nS&D Group's logo\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho we are\n\n\nOur president & bureau\n\n\nOur members\n\n\nOur team\n\n\nOur partners\n\n\nOur political family\n\n\nOur national delegations\n\n\n\n\nWhat we stand for\n\n\nOur priorities\n\n\nOur achievements\n\n\nWhy voting matters\n\n\nOur history\n\n\n\n\nWorking for you\n\n\nOur campaigns\n\n\nOur committee work\n\n\nOur global action\n\n\n\n\nNewsroom\n\n\nOur press releases\n\n\nOur events\n\n\nOur videos\n\n\nOur publications\n\n\nOur plenary work\n\n\nOur position papers\n\n\nOur opinions\n\n\nOur statements\n\n\n\n\nWorking with us\n\n\nJob opportunities\n\n\nSpontaneous application\n\n\nTraineeships\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a92024 Socialists & Democrats\n                \n                All rights reserved | Legal notice | Processing of personal data | Cookie policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
