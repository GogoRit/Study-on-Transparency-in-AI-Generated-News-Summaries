Oct 2020, 07:03\n\nLast week, Poland's Constitutional Tribunal imposed a virtual ban on Polish women's access to abortion care.\nThis massive blow to the rule of law and to citizens' rights was carried out by what Donald Tusk has rightly labelled a pseudo-tribunal, the legitimacy of which is disputed by Poland's own people and by Europe.\n\n\nRead and decide\nJoin EUobserver today\nGet the EU news that really matters\nInstant access to all articles \u2014 and 20 years of archives.\n       14-day free trial.\n\nChoose your plan\n\n\nMonthly\n\n\u20ac19\nShort-term commitment\n\n\n\nYearly\n\n\u20ac150\nBest value, save 34%\n\n\n\nReduced yearly\n\n\u20ac90\nStudent or retired?

We cannot help but see the similarities with demonstrations in Belarus.\nLast week's decision to attack women's reproductive safety was requested by a ruling party lacking the parliamentary support to pass an abortion ban, and fearful of re-igniting large-scale public demonstrations like the 2016 'Black Protest' against a total abortion ban and the criminalisation of women.\nBehind PiS's assault on women's health and dignity is the party's need to appease its ultra-conservative supporters.\nThis assault on women's rights is just the beginning.\nThe court is being weaponised against the citizens it is sworn in to protect; its behaviour is that of an arm of the ruling party.\nCivil society is hugely concerned that after the abortion ban, this pseudo-tribunal will be used to withdraw the few remaining protections that remain for survivors of domestic violence, and that it may then turn its attention to LGBTI people.\nAnother example of how Poland is drifting away from the European project is the recent signing of the so-called Geneva Consensus Declaration.\n\nSign up for EUobserver\u2019s daily newsletter\nAll the stories we publish, sent at 7.30 AM.\n\n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nSpearheaded by the US, this is an anti-abortion declaration that carries no legitimacy within the UN system.\nThis document breaks with broad consensus in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights and attempts to dismantle the international human rights framework.\nHorrible track-record\nThe farcical declaration has been signed by mostly authoritarian governments, with a horrible track-record on women's rights, plus Poland and Hungary.\nThis is a wake-up call for Europe.\nThe European Commission has already expressed serious concerns regarding breaches of the rule of law in Poland and has proposed to make EU funding to member states conditional on respect for this EU value.\nThe European Parliament supports this regulation, but it has been blocked by governments in the Council. It is time to ask how much abuse other member states will tolerate from autocratic governments. Where is the line that cannot be crossed?\nEU leaders should be emboldened by recent evidence of clear public support for a robust rule-of-law conditionality approach and increased trust in the EU among Poles. If we are to continue to trust the European project, this is the minimum we must demand of EU governments.\nAs EU democratic governments have showed financial solidarity during the pandemic, now it is time to show political solidarity with the citizens of authoritarian countries and stand against the erosion of democracy.\nLast week's verdict will be agonising for Polish women and their families, forcing some to continue through pregnancies against their will, and needlessly increasing their suffering. Coordinated attacks on the safety of Polish citizens, not only women, will continue.\nAs activists continue to protest in the streets and to shout their frustrations, we ask: will these be heard and acted upon by the EU and member states?\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor bio\n\nIrene Donadio is head of strategy and partnership at the International Planned Parenthood Federation European Network.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's, not those of EUobserver.\n\n\n\n, your membership gives you access to all of our stories.
