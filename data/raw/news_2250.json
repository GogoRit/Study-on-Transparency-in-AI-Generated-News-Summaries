But there\u2019s almost no evidence of pro-choice violence.Spencer AckermanContributing EditorEmily ShugermanSenior ReporterUpdated\u00a0Feb. 11, 2020\u00a05:20PM EST\u00a0/\u00a0Published\u00a0Feb. 10, 2020\u00a08:55PM EST\u00a0The FBI is expanding its focus on domestic terrorism, and that includes pro-choice violence\u2014even though such violence is so vanishingly rare, it\u2019s all but nonexistent.\u00a0In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray disclosed that the bureau has recently \u201cchanged our terminology as part of a broader reorganization of the way in which we categorize our domestic terrorism efforts.\u201d It\u2019s part of a much-heralded reinvigoration of the bureau\u2019s domestic terrorism focus after a rising tide of mostly white-supremacist terrorism.Among four broad categories of domestic terrorism that the FBI confronts, Wray said, is \u201cabortion violent extremism.\u201d\u00a0But Wray wasn\u2019t only talking about the pro-life extremism that murders abortion providers in their churches, he hastened to add, but \u201cpeople on either side of that issue who commit violence on behalf of different views on that topic.\u201d  His questioner, Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), was puzzled at Wray\u2019s seeming equivalence: \u201cPeople on either side of that issue don't commit violence.\u201d In fact, the FBI pointed The Daily Beast to just one episode of pro-choice-inspired terrorism\u2014one that did not involve an actual act of violence, but rather a threat in an online comments section. \u201cThe FBI pointed The Daily Beast to just one episode of pro-choice-inspired terrorism \u2013 one that did not involve an actual act of violence, but rather a threat in an online comments section.\u201d But Wray persisted: \u201cWell, we've actually had a variety of kinds of violence under that, believe it or not. But at the end of the day.\u201d Bass asked, \u201cReally, that blow up buildings and threaten doctors?\u201d Rather than responding, Wray moved on to detailing the FBI\u2019s next domestic-terrorism category, one about \u201canimal rights and environmental extremism.\u201dWray\u2019s comments weren\u2019t the first instance of the bureau promoting the idea of pro-choice violence as a real threat.\u00a0In 2017, the FBI distributed a brief \u201cAbortion Extremism Reference Guide\u201d at a counterterrorism training for local law enforcement, listing \u201cpro-choice extremists\u201d as a group of domestic terrorists. The document, first reported by Jezebel, claimed that these extremists \u201cbelieve it is their moral duty to protect those who provide or receive abortion services\u201d\u2014though even this document noted that only one \u201cpro-choice extremist\u201d had ever been prosecuted. Additionally, an earlier FBI training document obtained by the ACLU in 2012 referenced pro-choice violence but did not \u201cprovide a single example of violence against abortion opponents,\u201d the ACLU wrote.\u00a0\u201cAbortion violent extremism\u201d of any sort accounts for a only small percentage of FBI domestic terrorism cases. Wray on Wednesday that the \u201ctop threat\u201d of domestic terrorism comes from what he called \u201cracially/ethnically motivated violent extremists.\u201d Out of approximately 850 current cases that a senior FBI official cited in congressional testimony last May, about half concern anti-government extremism and another 40 percent concern racist terrorism. That leaves around 85 cases of violence motivated by animal rights, ecological degradation, abortion and miscellaneous cases. An FBI spokesperson confirmed the total caseload and the breakdown are still current.But abortion extremism doesn\u2019t have an \u201ceither side.\u201d The primary case of pro-choice violent extremism that the FBI pointed The Daily Beast toward\u2014the same one cited in the 2017 FBI document\u2014is the 2012 conviction of Theodore Schulman, who had a long history of threatening anti-abortion activists.\u00a0Schulman\u2019s ultimate downfall was the result of posting a threat in the comments section of religious conservative outlet First Things: \u201cif Roeder is acquitted, someone will respond by killing\u201d Princeton\u2019s Robert George and Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life, he wrote. That itself spoke to the discrepancy in violence between the two sides. \u201cRoeder\u201d was a reference to Scott Roeder, who murdered abortion provider George Tiller in the foyer of a Wichita church in 2009.\u00a0Other instances of anti-abortion violence include a trio of bombings at Florida abortion clinics in 1985, a string of arson attacks on a Washington clinic in 1983, and a 2015 shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood that killed three. Between 1993 and today, anti-abortion activists murdered 11 people and attempted to kill another 26, according to the National Abortion Federation.\u201cAnti-choice violence as we know it is constant, pervasive, and escalating dramatically, and it threatens the civil liberties as well as the lives of our patents, our members, our society,\u201d NAF President Katherine Ragsdale told The Daily Beast.\u00a0Wray\u2019s comments, she added, are a \u201cdanger to public perception.\u201d\u201cIt tars everyone with the same brush when in fact pro-choice folks simply are not doing this,\u201d she said.The Daily Beast has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI to document the extent of its focus on alleged pro-choice violent extremism. \u201cThe bureau seems to be grasping a tiny number of unrelated incidents that are not part of any organized effort to falsely imply that such a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 movement exists.\u201d\u2014 former FBI special agent Mike German Mila Johns, a domestic terrorism researcher affiliated with the University of Maryland\u2019s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), said violence was \u201cvery much lopsided in the other direction,\u201d the anti-abortion side, and called Wray\u2019s equivalence \u201ca very political statement.\u201d\u00a0START maintains the Global Terrorism Database, which tracks terrorist attacks across the world since 1970. The database records about 300 incidents related to anti-abortion violence and none for pro-choice violence. However, an Austin woman in 2016 was charged with throwing a crude Molotov cocktail at anti-abortion protesters. And last year, an 85-year old anti-abortion protester in San Francisco was knocked to the ground after he attempted jamming the bicycle spokes of a man who appears to have stolen a pro-life group\u2019s banner.\u00a0Troy Newman, the president of Operation Rescue\u2014a radical anti-abortion group that moved its headquarters to Wichita, Kansas, specifically to target Dr. Tiller\u2014said his movement has been on the receiving end of threats. He estimated he had made between 20 and 50 complaints to federal law enforcement over the last two decades, for everything from anthrax scares to online intimidation. Wichita resident Christopher Thompson, he noted, was sentenced to 12 months in jail last year for making menacing calls to Operation Rescue\u2019s office and employees.But when asked about specific instances of pro-choice violence, Newman cited only the murder of James Pouillon, an Operation Save America activist who was shot while protesting abortion outside a high school in 2009. (The judge in that case said the killer\u2019s motivations were not tied to abortion.) Newman declined to give examples of abortion-rights violence of the scale and magnitude of that enacted by the anti-abortion movement. \u201cYou got your scorecard and I got mine,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of them are terrible.\u201dThe FBI\u2019s position is that pro-choice activists and groups not concerned with violence don\u2019t need to worry about the new domestic terrorism categorization. \u201cWe don't investigate ideology or rhetoric or anything of that sort,\u201d Wray testified.\u00a0An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, but pointed to comments from the bureau\u2019s former assistant director for counterterrorism, Mike McGarrity, from last June. \u201cIt is important to remember that in line with our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States, no FBI investigation can be opened solely on the basis of First Amendment-protected activity,\u201d McGarrity testified to a House panel in June. \u201cRather, domestic terrorism investigations on individuals are opened on the basis of information concerning the occurrence or threat of violent criminal actions by the individual in furtherance of an ideology.\u201dHowever, prior episodes during the 18-year-old war on terror show the FBI does not always hold a rigid distinction between ideology that isn\u2019t to be investigated and violence that is. In 2011, its counterterrorism training at Quantico included instructional material that held Islam was an ideology, rather than a religion, with violence baked into its doctrines. The point of the training was to portray Islam itself as a threat to national security\u2014which, for an investigative entity with broad domestic powers, was ominous enough for the Obama administration to order the training materials removed.\u00a0Michael German, a former FBI special agent who investigated domestic terrorism, said the FBI was not only engaging in a false equivalence but \u201cthe manufacturing of an imaginary violent movement,\u201d reminiscent of its now-discarded \u201cblack identity extremism\u201d category.\u00a0\u00a0  The bureau \u201cseems to be grasping a tiny number of unrelated incidents that are not part of any organized effort to falsely imply that such a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 movement exists,\u201d said German, now with the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThis is a misleading analysis of dubious purpose, apparently to satisfy some political constituency, which is not what an objective law enforcement agency should be doing.\u201d\u00a0But for some in the reproductive rights space, the threat posed by anti-abortion violence is enough that they are willing to accept dubious FBI categorization to ensure it gets investigated.\u201cThose of us in this movement have lost friends and family,\u201d Ragsdale said. \u201cBy all means, investigate the escalating violence.\u201d\u201cAnd if politics requires you to have a category that says pro-choice violence, go right ahead,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019d be interested to see if anything ever pops up.\"  Spencer AckermanContributing Editor@attackermanEmily ShugermanSenior Reporter@eshugermanEmily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.comGot a tip?
