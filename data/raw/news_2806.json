SFL requested $2,346 in funding to bring King to campus.\nAccording to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian law firm representing SFL, the Student Government Association questioned SFL's leadership about the content and viewpoints that King would present at the event. ADF says the student government voiced concerns about King's views on abortion and gay marriage, and concern that King's viewpoints might offend some students.\nAccording to ADF, the student government denied SFL's funding request, stating in part that because King has been involved in religious ministries, her life was \"inherently religious.\"\nADF sued the university in April 2020 on behalf of Students for Life. On Sept. 2, the university's board of regents agreed to settle the case.\nAs part of the settlement, the school revised its policies to state that student activity funding would be viewpoint neutral. Georgia Tech also agreed to pay $50,000, as well as attorney's fees.\n\"Thankfully, Georgia Tech has shown its renewed commitment to [First Amendment] principles by taking quick corrective action to revise their policies so that all student organizations are treated fairly, regardless of political or religious views,\" said ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We hope that other universities around the country will ensure their policies meet constitutional muster without the need for a lawsuit.\"\n\n\nTags:\nStudents for Life\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\nOur mission is the truth.
