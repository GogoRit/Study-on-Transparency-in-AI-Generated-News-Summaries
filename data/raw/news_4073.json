The mayor\u2019s office denied the claim, saying that only one facility was repurposed for Covid-19 patients at the height of the outbreak. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more about:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tWomen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,  \n\tHealth\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,  \n\tCoronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 we have a small favor to ask.\nAs you may have heard, The Moscow Times, an independent news source for over 30 years, has been unjustly branded as a \"foreign agent\" by the Russian government.
