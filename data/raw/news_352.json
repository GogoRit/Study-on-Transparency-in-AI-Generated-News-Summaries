However, 100 years later, the world has seen a noticeable regression on the issue. Not only in modern Russia, but also in countries such as Poland and the United States, conservative forces are actively seeking to ban abortion. According to legal scholar Ekaterina Mishina, these efforts will have devastating consequences.\n\u00a0\n\nIn late October 2020, Poland saw massive protests against the ruling of the Constitutional Court that had effectively banned abortion.\u00a0A poster in Sanok, Poland, reads: \u201cwomen's strike.\u201d \u00a0Photo: Silar\u00a0/ Wikimedia Commons.\n\u00a0\nUnexpected pioneers\nNovember 18, 2020, marks the hundredth anniversary of the adoption of the resolution \u201cOn the protection of women\u2019s health\u201d by the People\u2019s Commissariat for Health and Justice. Soviet Russia thus became the first country in the world to legalize abortion. Sadly, we approach the anniversary with nothing that even resembles progress. Not only in Russia, but elsewhere too, there is a clear tendency towards severe restrictions, including an abortion ban.\u00a0\n\u201cWomen\u2019s health\u201d was a key phrase in the Bolshevik act on legalizing abortion, which repeatedly called the act evil. It also clearly stated that other countries \u201cfight this evil by punishing both the woman who decided to miscarry, and the doctor who carried it out. Without leading to positive results, this countermeasure drove the procedure underground and made the woman a victim of selfish and often ignorant abortionists, who created a trade for themselves from secret operations.\u201d Noting that \u201cthe moral relics of the past and the difficult economic conditions of the present still force some women to decide on this operation,\u201d the People\u2019s Commissars allowed free abortions only by doctors and only in hospitals in order to \u201cprotect the health of women ... and [the Commissars] consider the method of repression in this area as falling far short of the goal.\u201d If such an operation were performed by a non-doctor, or by a doctor but in a private practice, they would be brought before a people\u2019s court.\nThe 1922 Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic specified this type of criminal liability and established, in Article 146, that artificial termination of pregnancy with the consent of the mother, committed by a person without medical education or by a physician, but in improper conditions, was punishable by imprisonment or forced labor for up to one year. Abortion \u201cin the form of a trade,\u201d without the mother\u2019s consent or if it resulted in her death, was punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.\nThis sensible and progressive regulation of abortion was largely due to Alexandra Kollontai, a famous Russian revolutionary, feminist, and the first woman in world history to hold a ministerial position (Kollontai was the People\u2019s Commissar of State Charity in the first Bolshevik government in 1917-18).\nRussian society\u2019s attitude to Kollontai is highly ambiguous, and her name is primarily associated with her essay \u201cMake way for winged Eros!\u201d\u2014a hymn to \u201csexual communism.\u201d But Kollontai paved the way not only for \u201cwinged Eros,\u201d but also for progressive legal regulation. Through her efforts, the early Bolshevik legislation saw norms that improved the legal status of women, equalized illegitimate children in rights with children born in marriage, simplified the procedure for marriage and divorce, provided for the establishment of paternity in court, and legalized abortion. Unfortunately, most of these innovations were subsequently abolished. In 1936, abortion in the USSR was banned by a joint resolution of the USSR\u2019s Central Executive Committee. The History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): Short Course, a Soviet textbook, noted with satisfaction that \u201cin 1936, in connection with the growing prosperity of the masses, the government issued a law banning abortion.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNew reaction\nAt the dawn of the new Roaring Twenties of the 21st century, the problem of abortion is suddenly causing waves on both sides of the Atlantic. In Russia, last year, Patriarch Kirill called abortion a sinful practice in cases where abnormalities of fetus development are detected. Then the Patriarch\u2019s stance softened somewhat, and he suggested that if there are medical reasons to terminate pregnancy, a woman is freed from sin, especially if she has other children. But by that time, Russian legislators had picked up the tune.\nIn February 2020, State Duma deputy Vitaly Milonov, known for his active support of the abortion ban in Russia and the idea to establish an Anti-Abortion Day, suggested including the abortion ban in the Preamble to the Russian Constitution. In early May 2020, the Patriarchal Commission on Family, Motherhood and Childhood Protection proposed to introduce a moratorium on abortions in Russia during the coronavirus pandemic. At the end of May, Children\u2019s Rights Ombudsman Anna Kuznetsova came up with the idea to restrict the sale of abortion drugs in pharmacies.\nIn Poland, the situation has recently become even more dire. On October 22, the Polish Constitutional Court ruledunconstitutional the 1993 Abortion Law, which allowed abortion in cases of serious and irreversible defects or diseases of the fetus. The court ruling states that termination of pregnancy due to an incurable fetal disease is a eugenics practice and discriminates against the unborn child. Now abortion in Poland is permitted only in cases of rape, incest, or threats to the health and life of the mother, and these constitute only about 2 percent of legal pregnancy terminations in recent years, while 98 percent of legal abortions were carried out precisely because of fetal disease. Immediately after this ruling that effectively prohibited abortion, massive protests erupted across the country. On October 31, about 100 thousand people took to the streets of Warsaw\u2014Poland had not seen such massive protests and power since 1989. As a result, the government decided to postpone the ban\u2019s entry into force.\n\u00a0In the United States, tensions between pro-choice and pro-life abortionists have grown steadily over the past few years. The recent death of the great Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg catalyzed emotions: in the comments to articles dedicated to the memory of this legendary defender of women\u2019s rights, one could see not only words of gratitude, but also streams of hatred. The tone of the discussion was suspiciously familiar. I had a strange feeling that, among the American prairies or cornfields, the brothers-in-arms of Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s \u201ctroll factory\u201d had ripened. However, instead of the \u201ccrucified boys\u201d familiar to viewers of Russian national TV, poor unborn children were used as a bugbear. And they had no say in the matter, because, according to opponents of abortion, they were killed through the fault of Judge Ginzburg.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg was indeed a consistent advocate of women\u2019s rights, including abortion, throughout her career. Since 1993, she had done this as a judge of the highest court in the United States. At a Senate hearing on her candidacy for the post of Supreme Court judge, Ginsburg said: \u201cThe decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman\u2019s life, to her well-being and dignity. \u2026 When government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.\u201d Equally well-known is her dissenting opinion in the 2007 Gonzalez v. Carhart case\u2014a landmark decision of the Supreme Court, in which the 2003 Act prohibiting the so-called \u201cpartial birth\u201d procedure was found to be constitutional: \u201c[L]egal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman\u2019s autonomy to determine her life\u2019s course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.\u201d\u00a0\nUnfortunately, Judge Amy Barrett, who took the Ginsburg seat on the Supreme Court, is known for her conservative views and negative attitudes towards abortion, so she is unlikely to actively advocate for women\u2019s rights. Thus, fears of a revision of such precedent decisions as Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, which established that the right of women to abortion belongs to the category of constitutional rights and is protected by the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, are not groundless.\n\u00a0\nRisks of banning abortion\nThe abortion issue is that rare case when I completely agree with the Bolsheviks: the method of repression in this area absolutely falls far short of its goal. The abortion ban is an incomparably greater evil than the legalization of abortion. The prohibition and criminalization of any in-demand service (or product, as showcased by the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution and the Prohibition era) does not eliminate the demand for it\u2014on the contrary, it stimulates it. But in case of abortion, services rendered illegally will entail significantly higher risks for all participants.\nThe consequences of such bans, as a rule, go beyond the most pessimistic forecasts. As a result of 13 years of Prohibition in the United States, which ended only in 1933 following the adoption of the 21st Amendment to the US Constitution, organized crime flourished, primarily related to the illegal production and sale of alcohol, the volume of smuggling increased, the entertainment industry suffered greatly, and restaurants were ruined as a result of lost revenue due to the prohibition of legal alcohol sales. Breweries, wineries, and bars were forced to close, leading to the loss of thousands of jobs. One of the most destructive consequences of the Prohibition era was the sharp decline in tax collections. At the federal level, Prohibition cost the state billions in lost taxes.\nThe consequences of an abortion ban are always devastating, long-lasting, and completely different from what the proponents of the ban expect. First of all, it always leads to a spike in abortion numbers, as happened in the Soviet Union after the 1936 abortion ban: by 1939, their number had grown by more than 150 thousand compared to 1937. As a result of illegal abortions, which are often performed in unsanitary conditions, a huge number of women die or can\u2019t have children anymore. And let us not forget about the psychological hardships of women forced to abandon an unwanted child, and of children born not from love, but from despair.\nIn today\u2019s discourse on abortions, the expression \u201cDon\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater\u201d could be rephrased. The baby, however, has been moved to the foreground, while the woman is being thrown out. The issue of women\u2019s health and well-being has almost disappeared from the public agenda, and this is not just wrong, but tragic. After 33 years in the legal profession, I still cannot understand people who argue that the rights of the embryo are more important than the rights of the woman in whose body it appeared against her wishes or under difficult circumstances. And when a woman makes the heart-wrenching decision to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, she does so because she cannot do otherwise. But it is the woman who must decide for herself. This is her right and her choice.\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\tPrint \tEmail \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Institute of Modern Russia, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscriber\n\nOur newsletter delivers a digest of analytical articles and op-eds published on our website, along with the latest updates on the IMR activities on a monthly basis.\n\n\n     \n\nSubscribe \n\n\n\nTrending\n\nNews\n\n\nWAR IN UKRAINE: the world is at the critical junction, urgent action is needed now\nIMR's president Pavel Khodorkovskiy calls for immediate action to shelter Ukraine's sky and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\n\n\nIMR\u2019s statement on the situation in Ukraine\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCEPA\u2013IMR joint event: COVID-19 and information warfare\nOn December 15, the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), in collaboration with the Institute of Modern Russia (IMR), hosted a panel discussion on the findings and lessons learned from the recently released reports \u201cJabbed in the Back\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Sputnik V.\u201d Dalia Bankauskait\u0117, Ben Dubow, Olga Khvostunova, and Vera Michlin-Shapir shared their views on how Russia and China engaged in information warfare during the COVID-19 pandemic.
