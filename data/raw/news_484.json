Children born with disabilities, they argue, are able to lead meaningful lives with help from a myriad of federal, state and local programs that provide everything from therapy to job placement services.\nWhat fetal disabilities are covered by the proposed ban?\nScoliosis, dwarfism, Down syndrome, albinism, amelia, physical disfigurement and physical and mental disabilities are all conditions the legislation declares can't be used as reasons for terminating a pregnancy.\nWhat do Democrats say?\nMembers of the House's minority party argue that abortions in cases of fetal disabilities are an especially personal matter for a woman and her family to grapple with and that government should play no role in dictating whether she can seek to terminate her pregnancy.\nHow did Democrats attempt to derail the legislation?\nThey filed four amendments aimed at weakening the bill's provisions, including one that would have required Florida's Agency for Persons with Disabilities to eliminate a persistent patient wait list before the disability abortion ban could take effect. All four amendments failed.\nWhy hasn't the Senate acted?\nWhile also controlled by Republicans, the upper chamber is relatively more moderate in its handling of sensitive social issues, including abortion. Having prevailed in a number of swing district races in 2020, Senate leaders are cognizant that a vote on the disability abortion ban could be used in Democratic campaigns against swing district incumbents in 2022 and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            CERTIFICATIONS\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n            Spectrum News App\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
