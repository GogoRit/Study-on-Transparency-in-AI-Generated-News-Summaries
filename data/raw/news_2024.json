Wade, May 7, 2022. (Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo anti-abortion activists have submitted the first slate of abortion-ban initiatives to the Colorado Title Board since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that once guaranteed constitutional protection for abortions.\nThe four initiative filings, all titled \u201cProtections for a Living Child,\u201d would ban abortion in Colorado statute and would define a fertilized egg as an \u201calive\u201d human being. The four filings differ slightly, but all contain an eight-point declaration that defines a human, says it is unethical to kill humans and asserts that \u201cno human being is property of another human to dispose of at-will.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nTwo versions of the initiative directly cite Colorado\u2019s homicide statute and put abortion in that category. Two versions would permanently close facilities that provide abortions and would give local governments the authority to deny permits to facilities that could potentially provide abortions. Another version would give district attorneys and local law enforcement the power to enforce the abortion ban.\nThe women behind the initiative filings, Angela Eicher and Faye Barnhart, hope the Title Board will give a title to all four filings.\n\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll talk through and pray about which one to put forward on the state ballot that would be most consistent with the value of life and protecting these children,\u201d Barnhart said.\nBarnhart leads an anti-abortion center in northeast Colorado and is part of the Colorado Life Initiative group.\nThe initiatives have an initial Title Board hearing on Oct. 4. If they are granted a ballot title, initiative supporters can format a petition and then begin collecting signatures to get it placed on the 2024 ballot. A petition must receive 5% of the total votes cast for all candidates for secretary of state at the previous general election, which currently comes out to be 124,238 signatures.\nEicher and Barnhart withdrew a similar initiative in August and submitted the four new filings this month.\nEicher was involved with a similar initiative effort last year, but it did not get a title.\n\u201cWhat makes this one different is that it would be the first life initiative on the Colorado ballot since the overturn of Roe. We\u2019re in a different political climate than we were in the past,\u201d Barnhart said.\nThe Supreme Courts overturned Roe in June last year. Since then more than a dozen states have enacted extreme abortion restrictions.\nColorado has some of the strongest abortion protections in place. It is legal at all stages of pregnancy. The Legislature enshrined into law the right to abortion in 2022 in anticipation of Roe being overturned, and it passed laws this year to further protect out-of-state abortion patients and their providers from prosecution.\nIn 2020, Colorado voters rejected a 22-week abortion ban. Voters have also rejected three separate attempts to define \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d in the Colorado criminal code as \u201cunborn human being.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAnti-abortion group tries again to get ban on Colorado ballot\nby Sara Wilson, Colorado Newsline September 21, 2023\nAnti-abortion group tries again to get ban on Colorado ballot\nby Sara Wilson, Colorado Newsline September 21, 2023\n Two anti-abortion activists have submitted the first slate of abortion-ban initiatives to the Colorado Title Board since the overturning of Roe v.
