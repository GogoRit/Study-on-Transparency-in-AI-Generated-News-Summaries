A federal judge has blocked the enforcement of a legal opinion claiming Idaho\u2019s abortion ban makes it a crime for health care providers to refer patients seeking the procedure out of state. U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled on Monday, July 31, 2023, that health care providers have suffered from a genuine threat of prosecution that casted a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on their speech. (Sarah A.

It also makes it unlawful for health care professionals to assist in the provision or attempted provision of one, with the penalty being the suspension or loss of their medical license.Republican Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador wrote a letter to a conservative lawmaker in March in which he opined that referring a patient to legal abortion services in other states would constitute assisting in an abortion or attempted abortion \u2014 and thus would require the suspension of the health professional\u2019s license.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and several medical providers sued the next month, arguing such a restriction would violate their First Amendment right to free speech. Health care providers are not restricted from referring patients out of state for prenatal care or other treatment, they noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP Decision Notes: What to expect in Idaho\u2019s GOP caucuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho Republicans oust House majority leader amid dispute over budget process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical professionals \u201cwill be forced to choose between facing criminal penalties themselves and offering referrals and information about legal out-of-state medicinal services to their patients,\u201d U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill wrote in his order Monday. \u201cSimply put, their speech will be chilled.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case is one of two targeting Idaho\u2019s strict abortion laws. A separate lawsuit challenges a new Idaho measure making it illegal to help minors get an abortion without parental consent. Attorneys general from 20 states filed a brief Tuesday urging the court to block it.\u201cThe Constitution protects the individual right to travel between states, and Idaho\u2019s radical Legislature cannot abolish that right,\u201d Democratic Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement.\n\nEven before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision last year overturned the landmark abortion rights ruling in Roe v. Wade, some Idaho residents traveled to neighboring states for the procedure just because they had the closest clinic.But in the following year, with abortion criminalized in Idaho, its neighboring states saw a significant increase in abortions, including almost 1,500 in Washington, more than 1,300 in Oregon and nearly 2,600 in Nevada, according to data from the Society of Family Planning.\u201cProviders shouldn\u2019t face the threat of punishment for helping their patients obtain the abortion care they need in states where abortion is legal,\u201d said Meagan Burrows, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project.Winmill\u2019s order blocked the Office of Attorney General from enforcing Idaho\u2019s criminal abortion law as Labrador interpreted it. For technical and procedural reasons, he did not block the state boards of medicine and nursing from suspending the licenses of providers who refer patients for abortions out of state or who prescribe abortion drugs for patients to pick up in another state.\n\nHowever, Colleen Smith, a participating attorney with ACLU of Idaho, said the plaintiffs were confident that the same rationale the judge applied to the attorney general\u2019s office should also apply to the boards.The boards have not indicated they intend to start suspending the licenses of providers in such cases. Bob McLaughlin, a public information officer with the Idaho Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses, said the Idaho Board of Medicine does not comment on pending litigation.\u201cWe think that they\u2019ve probably gotten the message, based on what the court decided, that that\u2019s not an appropriate interpretation,\u201d Smith said.Stanton Healthcare, an anti-abortion pregnancy center in Boise, said in a statement it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by Winmill\u2019s order and that it would \u201conly serve to promote \u2018abortion trafficking.\u2019\u201d\u201cThis decision flies in the face of the Idaho legislature which built a wall of protection around women and their preborn children through life-affirming legislation which promotes well-being and hope,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLabrador\u2019s office argued it does not have the authority to criminally prosecute providers who refer patients out of state. Further, the state\u2019s attorneys noted, Labrador formally withdrew the letter after the lawsuit was filed, saying its analysis was \u201cvoid.\u201dBeth Cahill, communications director for the attorney general\u2019s office, suggested Winmill, who Democratic President Bill Clinton appointed in 1995, was biased. \u201cIn his 28-year career you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a time when Judge Winmill has ruled against Planned Parenthood, so his decision is not surprising,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cJudge Winmill wants to restrain a power we don\u2019t possess. We strongly disagree with his order.\u201d\n\nWinmill noted in his order that while Labrador had issued a subsequent letter withdrawing his legal opinion, the attorney general has not actually disavowed its reasoning \u2014 which could carry heavy weight among the state\u2019s county prosecutors.\u201cThe Attorney General has strained at every juncture possible to distance himself from his previous statement without committing to a new interpretation or providing any assurances to this Court or the Medical Providers,\u201d Winmill wrote. \u201cAttorney General Labrador\u2019s targeted silence is deafening.\u201d__Johnson reported from Seattle.
