Photo by Jane Norman, States Newsroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy June 24, David Burkons had spent as much time as a doctor could in the post-Roe world. The Cleveland native graduated the University of Michigan Medical School in 1973, the same year the landmark decision ensuring the right to an abortion was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0\nEverything changed for the obstetrician \u2014 and for thousands of Ohio women and girls \u2014 on June 24. That\u2019s when the current Supreme Court handed down Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health. It threw out Roe and gave states the power to ban abortion altogether.\nThe consequence, Burkons said, has been chaos \u2014 and worse health care for his patients.\nAttorneys general in some states with severe abortion restrictions on the books gave notice that they would begin enforcement of those laws in a few weeks or a month. But in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost raced to the courthouse the day Dobbs was announced and a restrictive state law that was passed in 2019 was in force by that evening.\nUnder the law, abortions were suddenly illegal after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 four months earlier than they had been and at a point which about a third of women and girls don\u2019t yet know they\u2019re pregnant. The law, Senate Bill 23, allows limited exceptions to protect mothers\u2019 lives and health, but it makes no exceptions for victims of rape and incest.\nIn sworn affidavits, doctors and other workers at Ohio abortion clinics described the scene as women and girls suddenly learned they couldn\u2019t get the abortions they were planning on.\u00a0\nMany cried inconsolably. Several threatened suicide. One woman said she\u2019d drink bleach. A high school student who couldn\u2019t stop vomiting was hospitalized and placed on suicide watch. One woman said she\u2019d try to end her pregnancy by hurling herself down some stairs, according to affidavits filed by Burkons and others.\n  WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 JUNE 24: Abortion-rights activist Jamie McIntyre reacts to the 6-3 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization which overturns the landmark abortion Roe v. Wade case in front of the Supreme Court on June 24, 2022 in Washington, DC. The court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion after almost 50 years. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\nNew arena\nIn an interview last week, Burkons, 75, said his and his colleagues\u2019 lives were also upended, suddenly and radically.\nIn 2014, he founded the Northeast Ohio Women\u2019s Center, which has clinics in Cuyahoga Falls, Shaker Heights and Toledo.\u00a0\nSB 23 says that doctors who violate the law can lose their medical licenses and be charged with felonies. So one of the first steps he took in response to it was to arrange a meeting with a criminal lawyer.\n\u201cWhen we were leaving, the attorney said \u2018Doctor, I hate to tell you this, but you\u2019ve entered my world,'\u201d Burkons said. \u201c\u2018You have to assume that every patient you have, every person you\u2019re dealing with, is wearing a wire. And you don\u2019t know who in the hospital is going to say \u2014 maybe because they honestly believe that you\u2019re doing (illegal) abortions or they don\u2019t like you, or whatever \u2014 they\u2019re going to turn you in.'\u201d\nBurkons added, \u201cPhysicians are very, very worried about that.\u201d\u00a0\nThe ramifications for maternal health \u2014 especially in emergency situations \u2014 were almost immediate, he said.\u00a0\nExperts say that\u2019s true nationally.\n\u201c\u2019Emergency\u2019 exists on a continuum, and prevention of anticipated critical events is not explicitly addressed\u201d in restrictive abortion laws such as the one passed in Texas, doctors Andrea MacDonald, Hayley B. Gershengorn and Deepshikha Charan Ashana wrote last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cIt is no longer clear whether physicians can intervene to prevent progression to critical scenarios, as is the standard in critical care medicine, or instead, if a physician must withhold evidence-based care until a patient develops an unambiguous emergency with significantly increased morbidity and mortality, such as septic shock and multisystem organ failure.\u201d\nBurkons said he\u2019s witnessed the problem in Ohio \u2014 in multiple ways.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had several people who have been very, very poorly treated for inevitable miscarriages,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come in. They\u2019re bleeding, they\u2019re cramping, but because they still show (fetal cardiac activity) the facility is afraid to do anything about it and you have to wait until they really start bleeding heavily. It\u2019s caused people to have to have transfusions where they could have had a five-minute procedure and the whole thing would be done.\u201d\nBurkons said he knew one Ohio woman who had to sit for two days in her bed and wait for her miscarriage to complete itself.\n\u201cAnd this is just because somebody is afraid that people are going to report them to the state board, or the prosecutor or who knows where,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this has impacted a woman\u2019s ability to get good medical care.\u201d\u00a0\nOther emergencies\n  The emergency room sign at O\u2019Bleness hospital in Athens, Ohio. Photo by David DeWitt, OCJ.\nThen there are \u201cectopic\u201d pregnancies in which a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside the uterus, typically the fallopian tubes. Such a pregnancy can\u2019t succeed and if not treated, it can cause the mother to bleed to death.\nWhen Burkons\u2019 clinics detect such a pregnancy, they send the mother to the emergency room.\n\u201cThe problem is they get to the emergency room and (doctors) can\u2019t see anything in the uterus, and physicians are very, very concerned,\u201d Burkons said. \u201cThe medicine you use to treat the ectopic pregnancy also is a drug that can cause an abortion of an intrauterine pregnancy. So they\u2019re very afraid until they can prove there\u2019s an ectopic pregnancy by seeing something in the tube on the ultrasound and then it becomes the case that you have to do surgery before it actually ruptures and becomes a crisis.\u201d\nIn his affidavit, Burkons reported two such pregnancies at his clinics during the 11 weeks SB 23 was in force.\u00a0\n\u201cIn one case, the fallopian tube ruptured, and surgery (was required) rather than medical management which would have been possible if they had acted sooner,\u201d he wrote.\nThe issue boils down to what doctors see as the vagueness in the exceptions Ohio\u2019s and other state laws make to protect mothers\u2019 lives and health. For example, one of those exceptions in Ohio requires a \u201cmedically diagnosed condition that so complicates the pregnancy of the woman as to directly or indirectly cause the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\nWhat, exactly, does that mean? And if you were a doctor, would you bet your medical license and possibly your freedom on your assessment of it?\n\u201cI had a busy obstetrics practice for many, many years and there are women who come to you early in pregnancy and you know it\u2019s going to turn out to be very, very difficult,\u201d Burkons said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got diabetes, they\u2019ve got heart disease. They\u2019ve already had a horrible pregnancy and you know this is going to be very, very bad. But can you say, \u2018OK, they\u2019re going to die?\u2019 No. Can you say they\u2019re going to be very sick? Yes. How sick? Who knows?\u201d\nHe said that based on his understanding of SB 23, \u201cOnce they get further along in pregnancy you\u2019re going to have to wait until they get really, really sick before you can say let\u2019s terminate this pregnancy \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be a very fraught procedure at that time.\u201d\nThe authors of the JAMA article put numbers to one way in which that can be very fraught \u2014 and become more so as time passes.\n\u201cBetween 2% and 14% of critically ill patients (all patients, including men and women) die in the hospital, and each hour of delayed care increases a patient\u2019s likelihood of dying by approximately 4%,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTherefore, the longer emergency abortions are delayed, the greater the risk that lifesaving interventions might not be effective and pregnant individuals could experience morbidity and mortality.\u201d\nHarsh realities\n  Doctor preparing an ultrasound. Getty Images.\nJust a week after the Dobbs decision was handed down came news that a 10-year-old rape victim from Columbus was forced to go to Indiana for an abortion because she couldn\u2019t get one in Ohio.\nYost was incredulous, going on Fox News to doubt the girl\u2019s existence only to see an arrest made in the case a few days later.\nBut through nearly a half-century of practice, Burkons has learned that while such realities might be shocking, they\u2019re hardly surprising.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just rare because physiologically, the large majority of 10-year-olds are not able to have a baby.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe youngest I\u2019ve ever done was 11. I\u2019ve certainly done numerous 12 and 13-year-olds. (Pregnancies among 10-year-olds are) not a common phenomenon. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s because there\u2019s not a lot of child molestation that takes place, but because I would say the majority of 10-year-olds are not endocrinologically\u00a0 capable of having a child. They may be raped, but they haven\u2019t developed to the point where they can have a child.\u201d\nYost, and seemingly DeWine, have claimed that the exceptions built into the Ohio law would allow 10-year-old rape victims to get abortions. But several Ohio obstetricians have told the Capital Journal that being very young is just one of an array of conditions that heighten the risk of pregnancy in ways that aren\u2019t covered by SB 23\u2019s exceptions.\nBurkons agreed with his colleagues.\n\u201cFor somebody to say this 10-year-old girl, her life was physically threatened by carrying the pregnancy, that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it would have done to her social and psychological development, that\u2019s a whole other issue. But she would have had a very, very hard time finding a physician in Ohio who would be willing to touch this with a 10-foot pole.\u201d\nAnother harsh \u2014 and even more widespread \u2014 reality might be the reason why so many women and girls want abortions. Some are victims of sexual violence, but many more might just generally be desperate.\nBlacks make up about 13% of Ohio\u2019s population, and they\u2019re nearly three times as likely than Whites to live in poverty.\u00a0\nThose two facts appeared to play a role in last year\u2019s abortion numbers. Despite making up such a small portion of the population, Black women and girls got 9,446 \u2014 or nearly half \u2014 of the 20,716\u00a0 abortions performed in the state in 2021, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health.\nOther statistics from the report also suggest that women choose abortions because they don\u2019t think they have the money and other support they need to care for a baby. Nearly twice as many, 13,319, women who got abortions already had children than those who didn\u2019t, 6,937.\nTo Burkons, there seem to be policy implications.\n\u201cIf there were a better social safety net, maybe some of these people would decide to have the baby,\u201d he said. \u201cThat may or may not be true, but I find it very interesting that in general, the people who are against abortion are also against increasing the social safety net.\u201d\u00a0\nHe added that assertions by some in the anti-abortion movement that the procedure is commonly seen simply as a convenient means of birth control is wrong.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a decision that some women make very easily, but most women really, really think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something people do out of convenience. It\u2019s something people do out of desperation more than anything else.\u201d\nMore health implications\n  Getty Images.\nIn addition to being much more likely to be poor and to get abortions, Black women have another tragic distinction: They\u2019re also three times more likely to die during childbirth\u00a0 and its immediate aftermath.\nIn a second JAMA article last week, doctors Linda Brubaker and Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo said restrictive laws such as Ohio\u2019s will only make things worse.\n\u201cLegal interference with evidence-based abortion counseling and care will disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic individuals as well as all persons for whom low income, lack of health insurance, or other life circumstances (eg, related to employment, transportation, or family care responsibilities) pose a barrier for access to legal abortion services,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCurrent estimates are that two-thirds of maternal deaths are preventable; the proportion of preventable maternal deaths will increase following the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\u201d\nA Cincinnati judge has paused enforcement of SB 23. But with DeWine\u2019s blessing, Yost has challenged the stay, and depending on who wins election to the Ohio Supreme Court, the law could well be back in force early next year.\nIn addition, Ohio is poised to consider even harsher abortion restrictions in the lame-duck session later this year. But DeWine and Yost so far have refused to publicly discuss controversial provisions of SB 23, much less whether they support legislation that goes even further.\nBurkons said the officials do the public a disservice with their silence.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the people who actually make the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re told that in the lame-duck session there\u2019s going to be a law passed that outlaws abortion. And the governor has been asked what his feelings are, but he won\u2019t answer whether he would sign that bill. The attorney general hasn\u2019t said anything about whether he would enforce it or not. I think that\u2019s something that people on either side have a right to know.\u201d\nFollow Marty Schladen on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWhile in effect, Ohio\u2019s abortion ban led to chaos, suffering, and worse health care, doctor says\nby Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal November 4, 2022\nWhile in effect, Ohio\u2019s abortion ban led to chaos, suffering, and worse health care, doctor says\nby Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal November 4, 2022\n By June 24, David Burkons had spent as much time as a doctor could in the post-Roe world.

Despite making up such a small portion of the population, Black women and girls got 9,446 \u2014 or nearly half \u2014 of the 20,716\u00a0 abortions performed in the state in 2021, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health.\nOther statistics from the report also suggest that women choose abortions because they don\u2019t think they have the money and other support they need to care for a baby. Nearly twice as many, 13,319, women who got abortions already had children than those who didn\u2019t, 6,937.\nTo Burkons, there seem to be policy implications.\n\u201cIf there were a better social safety net, maybe some of these people would decide to have the baby,\u201d he said. \u201cThat may or may not be true, but I find it very interesting that in general, the people who are against abortion are also against increasing the social safety net.\u201d\u00a0\nHe added that assertions by some in the anti-abortion movement that the procedure is commonly seen simply as a convenient means of birth control is wrong.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a decision that some women make very easily, but most women really, really think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something people do out of convenience. It\u2019s something people do out of desperation more than anything else.\u201d\n    More health implications\n\n\t\n  Getty Images.\nIn addition to being much more likely to be poor and to get abortions, Black women have another tragic distinction: They\u2019re also three times more likely to die during childbirth\u00a0 and its immediate aftermath.\nIn a second JAMA article last week, doctors Linda Brubaker and Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo said restrictive laws such as Ohio\u2019s will only make things worse.\n\u201cLegal interference with evidence-based abortion counseling and care will disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic individuals as well as all persons for whom low income, lack of health insurance, or other life circumstances (eg, related to employment, transportation, or family care responsibilities) pose a barrier for access to legal abortion services,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCurrent estimates are that two-thirds of maternal deaths are preventable; the proportion of preventable maternal deaths will increase following the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\u201d\nA Cincinnati judge has paused enforcement of SB 23. But with DeWine\u2019s blessing, Yost has challenged the stay, and depending on who wins election to the Ohio Supreme Court, the law could well be back in force early next year.\nIn addition, Ohio is poised to consider even harsher abortion restrictions in the lame-duck session later this year. But DeWine and Yost so far have refused to publicly discuss controversial provisions of SB 23, much less whether they support legislation that goes even further.\nBurkons said the officials do the public a disservice with their silence.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the people who actually make the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re told that in the lame-duck session there\u2019s going to be a law passed that outlaws abortion. And the governor has been asked what his feelings are, but he won\u2019t answer whether he would sign that bill. The attorney general hasn\u2019t said anything about whether he would enforce it or not. I think that\u2019s something that people on either side have a right to know.\u201d\nFollow Marty Schladen on Twitter.\n    \n    \n        \n\t\t\t\n            GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n        \n        \n            SUBSCRIBE\n        \n    \n    \n\t\n    \n    \n        \n            SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n        \n        \n            DONATE\n        \n    \n    \n\t\n\n\n Ohio Capital Journal is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
