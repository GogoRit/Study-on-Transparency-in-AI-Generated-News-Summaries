If Roe is overturned, states will determine the future of abortion access.  Rebecca Blackwell/The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more Stateline coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions.\nIf the federal right to abortion is erased by the U.S. Supreme Court in a few weeks as expected, the legal spotlight will shift immediately to state courts, where experts say judges in some conservative states could surprise everyone and uphold the right to abortion. \n\u201cHundreds of attorneys for abortion advocates across the country are no doubt poised to go into state courts to block enforcement of multiple state abortion laws the minute the decision comes down,\u201d said Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel at Americans United for Life, which opposes abortion. \u201cThere will be attempts in all but a few states to create the equivalent of Roe v. Wade.\u201d \nSuch challenges can\u2019t happen in Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Virginia, where lawmakers opposed to abortion rights already have amended the state constitution to clearly say that it does not protect the right to abortion. Kansas will have a similar measure on the ballot in August, and Kentucky in November. A similar proposal is pending in Missouri.\nBut in all other states, there will be little reason for abortion rights advocates not to file lawsuits in state courts. And in some unlikely places, including Florida, legal experts say previous court decisions indicate some chance of success. \nIn recent years, the makeup of the Florida Supreme Court has skewed conservative, with three of the seven justices appointed by the state\u2019s current Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. But in 1989, Florida\u2019s high court struck down a law requiring pregnant girls to get the consent of a parent before getting an abortion, citing the state constitution\u2019s privacy clause.\n\u201cMost people have not been thinking about state litigation, but it will become very prominent,\u201d said David Cohen, professor of law at Drexel University. \u201cI think that we\u2019re going to see a lot of lawsuits with outcomes that will surprise everyone.\u201d\nAlready, courts in two anti-abortion states have ruled in favor of temporarily blocking existing abortion bans. \nLast week, the Idaho Supreme Court denied a request from the state\u2019s Republican attorney general to lift a court injunction against a ban on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy that the legislature passed earlier this year.\nAnd in Michigan, a lower state court granted a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the state\u2019s dormant 1931 law making it a felony to provide an abortion. \nA central underpinning of the leaked court decision overturning Roe is that there\u2019s no explicit right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution. \nState constitutions in Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina\u00a0and Washington do have explicit privacy provisions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, legal experts cautioned that there is no guarantee that these state courts would extend that right to cover abortions.\nDifferent Constitutions\nLike the U.S. Constitution, no state constitution specifically confers abortion rights, although Vermont voters will decide in November whether to include such an amendment. \nBut the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has been active in state and federal abortion litigation for the past three decades, lists Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Montana as states with implied constitutional abortion rights, based on prior court decisions that found support for abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. \nCohen and other legal scholars would include even more states in that list: North Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma, for example.\nEven Mississippi\u2014the state with the 15-week abortion ban currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014has a 1998 state Supreme Court ruling that could be interpreted to indicate state constitutional support for abortion rights, according to Forsythe and other legal experts who represent abortion opponents.\nPaul Linton, an Illinois attorney who has represented anti-abortion clients in state courts and the U.S. Supreme Court for more than 30 years, said he\u2019s skeptical about abortion rights advocates\u2019 chances of succeeding in most state cases. \nEven if they win a case against a state abortion law, he said, they could lose with lawmakers. \u201cIf they challenge abortion laws in a conservative state and win the case, they\u2019ve just provided ammunition for the state legislature to amend the constitution to neutralize any implied abortion rights,\u201d he said. \nTennessee in 2014 and West Virginia in 2018 amended their constitutions to remove any implied abortion rights. The Tennessee Constitution, for example, says: \u201cNothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nAs of now, existing abortion bans in 26 states are expected to take effect within days of a Supreme Court ruling against Roe v. Wade, if state courts don\u2019t block or overturn them.\nAlabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wisconsin have dormant pre-Roe laws that would ban most abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Michigan also has a pre-Roe ban that was temporarily blocked from taking effect last week,\u00a0and Texas has a ban that has been permanently blocked. \nTwelve states\u2014Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming\u2014have more recent abortion bans designed to immediately take effect if Roe is overturned. \nOn the other side of the issue, 16 states and the District of Columbia have statutes guaranteeing the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. \nPast is Prologue\nIn the nearly 50 years since the U.S. Supreme Court established the right to abortion, conservative state lawmakers have been passing restrictions, and advocates have been suing them in federal courts. \nCourts have allowed many restrictions, including required waiting periods, parental consent and notification, and costly abortion clinic specifications\u2014such as the width of hallways, complex HVAC systems and down-to-the-inch operating room dimensions\u2014to take effect. \nBut federal courts routinely have struck down outright bans on the procedure prior to viability, when a fetus is considered able to live outside of the womb.\nDozens of abortion rights battles also were fought in state courts over the decades, but those cases garnered little public attention, said Robert Williams, professor of law emeritus and director of the Center for State Constitutional Studies at Rutgers University-Camden. \nThat\u2019s about to change. \nIn a post-Roe world, many people might think it would be pointless to file a lawsuit in say, Oklahoma, to block its strictest-in-the-nation abortion ban, Williams said. \u201cBut they would be wrong.\u201d \nThere\u2019s nothing to stop an abortion rights attorney from asking an Oklahoma Supreme Court judge to establish a right to abortion similar to Roe v. Wade based on the Oklahoma Constitution, he explained.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all learned that what the Supreme Court says, goes. But that\u2019s only half right,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen the Supreme Court rules against federal constitutional rights, the states have the sovereign authority to ensure those same rights and more, despite the gravitational pull of the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d \nOver time, courts in some states may decide to disagree with the Supreme Court and set a higher standard of protection for reproductive autonomy, he said. \nStates have a long history of providing greater protections than the federal government, including many examples in free speech, marriage rights, education equality and criminal justice, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think that abortion rights will be any different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXState Courts Could Overturn Abortion Bans in Red States\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline May 27, 2022\nState Courts Could Overturn Abortion Bans in Red States\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline May 27, 2022\n Read more Stateline coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions.\nIf the federal right to abortion is erased by the U.S. Supreme Court in a few weeks as expected, the legal spotlight will shift immediately to state courts, where experts say judges in some conservative states could surprise everyone and uphold the right to abortion. \n\u201cHundreds of attorneys for abortion advocates across the country are no doubt poised to go into state courts to block enforcement of multiple state abortion laws the minute the decision comes down,\u201d said Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel at Americans United for Life, which opposes abortion. \u201cThere will be attempts in all but a few states to create the equivalent of Roe v.
