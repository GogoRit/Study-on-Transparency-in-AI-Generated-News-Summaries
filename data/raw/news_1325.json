Wade.\nAbortion rights protesters  protest against the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe vs. Wade in Los ... [+] Angeles, California, on June 24.Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nIndiana: The state\u2019s near-total abortion ban will be blocked until at least January, when a hearing is scheduled in the case, after a lower court judge blocked the law on September 22\u2014a week after it went into effect\u2014and the Indiana Supreme Court ruled Wednesday to keep the law on hold while it hears the appeal.\n\n\n\nArizona: A state appeals court temporarily blocked Arizona\u2019s 1864 abortion ban on Friday after a lower court judge previously let the decades-old law go back into effect, which means abortion will once again be legal in the state until at least November 17, the deadline the court has set for briefs to be submitted in the case.\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota: A state judge issued an injunction that blocked the state\u2019s abortion ban from taking effect on August 25, after previously issuing a temporary restraining order in July that delayed the law\u2019s enforcement\u2014but that ruling could change, as the North Dakota Supreme Court ordered the lower court on Wednesday to reconsider its ruling while the challenge against the abortion law moves forward.\n\n\n\nOhio: The state\u2019s six-week abortion ban has now been blocked indefinitely while a lawsuit against it proceeds, extending a previous temporary pause on the law, after a federal court initially let the six-week ban take effect hours after Roe v. Wade was overturned and the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a previous request to block it.\n\n\nWest Virginia: A state judge blocked the state\u2019s pre-Roe abortion ban on July 18 as the litigation against it moves forward, as the judge sided with abortion providers who argued the 19th century law conflicted with the state\u2019s more recent abortion measures\u2014but abortion is now banned again in the state after lawmakers passed a new near-total abortion ban and Gov. Jim Justice (R) signed it into law on September 16.\n\n\nSouth Carolina: The state Supreme Court temporarily blocked its six-week abortion ban on August 17, siding with abortion providers who argued the law violated the state\u2019s Constitution, though lawmakers are now trying to pass new legislation that would still likely ban abortion only after six weeks, but tighten restrictions.\n\n\nGeorgia: A state Superior Court judge declined to block the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban on August 15 while the litigation against it proceeds, rejecting a request from abortion providers and advocates who sued to overturn the law after a federal judge allowed it to take effect in July.\n\n\nIdaho: The Idaho Supreme Court ruled August 13 that the state\u2019s trigger law outlawing nearly all abortions could take effect August 25 as abortion providers\u2019 litigation against it moves forward\u2014though a federal judge then separately limited the trigger law to allow abortions in the case of all medical emergencies\u2014and also allowed a six-week ban to take effect that allows for lawsuits against anyone who aids and abets an abortion.\n\n\nWyoming: A state judge issued a preliminary injunction on August 10 blocking the state\u2019s trigger law, which banned all abortions in the state with exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies, after previously pausing the law for just two weeks, siding with abortion providers who argued the law was overly vague and ruling it \u201clacks any guidance\u201d for providers who are unsure if a patient they have can legally get an abortion.\n\n\nKentucky: A state judge issued a restraining order on June 30 that blocked both the state\u2019s total ban on abortion and a separate ban on the procedure after approximately six weeks, but while a court first extended the block on July 22, an appeals court then ruled on August 1 that the ban can take effect again as the challenge moves forward.\n\n\nLouisiana: The state was the first to have its abortion trigger law blocked in court on June 27 and the law has gone in and out of effect since; it briefly went back into effect on July 8 before being blocked again, and an appeals court has now reinstated the law.\n\n\nUtah: The state\u2019s trigger law was blocked on June 27 after taking effect hours after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, as abortion providers argued the law violated the state Constitution, and a judge ruled on July 11 that it should remain blocked as the case moves forward.\n\n\nMississippi:  State Judge Debbra K. Halford denied a request on July 5 to block both the state\u2019s trigger law banning all abortions and a six-week abortion ban, ruling she didn\u2019t believe the abortion providers\u2019 lawsuit would ultimately succeed and they hadn\u2019t sufficiently shown the bans cause them \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d and the abortion clinic that brought the lawsuit dropped their challenge because the clinic has closed.\n\n\nTexas: A state judge issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the state\u2019s pre-Roe abortion ban from staying in effect on June 28\u2014allowing abortions to at least temporarily resume until Texas\u2019 trigger ban took effect later in July\u2014but the Texas Supreme Court then overruled that order on July 1, once again banning abortion in the state.\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Watch For\nMore state court rulings and lawsuits. Abortion providers and Democratic politicians have also filed lawsuits against abortion bans in Wisconsin and Oklahoma that have taken effect or are scheduled to take effect in the absence of Roe, and those challenges remain pending. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) has also asked a state court to put a six-week ban back in effect, teeing up a legal battle over that law.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cEvery additional day, every additional hour that we can block a ban is making a huge difference for the patients in the waiting room,\u201d Nancy Northup, CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, told reporters on July 1, saying providers\u2019 immediate priority is to preserve abortion access in states \u201cfor as long as we can.\u201d\n\nContra\nWhile state courts are increasingly blocking abortion bans, federal courts are allowing other states\u2019 bans to take effect. In addition to Ohio, Georgia and South Carolina, judges in Tennessee, Indiana, North Carolina and Alabama have so far allowed state-level bans and restrictions on the procedure to be reinstated, after previously blocking them when Roe was still the law of the land and abortion was legal on the federal level. The federal judge in Idaho\u2019s ruling did partially block that state\u2019s trigger law in response to a lawsuit from the Biden Administration, which argued it conflicted with federal law, but only as the law pertains to abortions during medical emergencies.\nTangent\nA state judge in Florida briefly blocked the state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, which was enacted and challenged in court prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The law took effect on July 1 until Leon County Judge John Cooper\u2019s written order was issued on July 5, even though Cooper had said during a hearing June 30 he intended to block the law. Cooper\u2019s order was only in effect for a few minutes, however, as the Florida government immediately appealed the decision, which automatically freezed Cooper\u2019s order until another decision can be issued on whether or not it should be put back in effect. That means the 15-week ban is still in effect for now. Florida Republicans passed the law despite the fact the Florida Supreme Court has upheld abortion rights in the state constitution, and abortion rights advocates fear the state court will overturn that precedent and give the state license to ban abortion.\nChief Critic\nState officials whose laws are being challenged have stood by their abortion bans. \u201cWe are fully prepared to defend these laws in our state courts, just as we have in our federal courts,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said in a statement, accusing the abortion providers of using \u201cscare tactics,\u201d and Utah AG Sean Reyes told the Salt Lake Tribune before the state\u2019s abortion law was blocked that his office \u201cwill do its duty to defend the state law against any and all potential legal challenges.\u201d\n\nKey Background\nThe U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, giving states license to fully ban the procedure as justices declared the landmark 1973 decision \u201cegregiously wrong.\u201d The court\u2019s ruling triggered 13 states\u2019 abortion bans, and the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute projects 26 states will ultimately ban or severely restrict the procedure. While abortion is now able to be outlawed under federal law, abortion providers\u2019 focus is to now target the bans in state courts, arguing that even if the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t protect abortion rights, they are still protected under state Constitutions and thus can\u2019t be banned despite the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.\nSurprising Fact\nWhile most state lawsuits have argued the abortion trigger bans violate state constitutions and the civil rights they provide for, Louisiana abortion providers had to instead only argue the state\u2019s laws are unlawfully vague because they can\u2019t make other arguments under the state constitution. Louisiana voters approved a ballot measure in 2020 stating, \u201cNothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion\u201d\u2014one of four states whose constitutions explicitly do not protect abortion rights, along with Alabama, Tennessee and West Virginia.\n\nFurther Reading\n100 Days Since Roe V.
