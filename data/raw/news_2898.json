Muzyka shared the vision of SAFL and how they are training a new kind of sidewalk counselor.\nSAFL is focused on peaceful, prayerful, loving, and law-abiding outreach outside of abortion facilities to aid the women seeking services at abortion clinics with life-affirming resources and information in an effort to save their pre-born children and end abortion.\nSpecifically stated, their mission is, \"To train, equip, and support communities across the U.S. and the world in sidewalk advocacy: to be the hands and feet of Christ, offering loving, life-affirming alternatives to all present at abortion facilities, thereby eliminating demand and ending abortion.\"\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nCurrently SAFL covers 220 abortion facilities with ongoing sidewalk advocacy, which is about 20% of all abortion facilities. Their goal is to be present outside every abortion facility.\nTo date over 17,000 women have been served and their babies saved as a result of SAFL\u2019s efforts, according to Muzyka. Further, 83 and counting abortion workers have left the industry and 29 abortion facilities have closed their doors.\nMuzyka is an attorney who has more than 20 years\u2019 experience as a sidewalk advocate. Her passion for defending the sanctity of human life led her into the pro-life movement.\nFor over two years, Muzyka served as campaign strategist for the national 40 Days for Life Team, advising more than 300 of their campaigns in North America.\nMuzyka spoke about why they are compelled to go to abortion facilities to advocate.\n\"Abortion is the greatest cause of death in the history of the world,\u201d she said. Sixty-three million deaths since Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.\"\n\"We channel righteous anger toward the first crisis, at the abortion clinic,\u201d Muzyka said, \u201cwhich is that a mother is there to take her child's life.\"\u00a0\nInspired by the work of Saint Teresa of Calcutta, Muzyka pondered whether her own personal love of Jesus would move her into the streets to pick up people the way in which Mother Teresa did.\n\"Then I realized, they aren't dying in the streets but behind closed doors in abortion facilities,\u201d Muzyka said. \u201cWe need to go where children are dying and women are wounded. This is the crossroads of life and death in America, at the abortion facility. Roe v. Wade ends for the individual or community, one at a time when we succeed.\u201d\nTweet This: We need to go where children are dying and women are wounded. This is the crossroads of life and death in America, at the abortion facility.\nThe SAFL website\u00a0 details the training they offer and the tools they utilize, and ways individuals can support their work.\u00a0\nNoting the evolution of sidewalk advocacy methodology, Muzyka highlighted two specific ways in which those involved have shifted in their approaches:\u00a0\n1. Doing a better job presenting themselves as the trained professionals that they are.\u00a0\n2. Keeping in mind that the woman they are approaching may be pulled away at any moment, they are doing a better job of marketing the free services of the local pregnancy center by sharing the information quickly and having tools in hand ready to hand off to these women. It may be as simple as pointing out there is a mobile unit nearby where a nurse can see her immediately for the same life-affirming services for free, such as a pregnancy test, ultrasounds, or STD testing.\n\"Former abortion providers say peaceful, prayerful sidewalk outreach was the activity that most devastated their business,\" Muzyka told the Heartbeat Conference.\nA SAFL video reporting the work in San Antonio demonstrates how sidewalk advocacy in conjunction with the use of a mobile unit from a local pregnancy help center is a \"match made in heaven.\"\u00a0\nNot only did a South San Antonio abortion facility close, but a mom whose child was saved by the encouragement of an advocate pointing her toward a mobile unit came back with her five-month-old child, grateful, reuniting with the advocate, demonstrating the effectiveness of the human connection employed with sidewalk advocacy.\nFormer Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson has also spoken of the effectiveness of prayer and peaceful advocacy outside abortion facilities.\u00a0\n\"When there is a peaceful, prayerful presence in front of an abortion facility,\u201d she said, \u201cPlanned Parenthood regularly documents up to a 75% cancellation rate.\"\n\nLauren Muzyka/Lisa Bourne\n\nMuzyka listed the main goals of sidewalk advocacy in terms of addressing a woman\u2019s needs.\u00a0\n\"Fill the need that brought her to the abortion facility,\u201d Muzyka said. \u201cDirect all business away from the abortion facility.\"\nThis is why an important part of the work is to have on hand literature that lists all the free services of the local pregnancy center. Regardless of why the woman is approaching the abortion facility she can receive the care that she needs at the local pregnancy help center for free.\nMuzyka spoke to the fact that sidewalk advocates must keep in mind the priority of putting the needs of the women they serve first.\n\"We are not there to counsel the baby,\u201d she stated. \u201cWe are there to help the mother. If we meet her need for love and support, then we can help save the child in the process.\"\nSAFL advocates follow this map: smile and greet in love, give out literature and explain the help available, ask questions and listen, solve the perceived problem, and empower her to leave.\n\"At any point in the conversation when she's ready to go to the pregnancy center, immediately affirm her choice, and switch your focus to a comfortable, professional handoff,\" Muzyka said.\nMuzyka said the partnership between pregnancy help centers and sidewalk advocates work best when pregnancy help centers, \"Have woman-oriented, welcoming curb appeal.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYour services are free, immediate, and visible,\u201d she said. \u201cYou're open, and advocates can mention a free pregnancy test and sonogram.\"\u00a0\nSAFL has a plan and vision for passing the baton consistently to pregnancy help centers as they reach out to women in front of abortion facilities.\nThe group is sponsoring its National Sidewalk Advocacy Conference October 28-30 in Dallas, Texas.\u00a0\nSpeakers will include Abby Johnson, pro-life strategist David Bereit, Heartbeat International President Jor-El Godsey, Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins, and Muzyka. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nabortion\nprolife\nsidewalk counseling\nSidewalk Advocates for Life\nsidewalk advocacy\nHeartbeat International Annual Pregnancy Help Conference\nLauren Muzyka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Hayes\n\nKim Hayes is a writer for Pregnancy Help News.\u00a0She has been a teacher, author, speaker and facilitator for marriage and family issues and married for over 35 years to Jeff, with four grown children.\u00a0Kim\u2019s counseling experience included 21 years as a volunteer consultant and trainer at Pregnancy Decision Health Centers.\u00a0She was the Athletic Director of Columbus Crusaders Youth Sports ministry for 15 years.\u00a0Kim has written several books, including the latest release, Prodigal Rewind:\u00a0 The Grateful Son. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\n\n\nMontana strikes down 3 pro-life laws; Where abortion stands in the state\n\n\n\nPro-life groups intervene to prevent abortion from becoming a \"constitutional right\" in Wisconsin\n\n\n\nArgentine President Milei: Abortion is aggravated homicide\n\n\n\nMissouri sues Planned Parenthood for trafficking minors for out-of-state abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET OUR NEWS DIGEST \n\n\nGet Pregnancy Help News delivered to your inbox each Monday morning.\nEmail \nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal court banishes Idaho satanists\u2019 abortion lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDobbs as D-Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court to hear first abortion case since Dobbs on March 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\u2019s March for Life events from coast to coast: \u2018Proclaiming the gift of human dignity\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSCLogin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n                                Remember me                            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nNewsCommentaryVideoAbout\n\n\n\nGet Involved\nAdvertisement Information Contact Us Pitch a Story Write for Us!Partner with Us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Pregnancy Help News .
