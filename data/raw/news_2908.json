That changed dramatically when as a university student in Vienna, Austria, she attended a conference on Europe\u2019s future. As part of the conference, Czernin watched a showing of the 2014 film, The Giver, based on Lois Lowry\u2019s 1993 Newbery Medal\u2013winning novel of the same name.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a part of the film where babies are put in a shop window and people choose them. The ones who don\u2019t get picked up are basically killed. I remember watching and thinking, \u2018This is abortion! It\u2019s the same thing!\u2019\u201d says Czernin. \nShe spent a sleepless night contemplating how many abortions take place in Europe each day. The next day at the conference she met a leader from a pro-life group in search of a graphic designer, Czernin\u2019s field. She offered her help. \u201cThe more I got to know about the issue, the more I understood the huge wound society has because of abortion.\u201d \nBut Czernin, who grew up in Portugal, sees that the problem of abortion in Europe needs a Europe-wide solution, which is why she helped found ProLife Europe three years ago. New pan-European organizations like ProLife Europe are challenging the decades-long acceptance of abortion as a right and reinvigorating the discussion with arguments from biology and ethics.\nCzernin stresses that the goal of ProLife Europe is first and foremost to have a positive message about protecting life. She says the pro-life movement in Europe has suffered in the past because of messaging that used graphic images or harsh rhetoric. That alienated many people who otherwise considered themselves pro-life. A negative message is also out of step with what younger pro-life people want to project. The organization\u2019s website reflects that: Brightly colored graphics show smiling youth proclaiming life-affirming messages, and an upbeat mission statement: \u201cWe are a transnational organization that aims to create a culture of life in Europe, beyond political and economic interests.\u201d \nStill, they don\u2019t shy away from the facts: Beyond life-affirming messaging, the group\u2019s main aim is education by presenting the basic facts of biology and conception and what an abortion does to stop life in the womb. \n\u201cIf you go out on the streets, people say, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s choice,\u2019 they know that line by heart,\u201d says Czernin. \u201cBut if you ask them what an abortion is, they don\u2019t know. They can only say that at 12 weeks, the baby is \u2018like a clump of cells.\u2019\u201d To counter that, ProLife Europe puts on training seminars for university students in biology, ethics, and philosophy, presenting facts and letting that persuade people, instead of trying to win an argument. A section of the website explains in matter-of-fact language how different kinds of abortions function, and whether the baby is killed by asphyxiation, heart failure, or dismemberment. \nCzernin cites public studies that support a pro-life case: \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that the child is alive. It\u2019s a fact that women have an 81 percent higher risk of depression following abortion. We have those studies, so our main goal is to make the information from those studies known.\u201d \nAs a university student, Czernin had a friend who became pregnant and sought an abortion. Though she considered herself pro-life, Czernin realized that she lacked the arguments and resources to give her friend an alternate perspective. Now the memory of that conversation motivates her to equip pro-life students. \nProLife Europe has 35 groups across Europe, with most members between the ages of 17 and 25. As a newer organization aimed largely at university students, the COVID pandemic took a toll on gatherings. Still, in the three years of its existence membership grew. Czernin says with the growth has come connection with other Europe-wide pro-life organizations and the desire to combine forces.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaria Czernin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Alberto Catania/Genesis\n \nONE OF THOSE GROUPS is the One of Us Foundation, based in Krakow, Poland. Founder and General Secretary Jakub Baltroszewicz met me for coffee in a gleaming shopping mall to the north of the city. Everything about Krakow and the shopping center belies attempts by international abortion activists to paint Poland as a repressive backwater. Upscale shops are spotless and well stocked, and everywhere I look there is evidence of a society that welcomes and cares for children: diaper-changing tables in the men\u2019s room, child-sized restroom stalls and toilets, accessibility for strollers in shops and on public transport.\nBaltroszewicz was one of five men who founded One of Us. He says the men started the organization because of what he calls a \u201ccrisis of manhood.\u201d \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a child in the belly of a woman, the man should be there,\u201d says Baltroszewicz. \u201cSeeking an abortion is always a huge cry of loneliness, when a woman is told: \u2018your belly, your problem.\u2019 If a man would be a real man who would support a woman, there would be no more abortion in the world.\u201d\nOne of Us grew out of a citizens\u2019 initiative to the European Parliament challenging the European Union financing of abortions in developing nations as a violation of the EU\u2019s principle of nondiscrimination. The initiative failed, despite garnering a record number of signatures from 20 supporting nations. But the effort brought together pro-life forces across Europe to found the federation of which One of Us is a part in 2013.\n\u201cWe had never worked together like that as Europeans before,\u201d says Baltroszewicz. \u201cThis is something good that came out of the initiative.\u201d One of Us now has a permanent office in Brussels where Baltroszewicz has lobbyist status. The 24-member nation group works to keep life issues in the EU spotlight.\n\nIf you root pro-life too much in your religious beliefs, then you lose a platform to connect to those who don\u2019t have God in their lives.\u201d\nBaltroszewicz is also president of the Polish Pro-life Federation, an umbrella group started in 1993 that boasts 70 pro-life NGOs from all over Poland. At 40, he\u2019s older than the pro-lifers that Czernin refers to, but he also sees the younger generation as key. In cooperation with the Jerome Lejeune Foundation, one of France\u2019s leading pro-life groups, One of Us has developed a school curriculum that approaches bioethical questions from a strictly human rights perspective, which it plans to provide to every secondary school in Poland. Like Czernin, Baltroszewicz stresses the importance of arguments that transcend religious beliefs, so he can also dialogue with atheists and agnostics.\n\u201cI think that if you root pro-life too much in your religious beliefs, then you lose a platform to connect to those who don\u2019t have God in their lives,\u201d says Baltroszewicz. \u201cAnd we are not here to convince people who are already Christians and believe, because they\u2019re usually pro-life. I want to convince the young girls, who last October after the tribunal ruling, ran around the city in a so-called women\u2019s strike, shouting that the church is taking away basic freedoms.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJakub Baltroszewicz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Omar Marques/Genesis\n \nOne newer project of One of Us Foundation is the Bioethics Academy, intended to provide online tools and facts for those who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to it. \u201cWhat do parents do if they\u2019re from a small village in eastern Poland, what kind of argument do they use with their teenage daughters? They usually use religious arguments, and teenagers very often don\u2019t care about it. So we want to provide people with tools,\u201d says Baltroszewicz.\nIN PARIS, Aliette Espieux also wants to provide tools for pro-life arguments. At 23, the philosophy student has served the last two years as spokesperson for La Marche pour la Vie (The March for Life), the pro-life group that organizes an annual January march in the capital. After going virtual in 2021, this year\u2019s march attracted 20,000 people, despite requirements for the unpopular vaccination pass to attend. Espieux says that number in a time of lingering COVID-19 restrictions was encouraging.\nEven more encouraging was the number of young people attending, as well as the number of young people joining the movement overall. Espieux says there\u2019s been a shift: Her grandparents\u2019 generation fought hard against the original Loi Veil, which legalized abortion in France in 1975. The following generation was less active, faced with a barrage of laws restricting pro-life actions, notably laws that prohibit demonstrating within 300 meters (just under 1,000 feet) of an abortion clinic. But now, Espieux says, the next generation has a stronger will to fight.\n\nEurope\u2019s future is pro-life, but to get there, new, positive attitudes must challenge entrenched ones.\n\u201cWe have to stop being afraid of these laws because we\u2019re fighting for children who are being dismembered. We have to analyze the risks: 24 hours in detention is not much to sacrifice compared to a child who could be saved,\u201d says Espieux. She added that the other factor driving young people to the movement is a desire to help women in unplanned pregnancies. \u201cIn France, everything is in place to push a woman to abort. No other solution is proposed to a woman in distress. Something very encouraging is young people who want to be trained to demonstrate in the streets, but at the same time, they want to be trained to bring tangible help to those women and their children.\u201d\nInspired by the Pro-Life Generation movement in the United States, Espieux founded G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Pro Vie (Pro Life) to encourage young adults who want to speak up for life. When she herself first wore her pro-life sweatshirt to university classes, fellow students were shocked. Some agree with her views in private, but feared she would get threats or sabotage her future career. But one professor recently gave her an unexpected encouragement. \u201cThe professor saw that I was pretty much the only one interested. She said, \u2018I understand why you\u2019re interested in a class in strategy. I think you need it for your fight.\u2019\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAliette Espieux\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by Emilie Garcin/Genesis\n \n\u201cThe other students started protesting that I was conservative, out of touch, against women\u2019s rights. The professor said, \u2018Listen, you can agree or disagree with her. In the meantime, there\u2019s only one person in this room who dares to disagree with the crowd, and she has ideas. I\u2019m not sure the rest of you have any or have even considered the question, you just follow everybody else.\u2019 I was dumbfounded,\u201d says Espieux.\nBut while a younger generation is expanding the pro-life movement, the older generation is still in charge. France\u2019s Parliament last month voted to move limits on abortion from 12 to 14 weeks. Olaf Scholz\u2019s new German government has started a push to liberalize policies around abortion. Activists are challenging Poland\u2019s life-preserving legal rulings, and even though the conservative government pushed for last year\u2019s pro-life ruling that forbids abortion in case of Down syndrome or life-threatening handicap, it has failed to follow through with promises of greater assistance to families raising a disabled child.\nEspieux, Baltroszewicz, and Czernin are all certain that Europe\u2019s future is pro-life, but to get there, new, positive attitudes must challenge entrenched ones, and the movement that\u2019s growing in size and youth must also grow in endurance for the long haul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny Lind Schmitt\nJenny is WORLD\u2019s global desk chief and European reporter.
