Chris Sununu touted the state\u2019s abortion ban on the national podcast \u201cThree Martini Lunch.\u201d (Courtesy)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was updated May 14, 2022 at 7:30 a.m. to correct the name of the co-host.\nAsked in a podcast interview what abortion restrictions he\u2019d put in place if he had his choice, Gov. Chris Sununu defended the 24-week abortion ban he signed last year and boasted he was the first Republican governor in decades to sign any ban.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done more on the pro-life issue, if you will, than anyone,\u201d he told Jim Geraghty, co-host of the national podcast \u201cThree Martini Lunch,\u201d which describes itself as \u201ca funny, edgy, and fast-paced podcast of the day\u2019s major political stories.\u201d\nWhen he\u2019s talked about the 24-week abortion ban here, Sununu has emphasized that he identifies as a pro-choice governor and has not publicly described the ban as an anti-abortion effort.\u00a0\nSununu said during the interview that his support for banning most abortions after 24 weeks is in line with most Americans and 44 states.\nAfter the clip circulated on social media Wednesday, Sen. Tom Sherman, a Rye Democrat hoping to unseat Sununu, and the state\u2019s Democratic Party put out statements condemning Sununu\u2019s comments.\n\u201cChris Sununu has repeatedly shown the women of New Hampshire that he can\u2019t be trusted to stand up for them,\u201d said Sherman, a gastroenterologist. \u201cAs a doctor, I\u2019ve spent my entire career building trust with my patients. There is no greater responsibility because once you break that trust you cannot get it back. This governor has repeatedly broken the trust of Granite State women and is now bragging about it to Washington insiders.\u201d\nParty spokesperson Monica Venzke accused Sununu of catering to \u201cthe far-right, anti-choice extremists\u201d in the Republican Party.\n\u201cGranite State women cannot trust a word he says, especially when it comes to our reproductive rights. Chris Sununu will continue to lie to us and strip us of our rights for his own political gain,\u201d Venzke said.\nAsked for comment, Sununu spokesman Ben Vihstadt reiterated points Sununu made in the interview.\n\u201cLike a majority of Americans, the governor supports limiting abortions in months seven, eight, and nine,\u201d he said. \u201cLike virtually every other state, New Hampshire now has laws on the books that limit late-term abortions. Regardless of any Supreme Court decision, that won\u2019t change the fact that these services will remain safe, legal, and accessible in New Hampshire.\u201d\nNew Hampshire\u2019s ban allows for abortion after 24 weeks only if the mother\u2019s health or life is at risk. Sununu said he will sign a bill headed to his desk adding an exception for a fetus that will not survive outside of the womb.\nUnlike some other states, however, New Hampshire\u2019s law does not make exceptions for rape or incest, and it carries criminal and civil penalties for physicians who violate it.\nSununu addressed abortion in a wide-ranging, nearly 50-minute interview posted Wednesday.\u00a0\nAbout 30 minutes into the conversation, Geraghty, noted Sununu issued a statement after a leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cProbably the less pleasant section of the interview here, governor,\u201d Geraghty, said. \u201cYou pretty quickly put out a statement saying, quote, as a pro-choice governor I am committed to upholding Roe v. Wade, which is why I\u2019m proud of the bipartisan bill (adding exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies) that is headed to my desk this year. \u2026 So long that I am governor, these health care services for women will remain safe and legal.\u201d\n\u201cPeople like me grind our teeth upon reading that,\u201d Geraghty, told him.\nHe went on to ask Sununu what abortion law he would put in place if the decision was his alone.\n\u201cWell, look, I\u2019m the first governor in 40 years to sign an abortion ban. Republican governors before me never signed that. I\u2019ve done more on the pro-life issue, if you will, than anyone. And and I believe, as most Americans do, that there should be a ban on abortions in months seven, eight, and nine. We got that done. And that was a 40-year challenge, and we actually did it.\u201d\nThe host asked Sununu how his position will figure into the governor\u2019s race. Sununu said he expected to get criticism from both sides of the issue.\u00a0\n\u201cDemocrats will say I\u2019m too pro-life. Folks on the extreme will say I\u2019m too pro-choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is New Hampshire. We\u2019re an in-the-middle state on this issue. I don\u2019t mean to say I\u2019m in the middle, but I believe in a reasonable ban to be put in place. We did that.\u201d\nSununu went on to say he felt the ban that came to his desk had \u201creally aggressive provisions that were completely unreasonable.\u201d\u00a0\nHe urged lawmakers this year to pass the bill making an exception for fatal fetal anomalies and also supported exceptions for rape and incest.\n\u201cI worked hard to kind of pull back on that because it didn\u2019t make logical sense to have that kind of stuff in there,\u201d he said. \u201cA ban on the late-term abortions, as most states have, is exactly where we need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXSununu touts New Hampshire\u2019s abortion ban on national podcast\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin May 12, 2022\nSununu touts New Hampshire\u2019s abortion ban on national podcast\nby Annmarie Timmins, New Hampshire Bulletin May 12, 2022\n This story was updated May 14, 2022 at 7:30 a.m. to correct the name of the co-host.\nAsked in a podcast interview what abortion restrictions he\u2019d put in place if he had his choice, Gov.
