The Planned Parenthood nurse spends two days each week at the Waukegan clinic, working with patients who are getting abortion procedures. She said the trip just makes sense.\u201cMost of these are our patients,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many people, patients from Wisconsin, we see in Waukegan.\u201d \n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday marks one year since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its historic opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case, overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving the legality of abortion up to individual states. In Wisconsin, nearly all abortions became illegal immediately, as an 1800s-era law that is still on the books took effect again. One year after the Dobbs decision, things look quite a bit different for Wisconsinites on both sides of the issue. As legal abortions have ceased in the state, patients, providers and protesters are making the trip to Illinois, Minnesota and other states where it\u2019s still legal. \nSophia Kallas, a comprehensive reproductive health care assistant, gets their backpack out of the trunk before heading into the Waukegan, Ill., Planned Parenthood to work Wednesday, June 7, 2023. Angela Major/WPR\nShortly after Ellingson arrived at the Waukegan clinic on a recent Wednesday, a small group of protesters began to set up on the sidewalk between the busy road and the clinic. They were from Wisconsin, too. \u201cWe came from Wisconsin to Illinois to try to reach out to women who are abortion-minded,\u201d said Anne Franczek of Milwaukee. She\u2019s been protesting at abortion clinics for close to 40 years, and now comes to Waukegan twice a week with the Christian anti-abortion group Tarry One Hour. The Waukegan clinic opened in 2020, with an eye on serving patients from nearby Wisconsin. For Franczek, that\u2019s part of the reason she makes the trip twice each week.  \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be that strategic, why shouldn\u2019t we be strategic?\u201d she said.  \nAnne Franczek stands outside of a Planned Parenthood among signs urging visitors to not get abortions Wednesday, June 7, 2023, in Waukegan, Ill. Angela Major/WPR\nEven as abortion-seekers flock to other states, fewer get accessPlanned Parenthood of Illinois reported a 54 percent increase in abortion patients since last summer, many of them coming from other states. But despite all the interstate travel, the numbers have not evened out, said University of Wisconsin-Madison obstetrics and gynecology professor Jenny Higgins, who directs the Collaborative for Reproductive Equity. \u201cWhile less restrictive states such as Illinois and Minnesota have seen increases in the number of abortions, those increases do not make up for the decreases and restrictive states such as Wisconsin,\u201d she said. A recent study by #WeCount, a national abortion reporting project, found an average of 5,377 fewer abortions were provided per month nationwide in the six months following the Dobbs decision. It\u2019s too soon to know how the ban is affecting birth rates in Wisconsin, as those numbers have yet to be reported by the state. But Higgins looks to the closures of abortion clinics in Green Bay and Appleton in 2013 and 2015 to predict what may happen. The birth rates went up in those areas, she said, and she expects to see the same thing in Wisconsin going forward. \u201cI can say with a lot of certainty that we would expect slight but significant increases in birth rates in the Wisconsin counties that have lost the most access to care,\u201d she said. In Wisconsin, pregnancy resource centers \u2014 sometimes referred to as pregnancy crisis centers \u2014 are also seeing increased demand, a representative from Wisconsin Right To Life recently told Wiconsin Public Radio. \nHeather Ellingson, right, and Sophia Kallas, left, sit in the parking lot after traveling to the Waukegan, Ill., Planned Parenthood to work Wednesday, June 7, 2023. Angela Major/WPR\nMedical confusion and fear are common In addition to more people who may have once sought abortions having babies, there have been other medical ripple effects of the ban, said Dr. Allie Linton, associate medical director at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin. Confusion and fear have been common in patients, she said.\u201cI\u2019ve seen patients that have stayed at home longer, even though they\u2019re concerned about something that they\u2019re experiencing,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s in the miscarriage realm, they are so afraid that they can\u2019t seek out medical care in a state like Wisconsin or other states where something is banned.\u201d She said that fear has extended to doctors as well, who could face up to six years in prison for performing an abortion under current state law. Some have warned of a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d of abortion bans, where doctors treating miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy could delay care for fear they may be accused of providing abortions. The Wisconsin Planned Parenthood clinics that once offered abortion services are still open, but now only provide things like routine family planning, STI screening and contraception. They also still provide pregnancy dating and ultrasound services for abortion patients who plan to travel for the actual medication or procedure appointment. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has assigned \u201cpatient navigators,\u201d who assist Wisconsin abortion-seekers in making out-of-state appointments and travel plans. Still, some patients are surprised to learn that abortion is no longer legal in the state. \u201cEven to this day, we\u2019ll get a call and they don\u2019t realize that they can\u2019t get care in Wisconsin,\u201d Linton said. \nA sign outside of the Planned Parenthood in Waukegan, Ill., on Wednesday, June 7, 2023. Angela Major/WPR\nThe Options Fund, a group that provides financial assistance for abortion-seekers in northwestern Wisconsin, saw a dip in requests immediately following the Dobbs opinion. \u201cWe knew that it wasn\u2019t because people weren\u2019t trying to access services, but people thought they couldn\u2019t anymore,\u201d said fund president Cheryl Thiede.Now, a year later, the numbers have returned to normal. Despite massive changes to the abortion access landscape statewide, most of The Options Fund\u2019s clientele are no farther from clinics than they\u2019ve always been. Before the ban, Wisconsin had four abortion clinics, three run by Planned Parenthood in Milwaukee, Madison and Sheboygan, and one in Milwaukee called Affiliated Medical Services. People who didn\u2019t live near those population centers were already traveling.  \u201cWe were set up with that framework, so we didn\u2019t really have to pivot in that way,\u201d Thiede said, but now, the out-of-state clinics face more pressure.\u201cThe states where it\u2019s legal now are carrying the burden of people from the other states,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is a little bit more of a lead time with appointments in Minnesota and Illinois as people from Texas, Louisiana, and all sorts of states are traveling.\u201d\nOne of three protesters stands with a sign outside of a Planned Parenthood on Wednesday, June 7, 2023, in Waukegan, Ill. Angela Major/WPR\nBoth sides look to the state Supreme Court The future of abortion in Wisconsin may come down to the state Supreme Court, which will now have a liberal majority after Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Janet Protasiewicz was elected to an open seat in April. Matt Sande, legislative director of Pro-Life Wisconsin, remembers celebrating the Dobbs decision a year ago, and the group plans to mark Dobbs anniversary with a March For Life event at the state Capitol Saturday. Still, he doesn\u2019t believe anti-abortion work is done, and is looking toward what the court will do. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve been abortion free for a year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut abortion could be coming back in the near future.\u201dPlanned Parenthood nurse Heather Ellingson is also looking toward the future, but she hopes abortion access will be restored. \u201cI was present when we had to close our door, and I would like to be there and swing that door right back open,\u201d she said.It\u2019s expected the court could take up the abortion case as soon as August. \n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nHow did the Dobbs decision affect the birth rate in Wisconsin? \n\n \n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood to resume abortion services in Sheboygan \n\n \n\n\n\nAfter latest ruling, what abortion restrictions still exist in Wisconsin? \n\n \n\n\n\n\u2018Resuming access to abortion care a first step,\u2019 says Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin leader \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
