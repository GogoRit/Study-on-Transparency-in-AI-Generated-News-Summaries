Ron DeSantis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decision to sign\u00a0a six-week abortion ban, calling it\u00a0a \u00e2\u0080\u009cterrible mistake\"\n\n\nThe Biden campaign\u00a0issued a statement on Sunday seeking to highlight what it sees as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\n\nTrump would not give a number of weeks in which he would support a federal ban on most abortion, saying he wanted to bring both sides together to find an agreement on a number of weeks\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake,\" the former president said of the Florida governor in the interview.\nDeSantis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to fire back. The DeSantis War Room posted a clip of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview, writing that the Florida governor \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill NEVER sell out conservatives to win praise from corporate media or the Left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nIn the interview, Trump would not give a number of weeks in which he would support a federal ban on most abortions, including declining to say whether he would sign a 15-week ban.\u00a0\nThe former president, whose appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court during his presidency paved the way for the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, said he would bring both sides of the abortion issue together to work out \u00e2\u0080\u009ca number that's going to make people happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're going to agree to a number of weeks or months or however you want to define it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, adding he would personally \u00e2\u0080\u009csit down with both sides and negotiate something and we'll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think both sides are going to like me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00a0\nTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit well with the Biden campaign either, which issued a statement on Sunday seeking to highlight what it sees as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complicated: Donald Trump is the reason millions of women lost the freedom to make their own health care decisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American people will reject Donald Trump and his extreme anti-abortion platform, just as they have rejected the MAGA extremist anti-abortion agenda in election after election post-Dobbs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLast year, the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Organization decision overturned the nearly half-century precedent set by Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the right to an abortion nationwide until a certain point in pregnancy. As a result, the issue of whether and how much to restrict abortion was returned to the states. Since then, states across the country have enacted a patchwork of laws nationwide restricting or banning the practice.\u00a0\nTrump has been critical of some Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 approach to the issue since Roe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overturning, including pointing to their handling of the topic to explain why the GOP did not perform as well as many expected in the 2022 midterm elections.\u00a0\nThe former president made many of the same arguments in Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview, emphasizing there should be exceptions on abortion bans for \u00e2\u0080\u009crape or incest or the life of the mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nAsked whether an agreement on when to ban abortion should be at the federal levels or state level, Trump said \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t frankly care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nRepublican candidates have struggled with the abortion topic, lacking a unified message.\u00a0\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have sought to lean into what they believe is a winning issue for their party, given polls showing a majority of Americans disapprove of the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dobbs decision and support access to abortion in the first trimester.\u00a0\nTo further make their case, Democrats point to voters rejecting efforts to tightly restrict the practice when it has been on the ballot both indirectly and directly in local elections since the overturning of Roe.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            CERTIFICATIONS\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
