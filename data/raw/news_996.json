Under the law, private citizens are allowed to sue anyone who provides an abortion after six weeks, as well as anyone \"who aids and abets\" someone who gets the procedure after six weeks.\r\n\nDuring an online discussion Thursday hosted by the LBJ School of Public Affairs at UT Austin, Dr. Lorie Harper \u2014 a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and professor at Dell Med \u2014 said SB 8 has made it more difficult to care for women who have physically dangerous pregnancies.\r\n\n\u201cSome women just cannot take the stress of pregnancy so they may basically die or develop a life-threatening condition because of pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cIn those cases, I have to recommend an abortion in order to prevent a maternal death. And that is getting much harder.\u201d\r\n\nFor one, she said, the legal stakes of these decisions are getting much higher. That\u2019s because SB 8 was designed to be enforced through civil lawsuits that could be filed by anyone in the country.\r\n\nHarper said the law does make an exemption to save the life of the pregnant person. So, someone can obtain an abortion after six weeks if their life is at risk, but Harper said that could be very broadly interpreted. Someone could disagree with the doctor's decision and possibly sue them.\r\n\n\u201cBecause of the civil lawsuit nature of this and how it is interpreted leaves us feeling very open to lawsuits and very at risk,\u201d Harper said, \u201ceven when we feel the procedure is medically indicated and justified.\u201d\r\n\nUnder SB 8, women are allowed to end a pregnancy if a doctor determines that there is a \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d Harper said that is \u201cnot very clearly defined\u201d and can be either narrowly or broadly interpreted depending on the individual physician.\r\n\nHarper said that means different patients will face \u201ca luck of the draw\u201d if they face an issue during their pregnancy. She said privileged patients will be able to \u201cdoctor shop,\u201d but patients with limited access to health care could have a harder time getting an abortion.\r\n\n\u201cPhysicians are having to choose between their own personal well-being and at times a patient\u2019s well-being,\u201d she said.\r\n\nDr. Lauren Thaxton, a board-certified OB-GYN and assistant professor at Dell Med, said many doctors are feeling a lot of fear and threat of legal action under this new law.\r\n\n\u201cWe went to medical school, we do not go to law school,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real threat that is being placed on medical providers.\u201d\r\n\nAnother consequence of SB 8, doctors say, is that now it\u2019s harder for families to get access to a procedure intended to allow a fetus to survive a rare pregnancy complication. In particular, Harper says, abortion procedures are now banned in twin and triplet pregnancies where one fetus is in danger or can\u2019t survive. \n\u201cThere are centers in Texas capable of saving the life of the healthy twin at the cost of the unhealthy fetus that can\u2019t survive,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAfter SB 8, those procedures stopped being offered in Texas. So, when patients have those complicated pregnancies, they have to leave the state to save their healthy baby.\u201d \r\n Copyright 2022 KUT 90.5.
