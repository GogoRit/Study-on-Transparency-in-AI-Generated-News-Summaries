Baby Lives Matter represents a true peaceful protest.\u201d\nA GoFundMe account was created to help fund artists who are painting the \u2018Baby Lives Matter\u2019 murals around the country.\u00a0 The first one was painted on July 15th outside a Planned Parenthood in Salt Lake City, Utah.\u00a0 According to the GoFundMe page, Hansen painted for seven straight hours in front of his local Planned Parenthood to complete the mural.\u00a0 As of August 26th, the \u2018Baby Lives Matter\u2019 page has raised over $17,000.\nA spokesperson with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department says officers responded to the area due to a report regarding vandalism in the street.\u00a0 CMPD says the incident is being investigated.\u00a0 No other details have been released at this time.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nDownload the WCCB Charlotte Mobile App\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos & Videos\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Teen Technology Center Is Setting Local Teens Up For Success \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock Steady Boxing Program Helps Charlotteans with Parkinson's Disease \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning Brew: Would You Pay For An Empty Seat Next To You On A Plane? + What Does The Happiest Person You Know, Do For A Living? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning Brew: Life Hacks That Seem Fake But Work + Celebrities You Once Adored But No Longer Do \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\nMorganton Woman Dead In Burke County CrashPolice Release Identities Of Victims Killed In Separate Charlotte ShootingsSuspect Arrested In California In Murder Of Missing Mother And Her Two ChildrenOne Dead, Two Injured In South Carolina CrashWildlife Agency Offers Guidance as Animal Encounters Increase in Spring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContests\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText2Win: Colin Mochrie & Brad Sherwood: Asking for Trouble Ticket Giveaway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nWCCB, Charlotte's CW\n\n\n\n\n\ud835\udd4f\n\nFormerly Twitter\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nicons go here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Live\nNews\n\nHealth\nCrime\n\nLocal Crime\nMugshots\n\n\nEducation\nLocal News\nNational News\nNorth Carolina News\nPolitics\nScience & Technology\nSouth Carolina News\nTraffic\nWeird News\nWorld News\n\n\nPhotos & Videos\n\nPhotos\n\nAround Town\nEditor Picks\nMugshots\nPets\n\n\nVideos\n\nCrime\nNews & Politics\nViral\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\nOver The Edge\nWatch WCCB Charlotte\u2019s CW\nComedy\nMovies\nMusic\nTheater & Live Shows\n\n\nSports\n\nBaseball\n\nCharlotte Knights\nKannapolis Intimidators\n\n\nBasketball\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\n\nCollege Sports\nFootball\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\n\nGolf\nHigh School Sports\nHockey\n\nCharlotte Checkers\nCarolina Hurricanes\n\n\nMotor Sports\n\nNASCAR\n\n\nSoccer\n\nCharlotte FC | MLS\nCharlotte Independence\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWeather\n\nDaily Forecast\nInteractive Radar\nSevere Weather Alerts\nWeather News & Information\n\n\nNews @ Ten\nRising\n\nCarolina InSight\nDo My Job\nDon\u2019t Waste Your Money\nFitness Friday\nHealthy Headlines\nMorning Brew\nPet Of The Week\nRising Cooks!\nRising Spotlight\nTasty Tuesday\nUp \u2018n Adam\nVeterans Day \u2013 Honoring All Who Served\nWhat The Tech?\n\n\nOver The Edge\nThe CW\nMarketplace\n \n\nContests & Quizzes\nEvents Calendar\nSalvation Army Angel Tree\nWCCB Digital\nAbout WCCB\n\nAdvertise With Us\nBahakel Digital \u2750\nCareers\nContact Us\nChannel Info\nEEO Reports and Outreach Initiatives Reports\nFCC Applications\nFCC Public File\nInternships\nMeTV\nOur Team\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nTV Schedule\nProgramming\nWCCB News App\nWCCB Weather App\nWCCB On Demand Apps\n\n\nWCCB On Social Media\n\n   On Facebook\n   On Twitter\n On Instagram\n   On YouTube\n   WCCB News Rising On Twitter\n   CW Street Team On Twitter\n   WCCB News Edge On Twitter\n   WCCB News Rising On Facebook\n   WCCB Traffic Now On Twitter\n   WCCB Digital On Twitter\n\n\n \n\u00a9 2024 WCCB Charlotte's CW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\nShare\nToggle Fullscreen\nZoom in/out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Previous\n Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"
