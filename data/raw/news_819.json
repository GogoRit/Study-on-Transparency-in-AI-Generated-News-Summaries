Wade and the abolition of federal constitutional abortion rights, accomplished in one fell swoop in the Dobbs Supreme Court decision. And the rush of Republican-controlled state legislators to enact newly available abortion restrictions was very exciting to those who spent decades struggling to find small cracks in the legal edifice created by Roe.\nBut the grassroots political backlash to these developments has to have been alarming to anti-abortion activists as they watched their long-time vassals in the Republican Party dance away from the aggressive steps to ban abortions everywhere that they had implicitly and explicitly promised to pursue once Roe went down. When Lindsey Graham tried to force a vote on a national 15-week abortion ban in the Senate in September, midterm-conscious Republican politicians all but shouted him down. By November, abortion-rights advocates had won ballot tests over laws in six states (Kansas, Kentucky, Vermont, California, Michigan, and Montana). And without question, the abortion backlash was a significant \u2014 maybe the most significant \u2014 factor in the underperformance of Republicans in the midterms.\nNow divided government in Washington will paralyze policy-making on abortion and nearly every other issue for the next two years. So all eyes are on 2024, and worried anti-abortion activists are making it clear they will use all the leverage they can to reimpose their views on the GOP via litmus tests on Republican presidential candidates. As Politico reports, demand No. 1 will likely be the kind of national abortion ban Graham proposed to the horror of most of his colleagues:\nAnti-abortion advocates are insisting on more in a post-Roe\u00a0era \u2014 namely, a hard commitment to back a federal abortion ban \u2014 and they\u2019re holding out until they get it.That means potential Republican presidential hopefuls \u2014 such as Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban would have been at the leading edge of the anti-abortion movement a year ago \u2014 enter the 2024 cycle under pressure to go farther. There\u2019s already a range of policy positions across the potential GOP field, from former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s support for a national abortion ban to former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley\u2019s recent remarks that abortion should remain a state issue, and most have not yet detailed the exact anti-abortion policies they would push if elected.\nThat will change assuming there really is a big, brawling competition for the 2024 GOP nomination full of candidate forums and dominated in some key states by activists who eat, breathe, and sleep abortion politics above all (such as Iowa, which among Republicans will remain the first contest of 2024 no matter what Democrats do). And despite the deep appreciation the forced-birth crowd has for what Donald Trump did to help bring down Roe and the powerful head of steam Ron DeSantis has built up if he decides to challenge the 45th president, no candidate will get to skip a tough abortion litmus test, or ignore demands to talk about the subject early and often.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m appreciative of everything [Trump] put in place,\u201d Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, told POLITICO. \u201cEvangelical voters and conservative voters have great admiration and appreciation for him, but they still want a vision cast for the future and they don\u2019t want to go through four years of relitigating 2020.\u201dTrump didn\u2019t once mention abortion or the fall of\u00a0Roe\u00a0in his grievance-laden speech announcing his 2024 campaign, sparking conservative concerns that he won\u2019t prioritize the issue in a third White House bid.\nDeSantis has been a bit dodgy, pushing through his legislature a 15-week ban with no exceptions but (so far) resisting demands to go farther now that he stands athwart Florida like a political colossus. But he and other potential presidential candidates will definitely have to take a stand on a national ban, which is not a theoretical matter since a very good Republican year in 2024 could give the GOP trifecta control in Washington. Certainly the topic will come up in the early and pivotal 2024 primary in South Carolina, Lindsey Graham\u2019s state, where a potential presidential candidate, former governor Nikki Haley, has taken the position that abortion is exclusively a state issue. Here\u2019s what Graham told Politico about that:\n\u201cEach person running for the White House will have to come up with an answer to the question, post-Dobbs: \u2018Should we consider this a states rights issue or a human rights issue?\u2019\u201d Graham said in an interview. \u201cThe pro-life community is still a strong component of the Republican Party and if you\u2019re running for president, I think in certain states, like South Carolina, the position that the unborn have no voice in our nation\u2019s capital will be a tough sell for the pro-life community.\u201d\nAt present the only potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate who is golden with the anti-abortion lobby is former vice-president Mike Pence, the conservative evangelical stalwart who has long favored a very tight national ban on abortions. Assuming he runs (which he\u2019s giving every indication of doing) Pence will significantly ramp up the pressure on his rivals to commit to a federal ban on the strictest possible terms.\nWill any potential GOP president look at some general-election polls and dare to push back on these demands? It\u2019s an interesting question. The pro-choice wing of the Republican Party has been moribund for decades. But 2022 votes in Kansas and elsewhere have shown there are Republican voters who haven\u2019t bought into anti-abortion extremism once it actually matters in terms of the law of the land. In any event, the national GOP\u2019s position on the fraught subject will be tested as never before in 2024.\n\n\nMore on life after roe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The Christian Right\u2019s Imaginary Nation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Republicans Have More Than a \u2018Brand Problem\u2019 on Abortion\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Anti-Abortion Activists Have Republicans in a Vise\n            \n\n\n\n\nSee All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer\u00a0Newsletter\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n          Privacy Policy and\n          Terms of Service apply.\n        \nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\npolitics\n\n\nearly and often\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nA National Abortion Ban Will Be a 2024 GOP Litmus Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Middleton Was Spotted in Public, With Video to Prove It\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Says He Can\u2019t Get a $464 Million Bond.
