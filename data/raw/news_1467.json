(AP) \u2014 A major anti-abortion group blasted former President Donald Trump on the issue Thursday, saying his contention that abortion restrictions should be left up to individual states, not the federal government, is a \u201cmorally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate.\u201dThe Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America group was responding to a statement by Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung for a Washington Post story about division among the 2024 GOP presidential field on abortion-related issues. The group has said it would not support any White House candidate who did not at a minimum support a 15-week federal abortion ban.\u201cThe Supreme Court made clear in its decision that it was returning the issue to the people to decide through their elected representatives in the states and in Congress,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a news release. \u201cHolding to the position that it is exclusively up to the states is an abdication of responsibility by anyone elected to federal office.\u201d\n\nThe condemnation by one of the nation\u2019s largest anti-abortion groups amounted to a stunning rebuke of the former president, the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. His three nominations of conservative judges to the Supreme Court paved the way for the reversal of Roe v Wade, which had legalized abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheung had told the Post that \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump believes that the Supreme Court, led by the three Justices which he supported, got it right when they ruled this is an issue that should be decided at the State level.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has referred to himself as \u201cthe most pro-life president in American history.\u201d But in the early months of his 2024 bid, he has often sidestepped the issue of abortion, even as Republicans across the country celebrate the Supreme Court decision stripping federal constitutional rights to abortion. He won\u2019t be among the GOP hopefuls gathering this weekend at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s spring kickoff but will instead be speaking to the group by video.\n\nLast month in Iowa, Trump repeatedly refused to say whether he would support a federal law restricting abortion in every state, a move that anti-abortion activists have been demanding of the GOP\u2019s presidential contenders.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of different things,\u201d Trump said when asked twice by the AP whether he supports a federal abortion ban.Dannenfelser said in the statement Thursday that \u201clife is a matter of human rights, not states\u2019 rights\u201d and that Trump\u2019s characterization of last year\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case was wrong.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s assertion that the Supreme Court returned the issue of abortion solely to the states is a completely inaccurate reading of the Dobbs decision and is a morally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate to hold,\u201d she said.Pointing to a 2021 social media post from Dannenfelser\u2019s organization calling Trump \u201cthe most pro-life president in U.S. history,\u201d a spokesman for Trump\u2019s campaign also noted, \u201cEven though much work remains to be done to defend the cause of life, President Trump believes it is in the States where the greatest advances can now take place to protect the unborn.\u201d \n\nAll of the candidates running in the Republican presidential primary or moving toward a bid have supported state bans on abortion. Most have been much more cautious about staking a position on a nationwide ban, though entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s campaign has said he believes it\u2019s an issue for the states, not the federal government.Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who launched a presidential exploratory committee last week, has said he would support a federal law to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last week signed a state abortion ban that, if upheld by the courts, would ban the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women know they are pregnant. It will take effect only if the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives, upholds Florida\u2019s current 15-week ban that is part of an ongoing legal challenge. The Florida ban would be one of the toughest in the U.S. But DeSantis has not made clear his position on whether such restrictions should be imposed across the country.\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and one-time United Nations ambassador, has called abortion a \u201cpersonal issue\u201d that should be left to the states, though she has left open the possibility of a federal ban. Haley is scheduled to give a speech on abortion next week.Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, campaigning in Iowa, stopped short of saying whether he would support a federal six- or 15-week ban as president. \u201cObviously I would want to look at the bill,\u201d said Hutchinson, who as governor signed a law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. \n\nTrump\u2019s stance has provided an opening on the right for potential rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian with long-held anti-abortion views.Pence\u2019s advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, has pushed for Congress to pass legislation including a national abortion ban beginning around six weeks.___Associated Press writer Sara Burnett in Chicago contributed to this report.___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEG KINNARD\n\n\n                Kinnard covers national politics for The Associated Press.
