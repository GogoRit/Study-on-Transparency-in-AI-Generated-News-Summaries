The law has been on hold since October when a Hamilton County Court ruled the law's language was too vague. Legislators considered passing a bill to clarify that language and to specifically write into law when doctors could still perform abortions even after fetal cardiac electrical activity is detected.Huffman said don\u2019t expect a bill to clarify that language by the end of this year.\u201cI think there are just too many moving parts, too many different opinions as to what that would look like,\" Huffman said.Huffman said lawmakers had hoped the clarifying language would have been part of a larger bill that would also contain income tax credits for Ohioans who choose to adopt a child.Meanwhile, two groups are in the beginning stages of crafting proposed constitutional amendments to allow voters to guarantee abortion rights in Ohio\u2019s constitution.Republicans plan to bring up the issue of abortion next year in the new General Assembly, which will retain a GOP supermajority in both chambers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nGovernment/Politics\nOhio Statehouse NewsAbortionabortion ban\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJo Ingles\n\n\n                \n                    Contact Jo Ingles at jingles@statehousenews.org.\n                \n            \n\n\n                        See stories by Jo Ingles\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment/Politics\n\n\nOhio\u2019s Republican U.S. Senate race, contested statehouse races on Tuesday\u2019s primary ballot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment/Politics\n\n\nTrans advocates still against Ohio's draft rules on youth transition treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment/Politics\n\n\nFinal weekend of Republican U.S. Senate race in Ohio is busy, bitter and brought out big bucks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment/Politics\n\n\nRepublican war for control of Ohio Statehouse bringing in money, interest in primary races\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment/Politics\n\n\nFormer Gov.
