Russo, is over a Louisiana law that requires any physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, which critics say would severely limit access to those services. Opponents of the law warn that it would leave only one physician providing abortions in the entire state.\nA ruling that allows the Louisiana law to stand could potentially allow other states to impose stricter abortion regulations.\n  People rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court as it hears oral arguments in June Medical Services v. Russo on 3/4/20Photo: Robin Bravender\nThe court\u2019s four liberal justices \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 all questioned the need for Louisiana\u2019s requirement that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortion is performed.\n\u201cWhat sense does the 30-mile limit make?\u201d Ginsburg asked Elizabeth Murrill, Louisiana\u2019s solicitor general who defended the state\u2019s law.\nMurrill said the limit is \u201cconsistent with our regulatory structure\u201d and that there was evidence of women who did require transfers to hospitals after abortion procedures.\nSotomayor also questioned the need for the 30-mile limit, arguing that, if doctors are credentialed somewhere outside those bounds, \u201cthey have the skill level.\u201d\nKagan said that an abortion provider in Louisiana that served over 3,000 patients annually for 23 years had only ever transferred four patients to a hospital. The justices suggested that most women experience no complications after abortions and that those that did would likely seek medical care later from their homes. Ginsburg called first-trimester abortions among the safest medical procedures, \u201cfar safer than childbirth.\u201d\nGiven that Louisiana\u2019s former law required abortion providers to have admitting privileges or a written transfer agreement with a hospital, \u201cit\u2019s a little hard to see how this improves anything,\u201d Breyer said.\nHe stressed that the justices weren\u2019t likely to settle the complex case during oral arguments. He also pointed to the contentious nature of the issues at stake.\nIn the country, \u201cpeople have very strong feelings and a lot of people morally think it\u2019s wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong,\u201d Breyer said.\nThe Supreme Court has tilted ideologically in recent years after President Donald Trump\u2019s appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was often a swing vote and who sided with the court\u2019s liberal wing in the Texas abortion case.\nAbortion foes are hoping that Kavanaugh\u2019s presence on the bench will push the court to uphold the Louisiana law and set a new standard for how far states can go in imposing abortion restrictions.\nLast year, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to temporarily block the Louisiana law from taking effect. Four conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh \u2014 said they would have denied the request to stay the law.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts could represent the pivotal vote in the case. He joined the conservative wing in their 2016\u00a0dissent\u00a0in the Texas case, arguing that the Texas law should have been upheld. Roberts joined the liberals, however, in the\u00a0decision\u00a0last year to block the law.\nJulie Rikelman, the attorney representing opponents of Louisiana\u2019s law, told the justices Wednesday that \u201cthis case is about respect for the court\u2019s precedent,\u201d urging the court to reject the law on the same grounds that it did in the Texas case.\nRoberts asked Wednesday how the issues in Louisiana compare with the Texas case,\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt.\nKavanaugh questioned whether critics of the Louisiana law would argue that \u201cadmitting privileges laws are always unconstitutional,\u201d or whether the facts should be considered state-by-state.\nTwo conservative justices, Gorsuch and Thomas, did not ask questions during the arguments.\nAlito questioned whether abortion providers challenging the law have the legal \u201cstanding\u201d to sue. He suggested that the providers may not be allowed to sue on behalf of their patients if their interests are at odds.\n\u201cYou think that if the plaintiff actually has interests that are directly contrary to those of the \u2014 those individuals on whose behalf the plaintiff is claiming to sue, nevertheless that plaintiff can have standing?\u201d Alito said.\nJeffrey Wall, a Justice Department attorney representing the Trump administration, argued that providers and patients can indeed have conflicting interests. \u201cTheir interests are not necessarily aligned,\u201d Wall said. \u201cOne is the interest of for-profit providers and not being regulated in particular ways. The other is the interest of women in their own health and safety.\u201d\nThe Trump administration is supporting Louisiana in the case.\nThe court is expected to issue an opinion before its term ends this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLiberal Supreme Court justices challenge abortion restrictions in high-stakes case\nby Robin Bravender, Wisconsin Examiner March 4, 2020\nLiberal Supreme Court justices challenge abortion restrictions in high-stakes case\nby Robin Bravender, Wisconsin Examiner March 4, 2020\n \n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The liberal wing of the U.S. Supreme Court appeared highly skeptical of a Louisiana law that restricts abortion access as the justices heard oral arguments Wednesday in a high-stakes case that could open the door for additional abortion limitations around the country.\nBut the court\u2019s conservative majority \u2014 which is likely to determine the outcome of the case \u2014 was less clear during oral arguments about how they\u2019re likely to rule when the court issues its opinion later this year.\nThe case,\u00a0June Medical Services LLC v.
