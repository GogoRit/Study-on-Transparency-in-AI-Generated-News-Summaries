Offer it up for those unborn babies,\u201d she said.\nThe Catholic University of America is a top-tier sponsor of the March for Life. Classes are cancelled during march hours because so many students attend. Students volunteer the night before at the National Mass and Vigil for Life in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, and the University traditionally hosts out-of-town participants. This year, that hospitality was suspended due to COVID-related precautions.\u00a0\nThe University also sponsored the Archdiocese of Washington\u2019s popular Mass and Youth Rally for Life, which was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew this year, scaled down, but back in person and broadcast virtually.\nThe University\u2019s new video spots were shown on jumbotrons during the march and shared on social media. The taglines include, \u201cThe Catholic University of America \u2013 where pro-life leaders are made\u201d and \u201cEducating leaders of today for the generations of tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0\n\nElena Buono, Catholic University freshman\n\nKelsey Nowack, a senior from Wisconsin helped to carry the \u201c100% pro-life\u201d banner.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of our university\u2019s commitment to the pro-life cause, supporting all people from conception until natural death,\u201d she said.\nAs part of their commitment to life, students brought hygiene packs with them to distribute to people experiencing homelessness.\nThe March for Life \u201chas always been one of the cornerstone events of the University. Part of the mission of the University is engaging students in dialogue about what it means to be pro-life throughout the year,\u201d said Amanda Schleimer, associate campus minister for women\u2019s ministry and pro-life hospitality.\nFather Jude DeAngelo, OFM Conv., the university chaplain and director of campus ministry, said that the turnout in the face of COVID and frigid temperatures shows there is \u201ca real sea change in our country and young people today are really pro-life.\u201d\nAt a Cardinals for Life rally the night before the march, University President John Garvey called for continued dedication if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade - the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide \u2013 later this year.\nA decision to offer greater protection to unborn children \u201cwill be a step in the direction of justice for the unborn. There will be victory in that. But we will still have work to do,\u201d he said. Advocacy will move from the high Court to 50 state legislatures.\nHe drew a parallel to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s final speech, given just after the Civil War ended. Lincoln called for reconstruction of the South \u201cwith malice toward none; with charity for all.\u201d\nThe most difficult task will remain persuading individuals that unborn babies have a right to life, President Garvey said.\n\u201cPatience and dialogue are key. But our words will mean little if our actions don\u2019t reflect a deeper commitment to supporting life in the womb. That means listening to what mothers and babies need, especially those in difficult circumstances. It requires putting more, not fewer, resources at their disposal.\u201d\nIn a virtual presentation to the students, Los Angeles Auxiliary Bishop Robert Barron \u2013 a best-selling writer and evangelist \u2013 emphasized that moral truths about human dignity aren\u2019t matters of personal opinion, but are as irrefutable as the principles of mathematics. He urged students to engage pro-choice acquaintances by first finding common ground on moral issues such as racism, then extending the idea of moral truth to unborn children.\nThe fact that evils such as Jim Crow plunged from mainstream practices to \u201clunatic notions\u201d shows that advocacy can make a difference, he said.\n\u201cCultures can change,\u201d Bishop Barron said. \u201cPlease God, in 50 years or 100 years, people will say that only a mad person would accept the legitimacy of abortion. Perhaps that day is coming even sooner than some of us had hoped for.\u201d\n\nNick Swanson, a senior from Minnesota and president of Cardinals for Life, organized the rally.\n\u201cWe march to remember the one-third of our generation that is missing and to be a voice for all those unborn children who cannot speak for themselves,\u201d he told the assembled students.\nParticipating in March for Life events \u201cis one of the hallmarks of being a student at the Catholic University of America,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cWe are marching not just against abortion but for a totally different vision of life, one that sees children not as burdens but as unrepeatable gifts of God\u2019s love. I will take that with me, and so many students will take that with them when we graduate.\u201d\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll University News\n\n\n\nSpotlight Stories\n\n\n2024\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\nView Entire News Archive\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Information\nApply Online\nVisit Campus\nContact Admission\n\n\n\n\nShare this: \n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll University News\n\n\n\nSpotlight Stories\n\n\n2024\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2022\n\n\nView Entire News Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Information\nApply Online\nVisit Campus\nContact Admission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Catholic University of America\n\n 620 Michigan Ave., N.E.
