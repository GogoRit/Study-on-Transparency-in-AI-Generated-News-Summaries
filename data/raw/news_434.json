Given that these represent around 98% of the 1,000 or so legal terminations that take place annually in Poland, the ruling would in effect introduce a near total ban on abortion.\nIn response, tens of thousands of protesters \u2013 the majority of them women \u2013 have taken to the streets of towns and cities around the country, in defiance of coronavirus restrictions strictly limiting the size of gatherings.\n\nConstitutional court ends almost all legal abortion in Poland\n\nTheir anger has been directed not mainly towards the Constitutional Tribunal itself, but rather the ruling national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which is seen as being behind the ruling.\nThe country\u2019s influential Catholic church has also been a target, with some protesters disrupting Sunday Masses yesterday and others vandalising church buildings.\nBelow we present images from yesterday\u2019s protests in the city of Gda\u0144sk on Poland\u2019s northern Baltic coast, taken by Italian photographer Luca Aliano.\n\n\u201cTo jest wojna\u201d (\u201cThis is war\u201d) has become one of the main slogans of the protesters.\nThere has been a heavy police presence at the protests. On Thursday evening, officers protecting the house of PiS chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski clashed with demonstrators. Police deployed tear gas against the crowd, after some protesters threw objects at them.\nThe image shows PiS leader Kaczy\u0144ski, and the words translate roughly as \u201cGiving birth is none of your business\u201d.\n\n\u201cKraj\u201d (pronounced like the English word \u201ccry\u201d) means \u201ccountry\u201d in Polish.\n\n\u201cWypierdala\u0107\u201d (\u201cFuck off\u201d) has become another slogan of the protests.\n\u201cPiek\u0142o kobiet\u201d (\u201cWomen\u2019s hell\u201d) is a longstanding slogan used by protesters for women\u2019s rights.\nThe demonstrations over abortion have coincided with anti-lockdown protests, especially from businesses \u2013 such as restaurants and gyms \u2013 that have been forced to close. The sign at the front complains of 76,000 premises, which provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, having to shut down.\n\nA protest by the hospitality industry against lockdown.\n\u00a0\nTourism businesses have also suffered during the pandemic and associated lockdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuca Aliano\u00a0is an Italian photographer based in Gda\u0144sk, where he tells stories through his 35mm lens. You can find him on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLocal issues, not ideological quarrels\u201d: an interview with PiS\u2019s candidate for\u00a0Warsaw\u00a0mayor\n\nInsights, PoliticsAlicja Ptak\nWe speak with Tobiasz Boche\u0144ski about his vision for the capital.\n\n\n\n\nHow deep is the crisis in Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party?\n\nInsights, PoliticsAleks Szczerbiak\nPiS is facing its most serious crisis for many years and may not survive in its current form\n\n\n\n\nPresidential visit highlights failings and opportunities in Poland\u2019s relations with Africa\n\nBusiness, Insights, PoliticsJacek P\u0142aza\nPoland lacks a coherent and consistent strategy.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INSIGHTSYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany, France and Poland pledge to buy weapons for Ukraine using frozen Russian assets\n\nMar 15, 2024 | Business, Hot news, News, Politics\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary and for as long as it is necessary to prevent Russia from winning the war with Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a secular state\u201d: Polish government ends subsidies for religious publications\n\nMar 15, 2024 | Culture, Hot news, News, Politics\u201cThe mission of the state is not to spread faith and salvation,\u201d says the culture minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrink drivers to have cars confiscated in Poland as new law enters force\n\nMar 15, 2024 | Hot news, News, SocietyThe first drink driver eligible for confiscation under the new law was caught just two hours after it came into force.\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT NEWS\nWe can only do this thanks to your support!We are an independent, nonprofit media outlet, funded through the support of our readers.\nIf you appreciate the work we do, please consider helping us to continue and expand it.\nSUPPORT US!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFUNDACJA NOTES FROM POLAND\nChocimska 7 / 830-057 Krak\u00f3w, PolandNIP: 677 243 97 04KRS: 0000758506\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nTopics \nNEWS\nINSIGHTS\nPOLITICS\nSOCIETY\nCULTURE\nBUSINESS\nEDITOR\u2019S PICK\nREADER\u2019S CHOICE\nPO POLSKU\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Notes From Poland | Design jurko studio | Code by 2sides.pl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPaulina Olszanka\nSolutions journalism project manager\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Paulina\u00a0 is a journalist and writer with a background in anthropology, social theory & political economy.
