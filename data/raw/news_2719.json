However, he also noted that taking such a drug should be avoided.He said, \u201cAlthough the Church has been clear that one may receive such drugs, it is also the case that we have a duty to protest the disturbing fact that aborted materials are still being used in many sectors of biomedical research.\u201cMany people and many Catholics are surprised to learn about the widespread and continuing use of these cells in biomedicine and research.\u201dFather Pacholczyk, director of education for The National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, stressed that Catholics must vigorously call for drugs developed and tested without cells or tissue from aborted babies.\u201cThe distinction exists between testing and manufacturing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for both of these aspects of drug or vaccine development, the use of cell lines from abortions should be avoided as much as possible.\u201dScientists worldwide accelerated research and production of new therapeutic drugs in vaccines to fight COVID-19 since the virus that causes it began its deadly sweep of the planet at the end of 2019.The Food and Drug Administration reported that more than 550 COVID-19 drug development programs were underway as of Oct. 12. Meanwhile, more than 350 drug trials were under review by the FDA.The agency had also authorized five drugs for \u201cemergency use,\u201d but REGN-COV2 was not yet one of them. Its manufacturer, Regeneron, filed an emergency use authorization request with the FDA on Oct. 7, the same day Trump made his video testimonial about the drug.After the video, media attention over REGN-COV2 vaulted over other similar drugs under development. It thus became public knowledge that the drug\u2019s history has a connection to HEK293T. This cell line\u2019s origins reach back nearly 50 years ago from kidney cells taken in a Dutch laboratory from an aborted female fetus. The parents\u2019 identities and the reason for abortion are unknown.\u201cHEK293T cells were used to create a \u2018pretend virus\u2019 to test our antibodies against,\u201d said Alexandra Bowie, spokeswoman for Regeneron. \u201cHEK293T is a doubly-transformed cell line, and we would not classify it as \u2018tissue.\u2019\u201dBowie told The Tablet on Oct. 12 that HEK293s \u201care considered \u2018immortalized\u2019 cells (not stem cells) and are a common and widespread tool in research labs.\u201d\u201cHEK293T wasn\u2019t used in any other way,\u201d Bowie added, \u201cand fetal tissue was not used in this research. We did not use human stem cells or human embryonic stem cells in the development of REGN-COV2.\u201dRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is based in Tarrytown, Westchester County, New York. Bowie said its scientists \u201chave been working tirelessly for nearly the whole year to advance REGN-COV2 in record time for patients impacted by COVID-19.\u201d\u201cBased on promising early data,\u201d she added, \u201cwe hope this investigational drug will be deemed safe and effective and ultimately help improve human health.\u201dFather Pacholczyk explained how Catholics could receive the drug, even though testing was conducted with HEK293T.Quoting from the 2008 Vatican instruction \u201cDignitas Personae (n. 35),\u201d Father Pacholczyk said, \u201cgrave reasons may be morally proportionate to justify\u2019 the use of these products, especially in the absence of alternatives.\u201c\u2018Grave reasons\u2019 would, of course, include danger to one\u2019s health, allowing us to receive medicines or vaccines \u2018developed using cell lines of illicit origin.\u2019\u201d\u201cThis is permissible,\u201d Father Pacholczyk said, \u201cbecause, in part, one would not be cooperating with the abortion that happened many decades earlier, and one did not have any role in making the decision to use the cell line by the pharmaceutical company.\u201dBut Father Pacholczyk also noted the same Vatican document declares that Catholics now live \u2018in the context of the urgent need to mobilize consciences in favor of life.\u2019\u201d\u201cAlternatives to the use of these cells is critical,\u201d he said, \u201cand part of the duty of the moment is to increase awareness about the problem.\u201dTo that end, bishops in the U.S. joined pro-life medical professionals in April to draft a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of \u201cethically\u201d produced drugs to fight COVID-19.Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City penned the first signature. He chairs the Committee on Pro-Life Activities for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\u201cWe are aware,\u201d the letter reads, \u201cthat among the dozens of vaccines currently in development, some are being produced using old cell lines that are created from the cells of aborted babies.\u201cFortunately, there is no need to use ethically problematic cell lines to produce a COVID vaccine or any vaccine,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cOther cell lines or processes that do not involve cells from abortions are available and are regularly being used to produce other vaccines.\u201dThe USCCB\u2019s pro-life committee has praised the Trump administration for creating a fetal tissue ethics review board within the National Institutes of Health. Archbishop Naumann applauded the administration in August after the review board recommended against funding for some projects involving fetal tissue research.Last week, however, it was unclear what Trump knew about how HEK293T was used to test the drug he called \u201ca cure.\u201d\u201cSome people don\u2019t know how to define therapeutic,\u201d he said. \u201cI view it differently; it\u2019s a cure.\u201cI heard about this drug. I said, \u2018Let me take it.\u2019 It was my suggestion. I said, \u2018Let me take it,\u2019 and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible.\u201dTrump said he also tried the antiviral drug Remdesivir, which is approved for emergency use by the FDA, although supplies were limited in mid-October because of testing.Medical experts have said it was premature for Trump to say the drug cured him, noting that Remdesivir could\u2019ve played a role. They also noted Trump took the steroid dexamethasone to fight inflammation in his lungs.The president, however, believed REGN-COV2 did the trick. He pledged to win approval for the drug and make it free for everyone, although he provided only a few details about how that would get done.\u201cI want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to get you the drug. It\u2019s going to be free. We\u2019re going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you\u2019ll see some amazing things happen.\u201dThe federal government also recognized the drug\u2019s potential in July when it awarded Regeneron $450 million to develop REGN-COV2 as part of \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d \u2014 the public-private partnership launched to fast-track the development of vaccines and therapeutics to fight COVID-19. The money came from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.Regeneron officials said if REGN-COV2 is OK\u2019d for emergency use authorization (EUA), \u201cthe government has committed to making these doses available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for its distribution.\u201dThe officials made that comment in the company\u2019s Oct. 7 EUA request. The document also stated that it had 50,000 doses available.\u201cAnd,\u201d the officials added, \u201cWe expect to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total within the next few months.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic bioethicists express concern about attempts to find a COVID-19 vaccine or therapeutics using cell lines created from fetuses aborted nearly five decades ago.
