[JAKUB KACZMARCZYK/EPA/EFE] \nEuractiv is part of the Trust Project >>>  \n\n\n\nPrint Email   Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram  \n\nPolish lawmakers are to debate a proposal to tighten already restrictive abortion rules on Wednesday (15 April), while rights activists protested on social media as coronavirus limits public gatherings.\nAbortion rights are a contentious issue in Poland, one of Europe\u2019s most devout nations, with the nationalist ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party keen to burnish its conservative credentials despite considerable public opposition to further restrictions.\nProposed as a citizens\u2019 initiative, the draft legislation would ban abortion if prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the foetus, one of the few instances in which the procedure is allowed in Poland.\nOthers are incest, rape and risks to maternal health.\nPiS, a party that campaigns on introducing more religious values into public life, has signalled some reluctance to back the bill in parliament, which it controls, ahead of a presidential election on 10 May.\nThe issue poses a dilemma for PiS, which had previously retreated from proposals to nearly ban abortion after a massive public outcry, because it could galvanise voters on either side of the divide.\nCampaigners also say it would face renewed criticism if it pushed through legislation when restrictions on public life because of the coronavirus pandemic prohibit large-scale demonstrations.\n\n\nFour years ago thousands of people marched the streets in Poland protesting against a total abortion ban. Now, when it\u2019s basically illegal to leave your house, the government is trying to pass the bill again.\n\u2014 Kasia Babis (@kasiababis) April 8, 2020\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult subject, and the timing is unfavourable,\u201d said Tadeusz Cymanski, a senior PiS lawmaker.\nDeputies are due to debate the issue late on Wednesday.\nTerminations abroad \nUnderscoring deep-seated support for further restrictions on the right in Poland, President Andrzej Duda told a Catholic news outlet Niedziela that he would sign further curbs into law.\n\u201cI believe that killing disabled children is simply murder,\u201d Duda, a PiS ally, was quoted as saying.\nOpinion polls show Duda wining the May 10 election, although the ballot is clouded in uncertainty because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPiS is seeking to hold the ballot via post rather than polling booths but a legislative proposal on the issue might clear parliament only days before the election date, leaving little time to organise.\nThe opposition has said the vote should be postponed because the election campaign has been curtailed by the pandemic, accusing Duda of taking advantage of his position to continue campaigning.\nRights activists in Poland say the pandemic has also curbed women\u2019s access to abortion abroad because of travel restrictions throughout Europe.\nMany women terminate pregnancies in Germany, Slovakia and further away, in cases when it would be illegal in Poland or when hospitals refuse to perform an abortion that would technically be allowed under Polish rules.\nAndrzej Rychard, a sociologist, said a vote for new abortion rules would likely undermine unity within PiS and its conservative ruling alliance, already strained by internal debates over whether the presidential vote should be delayed.\n\u201cIt would remind people that they can mobilise and protest,\u201d Rychard said. \u201cAnd that could shake up the ruling alliance.\u201d\nRead more with Euractiv\n\nRomanian EPP avoids Orban expulsion letter fearing border backlashRomania\u2019s National Liberal Party (PNL) has not joined a call of 13 centre-right leaders to expel Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party from the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) fearing a backlash at the Romanian-Hungarian border, EURACTIV.com has learnt. \n\n\n\nSubscribe to our EU 2024 Elections newsletter\n\n\nEmail Address *\n\nPolitics\n                            Newsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrint Email   Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram  \n\n\nTopics\u00a0\u00a0\n abortions Andrzej Duda Catholic church coronavirus Elections Health PiS Poland Polish election Politics \n \n\n\n\nAdvertisementSupportersAdvertisement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Euractiv\n\nAbout\nMediahuis\nPress Releases\nSubscribe to The Brief\nSubmit an Opinion\nNewsletters\n\nCommunication Services\n\nCommunication Services at a glance\nAdvertising at Euractiv\nEuractiv Events\nEuractiv Membership\nMultimedia at Euractiv\nEuractiv European Public Projects\nYellow Academy\nEuractiv Intelligence\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEURACTIV Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9 1999 - 2024 |     Efficacit\u00e9 et Transparence des Acteurs Europ\u00e9ens.
