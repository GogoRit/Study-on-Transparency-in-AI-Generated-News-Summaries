Not sure what we\u2019re talking about exactly? Students for Life of America (SFLA) President Kristan Hawkins recently shared an example of such an encounter; watch her Instagram Live video HERE or continue reading below for our brief summary:\nIn the middle of a full day, Hawkins recently met up with a\u00a0group that said they were conservatives at Yale University who had reached out to her, asking if they could present her with an award and have her on their podcast. As Hawkins is always happy to encourage\u00a0and meet with\u00a0the Pro-Life Generation and was conveniently already at\u00a0Yale to speak at a pro-life conference, she agreed \u2014 but her experience with the group\u00a0raised several red flags.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough a documentary team had been following Hawkins around for several days, the alleged\u00a0Yale group said no to any filming of the podcast or presentation of the award; an interesting request. However, the Yale group didn\u2019t have any problem with Hawkins bringing her bodyguards or our\u00a0SFLA Regional Coordinator\u00a0into the room,\u00a0giving\u00a0her\u00a0witnesses to the insanity of what followed once cameras turned on.\u00a0\nBefore\u00a0the podcast recording commenced, the group informed Hawkins that they were a SFLA-affiliated group, which seemed surprising to Hawkins and turned out to be false when she researched it after the bizarre interview. When the interview began, the students asked ever-more-odd questions\u00a0including several about\u00a0creating a movie about the Holocaust but just focusing on aborted infants and teen pregnancy.\u00a0The questions were raised in such an odd and insensitive way that it became obvious the young women had never been through SFLA apologetics training.\n\n\nAfter the interview concluded, Hawkins recorded an Instagram Live video explaining, \u201cI have a feeling it was a spoof because\u2026I\u2019ve never met a Students for Life of America group that would ask questions like that or even dare to talk about the Holocaust in that way.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter the podcast interview and being presented with a paper mache award (perhaps a homage to Michael Scott leaving the Office?), Hawkins and our team started looking into the group that not only featured SFLA and Yale\u2019s logos on a website but didn\u2019t tell all the facts about the people involved. (Turns out, one of those who helped set this up used a fake name and had\u00a0worked on the Hillary Clinton campaign and is interning on\u00a0Late Night with Seth Meyers.)\n\n\nThe SFLA General Counsel is currently looking into this matter as groups that are not affiliated with SFLA have no right to use SFLA logo or materials; stay tuned to the SFLA blog for updates on this story. We have also notified Yale of the use of their logo on the women\u2019s website.\u00a0\nBottomline: In this new Post-Roe era, watching out for comedy\u00a0shows masquerading as real news teams or podcasts is now part of the\u00a0\u201ccost of doing business,\u201d but we are willing to take the chance as we are unafraid to discuss the human rights issue of our day. In fact, we are working toward having one million conversations with Millennials and Gen Z this year \u2014 but we probably won\u2019t count this one!\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Wilberforce Fellow Recruits 120 New Group Members\n\n Post Views: 1,161\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
