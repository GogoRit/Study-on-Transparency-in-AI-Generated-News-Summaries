She suggests that no one at the Democratic National Convention uttered the word \u201cabortion\u201d because the party is trying to avoid the topic.\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats don\u2019t focus on the word \u201cabortion.\u201d While welcoming a diversity of views on the topic, the one thing they agree on is that the decision should be between a woman and her doctor. In other words, Democrats are \u201cpro-choice\u201d rather than \u201cpro-abortion.\u201d The section of the party\u2019s platform that addresses this issue is titled, Securing Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice. Notice that the word \u201cabortion\u201d isn\u2019t included. It comes up only once in the text:\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion\u2026Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights\u2026We believe that a person\u2019s health should always come first. Democrats will protect the rights of all people to make personal health care decisions.\nThere are a few things that DeSanctis didn\u2019t want to talk about. First of all, she skipped over some of the controversy surrounding Abby Johnson, the anti-legal abortion activist who spoke at the RNC. DeSanctis wrote that most reports about Johnson\u2019s speech at the RNC \u201cdredged up her controversial comments on other subjects.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement. Johnson\u2019s suggestion that married women should lose their right to vote is pretty relevant. Back in May, she tweeted support for \u201chousehold voting,\u201d adding that \u201ca married couple would have to decide on one vote.\u201d She went on to say that \u201cin a Godly household, the husband would get the final say.\u201d\nIn her article, DeSanctis writes: \u201cEvery abortion ends the life of a distinct, living human being.\u201d But beyond a simple declarative statement like that, she doesn\u2019t want to talk about difficult questions, such as: If abortion involves killing a baby, why would anyone agree to it being legal in the case of rape or incest? Or: Aren\u2019t women who get abortions guilty, at minimum, of being accessories to murder? If so, why shouldn\u2019t they be prosecuted? To address those questions means getting into areas conservatives want to avoid because it exposes the extremism of their position.\nFor most people, however, abortion is much more complex. In recognizing that, the job of Democrats becomes more difficult, as Barack Obama warned us back when he was still a U.S. Senator.\nThe bottom line is that our job is harder than the conservatives\u2019 job. \u00a0After all, it\u2019s easy to articulate a belligerent foreign policy based solely on unilateral military action, a policy that sounds tough and acts dumb; it\u2019s harder to craft a foreign policy that\u2019s tough and smart. \u00a0It\u2019s easy to dismantle government safety nets; it\u2019s harder to transform those safety nets so that they work for people and can be paid for. \u00a0It\u2019s easy to embrace a theological absolutism; it\u2019s harder to find the right balance between the legitimate role of faith in our lives and the demands of our civic religion. \u00a0But that\u2019s our job. \u00a0And I firmly believe that whenever we exaggerate or demonize, or oversimplify or overstate our case, we lose. \u00a0Whenever we dumb down the political debate, we lose.\nAbortion is one of those topics where the job of Democrats is harder because it involves recognizing that human experience doesn\u2019t tend to fit neatly into ideological boxes.\nI\u2019ll end with a personal story that demonstrates the complexity of this issue. I once knew a 16-year-old who learned she was pregnant while trying to finish high school and raise her 18 month-old son. She didn\u2019t want to have an abortion so she set up an appointment with a local adoption agency. When I asked her how it went, her exact words were: \u201cI have no choice. I have to have an abortion.\u201d That\u2019s because she had already named the man who got her pregnant and he wouldn\u2019t agree to an adoption, cutting off that avenue for her.\nThat is precisely why Democrats are pro-choice. It means doing everything necessary to ensure that women have alternatives and the right to decide what to do with their own bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n \n\nTagged: abortion,\u00a0pro-choice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNancy LeTourneau\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Nancy on Twitter @Smartypants60. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore by Nancy LeTourneau\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSupport Washington Monthly\n\nDonate Now!\n\n\n\n\nNewsletterGet a weekly dose of our best stories in your inbox.\nEmail (required) *Select list(s) to subscribe to Yes, I would like to receive emails from Washington Monthly.
