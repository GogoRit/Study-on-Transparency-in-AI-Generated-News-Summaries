The second episode of this season of Slow Burn tracks the Willkes\u2019 rise and explores the influence of the handbook and the pamphlets that followed. Below, we\u2019ve put together a timeline of the Willkes\u2019 work. Scroll to see what the Handbook on Abortion and the pamphlet \u201cLife or Death\u201d contained, and how they evolved over time.\nListen to the full episode here:\n\n\n\n\nMay 1971: Jack and Barbara Willke, a Catholic couple who worked primarily as sex educators, publish the Handbook on Abortion. The first edition is 141 pages long and contains \u201c42 scientific references.\u201d The back of the book is filled with advertisements for the Willkes\u2019 other educational resources: pro-life books, cassettes, posters, and brochures marketed to parents, teachers, and children. The cover of the book features a photograph of their daughter Marie, who convinced them to write the Handbook. The first print run of 5,000 copies sells out within a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cover of the Handbook on Abortion, featuring a photo of Marie Willke, and the back cover, featuring Jack and Barbara Willke.\nImages from the Handbook on Abortion, 1971 edition\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 1972: As the Willkes begin to understand the power of photographs of aborted fetuses, they print a brochure that\u2019s easier to pass out than the Handbook. \u201cLife or Death\u201d is primarily distributed in states that are voting on abortion referendums. One of those states is Michigan, which votes down an effort to liberalize abortion laws in November 1972. Pro-life groups in Michigan order hundreds of thousands of copies of this brochure to pass out in the last weeks of the election\u2014the polling suggests that support for liberalizing abortion dropped by almost twenty points in that same time period. Michigan voters ultimately defeat the effort to liberalize its abortion law.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you can scroll through the text and images of the full pamphlet, \u201cLife or Death.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1973: The Supreme Court affirms the right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, and the Handbook\u2019s sales skyrocket. Two months later, Jack Willke claims the court is denying personhood to fetuses. He compares the Roe decision to the ruling in 1857\u2019s Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which the Supreme Court said that enslaved people were not U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese photos from the Handbook on Abortion show four different methods of abortion: By suction, by scraping, a hysterectomy, and a saline abortion.\nImages from the Handbook on Abortion, 1971 edition\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n1974: The first translations of the Handbook on Abortion are published, in Spanish, French, and Malay. By 1985, there are 10 total translations in print, including Italian, Chinese, and Portuguese.\nJune 1975: The Willkes publish a revised version of the Handbook, which extends to 208 pages. In 1979, they revise the Handbook once more, expanding it to a final 210 pages. These later editions also include additional pages of images of abortions. By 1985, the Handbook on Abortion has sold more than one million copies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top photo is known as Tiny Feet. The lower photo is known as Teardrop. \nImages from the Handbook on Abortion, 1979 edition.\n\n\n1985: The Willkes publish the Handbook\u2019s successor: Abortion: Questions & Answers. More than double the original Handbook\u2019s length at 342 pages, it includes both new references to scientific papers, and information that had previously been in the original Handbook.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              History\n            \n\n\n              Photography\n            \n\n\n              Religion\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
