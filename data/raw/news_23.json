Thompson, who issued a preliminary injunction against prosecutions of abortion providers under emergency health orders,\u00a0wrote that state officials had failed to clarify whether a March order limiting elective and unnecessary medical procedures amid the COVID-19 outbreak would ban abortion proceedings.\u00a0\u201cFor at least some women, a mandatory postponement until April 30 would operate as a prohibition of abortion, entirely nullifying their right to terminate their pregnancies, or would impose a substantial burden on their ability to access an abortion,\u201d Thompson wrote.\u00a0Attorneys for the state\u2019s abortion clinics hailed Thompson\u2019s ruling.\u00a0\u201cThis decision ensures that Alabamians can continue to access the abortions they need to protect their health during this crisis,\u201d Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, which represented the clinics, said in a statement. \u201cPreventing someone from getting an abortion doesn\u2019t do anything to stop the COVID-19 virus, it just takes the decision whether to have a child out of their hands.\u201dA message seeking comment was left with Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall\u2019s office on Monday morning.The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) on March 20 limited elective medical procedures. The goal was to give health care facilities space and supplies needed to treat coronavirus cases. ADPH at first signaled the order did not apply to abortions, the vast majority of which take place outside hospitals.\u00a0But a week later, an amended order banned procedures not necessary to treat an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d Attorneys for the state\u2019s three abortion clinics wrote that Marshall \u2014 who supported an attempt by Texas to stop abortions in that state during the outbreak \u2014 failed to provide clear guidance on whether they could face prosecution under the order.\u00a0The clinics said the uncertainty led patients to cancel of abortion procedures. Attorneys for the state argued the state of emergency declared by Gov. Ivey in March made the ban proper.\u00a0Thompson issued a temporary restraining order against criminal punishment of abortion providers on March 30. In his Sunday opinion, the judge described a hokey-pokey dance by state officials in applying the order to abortion clinics.\u00a0Thompson wrote that State Health Officer Scott Harris signaled in a declaration filed on April 1 that he would defer to the judgment of doctors considering \u201chis or her patient\u2019s individual circumstances.\u201d The judge wrote that the state appeared to confirm this position at an April 3 hearing, and suggested providers would be able to determine if abortion met one of the exceptions in the emergency order.\u00a0But on April 5, Thompson wrote, state attorneys wrote that a provider\u2019s judgment \u201cis not conclusive proof\u201d that an abortion procedure met the exceptions and that \u201cthe risk to a patient\u2019s health be sufficiently serious\u201d to allow an abortion to take place.\u00a0\u201cThese medical restrictions are susceptible to multiple readings,\u201d Thompson wrote. \u201cOver the course of this litigation, the defendants themselves have put forth several divergent interpretations of the medical restrictions, each with dramatically different implications for the plaintiffs.\u201dThe judge rejected arguments that allowing abortions to continue to tax medical resources. Thompson noted the low rate of hospitalizations from abortions and wrote that the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in abortion procedures is low. Thompson also rejected the state\u2019s emergency powers arguments.\u00a0\u201cA fundamental right is at stake; that right, for some women, is subject to a possible permanent denial, not a mere delay or temporary denial; and, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s clear holdings on the right to an abortion, the State\u2019s asserted interests, even when viewed with a tremendous degree of deference, cannot support the accompanying deprivation of a Fourteenth Amendment right,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0Under Alabama law, a woman seeking an abortion must receive counseling aimed at discouraging the procedure and wait 48 hours. The woman must also go through an ultrasound and have the option of viewing it.\u00a0Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
