Wade, amounted to a challenge for the GOP front-runner, Donald Trump, who has been reluctant to endorse a federal abortion ban. The former president is addressing the evangelical assembly on Saturday night.\n\u201cWe must not rest and we must not relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in this country,\u201d Pence said. \u201cEvery Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion before 15 weeks as a minimum nationwide standard.\u201d\nPence was among a number of 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls \u2014 including Florida Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis\u00a0and Sen.\u00a0Tim Scott\u00a0of South Carolina \u2014 to speak Friday before a ballroom of about 500 attendees. All of the candidates emphasized their anti-abortion credentials while urging like-minded activists to stay on the political offensive, even as leading Democrats insist their party\u2019s defense of abortion rights will be a 2024 boon to them.\nDeSantis, who signed a law in Florida banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, touted the measure with a nod toward Trump\u2019s veiled criticism last month that it is \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d DeSantis told the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nDeSantis has been less clear on where he stands on a federal abortion ban.\nNot far from the conference site in Washington, President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0were rallying\u00a0Friday with abortion rights supporters to mark the anniversary of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0decision.\nWATCH: Biden and Harris hold event marking anniversary of Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling\nThat ruling, issued June 24, 2022, ended federal constitutional abortion protections and paved the way for\u00a0near-total bans\u00a0in some Republican-led states. Democrats have vowed to codify the right to an abortion in federal law, but don\u2019t have the votes in Congress to do so.\n\u201cSince that dark June day last year, each one of you has worked tirelessly to fight back,\u201d Biden told activists from reproductive rights groups. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d\nReferring to supporters of Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again movement, the president added, \u201cWhat\u2019s really remarkable is despite the will of the American people, MAGA Republicans made it clear that they won\u2019t stop with the Dobbs decision.\u201d\nAfter stronger-than-expected results in last year\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats believe issues surrounding abortion access can energize their base, attract moderates alienated by GOP hardliners and help the party hold the Senate, flip the House and reelect Biden\nEven Trump has suggested that increased abortion restrictions are a weakness for Republicans, despite his three Supreme Court nominees making up the majority of justices who voted to overturn Roe last year.\nHe posted on his social media site in January that the party\u2019s underwhelming midterm performance \u201cwasn\u2019t my fault\u201d and blamed \u201c\u2019the \u2019abortion issue,\u2019 poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother.\u201d\nYet the mood at Friday\u2019s Faith & Freedom Coalition session was jubilant, with attendees cheering every mention of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal. \u201cThank God almighty for the Dobbs decision,\u201d Scott told the crowd.\nREAD MORE: America\u2019s religious leaders sharply divided over abortion, a year after Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal\nRalph Reed, founder and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, said the conference\u2019s dates were set years ago, so the fact that it spans the Dobbs anniversary is a \u201cserendipitous coincidence.\u201d Still, he said the gathering is out to ensure top Republican candidates don\u2019t get complacent when it comes to opposing abortion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to do everything that we can, as an organization and as a pro-life and pro-family movement, to give our candidates a little bit of a testosterone booster shot and explain to them that they should not be on the defensive,\u201d Reed said in an interview before the conference began. \u201cThose who are afraid of it need to, candidly, grow a backbone.\u201d\nReed drew sustained cheers when he opened the gathering by saying that \u201cafter 50 years of prayer, and fasting and knocking on doors and electing candidates and registering voters and changing the culture of our country, Roe v Wade has been overturned.\u201d\nMichigan Sen. Gary Peters, head of the Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign arm, said this week that top Republican presidential candidates will back a nationwide ban to win support in their GOP primaries, then shift to a more moderate position for the general election.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to get away with that,\u201d Peters said.\nAmong GOP candidates, Pence has previously said he\u2019d support banning abortion nationally after just six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.\nHis declaration Friday that a ban at 15 weeks should be the \u201cminimum nationwide standard\u201d mirrors a call from the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. The organization has vowed not to support any White House candidate who doesn\u2019t support a 15-week federal ban at a minimum.\nWATCH: Sen. Lindsey Graham unveils national proposal banning abortion after 15 weeks\nScott also has praised South Carolina\u2019s six-week ban and backs a 15-week federal prohibition. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley supports a federal ban but hasn\u2019t said at what point in pregnancy she would seek to ban abortions.\nTrump has avoided specifying what national limits, if any, he would support on abortion.\nA deeply devout, evangelical Christian, Pence was greeted far more warmly at this year\u2019s Faith & Freedom Coalition conference than he was the last time he addressed the group in 2021. Then, he was booed by some and faced shouts of \u201ctraitor.\u201d That event, held in Florida, came months after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, when Pence defied Trump\u2019s unprecedented demands to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election.\nThe tamer reaction came after Reed warned Friday\u2019s audience about booing or verbally expressing disagreement with any presidential candidates: \u201cIf they\u2019re not where they need to be, then let\u2019s just love them and pray them right where they need to go.\u201d\nNot everyone heeded that warning. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has built his 2024 candidacy around criticizing Trump, drew boos when he said the former president is more interested in promoting himself than the country\u2019s interests.\nA woman near the stage bellowed \u201cWe love Trump\u201d and a few others tried to start chants of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d but Christie was able to finish his speech.\n\u201cYou can boo all you want but here\u2019s the thing, our faith teaches us that people have to take responsibility for what they do,\u201d said Christie, who is Catholic. \u201cPeople have to stand up and take accountability for what they do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Mike Pence, Republican presidential candidate and former vice president, addresses The Faith and Freedom Coalition's 2023 \"Road to Majority\" conference in Washington, D.C., June 23, 2023.
