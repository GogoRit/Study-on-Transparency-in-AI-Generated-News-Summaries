Another started mirroring the life-threatening symptoms that her baby was displaying while in the womb. An OB-GYN found herself secretly traveling out of state to abort her wanted pregnancy, marred by the diagnosis of a fatal fetal anomaly. All of the women were told they could not end their pregnancies in Texas, a state that has enacted some of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws. Now, they\u2019re asking a Texas court to put an emergency hold on some abortion restrictions, joining a lawsuit launched earlier this year by five other women who were denied abortions in the state, despite pregnancies they say endangered their health or lives.More than a dozen Texas women in total have joined the Center for Reproductive Rights\u2019 lawsuit against the state\u2019s law, which prohibits abortions unless a mother\u2019s life is at risk \u2014 an exception that is not clearly defined. Texas doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to $100,000, leaving many women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy. \n\n\u201cOur hope is that it will allow physicians at least a little more comfort when it comes to patients in obstetrical emergencies who really need an abortion where it\u2019s going to effect their health, fertility or life going forward,\u201d Molly Duane, the lead attorney on the case, told The Associated Press. \u201cAlmost all of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit tell similar stories about their doctors saying, if not for this law, I\u2019d give you an abortion right now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court extends block on Texas law that would allow police to arrest migrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina, Iowa, USC and Texas are the top seeds in the women\u2019s NCAA Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida reaches SEC final rallying from 18 down to beat Texas A&M 95-90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office, which is defending the state in the lawsuit, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Monday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit serves as a nationwide model for abortion rights advocates to challenge strict new abortion laws states that have rolled out since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Sixteen states, including Texas, do not allow abortions when a fatal fetal anomaly is detected while six do not allow exceptions for the mother\u2019s health, according to an analysis by KFF, a health research organization. fd52425b61c1466c9faa1686dcd88d9d\n\nDuane said the Center for Reproductive Rights is looking at filing similar lawsuits in other states, noting that they\u2019ve heard from women across the country. Roughly 25 Texas women have contacted the organization about their own experiences since the initial lawsuit was filed in March.The women who joined the lawsuit describe being elated about finding out they were pregnant before the experience turned catastrophic. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Bernardo and her husband spent years trying to conceive, even consulting fertility doctors, before finally become pregnant with a daughter, Emma, last July. Almost immediately, Bernardo was coughing so hard and often she would sometimes throw up. Fourteen weeks into the pregnancy, test results revealed her baby likely had Down Syndrome, so she consulted a specialist who gave her devastating news: Emma\u2019s heart was underdeveloped and she had a rare, deadly disorder called fetal anasarca, which causes fluid to build up in the body. \n\n\u201cHe handed me a tissue box,\u201d recalled Bernardo, who lives in Frisco, Texas. \u201cI thought maybe the worst thing he was going to tell us was that she\u2019s going to have Down Syndrome. Instead, he said, \u2018I can tell you right away...she wouldn\u2019t make it.\u2019\u201d The doctor warned her to watch out for high blood pressure and coughing, symptoms of Mirror syndrome, another rare condition where a mother \u201cmirrors\u201d the same problems the fetus is experiencing. With Bernardo\u2019s blood pressure numbers climbing, her OB-GYN conferred with the hospital\u2019s ethics board to see if she could end the pregnancy but was advised Bernardo wasn\u2019t sick enough. Bernardo spent $7,000 traveling to Seattle for an abortion a week later. Even if Emma made it through the pregnancy, doctors would have immediately needed to drain excess fluids from her body, only for her to survive a few hours or days, Bernardo said. \n\n\u201cReading about everything they would do sounded like complete torture to a newborn that would not survive,\u201d she said. \u201cHad I not received an abortion, my life would have very likely been on the line.\u201dOther women facing similar situations have not had the financial resources to travel outside of the state. Samantha Casiano, a 29-year-old living in eastern Texas, found out halfway through her pregnancy last year that her daughter, Halo, had a rare diagnosis of anencephaly, where much of the skull and brain is missing. Her doctor told her she would have to continue with the pregnancy because of Texas law, even though her baby would not survive. With five children, including a goddaughter, at home she quickly realized she could not afford an out-of-state trip for an abortion. The next next few months of her pregnancy were spent trying to raise money for her daughter\u2019s impending funeral, soliciting donations through online websites and launching fundraisers to sell Mexican soup. Halo was born in April, living for only four hours. \n\n\u201cI was so full of heartbreak and sadness, all at the same time,\u201d Casiano said. Women in the lawsuit say they could not openly discuss abortion or labor induction with their doctors, instead asking their doctors discreetly if they should travel outside of the state. Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, never talked about her own abortion with her doctors after they discovered anencephaly on the baby\u2019s ultrasound during her third pregnancy last year. She worried her out-of-state trip to end the pregnancy could jeopardize her medical license or invite harassment against her and her husband, also an OB-GYN. Dennard was inspired to go public with her case when one of her own patients joined the original lawsuit filed in March after traveling to Colorado to abort a twin fetus diagnosed with a life-threatening genetic disorder. \u201cThere was an enormous amount of fear that I experienced afterward,\u201d Dennard said. \u201cIt\u2019s an additional way of feeling silenced. You feel you have to do it in secret and not tell anyone about it.\u201dDennard is expecting another child later this year. ___Associated Press writer Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMANDA SEITZ\n\n\n                Seitz is an Associated Press reporter covering federal health care policy.
