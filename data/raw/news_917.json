to abortion nationwide.\n    \n\n            The Senate blocked the measure on a nearly party-line vote, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voting with Republicans in opposition. The vote was 46-48.\n    \n\n            The bill, dubbed the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, aimed to \u201cprotect a person\u2019s ability to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care provider\u2019s ability to provide abortion services.\u201d The House had passed the legislation in a nearly party-line vote in late September \u2013 even though the bill was not expected to have the necessary votes to pass the 50-50 Senate, as legislation in the chamber requires Republicans to join Democrats to get at least 60 votes to break a filibuster.\n    \n\n            The bill\u2019s failure to advance in the Senate comes as Republican-led states have introduced and advanced bills across the nation that make it harder for women to access abortions and threaten health-care providers who perform the procedure. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights activists rally at the Texas State Capitol on September 11, 2021 in Austin, Texas. Texas Lawmakers recently passed several pieces of conservative legislation, including SB8, which prohibits abortions in Texas after a fetal heartbeat is detected on an ultrasound, usually between the fifth and sixth weeks of pregnancy. \n\nJordan Vonderhaar/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTexas abortion seekers flooded out-of-state clinics after six-week ban went into effect, Planned Parenthood records show\n\n\n\n\n            A Texas law took effect in September that bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and allows private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion in violation of the ban. And the Supreme Court justices are expected to decide later this year a separate Mississippi case that presents a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\n    \n\n            Following that controversial Texas law taking effect, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had announced the House would take up the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act.\n    \n\n            Pelosi argued that the time had come to pass the legislation, considering Democrats\u2019 control of the House \u2013 where the majority of members support abortion rights \u2013 and a Democrat serving as president.\n    \n\n            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking at a news conference ahead of the vote, said abortion restrictions passed at the state-level \u201clargely fly in the face of public opinion, common sense, and frankly common decency. We must fight to stop these insidious efforts to curtail a woman\u2019s right to access safe, legal abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n            Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement that she supports a woman\u2019s right to choose but that the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act \u201cgoes too far.\u201d \u201cIt would broadly supersede state laws and infringe on Americans\u2019 religious freedoms,\u201d she said.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
