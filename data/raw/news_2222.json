(Karen Callaway/Chicago Catholic)     People from all over the Midwest usually come to Illinois to participate in the March for Life Chicago, something they can\u2019t do this January because of COVID-19 restrictions. So this year, march organizers are taking the event on a tour with stops in Omaha, Nebraska; Des Moines, Iowa; Madison, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne and Indianapolis, Indiana; and Mundelein. The tour begins on Jan. 2 and ends\u00a0in downtown Chicago on Jan. 23. \u201cThis year we recognized not everyone can hop on buses and come in. The Midwest came to us last year. This year we\u2019re going to the Midwest,\u201d said Kevin Grillot, executive director of the March for Life Chicago and weDignify, a pro-life organization for college students in the Midwest. Each tour stop will offer a rally with speakers, much like the main march. However, logistics will be similar to the drive-in Masses held at several archdiocesan suburban parishes. People will drive to a main site, where they will park and stay in vehicles. Speakers will take to a stage and people can hear their speeches by tuning into a local radio frequency. Several of the tour stops will hold car processions through the cities following the rallies. \u201cThey can bring their whole family in the car. That way no one has to get out,\u201d Grillot said. \u201cFor some, they might find this advantageous because sometimes we\u2019ve been known to have a march in a 15-degree wind chill so they might value the heat in their cars.\u201d Rallies at all the tour stops will be livestreamed for those who aren\u2019t comfortable attending in person. Participants also will have the opportunity to take part in a diaper drive that benefits local women\u2019s centers. When people pull up to the rallies, they can open their trunks and volunteers will collect the diapers from the cars. \u201cThere are 130,094 abortions in the Midwest each year,\u201d Grillot said. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking to raise 130,094 diapers.\u201d People can sign up to be caravan captains and have pro-life signs mailed to them that say \u201cI march for life\u201d or \u201cI love them both\u201d to decorate their cars or put in the windows during the processions. \u201cSay your church regularly rents a bus, in this way you could meet up with several cars at a parking lot, people get the signs and then drive down together to the nearest tour stop,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they go home, they now have a yard sign that they can put out.\u201d At each stop, organizers are partnering with local pro-life groups and churches to host the event. For example, in Omaha, the Archdiocese of Omaha is one of the partners. Many of these partners have participated in the March for Life Chicago in the past. March for Life Chicago\u2019s goal is to provide a safe and strong pro-life presence in the public square, Grillot said, following each location\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions. That fits with the overall purpose of the march. \u201cCardinal George brought several organizations together in 2013 in order to build up the March for Life Chicago and his commitment was a courageous witness in the public square,\u201d Grillot said. \u201cWe have expanded to work with an ecumenical presence to reach out to many organizations and people who are passionate about being visibly pro-life. It\u2019s not enough to be silently pro-life or to hold your beliefs so close that no one sees them.\u201d It\u2019s about being open and inviting people into a movement that is building, he said. \u201cWe do that through showing and witnessing for life, coming out to the march, having a yard sign up, having visibility to friends, posting to social media,\u201d Grillot said. \u201cThis is something that each person is called to live out and be a witness to.\u201d The Archdiocese of Chicago is one of the hosts for the tour stop at Carmel High School in Mundelein on Jan. 17. \u201cThis is a way to bring people together who might be worried about going into the city or who would just prefer not to go into the city,\u201d said Dawn Fitzpatrick, senior coordinator for the Office of Human Dignity and Solidarity for the Archdiocese of Chicago. \u201cWe will have some great speakers and an opportunity to stand up for life and to support Aid for Women [through the diaper drive]. We also can put a spotlight on Carmel High School and inspire many young people by hosting the rally there.\u201d Speakers at the Mundelein stop include Melissa Villalobos, a local mother whose healing through the intercession of John Henry Newman led to his canonization in 2019, and Patrick McCaskey of the Chicago Bears. The tour also gives people a chance to effect change during the pandemic, she said. \u00a0\u201cSo many people have been shut in this year due to COVID-19 and maybe even feel like there is nothing they can do to make a difference,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity to stand up for truth and provide witness for the voiceless while taking the needed precautions to stay safe.\u201d Rosemary Hackett, president of Illinois Right to Life, which is one of the seven hosts for the march in downtown Chicago, said the value of a public witness to pro-life issues cannot be understated. \u201cIt\u2019s the public display, whether it\u2019s marches or praying at abortion clinics, that has kept the issue alive and made people aware,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are more pro-life now than in the past. I think we go in phases and the younger generation is much more pro-life.\u201d Fitzpatrick agreed. \u201cMany have become aware of the network of people who are pro-life. We bring people together and inspire them to take action for the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cMany are introduced to the issue through the march and then they find additional ways to stand up for life the rest of the year.\u201d And every person counts, Hackett said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to continue to witness. Maybe on a grand scale you don\u2019t notice the difference, but I think you notice it on the micro scale of impacting individual people\u2019s lives.\u201d Hackett also noted that the pro-life issue is one that crosses cultural, religious and economic lines. \u201cIt draws people from all walks of life. It\u2019s an issue that unites us all,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the older people who started this \u2014 at least in Illinois \u2014 show up, but also a lot of young people from all over show up because it\u2019s something that crosses all boundaries.\u201d For information about the March for Life Chicago and the tour, visit marchforlifechicago.org. \u00a0    Topics:   march for life  covid-19    Related Articles     Virtual worshippers often satisfied, but more Americans choose in-person services  In the height of the pandemic, many Americans who attended in-person worship services turned to their computers and their couches instead for virtual viewing.
