And the appearance made clear that, as he heads into the 2020 election, Trump is counting on those voters to help bring him across the finish line.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant move,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of Trump\u2019s most prominent evangelical supporters, of Trump\u2019s decision to become the first president to take the event\u2019s stage. Reed said the president\u2019s appearance would \u201cenergize and remind pro-life voters what a great friend this president and administration has been.\u201d\nIt also shows how much times have changed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPast presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure. They sent remarks for others to deliver, spoke via telephone hookup or invited organizers to the White House \u2014 but never appeared at the march.\n\nOver the last 10 years, however, the Republican Party has undergone a \u201crevolution,\u201d displaying a new willingness to \u201cembrace the issue as not only being morally right but politically smart,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PAC, which is planning to spend $52 million this cycle to help elect candidates opposed to abortion rights.While views of abortion have remained relatively stable over two decades of polling \u2014 with roughly 6 in 10 Americans saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center \u2014 both the Republican and Democratic parties have taken harder-line positions for and against abortion rights.\u201cThere used to be a middle in this country and candidates would not want to alienate the middle,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under President George W. Bush. \u201cAnd it just seems that that is over and that both parties play to their bases.\u201dDuring his first three years in office, Trump has embraced socially conservative policies, particularly on abortion. He\u2019s appointed judges who oppose it, cut taxpayer funding and painted Democrats who support abortion rights as extreme in their views. \n\n\u201cPresident Trump has done more for the pro-life community than any other president, so it is fitting that he would be the first president in history to attend the March for Life on the National Mall,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere. On Friday, his administration took another step, threatening California with the potential loss of federal health care funding over the state\u2019s requirement that insurance plans cover abortions. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign announced the creation of a new campaign coalition, \u201cPro-life Voices for Trump.\u201dTrump\u2019s thinking on the matter has been simple: If he supports the cause, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t he show up to their big event?\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union and a close ally of the White House. He said the appearance would be deeply significant for participants and \u201ccement even tighter the relationship\u201d Trump has with conservative activists across the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people be moved to tears over the fact that he\u2019s going,\u201d said Schlapp. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d March attendees began streaming onto the Mall early Friday morning, many holding signs with slogans like \u201cMAKE UNBORN BABIES GREAT AGAIN!\u201d and I VOTE PRO-LIFE FIRST.\u201d In some ways, it had the feel of a Trump campaign rally, with vendors selling pro-Trump buttons and hats.\u201cI am very impressed with him. It takes a lot of guts to do something that nobody else has done before,\u201d said Janet Peterson, who traveled from South Carolina for the event, and credited Trump\u2019s decision to appear on his New York roots.\u201cIf you tell them, \u2018This isn\u2019t the status quo\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t do it this way,\u2019 they\u2019re more likely to give you a double middle finger and do it,\u201d she said. \n\nTrump used his speech, in part, to attack Democrats for embracing what he labeled \u201cradical and extreme positions\u201d on abortion, and praised attendees, saying they were motivated by \u201cpure, unselfish love.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, who was traveling in Italy Friday, also appeared via video recorded at the Vatican following a meeting with Pope Francis.The full embrace underscored Trump\u2019s dramatic evolution on the issue of abortion from his days as a freewheeling New York deal-maker, when he described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in a 1999 interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201dBy 2016, however, Trump said his views had changed and that he was now opposed to abortion except in the case of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk.And to the surprise of many, he has been embrace by the movement.\u201cThese voters who are pro-life love Donald Trump and they will crawl across broken glass to get him re-elected,\u201d said Reed, who credited Trump with having \u201cmasterfully capitalized on his pro-life position in a way I think no one could have envisioned four years ago,\u201dCritics, meanwhile, accused Trump of using the march to try to distract from his impeachment trial in the Senate, with Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, calling it \u201can act of desperation, plain and simple.\u201d ___Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
