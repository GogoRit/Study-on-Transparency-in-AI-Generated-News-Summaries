In the past, he exposed Candace Owens\u2019 ignorance on the science of climate change, pushed back against Dave Rubin\u2019s childish conception of the free market, and now, highlighted the inherent cruelty of Seth Dillon\u2019s anti-choice stance.\n\n\nDuring the podcast, the two discussed the fall of Roe v. Wade, and Dillon expressed his anti-choice views. In response, Rogan argued:\n\u201cThere\u2019s also women who have been raped, who should not have to f**king carry some rapist\u2019s baby. There\u2019s women who have been sexually assaulted before the age of 14.\u201d\nDillon responded that \u201cthere are people who have been born of rape, and are alive right now, and are pro-life and they go around speaking, talking about how \u2018I had a right to live\u2019 and they will go out there and make an argument, a pro-life case.\u201d\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor\nRogan then stated: \u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to tell a 14-year-old girl, she has to carry a rapist\u2019s baby. Like, you don\u2019t have the right to tell my 14-year-old daughter, she has to carry her rapist\u2019s baby. You understand that?\u201d\n\nFor Rogan, the issue was clearly personal, while Dillon argued with the supreme confidence of a person who never has to worry about getting pregnant. After the two repeated their arguments, Dillan said, rather weakly: \u201cI don\u2019t think two wrongs make a right\u2026 I don\u2019t think murder fixes a rape.\u201d\n\n\nRogan tried to pin down when, exactly, Dillon considered a human life to have formed - Dillon didn\u2019t have a coherent answer, implying that it might be the moment sperm merges with an egg.\nDillon is the CEO of conservative satire website The Babylon Bee, which was suspended from Twitter after misgendering U.S. Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine. Dillon has indicated that the account will never delete the tweet; via his own personal Twitter account, Dillon wrote:\n\u201cThey could, of course, delete the tweet themselves. But they won\u2019t. It\u2019s not enough for them to just wipe it out. They want us to bend the knee and admit that we engaged in hateful conduct.\u201d\nRogan has previously clarified that he is not a supporter of Donald Trump, contrary to popular belief, and that he actually turned down Trump\u2019s requests to appear on The Joe Rogan Experience, because he is \u201cnot interested in helping him.\u201d\nWhile Rogan is still dedicating much of his time to platforming right-wing culture warriors, his pro-choice outburst proved that he\u2019s not quite sold on all of their ideas.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0Dani Di PlacidoEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
