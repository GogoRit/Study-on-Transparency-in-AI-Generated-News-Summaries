Even if all there is a heartbeat, that\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe 75-year-old also shared that his faith in God affected how he chose to pursue his career. Feliciano shared how his faith helped influence his career choice.\n\u201cIt seemed to me that before my parents read the Bible or did other things with me, God was pushing me into the music area,\u201d Feliciano said. \u201cGod was showing me the light ever since I was born.\u201d\n\u201cSomehow at that age when I would hear my uncles playing music [in Puerto Rico], it seemed that God was sending me a message, that he was steering me in that direction,\u201d he added.\nFeliciano said he remains thankful to God, despite his blindness.\n\u201cIn one sight being blind helped because if I would have been sighted, I probably would have been playing stickball in the streets and not listening to the message that God was giving which was music all the time,\u201d Felciano said.\nFeliciano said that his parents also showed great faith and supported him throughout his life. Feliciano\u2019s father gave him a harmonica at the age of 4, and he knew that he had an ear for music.\n\u201cMy mother would go in the kitchen and sob uncontrollably because it really looked like a miracle. When she was crying, someone said, \u2018Listen, this has to be a sign from God,\u201d Feliciano recalled.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Jose\u0301 Feliciano (@josefeliciano)\n\n\n\nNow more than ever we\u2019re bombarded by darkness in media, movies, and TV.
