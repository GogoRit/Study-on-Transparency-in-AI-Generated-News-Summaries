They should plan for concerted action and dedicate resources to prevent and respond to gender-based violence and to eliminate discrimination in law and practice.\nThis year is the 25th anniversary of the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which set out a progressive women\u2019s rights agenda in 12 areas and mobilized widespread political will and action. A planned two-week meeting at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in New York to take stock of advances since Beijing has been postponed due to coronavirus concerns. But the Generation Equality Forum, co-hosted by Mexico in May 2020 and France in July will bring together governments, the private sector, and civil society groups to create blueprints to accelerate progress on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights.\n\u201cInspiring activism and organizing around women\u2019s rights over the past 25 years has led to massive gains, but entrenched discrimination, gender-based violence, and neglect keep many women and girls from enjoying their full rights,\u201d said Nisha Varia, women\u2019s rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe need to prioritize women and girls who have been marginalized based on factors such as disability, age, race, ethnicity, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity, and Indigenous or migration status.\u201d\nOver the past 25 years, Human Rights Watch has reported on a wide range of violations of women\u2019s rights and human rights abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\nThere have been notable advances in many areas. Although many women workers are in poorly regulated sectors with low wages and exploitative working conditions, they have organized to achieve key legal protections. These include the International Labour Organization (ILO) Domestic Workers Convention, which set new international standards and catalyzed reforms in dozens of countries, and the newly adopted ILO Violence and Harassment Convention. Labor and other groups have also been fighting abuses in women-dominated sectors such as the garment industry, championing greater transparency in global supply chains to facilitate redress for grievances and using legally binding agreements to tackle sexual harassment at work.\nLegal reforms have focused both on removing harmful and discriminatory laws and on introducing new legal, economic, and psychosocial \u2013 mental health \u2013 protections. Countries across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa have repealed laws that allow rapists to escape prosecution by marrying their victims. One hundred and fifty-five countries have laws addressing domestic violence, including almost half the countries in the Middle East and North Africa in the past five years. Some countries, among them India, have created specific legal safeguards for women with disabilities, although implementation has been weak.\nRegional human rights treaties in Africa, the Americas, and Europe have set forth minimum standards for preventing and prosecuting gender-based violence and providing needed support for survivors.\nDespite this progress, discriminatory laws and protection gaps remain, and enforcement of existing laws is often weak. Women\u2019s and girl\u2019s rights to access and own property, including land, still lag behind. In Kenya and Zimbabwe, Human Rights Watch found married women and widows face formidable barriers to claiming property and land.\nGender-based violence remains endemic. Governments often fail to protect lesbian, bisexual, queer, and transgender women from violence, including sexual violence, as Human Rights Watch has documented in Nigeria; domestic violence, as documented in Ghana and Lebanon; police violence, as documented in Kuwait; and violence against transgender women, as in Lebanon. Many factors contribute to violence against women with disabilities, including limitations in physical mobility, communication barriers, isolation, and harmful stereotypes.\nAdditional reforms and enforcement are critical, as Human Rights Watch research on domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan shows. At least 37 countries criminalize same-sex conduct. And Human Rights Watch research in Cambodia, China, Lebanon, Tanzania, the United States, and South Africa shows that criminalizing sex work compromises the safety and access to basic rights for those who sell sex to survive.\nHuman Rights Watch research in Malawi, South Sudan, Nepal, and Bangladesh underlines the mixed record of governments fighting child marriage, which exposes girls to a heightened risk of violence and health problems due to early childbearing, and causes them to leave school. Similarly, despite massive gains in school enrollment, 260 million children were not in school in 2019, with girls especially affected because of sexual harassment and violence, child marriage, and discrimination. Human Rights Watch found that schools in Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone have expelled tens of thousands of girls who marry or get pregnant.\nThe global fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights has mobilized activists and health care workers. Human rights bodies have recognized that criminalizing and restricting access to abortion negatively affects myriad women\u2019s human rights. Governments have moved slowly to loosen such restrictions, such as in Chile in specific cases.\nBut greater access to reproductive health services has also spurred concerted opposition from some governments and powerful religious bodies, including, as Human Rights Watch documented, in Poland. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean criminalize abortion in all circumstances, including the Dominican Republic and Honduras, or severely restrict access, such as in Ecuador. Argentina is initiating a new legislative debate to decriminalize abortion.\nThe United States has tried to eliminate and weaken references to sexual and reproductive rights in international resolutions, and has excluded these issues from the State Department\u2019s\u00a0annual human rights country reports. It has restricted its funding as the world\u2019s largest health donor with its \u201cglobal gag rule,\u201d which has threatened hard-fought gains in women\u2019s health, including in Kenya and Uganda.\nThe women, peace, and security agenda in UN Security Resolution 1325 outlines measures governments should take to ensure women\u2019s participation in peace and security talks, and to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in conflict. Women\u2019s participation in peace processes remains limited, though, including an unclear role for Afghan women in upcoming negotiations between the Taliban, the Afghan government, and other factions.\nHuman Rights Watch has found a lack of long-term support services and formidable obstacles to accountability when documenting sexual violence in conflict, including against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Yezidi women in Iraq by ISIS, by Boko Haram in Nigeria, in post-election violence in Kenya, and in the Central African Republic.\nNew challenges are emerging. Climate change exacerbates conflict over land, worsening women\u2019s access to pastoral and agricultural land and threatens advances made in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 health, including\u00a0maternal health.\u00a0Governments have a human rights obligation to address climate change both by cutting emissions and by adequately funding protections, especially for marginalized communities. Online violence presents a growing threat to which governments need to develop an adequate response.\n\u201cThere have been varying degrees of progress in legal equality and protections, but the true litmus test will be meaningful improvements in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 daily lives,\u201d Varia said. \u201cWe are still far from realizing the vision put forward in Beijing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAfrica Americas Asia Europe/Central Asia Global Middle East/North Africa United States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Child Marriage Domestic Violence Domestic Workers Gender Equality Labor Rights in the Garment Industry Reproductive Rights and Abortion Sexual Violence and Rape Women and Armed Conflict Women\u2019s Health and FGM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 18, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nSexual Violence: Uganda Police Should Support Victims, Not Blame Them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 7, 2020\n\n          Statement\n        \n\n\nHuman Rights Watch Submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on Yemen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cMy Marriage was Mistake after Mistake\u201d\n\n\nThe Impact of Unregistered Marriages on Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Rights in Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cGirls Shouldn\u2019t Give Up On Their Studies\u201d\n\n\nPregnant Girls\u2019 and Adolescent Mothers\u2019 Struggles to Stay in School in Mozambique\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 18, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nSexual Violence: Uganda Police Should Support Victims, Not Blame Them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 7, 2020\n\n          Statement\n        \n\n\nHuman Rights Watch Submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on Yemen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
