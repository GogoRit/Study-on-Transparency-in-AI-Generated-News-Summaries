Critics argue that most patients do not realise they are pregnant so soon after conception, rendering the latest bill a near-total ban.\nIn the wake of its passage, the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden issued a statement opposing what it called an \u201cextreme and dangerous new abortion ban\u201d.\n\u201cThe ban flies in the face of fundamental freedoms and is out of step with the views of the vast majority of the people of Florida and of all the United States,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote in a statement.\n \n\n\n\n \nShe added that Thursday\u2019s ban would not only affect the 4 million women of reproductive age in Florida but also patients in surrounding states, where similar bans are in effect.\nMany of them, Jean-Pierre argued, \u201chave previously relied on travel to Florida as an option to access care\u201d.\nFlorida has some of the highest rates of abortions in the US. The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health Policy Research nonprofit found that, in 2020, an estimated 74,868 legal abortions were performed in Florida, the most of any state.\nThe next highest totals were in New York and Texas. Florida has the third-highest state population in the US, recently surpassing New York.\nVice President Kamala Harris echoed Jean-Pierre\u2019s remarks on Twitter, writing: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: This law would deny women across Florida access to basic health care.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n \nThe decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade last June \u2014 thereby ending the constitutional right to an abortion \u2014 has made the question of its legality up to individual states.\nThe six-week abortion ban passed the Florida Senate on April 3 by a margin of 26-13. The bill includes exceptions for rape, incest and danger to the parent\u2019s life.\nBut those exceptions do not go far enough, according to Kara Gross, the legislative director at the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\u201cThe bill\u2019s exceptions are so onerous and impracticable that they are virtually meaningless,\u201d she said in a statement released on Thursday. \u201cIn a state that prides itself on being free, this is an unprecedented and unacceptable level of government overreach and intrusion.\u201d\nDemocratic state Representative Anna Eskamani likewise denounced the bill, saying it was \u201cthe most extreme abortion ban in Florida history\u201d.\n\u201cThis is an incredibly sad and painful day for our state but we will not stop or be deterred in the fight for reproductive justice and personal freedom,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n \n\n\n\n \nBut many in the state\u2019s Republican majority applauded the bill.\n\u201cThere is no greater purpose that drives me than giving every child an opportunity to be born and an opportunity to live,\u201d Republican state Representative Jenna Persons-Mulicka said in a video supporting the abortion ban.\nSeven state Republican representatives, however, broke rank to vote against the bill.\nPolls generally indicate that a majority of Americans support some measure of access to abortion. In 2022, the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of Americans believed abortion should be accessible in most or all cases.\nWhile approval of abortion tends to fall along party lines \u2014 with Democrats supporting access and Republicans in favour of greater restrictions \u2014 a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday painted a more nuanced picture.\nThe poll found that 43 percent of self-identified Republicans indicated they were less likely to vote for someone who backed limiting access to abortion.\nIn addition, 51 percent of the Republicans polled agreed with the belief that a recent decision by a Texas judge to limit access to the abortion pill was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d.\nDeSantis, who has\u00a0risen to prominence as one of the foremost Republicans in the US, is considered a likely contender for the 2024 presidential race.\nHe had previously shown support for a six-week abortion ban in his state and has argued for his policies in Florida to be a model for the rest of the nation.\nThe Florida Supreme Court is weighing a legal challenge against the previous 15-week ban on the grounds that it violates the right to privacy in the state constitution.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
