That resource is babies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the interview, Douthat said that some factors, such as a shift away from an agrarian economy and lower infant mortality rates, can help explain declining birth rates but cannot account for why birthrates have fallen below the replacement rate.\n\"If you ask people how many kids they would like to have, even in a secular society where most people don't have Humanae Vitae on the shelf, people still say they want between two and three kids,\" Douthat said.\u00a0\n\"But if you look at how many kids they're having, our birth rate is at 1.6, 1.7, in places like South Korea it's at one-that has the potential to cut your population in half without immigration over a couple generations.\"\nIncreasing secularization alone, Douthat said, does not explain the shift, because parents in some secular countries, like Sweden, have more children than some religious ones, like Poland, but that broadly \"there is something about the idea that you are embedded in a story that extends beyond yourself and your own moment, to the next chapter and next development, that makes people more likely to start families and so it helps to think that your story has a capital A author.\"\nThinning family trees present a host of socioeconomic consequences, he said, creating a society that is older, more resistant to change. It also creates families with fewer members, and children experience experience fewer interpersonal relationships with siblings and cousins.\n\"Large families, they toughen kids up in interesting ways,\" Douthat said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like if you're a four-year-old in a family with a six-year-old and an eight-year-old, you can't afford to be too special of a snowflake and you get used to sort of managing interpersonal tensions, you know, if the family is healthy.\"\nDouthat noted the similarity between his own arguments about a decadent society and Pope Francis' criticisms of a \"throwaway culture.\"\n\"It's a society that doesn't have a strong idea of the future or of the past,\" Douthat said. \"So it's sort of lost faith, it thinks that the past was bad and unprogressive and corrupt, but it doesn't have a lot of confidence about the future, so it does, I think, tend towards very disposable forms of culture.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't get people, building the great cathedrals, and writing the great operas,\" in a decadent or throwaway culture, he said, \"not that I attend opera all the time, I mean, I myself am decadent too.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nKate Scanlon is a producer for EWTN Pro-Life Weekly.\n\n\nTags:\nDemographics, \nRoss Douthat, \nBirth rate, \nEWTN Pro-Life Weekly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Catholic News Agency (CNA) Staff are a team of journalists dedicated to reporting news concerning the Catholic Church around the world.
