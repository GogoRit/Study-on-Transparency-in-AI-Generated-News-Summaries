(Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOregon needs to strengthen its laws to protect doctors who provide abortions or gender-affirming care from prosecution and lawsuits, a legislative work group recommended Wednesday.\nThat\u2019s among several recommendations from the Reproductive Health and Access to Care workgroup, which House Speaker Dan Rayfield convened this summer after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the national right to abortion. The procedure remains legal in Oregon, but as Rayfield told a legislative committee on Wednesday, abortion being legal doesn\u2019t guarantee care.\u00a0\n\nRead the Reproductive Health and Access to Care workgroup\u2019s full report\n\n\u201cOregonians have clearly affirmed their support for making abortion and other care safe and accessible to all,\u201d Rayfield said. \u201cBut I want to be clear: The right to access an abortion does not mean abortion care is accessible.\u201d\nThe workgroup found that three-quarters of Oregon\u2019s counties don\u2019t have abortion providers, and roughly 30% of the state\u2019s hospital beds are in Catholic hospitals that are exempt from providing abortions, contraceptives and some other reproductive health care.\nWomen in eastern Oregon who previously travelled to Boise or Meridian for abortions can no longer do so because of a recently enacted ban in Idaho. Oregon clinics now face higher demand from Oregon residents along with women from Idaho and other states where abortion is now banned or restricted.\u00a0\n\u201cWe now border a state, Idaho, with a near-total abortion ban,\u201d Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum told the committee. \u201cAbortion bans indisputably put health, and that means lives, at risk.\u201d\nThe workgroup\u2019s 22-page report, released Wednesday afternoon,\u00a0 calls for additional training for community health workers and updating state webpages to make sure people who need abortion or gender-affirming care know their rights and where they can receive care.\u00a0\nAnd it seeks an unspecified amount of legislative funding for incentives for health care providers and medical fellows and residents who need to travel to Oregon for training. In this year\u2019s legislative session, lawmakers approved $15 million for abortion care for Oregonians, out-of-state residents and providers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRep. Andrea Valderrama said the report brought to light issues she sees in her east Portland community every day. Valderrama, a Democrat, said she initially ran for the David Douglas School District board because her district has some of the state\u2019s highest rates of sexually transmitted infections. Those rates fell after the board passed a policy to provide free contraceptives.\u00a0\nShe said legislators need to take action to ensure Oregonians have access to services in their communities. The report found that some Oregonians have traveled as far as 350 miles in-state to receive abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do these people do when they can\u2019t afford the gas to drive 350 miles or they have kids at home who need them? As legislators, we can\u2019t sit by,\u201d Valderrama said. \nThe report also calls for more state enforcement of reproduction health insurance mandates. The state Reproductive Health Equity Act of 2017 requires that care including abortion, screenings and contraception be covered at no cost to patients, but an audit this summer found that many insurance provideres weren\u2019t following the law.\u00a0\nSome insurance carriers aren\u2019t required to do so. Federal employees and people covered by Indian Health Services or Veterans Affairs are on their own because the federal Hyde Amendment bans the use of federal funds for abortions.\nReligious-based insurers such as the Providence Health Plan are exempt and some self-funded group plans don\u2019t need to provide abortion coverage. A Republican majority on the Deschutes County Commission has repeatedly declined to add abortion coverage to its health plan for the county\u2019s more than 1,000 employees.\u00a0\nThe workgroup report calls for giving the Oregon Health Authority funding and authority to offer expanded reproductive health care coverage for Oregonians who don\u2019t receive it through their insurer, and for ending a loophole that allows local governments such as Deschutes County to avoid following the law.\u00a0\nLegal protections\nSeveral of the recommendations are intended to protect Oregon-based health care providers from legal repercussions from states that have banned abortion. That includes prohibiting medical malpractice insurers from denying or revoking coverage or imposing penalties or rate increases that are based on providing abortions or gender-affirming care in a way that\u2019s consistent with Oregon law.\u00a0\nThe group recommended prohibiting Oregon licensing boards from suspending health care provider licenses for providing medical care that\u2019s legal in Oregon. It wants the Legislature to pass a law codifying Gov. Kate Brown\u2019s commitment not to extradite people who provided legal health care services that are criminalized in other states and prohibit future governors from having the discretion to extradite individuals in those cases.\u00a0\nAnother recommended law would explicitly prohibit Oregon prosecutors from any abortion-related prosecution, including charges for terminating a pregnancy or experiencing a miscarriage or stillbirth. Oregon law now states that abortion is a right, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly ban prosecution.\u00a0\nRosenblum pledged that the attorney general\u2019s office will defend access to abortion and gender-affirming care.\n\u201cWe at the Oregon Department of Justice will not stop defending your rights,\u201d she said. \u201cAccess to abortion remains legal in Oregon. We will not go back to the days of politicians telling you what to do with your bodies.\u201d\nAdvocates are seeking an unspecified amount of state funding to help medical providers or abortion recipients pay legal fees if they\u2019re prosecuted or sued by other states.\nThe group further recommended that the state enforce Oregon\u2019s Unlawful Trade Practices Act against so-called \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d which depict themselves as reproductive health care centers but try to dissuade women from obtaining abortions. Oregon has 44 crisis pregnancy centers and only 13 abortion clinics, according to the report.\nRep. Cedric Hayden, R-Roseburg, questioned whether that enforcement could violate the free speech rights of people who operate crisis pregnancy centers. The Oregon Justice Department has not prosecuted any centers.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXOregon workgroup recommends stronger legal protections for abortion doctors\nby Julia Shumway, Oregon Capital Chronicle December 7, 2022\nOregon workgroup recommends stronger legal protections for abortion doctors\nby Julia Shumway, Oregon Capital Chronicle December 7, 2022\n Oregon needs to strengthen its laws to protect doctors who provide abortions or gender-affirming care from prosecution and lawsuits, a legislative work group recommended Wednesday.\nThat\u2019s among several recommendations from the Reproductive Health and Access to Care workgroup, which House Speaker Dan Rayfield convened this summer after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
