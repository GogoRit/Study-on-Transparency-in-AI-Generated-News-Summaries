to the streets of Polish cities Friday night, with thousands heading to the house of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the country\u2019s de facto ruler, to protest last week\u2019s court ruling tightening Poland\u2019s already-restrictive abortion laws.\nThe scale and momentum of the protests is prompting the government to try to find a compromise that would defang the demonstrations.\nPolish President Andrzej Duda on Friday proposed a new abortion law that would allow the procedure in cases where prenatal diagnosis shows a \u201chigh probability\u201d of the fetus being stillborn or being born with a condition \u201cleading inevitably and directly to death.\u201d That comes after the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal ruled on October 22 that abortions for reasons of fetal abnormality violate the Polish constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki appealed for people to stop protesting \u2014 on a day when Poland noted a record 21,628 COVID-19 cases. \u201cI\u2019m not asking that we forget about the conflict over abortion, but to put it aside for a better time,\u201d he said Friday afternoon.\nBoth appeals were ignored by protesters, who surged onto the streets to demand a complete rethink of abortion, and more broadly to campaign against the Law and Justice (PiS) government that has ruled Poland since 2015. The main motto of the protests is a vulgar \u201cfuck off\u201d and chanted refrains of \u201cFuck PiS\u201d echoed throughout the streets of Warsaw as protesters marched from Morawiecki\u2019s office across downtown toward Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s house. Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski estimated that more than 50,000 people took part.\nThousands of protesters in Warsaw | Omar Marques/Getty Images\n\u201cI came out here to show my opposition to what the tribunal decided, but also to show I\u2019ve had enough,\u201d said Anna Borowska, 43, who was marching alongside her husband. \u201cI had to come and protest because otherwise we\u2019ll no longer be able to live in this country. It\u2019s breaking my heart but we are thinking of leaving Poland.\u201d\nThe decision of the tribunal, widely seen as being under the political control of PiS,  further polarized what is already a deeply divided society. Some of the early protests targeted Catholic churches, blaming the tight alliance between parts of the church and PiS for overturning an abortion compromise that had stood since 1993.\nIn response, a mix of tough-looking young men and praying parishioners blocked the front stairs of St. Alexander\u2019s Church in downtown Warsaw, in turn protected by ranks of civilian and military police.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to protect our fucking holy places from these fucking people,\u201d said one man who refused to give his name. \u201cThese people aren\u2019t Poles, they\u2019re fascists trying to destroy our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome nationalists threw flares and firecrackers into the crowd of marchers.\nBut for some of the people in front of St. Alexander\u2019s, the tribunal\u2019s ruling makes sense in what is still a deeply Catholic country.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not politicians but people of faith who started the movement to ban abortion,\u201d said Pawe\u0142 Gierech, 46, pointing to red splashes of paint left on the facade of the church from protests earlier in the week. \nPeople take part in the \u201cMarch on Warsaw\u201d protest | Radek Pietruszka/EFE via EPA\n\u201cMany people support this decision \u2026 this is just a very loud minority,\u201d he said of the protesters walking by the church.\nBut on the other side, many people see no return to the old abortion law \u2014 already one of the toughest in Europe. It largely kept abortion out of politics through the fiction that abortions were very rare in Poland. Last year there were only 1,110 legal abortions in the country, but the true number is likely closer to 150,000, according to abortion rights groups.\n\u201cWhat I really want is abortion on demand for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy,\u201d said Monika Chmiel, 30. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an address on Facebook earlier this week, Kaczy\u0144ski defended the ruling and cast its opponents as enemies of the country. \u201cThis is an attack which is supposed to destroy Poland, which is to lead to the triumph of forces whose rule will essentially end the history of the Polish nation as we\u2019ve known it,\u201d he said, calling on members of his party \u201cto defend the church.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t support attacking churches and today we can see it\u2019s no longer happening,\u201d said Chmiel. \u201cBut the scale of people coming out onto the streets during a pandemic shows the scale of our anger.\u201d\nThe organizers of the women\u2019s marches have put out out a list of demands, ranging from women\u2019s rights to the resignation of the government.\nHowever, the PiS-led nationalist coalition won last year\u2019s parliamentary election and PiS-backed Duda won another five-year term earlier this year, and has no intention of quitting.\nThe organizers plan more demonstrations next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated
