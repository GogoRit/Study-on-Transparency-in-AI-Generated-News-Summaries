Another doctor interviewed for the study said: \u201cI remember getting sick out in the corridors afterwards because I thought it (feticide) was such an awful procedure and so dreadful.\u201d\nThe ten doctors interviewed by the study\u2019s researchers were involved in performing abortions on babies with a fatal foetal anomaly (FFA). The doctors expressed their fears of getting an FFA diagnosis incorrect because of media scrutiny and criminal liability associated with FFA legislation.\nLast January the first official figures were published by the Department of Health since Ireland new abortion laws came into effect in January 2019. They showed that 6,666 abortions were carried out last year under the new legislation enacted following the repeal of the Eighth Amendment.\nThe vast majority of these abortions, 6,542, were carried out in the first 12-weeks. A further 100 abortions were carried out due to a condition that was likely to lead to the death of the foetus.\nThe referendum on repealing the Eighth Amendment was supported by 66 per cent of the electorate in 2018 and the country\u2019s abortion laws were liberalised in January 2019 allowing for medical and surgical abortions up to 12 weeks and later if there is a threat to the life of the mother or in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities.\nIn his statement, Aont\u00fa politician Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn highlighted how doctors are asked to inject potassium into the heart of the unborn child without any pain relief for the foetus. This induces a heart attack to end the foetus\u2019 life. The TD said medical staff involved in this procedure were \u201cirreparably haunted\u201d by these \u201chorrific acts\u201d.\n\u201cAnother harrowing element of the report referred to the situation arising where a child survived an abortion and whether their lives will be fought for. Indeed, the doctors surveyed said they would be left in a position where they would \u2018begging\u2019 anyone to help administer palliative care to the abortion surviving child. It is truly harrowing that there would even be any doubt that a child born in Ireland who survived an abortion should be saved or not,\u201d the Aont\u00fa Leader said.\nHe added that the testimony of the doctors underlined \u201cthe absolute need to ban late term abortion in Ireland, to allow for pain relief to be given to the child before the abortion and the need for a legal responsibility to safeguard the life of the child if he or she survives an abortion\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to articles\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to articles\n\nTags\n\nCatholic news\nAbortion\nThe Catholic Church in Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Loading ...\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Instant Access\n\n\nSubscribe to The Tablet for just \u00a37.99\nSubscribe today to take advantage of our introductory offers and enjoy 30 days' access for just \u00a37.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext\nArticle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Catholic News Weekly\n\n\n\nSign up for our newsletter\nGet the latest news and special offers delivered to your inbox\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIGN UP\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tablet\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nArchive\nContact us\nHelp\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise\nJobs\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\nAccessibility\nCookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow The Tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective marketing design by Beond\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDIGITAL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDIGITAL & PRINT\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nINSTITUTIONAL\n\n\n\n\nWebsite design and build by Digital Virtue\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Tablet Publishing Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT COOKIES ON THIS SITE\n\n\nBy continuing your visit on this website, you agree to the use of cookies to give you the very best browsing experience and to collect statistics on page visits.
