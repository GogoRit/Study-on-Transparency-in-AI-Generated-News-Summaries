Signatories include local officials and state legislators, as well as nine members of Congress and three governors.\nAmong the signatories were Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who signed a \"heartbeat bill\" into law earlier in 2019, and Louisiana state Senator Katrina Jackson, who authored the Louisiana law on abortion clinic admitting privileges that the Supreme Court struck down earlier this year.\nAnother signatory was state Senator Mike Gabbard of Hawaii, father of U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, whose support for limiting abortion in the third trimester put her in stark contrast with most of the other candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\nAccording to Democrats for Life of America, dozens of additional politicians said they quietly supported the letter but feared the repercussions of signing it.\nThe letter's signers said they worried about a type of pro-abortion litmus test that has been created within the Democratic Party.\nThey suggested that pro-abortion language within the party's platform is radical and out-of-touch with the views of Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile prominent party leaders have endorsed legal abortion on-demand at any time in a pregnancy, polls indicate that 79% of Americans oppose this view, they said.\nThey noted that the 2016 Democratic Platform endorses taxpayer funding for abortion, both in the U.S. and in developing nations \u2013 ideas that the majority of Americans reject.\nThe signers warned that the rigid pro-abortion views of the party's leaders are driving voters away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In 389 out of 435 Congressional districts, a majority of voters support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks,\" they said. \"When Democratic leaders support late-term abortion, they push many voters into the arms of the Republican Party. Many people holding pro-life views are single-issue voters.\"\nThe letter called on the party to reintroduce language into the platform recognizing a diversity of views on abortion and pledging that the consciences of all party members will be respected.\nIn the year 2000, the Democratic platform included such language in regards to abortion, saying, \"We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party.\" As late as 2004, the platform called for abortion to be \"safe, legal and rare.\"\nBy 2016, however, the conscience language had been dropped from the platform and the word \"rare\" was no longer used alongside repeated calls to make abortion \"safe and legal.\"\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life advocates both within and outside of the Democratic Party have objected to these changes, arguing that the party has become increasingly extreme on the issue.\nJoe Biden's presumptive nomination as the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his selection of Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate, have prompted further concerns.\nLast year, Biden shifted his position on the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of Medicaid funds for most abortions. After voting for the original amendment in 1976 and supporting it for decades, Biden announced last summer that he opposed the Hyde Amendment. His change in position came amid criticism from other Democratic candidates, particularly Harris.\nHarris has been prominent in pushing to limit the operations of pro-life groups.\nAs California attorney general, she drew criticism from the state Catholic conference by sponsoring a bill compelling pro-life pregnancy centers to advertise \"free or low-cost\" abortions to their clients. That law was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2018.\nWhile seeking the Democratic presidential nomination last year, Harris proposed a plan that would bar some states from changing their abortion laws without federal approval.\nAs a senator, she has also co-sponsored legislation to bar any government from imposing a wide variety of limitations on abortion.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nDemocratic Party, \nPro-life Democrats, \nAbortion in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur mission is the truth.
