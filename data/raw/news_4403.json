There are 193 UN member states and they\u2019ve got 31. This is a terrible showing. None of our like-minded partners are there, and none of the people on the list could care less about women. It\u2019s a failure of diplomacy.\u201dA virtual signature ceremony was co-hosted by Pompeo and US health and human services secretary, Alex Azar. They portrayed the declaration as a historic moment in a movement to stop abortion being supported as part of reproductive health care, and credited Donald Trump.\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, the United States has defended the dignity of human life everywhere and always,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cHe has done it like no other president in history. We have mounted an unprecedented defense of the unborn abroad.\u201dIn the declaration, the signatories: \u201cReaffirm that there is no international right to abortion, nor any international obligation on the part of states to finance or facilitate abortion\u201d.The declaration uses \u201cpro-family\u201d language, supporting the \u201crole of the family as foundational to society and as a source of health, support, and care\u201d - which has been associated in the past with opposition to gay marriage and LGBT rights.Pompeo claims private property and religious freedom are 'foremost' human rightsRead moreThe document signed on Thursday also emphasises the primacy of national sovereignty in determining policy and rights, a theme pursued in another project heavily promoted by Pompeo at the state department, the commission on unalienable rights, which argues that the US view on human rights should be rooted in its own constitutional history.As with the unalienable rights commission, career officials at the state department were largely excluded from the development of the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which has been carried out by political appointees.Explore more on these topicsAbortionTrump administrationMike PompeonewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
