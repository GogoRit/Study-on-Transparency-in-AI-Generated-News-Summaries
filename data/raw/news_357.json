Truth instead of lies!\u201d The updates in the secret Telegram chat kept pinging in. Our next protest target: the headquarters of TVP\u2014the Polish state media corporation that since 2015 has been a mouthpiece of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. It was the second big action on a dreary night some two weeks after Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal placed a near-total ban on abortion. The first protest\u2014an automobile and bicycle blockade\u2014was already a success. A seemingly endless phalanx of honking cars and whooping cyclists snaked from the north to the south end of the Vistula River, snarling rush-hour traffic along a major thoroughfare. \n\n\n\n\nThe initial Strajk Kobiet (Women\u2019s Strike) movement emerged in 2016 in response to proposed anti-abortion legislation that PiS later withdrew in the face of demonstrations. What the party\u2019s hard-liners couldn\u2019t achieve legislatively they\u2019ve now won through the courts. Before the tribunal\u2019s ruling, Poland already had one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive laws regarding abortion, banning it except in cases of fetal defects, rape, incest, or threats to a mother\u2019s health. Last year, terminations due to congenital defects accounted for 97 percent of the 1,110 legal abortions in Poland. Now, with the high court finding the first exception unconstitutional, legal abortions would drop to near zero.\nOpinion polls before and after the new ruling have consistently found that a clear majority of Poles oppose further restrictions, with the court\u2019s decision enshrining a minority opinion in a manner somewhat paralleling the fears of many American progressives about how Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s appointment could threaten abortion access in the United States. Building on momentum from past fights, within a matter of days of the October 22 ruling, the decentralized Women\u2019s Strike channeled simmering anger at the right-wing direction of Poland into mass demonstrations drawing hundreds of thousands of Poles into the streets in defiance of coronavirus restrictions.\nThe daily protests deploy cohesive, Internet-friendly organizing tactics and symbols: umbrellas and wire hangers jutting out of car windows in the blockades; banners with pink lightning bolts hanging from apartment windows; and minute-by-minute updates via encrypted messaging apps letting protesters know where not to be when the police show up. The Telegram group in Krakow is called Solidarno\u015b\u0107 nasza broni\u0105: \u201cSolidarity is our weapon.\u201d And much like the Solidarity movement strikes in the 1980s, the current Women\u2019s Strike movement is clamoring to remake a divided Poland.\nSo far\u2014during the current battle in an ongoing culture war\u2014the protesters seem to be winning. On November 4, the government backtracked in the face of the unrest, delaying implementation of the controversial ruling. Yet the abortion issue is just the tip of the iceberg of discontent\u2014a symbol for the wider rollback of rights and the rule of law under the Law and Justice government. Now, a month since the court ruling, my Telegram keeps pinging, and the daily protest actions churn on with a growing list of demands. Kasha, an undergraduate I meet at one of the protests, puts it bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s not only about the abortion ban at this point. It\u2019s about overthrowing the government.\u201d\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\n\n\nDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Can\u2019t the Political Press Just Say the Truth About Trump?

As rhetoric heats up, each side trades blame and digs in, further polarizing the country in what feels like the sort of existential cultural battle currently wracking American politics. While many protest chants keep the focus on women\u2019s rights\u2014\u201cI think, I feel, I decide\u201d\u2014the most prevalent mantra, screamed out of windows and spray-painted on walls, is simply \u201cJeba\u0107 PiS\u201d: Fuck PiS. Rather than calm tensions, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski inflamed them in a fiery speech to parliament calling on supporters to \u201cdefend Poland, defend patriotism\u201d and \u201cdefend Polish churches\u201d against the atheistic mob: \u201cThis is the only way we can win this war.\u201d\nWhile Kaczynski\u2019s bellicose language is hyperbolic, he does accurately pinpoint a defining feature of the current movement: its willingness to challenge the Catholic Church, long the third rail of Polish politics. Activists are actively targeting the powerful institution\u2014from disrupting Sunday services to screaming in the face of a local priest (as seen in one viral video). While the church was instrumental in the fight against Communism in the 1980s, many now blame it for facilitating the country\u2019s contemporary rightward drift. \nCurrent Issue\n\n\n\n \nView our current issue\n\n\n\n\n\nA new encrypted message came though on my phone following the protest against the state media company: \u201cWe have had enough! The same people who celebrate the pseudo-tribunal\u2019s verdict defended pedophiles for years, reaping financial benefits. Are you surprised? We aren\u2019t!\u201d This was accompanied by a Facebook event link for a vigil in remembrance of the \u201cvictims of church abuse.\u201d An hour later, a somber crowd of several hundred people occupied the street outside the archbishop\u2019s palace here. Organized by the activist group DO\u015a\u0106 Milczenia (Enough Silence), the gathering turned religious symbolism against the church. Protesters ripped up chrysanthemums, funerary flowers, throwing the petals on three child-size wooden coffins surrounded by a sea of votive candles in allusion to traditional Polish Day of the Dead rituals.\nOne by one, activists stepped up to the microphone to speak for perceived victims of the church: for women whose lives have been lost in botched illegal abortions, for children sexually abused by priests, for LGBT teenagers driven to suicide. Police in riot gear separated the crowd from a group of male counterprotesters loudly intoning Catholic prayers. At one point, in response to the counterprotesters, the main crowd chanted, \u201cJesus Christ stands with us.\u201d Through her megaphone, Kartarzyna Wojtowicz, a lead organizer, urged the crowd, \u201cThrow flowers, not stones. Because they\u2019re the evil ones, not us.\u201d\nWhile church leaders may be caught off guard by the intense anger, their alliance with PiS\u2019s right-wing agenda has been far from subtle. Marek Jedraszewski, the current archbishop of Krakow, recently expressed disbelief at the \u201caggression unknown so far in Poland, when the sanctity of churches, of sacred places is being violated.\u201d Yet just last year, he labeled the gay rights movement a \u201crainbow plague\u201d that would inflect Poland much like the \u201cred plague\u201d of communism. In an announcement unfortunately timed for the embattled priests, last week the Vatican released the long-awaited McCarick Report implicating Pope John Paul II\u2014Poland\u2019s heretofore unimpeachable modern saint\u2014in the cloud of sexual-abuse scandals hanging over the Catholic Church.\nUsing tools like Facebook and Instagram Live, Ma\u0142gorzata Halber, a leftist writer and activist, has been reporting on protests taking place outside of the media spotlight in dozens of smaller cities deep in PiS-voting regions. When I spoke with her via Zoom, she expressed hope that the marked shift in tone towards the church signaled a greater realignment away from the conservative consensus that has dominated Polish politics since the fall of Communism. \u201cNo one in those conservative places ever had any power before to criticize the church,\u201d she explained. \u201cEven in 2016, when women were marching against the proposed abortion restrictions, they were saying: \u2018Okay, we just want things as they were,\u2019 meaning the compromise\u201d\u2014a 1993 deal between the church and Poland\u2019s post-Communist leaders that enshrined the strict abortion laws in place before the recent ruling. This time around, the movement demands far more.\nYet with all the posturing, symbolism, and the invocations of \u201cwar,\u201d many find it hard to imagine what new social \u201ccompromise\u201d will take root. Poland\u2019s domestic fight is amplified by a European-level battle between Brussels and the self-proclaimed \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d of Central Europe. Poland, together with Hungary, is threatening to veto the current European Union budget because of new enforcement mechanisms included to explicitly target the type of erosion of the rule of law that allowed PiS to pack Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal in the first place. The EU Council, meanwhile, launched a fact-finding mission last month against LGBT discrimination in Poland.\nAccording to Halber, this bureaucratic tit-for-tat is a sideshow to the real work of building power in the streets\u2014and then victory at the ballot box. \u201cRevolution is a woman\u201d goes one of the popular chants. And, so far, many women in Poland show no signs of letting up in their drive to prove it.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
