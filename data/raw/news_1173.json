Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, sent cease-and-desist letters to eight abortion funds earlier this month, ordering them to \u201cimmediately stop paying for abortions performed in Texas or face criminal prosecution.\u201d\n        \n\nCredit:\n Miguel Gutierrez Jr./The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nA group of nonprofits that help people access abortions are threatening to sue a Texas lawmaker for defamation after he called them \u201ccriminal organizations\u201d in letters he posted to social media.\nState Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, sent cease-and-desist letters to eight of these abortion funds earlier this month, ordering them to \u201cimmediately stop paying for abortions performed in Texas or face criminal prosecution.\u201d\nCain cites an older state law that says \u201cwhoever furnishes the means for procuring an abortion knowing the purpose intended is guilty as an accomplice,\u201d and faces two to five years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state representative notes in his letter that the law was never repealed and that the Legislature reaffirmed the statute when it passed its ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\nTexas\u2019 new abortion restriction, passed as Senate Bill 8, specifically notes that \u201cthe legislature finds that the State of Texas never repealed, either expressly or by implication, the state statutes enacted before the ruling in Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\u201cIt appears that you are unaware that [the statute] continues to exist as the law of Texas,\u201d Cain said. \u201cAnd you likewise appear unaware that your organization is committing criminal acts that are exposing everyone involved in your organization\u2014including your employees, volunteers, and donors\u2014to criminal prosecution and imprisonment.\u201d\nCain also said he intends to introduce legislation to allow district attorneys to prosecute abortion-related crimes outside their home jurisdiction \u201cwhen the local district attorney fails or refuses to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas\u2019 original abortion statutes do remain on the books, but were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. The next year, Texas Attorney General John L. Hill affirmed in a legal opinion that \u201cthere presently are no effective statues of the State of Texas against abortion.\u201d\n\u201cLaws that are repugnant to the Constitution are void and of no effect, and do not create crimes or criminal liability,\u201d Jennifer Ecklund, a lawyer for the abortion funds, wrote in a rebuttal to Cain. \u201cYou are making statements that are legally indefensible and factually false. Your unfounded criminal accusations are also defamatory.\u201d\nIn the letter, Ecklund called for Cain to issue a public statement retracting his original claims and making it clear that he does not believe that the abortion funds are committing any crimes. If he does not, the letter said, the organizations will explore all legal options, including seeking a court order and compensation for the damages and attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the funds.\nEcklund also asked Cain to confirm whether he sent the cease-and-desist letters as a state representative, as an attorney or as an individual. The letters were sent on his official legislative letterhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a response sent to Ecklund on Tuesday, Cain confirmed that he was acting in his role as a state legislator when he sent the letters, and indicated he did not intend to retract the claims. He also added that Ecklund was committing legal malpractice by advising her clients that they were not in violation of state law.\n\"If you and your clients want to adhere to your delusional belief that article 4512.2 no longer exists as the law of Texas, then we welcome the opportunity to have the judiciary set you straight,\" Cain said.\nEcklund and her firm, Thompson Coburn, are representing the abortion funds in an ongoing state lawsuit challenging Texas\u2019 ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. A state judge found the law to be unconstitutional, though he declined to enjoin it from being enforced.\nEarlier this month, two of the abortion funds filed federal lawsuits against two anti-abortion groups, a move legal experts believe may have a strong chance of blocking the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenise Rodriguez, communications director for the Texas Equal Access Fund, said the abortion funds will not be intimidated by Cain\u2019s letter. But she\u2019s not surprised that abortion funds have moved into the crosshairs recently due to their work helping people circumvent the new law.\n\u201cIt seems like their strategy is to try to intimidate donors of abortion funds and try to basically starve abortion funds for resources that can help people get out of state or get abortions,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on a Mississippi abortion case that has the potential to overturn Roe v. Wade. Texas has a trigger law that would immediately ban abortion in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Cain\u2019s letter is an indication that he, and possibly other legislators, will take action to ensure those laws are swiftly and thoroughly enforced.\n\u201cThe state of Texas will ensure that you and your organization\u2019s employees, volunteers, and donors are held accountable for every abortion that you illegally assisted,\u201d Cain wrote in the letter. \u201cConduct yourself accordingly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to welcome you in person and online to the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival, our multiday celebration of big, bold ideas about politics, public policy and the day\u2019s news \u2014 all taking place just steps away from the Texas Capitol from Sept. 22-24.
