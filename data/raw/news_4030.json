Wade in 2020. Already, multiple states have passed laws that amount to a total ban on abortions. And in March, the Court will hear arguments for June Medical Services v. Gee, a case centered on whether or not Louisiana can restrict abortions to treatment centers at which at least one doctor has admitting privileges at an area hospital. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n9 winners and one really big loser from the 2020 Golden Globes\n\nAdmitting privilege laws are a common tactic used by red states to shut down as many abortion providers as possible. While ostensibly they do so in the name of women\u2019s safety, advocates for abortion rights tend to counter that argument by noting that it\u2019s vanishingly rare for anyone to need to go to the hospital after an abortion. Observers believe that with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench, the Court will uphold Louisiana\u2019s law, essentially making it possible under federal law for states to outlaw abortion and overturn Roe. \nWilliams, who has been an active participant in Hollywood\u2019s Time\u2019s Up movement, went on to declare that she could not have lived the life she\u2019s had without the guarantee of a women\u2019s right to choose, and of knowing she would be able \u201cto choose when to have my children, and with whom.\u201d\n\n\n    Related\n  \nWho did Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais roast hardest? Everyone.\n\n\u201cI know my choices might look different than yours,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut thank god or whomever you pray to that we live in a country founded on the principle that I am free to live by my faith and you are free to live by yours. So, women, 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest. It\u2019s what men have been doing for years.\u201d\nBehind Williams, Tiffany Haddish, who presented the award, applauded vigorously. \u201cI\u2019m about that women\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Haddish informed the audience.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
