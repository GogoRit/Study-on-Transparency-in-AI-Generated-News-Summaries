Ralph Northam, she was talking about a child who had already been born).\nPPGNY\u2019s national organization, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, has long said that many of Sanger\u2019s racist quotes have been taken out of context. While the national organization acknowledges some of Sanger\u2019s many flaws, it says her story is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and it hasn\u2019t totally disavowed her. It still labels her a \u201cwoman of heroic accomplishments\u201d and it still calls its \u201chighest honor\u201d the Margaret Sanger Award.\nHowever, in its news release, PPGNY parted ways with the standard talking points, acknowledging what it called \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color.\u201d Yet for years, Planned Parenthood has had the audacity to claim that it believes Black lives matter.\nAs we know all too well, the \u201ccancel culture\u201d is one of the far left\u2019s frequently used tools to destroy anyone or anything that doesn\u2019t comport with its radical ideology. Never at a loss for hypocrisy, though, the left frequently attempts to nuance the troubling pasts of its heroes, trying to make them acceptable while at the same time tearing down statues of those who helped make America the exceptional nation it is.\nSome will accuse me of having a double standard when I say that it\u2019s OK to \u201ccancel\u201d\u00a0Margaret Sanger\u00a0while I defend statesmen like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Yet there\u2019s a significant difference. While we roundly condemn Washington\u2019s and Jefferson\u2019s participation in the evil of slavery, we can still celebrate their lifelong work to create a nation built on the highest ideals of humanity.\nOn the other hand,\u00a0Sanger\u2019s open racism, her promotion of eugenics and her advocacy of forced sterilizations to keep those she deemed \u201cunfit\u201d from \u201cbreeding\u201d was her vision. Planned Parenthood was formed on that vision, and much of that vision still exists at Planned Parenthood today.\nPlanned Parenthood still considers certain people less than human and rejects the science of prenatal development by calling babies in the womb \u201cclumps of cells,\u201d \u201ctissue masses,\u201d and \u201cproducts of conception.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood also still targets minority communities. If Black lives matter to Planned Parenthood, then why, according to a 2015 study, are nearly 80 percent of its surgical abortion facilities located within walking distance of minority neighborhoods? According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2014, a year when Black women only accounted for about 13% of the U.S. population, they made up 28% of those having abortions. Each year in New York City, more Black babies are aborted than born.\nPro-lifers have been pointing out\u00a0Sanger\u2019s despicable views for decades, and Planned Parenthood didn\u2019t just find out about Sanger\u2019s past yesterday. So why is Planned Parenthood only now rejecting its founder\u2014and why isn\u2019t the entire organization doing it?\nIt strikes me how blatantly we see the double standard at work here. Sure,\u00a0Sanger\u00a0is getting \u201ccanceled,\u201d but only at one of Planned Parenthood\u2019s facilities and in a relatively mild way. Planned Parenthood still talks about the good she allegedly did and is willing to ascribe her transgressions to being a woman \u201cof her time.\u201d\nHow ironic that the left doesn\u2019t give America\u2019s Founders the same courtesy. There\u2019s no allowance for context; no allowances for being \u201cmen of their time.\u201d There is only cancellation and demands that everything they produced (ie. America) be destroyed.\nUntil Planned Parenthood stops dehumanizing living, growing children in the womb; until it ceases performing abortions; and until it stops locating facilities and advertising heavily in and around minority communities, it will continue carrying out\u00a0Margaret Sanger\u2019s original vision. \u201cCanceling\u201d\u00a0Margaret Sanger\u00a0and the symbolic gesture of removing her name from a building won\u2019t change any of that.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Washington Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
