The so-called Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (WHPA) and a new set of \u201cabortion messaging do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u201d from the House of Representatives Pro Choice Caucus are their latest attempt to avoid the \u201cinconvenient truth\u201d that abortion kills babies.\nOn May 11, for the second time in less than three months, the Senate voted against allowing consideration of the WHPA. Its sponsors want you to believe that the bill would simply \u201ccodify Roe v. Wade\u201d in case, as appears likely, the Supreme Court overrules that decision, which created the right to abortion. In fact, the WHPA would gar far beyond Roe, attempting to prohibit any government anywhere from doing anything that might, potentially or indirectly, reduce the likelihood that abortions will actually take place.\nNot only that, the WHPA would require every state and local government to repeal any existing laws, regulations, rules, anything that also could have that effect. Members of Congress, who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, should know that Congress has no authority to dictate how state and local governments exercise powers that the Constitution gives them.\nEven in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court acknowledged that abortion affects two human beings, referring multiple times to \u201cunborn children,\u201d \u201cpregnant women,\u201d and even \u201cmother.\u201d In fact, the Court said that the presence of the unborn child made abortion \u201cinherently different\u201d than other rights. As radical as the WHPA is, as recently as 2017, it referred a dozen times to \u201cwoman\u201d and multiple times to \u201cchild.\u201d The bill stated its purpose as protecting \u201ca woman\u2019s right and ability to determine whether and when to bear a child.\u201d\n>>> EVENT:\u00a0Life After Roe Symposium\nThat, however, was too close to reality for current abortion extremists. The WHPA introduced last year expands its focus from pregnant women to \u201cpeople with the capacity for pregnancy.\u201d These include \u201ccisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, [and] those who identify with a different gender.\u201d The bill entertains these hypothetical categories while completely deleting any suggestion, hint, or whisper of the actual human being\u2014the unborn child\u2014who actually exists. The bill even scrapped its prior definition of abortion because it referred to a \u201clive birth\u201d (of what?) and a \u201cdead fetus\u201d (that must once have been alive).\nLeading feminists once embraced, rather than repudiated, the truth about women and babies. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, for example, published The Revolution magazine from 1868 to 1872, regularly arguing that the law should treat abortion for what it is, \u201cchild murder.\u201d The first women to enter the medical profession separated killing babies from health care for women; Dr. Charlotte Lozier, for example, campaigned both against abortion and for women\u2019s rights. Women, er, potentially pregnant people have come a long way, but not necessarily in the right direction.\nThen there are the abortion spinmeisters. Organizations promoting abortion have long produced various manuals, guides, and recommendations for \u201cabortion messaging.\u201d The latest instructions on this is a list of \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d from the House Pro-Choice Caucus with examples of \u201charmful\u201d and \u201chelpful\u201d language. The confusion, however, starts right at the top. The Pro-Choice Caucus\u2019s first example of harmful language is the word \u201cchoice.\u201d Wait, what? Hasn\u2019t choice been lynchpin of the abortion movement\u2019s messaging for the last 50 years? Last September, in defending the WHPA, members of the Pro-Choice Caucus routinely described abortion as a \u201cdeeply personal choice\u201d and pro-life legislators as \u201canti-choice.\u201d According to the Pro-Choice Caucus\u2019s latest guidelines, however, Caucus members were actually using harmful language that, no doubt unbeknownst to them at the time, was undermining their own cause.\nThe Pro-Choice Caucus now rejects another of the movement\u2019s longstanding clarion calls. In 1992, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton said that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d The Democratic Platform that year endorsed \u201creproductive choice\u201d (there\u2019s that word again) including \u201cthe right to safe, legal abortion.\u201d Four years later, with Clinton running for re-election, the platform said: \u201cOur goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare.\u201d The Democratic platform made the same point in the next two cycles, with the 2004 document stating directly: \u201cAbortion should be safe, legal, and rare.\u201d Hillary Clinton even used the same phrase during her 2008 presidential campaign.\n>>>\u00a0We Have a Duty To Protect the Unborn\nNot anymore. The 2008 and 2012 Democratic platforms dropped \u201crare,\u201d while still endorsing efforts to \u201creduce abortions.\u201d But since 2012, abortion advocates have embraced killing babies as fully legitimate all by itself. Signs at their rallies and protests often say \u201cAbortion On Demand and without Apology.\u201d The Pro-Choice Caucus also rejects any suggestion that abortion should be rare; its website even include a photograph of caucus members on the Capitol steps holding signs that read \u201cAbortion Is Essential\u201d and \u201cLiberate Abortion.\u201d\nWe cannot avoid answering the question Reagan asked almost four decades ago about the value of human life by pretending that human beings never existed before they were born or that men can somehow become pregnant, or by using some new words suggested by the latest focus group. Abortion kills babies, and its advocates are loudly telling us the value they place on human life.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in Christian Renewal Magazine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
