He pledged to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 and he has been making good on that promise.\nTrump has spent the past four years pushing policies that threaten our health, our rights and our lives. He and his right-wing allies are putting our lives at risk every single day they are in office,\u00a0and Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon is committed to doing everything we can to vote them out in November.\u00a0\nAs the nation grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and stands up to state-sponsored violence against Black people, it\u2019s clearer than ever the public wants engaged, competent leaders who will work to keep us safe and increase healthcare access \u2014 not undermine it.\u00a0\nWe know we can win this. We\u2019ve done it before, and we will do it again.\u00a0\n\nEmily McLain is executive director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon.Courtesy photo\nJust look at 2018, when our collective power brought in a sea change, radically shifting who\u2019s in office. We elected the first pro-reproductive health majority to the U.S. House of Representatives, and here in Oregon, we soundly defeated the anti-abortion Ballot Measure 106.\nBut, all of those achievements could be undermined by judges who will affect our rights for generations to come. Since 2016, the courts have often become the last \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 line of defense against dangerous and unconstitutional attacks on basic rights. Yet Trump has remade the federal courts with judges hostile to the right to access sexual and reproductive health care. To date, he has appointed nearly 200 judges to the federal bench, with 20% of the federal judiciary appointed by his administration.\u00a0\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly struck down an anti-abortion law in Louisiana that was identical to a Texas law that was ruled as unconstitutional four years earlier. The Louisiana law would have forced abortion providers to obtain local hospital admitting privileges, a medically unnecessary move meant to make abortion more difficult to access. Surprisingly, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the majority \u2014 not because he\u2019s newly supportive of abortion rights, but because he felt bound by the Texas precedent.\nWhile access is protected for now, more than a dozen other abortion lawsuits are one step away from the court. These cases include a dangerous Arkansas law that would ban medication abortion, as well as a deeply unethical policy by the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement that seeks to prevent young, undocumented women in government custody from accessing abortion.\nAnd it\u2019s not just abortion. All reproductive care is on the docket. Last month, the Supreme Court upheld Trump administration rules that allow employers and universities to push their religious or moral beliefs on employees and students by denying them access to insurance that covers birth control.\u00a0\nBirth control should not be controversial. Nearly nine in 10 women will use it in their lifetimes. It is essential, time-sensitive care that treats serious conditions and allows people to plan if and when they get pregnant.\u00a0\n\nIN OREGON:\u00a0Reproductive rights prevail even as pandemic limits some services\n\nThis year marks not only the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s right to vote, but also the 60th anniversary of the FDA\u2019s approval of the first birth control pill. Since that historic moment, access to birth control has been responsible for one-third of women\u2019s wage gains relative to men\u2019s. The ability to get the pill before age 21 has been found to be the most influential factor enabling women already in college to stay there.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control benefit expanded contraceptive coverage with no out-of-pocket costs for more than 62 million women. Now, because of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, many of their health plans may no longer cover birth control based on the personal objections of bosses and universities.\nOn top of that, the Trump administration has dismantled Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. It has pushed ineffective abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. It has denied care to immigrants. It has gagged Title X health providers and forced Planned Parenthood health centers out of the federal program that provides affordable reproductive health care to people with low incomes.\u00a0\n\nOPINION:\u00a0Adding a citizenship question to census an attack on immigrant health care\n\nOpening the door to reduced health care access would have been a mistake in any environment. But as we struggle against the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and systemic racism, the dire implications of this decision are clearer than ever.\nOur ability to control our own bodies and futures lie in jeopardy like never before. Fortunately, Oregonians have elected leaders and have passed landmark laws that will safeguard us from many of Trump\u2019s harmful policies. That\u2019s why we must remain vigilant to continue holding politicians accountable for their records targeting our health, rights and safety.\nEmily McLain is the executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon and Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon.
