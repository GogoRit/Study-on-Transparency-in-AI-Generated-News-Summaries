Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect,\u201d Harris said last year. \u201cThat's called pre-clearance.\u201dIn a tweet, National Right to Life said Harris is the \u201cmost pro-abortion of pro-abortion politicians. Anything and everything goes.\u201dThe most pro-abortion of pro-abortion politicians.

Prior to becoming a U.S. senator, she was attorney general of California.\u201cSen. Harris supports a policy of abortion on demand at any time, anywhere, and under any circumstances,\u201d said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life. \u201cSadly, both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris see the lives of precious unborn babies as expendable.
