In an exclusive interview on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d Wednesday, Houck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie, recounted the moment she looked out her front window to find roughly 25 uniformed agents with guns and shields surrounding her front door.\n\u201cMy entire front yard, you could barely see it, it was covered with at least 15 big trucks and cars,\u201d the mother of seven said. \u201cThere were 20, 25, 30, men, women, completely in jackets with shields and helmets and guns. They were behind cars. It was something I would never expect to see on my front lawn.\u201d\nRyan-Marie said the agents raided their home with \u201cguns drawn,\u201d on her family, describing in an earlier interview how they put her husband in \u201cshackles\u201d while her children watched in fear.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRyan-Marie Houck claims approximately 25 armed FBI agents barged into her home. Fox News\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d she told host Tucker Carlson. \u201cAs you can imagine, it\u2019s hard to even express the victimization and how traumatized we all are due to this unnecessary thing that happened to us.\u201d\nRyan-Marie said her children have been \u201ccrying\u201d and are afraid to sleep alone since her husband\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cThe older ones, we can talk, we can cry. We\u2019ve had some counseling, we have more counseling to do,\u201d she told Tucker Carlson. \u201cAnd the little ones, they\u2019re scared. There\u2019s a lot of crying and a lot of unrestful sleep. A lot of kids in our bed at night and in the morning.\u201d\n\n\n3\n\nRyan-Marie, wife of pro-life activist Mark Houck, said her children were left \u201ctraumatized\u201d after witnessing the FBI arrest her husband. Fox News\nThe raid and subsequent arrest reportedly stemmed from an altercation Houck, 48, had with a Planned Parenthood escort in Philadelphia in October 2021, when he was accused of pushing a 72-year-old man outside the clinic after the escort allegedly verbally harassed Houck\u2019s 12-year-old son. The pro-life father, who routinely engages in prayerful protests outside abortion clinics, is co-founder and president of The King\u2019s Men, a Catholic ministry that aims to spiritually mentor young men.\nThe Philadelphia Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that officers responded to the Planned Parenthood on the afternoon of October 13 last year, but that no charges were filed against Houck, and he was not arrested. The Philadelphia district attorney also declined to prosecute Houck over the incident.\nBut for reasons unknown, Houck\u2019s case caught the attention of the Justice Department. In May, he received a \u201ctarget letter\u201d from the DOJ telling him he was being investigated by a grand jury for violating the Freedom of Access Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act, which makes it a federal crime to use force with the intent to injure, intimidate and interfere with anyone because that person provides reproductive health care.\n\n\n3\n\nRyan-Marie Houck admitted her children needed counseling after the FBI raid. Fox News\nHouck\u2019s attorney and senior counsel at the Thomas More Society, Peter Breen, condemned the arrest as an abuse of power from President Biden\u2019s Department of Justice (DOJ) during the \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d interview, where he accused the department of trying to intimidate pro-life Americans.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\tPennsylvania pro-life activist arrested by FBI, charged with assaulting clinic escort\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was not a federal crime. We have controlling case law on that, strong defenses, but instead, they\u2019ve taken an innocent man and made an example out of him, presumably to send a message to pro-life people and people of faith across this country,\u201d he said.\nAfter the Philadelphia district attorney declined to prosecute Houck over the incident, Breen said the man involved brought a private criminal complaint against Houck. However, that man never showed up to his own court hearings that he initiated. Houck\u2019s lawyer said they have considered taking legal action for abuse of process.\n\u201cThis was reckless and outrageous,\u201d Breen told Carlson. \u201cIt put the Houck family in unnecessary danger. We\u2019ve offered to bring him in. Didn\u2019t get a response. Even if you\u2019re going to arrest a regular person, you just send a couple of agents, they knock on the door, not dragging the head of the family out, violating the sanctity of the home, pointing guns at them. This was outrageous and uncalled for.\u201d\nBreen said Thomas More Society has retained some of the best legal talent in Philadelphia to assist in the case.\n\n\u201cIf we can push back against the Justice Department here, we can get them to stop and not do this to someone else,\u201d he said.\nHouck pleaded not guilty to two counts associated with the charges against him related to the alleged assault of the escort.\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\nassault\n\n\ncatholic\n\n\ndepartment of justice\n\n\nfbi\n\n\njustice department\n\n\npennsylvania\n\n\n9/29/22 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPrincess Diana\u2019s heartfelt letter on display at Las Vega...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Concerts\n\n\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post\n\n\n\t\t\tGet seats.
