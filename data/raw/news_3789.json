Despite this, his feminist contributions are often ignored and denied. \nEven Indian Feminists often limit his work to the betterment of Dalit women\u2019s lives. This invisibalization of Ambedkar and his life\u2019s work is symptomatic of upper caste feminist movements. Ambedkar is only called upon when upper-caste women speak to and of Dalit women, beyond that Babasaheb\u2019s work in pushed to the margins.\u00a0\nAmbedkar\u00b4s contribution is not an outlier to feminist struggles but has been instrumental in shaping women\u2019s rights in the country. \nIn his essay Castes in India Babasaheb outlines how endogamy was the essence of the caste system. He details how the focus on maintaining caste exclusivity leads to the rise of Sati and child marriage. He articulates through this piece the linkages between caste and the subordination of women. Ambedkar has always maintained that women were the gateways of the caste system and the caste system lay down a structure for the subordination of women and it had to be uprooted. He saw castes\u2019 exclusionary violence and subjugation of women inherent to the very process that lead to caste formation.\nAmbedkar in his other works details the gendered violence that women face withing Hindu Smritis and Vedic texts. In the Manusmriti for example, Manu set the ideal for women to worship her husband despite all his flaws. He says \u201cManu can hardly be said to be more tender to women than he was to the Shudra.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved\u201d-B R Ambedkar\nAmbedkar did not only right for women\u2019s rights, he continuously worked with women to realize the ambition of equality amongst genders.\u00a0 He advocated for the rights of sex workers and spoke out against the casteist nature that was the foundation of sex-work. He worked to ensure that women were also protected under labour laws. He was instrumental in reducing the number of working hours and improving the working conditions. In 1928, as a member of the Legislative Council of Bombay, he supported a Bill granting paid maternity leave for women working in factories. He was of the view that if the employer was getting benefits off of women\u2019s labour, they should also be supporting women, partly, when they are on their maternity leave. The other half he believed should be paid by the government as it was in the interest of the nation. Ambedkar also believed that women have the right over their own body. He said that conception was a choice that women should make. He argued for reproductive rights for women, recommended that birth control facilities be made available to them, and was a strong advocate of women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\nAmbedkar Jayanti, Anand Teltumbde arrest and the casteist face of power\n He also drafted the Mines Maternity Benefit Act which asked for equal wages and equal representation of women on the welfare fund for the coal mine workers, and emphasised equal citizenship and women\u2019s right to economic development as crucial for women\u2019s rights in India. Between 1942 and 1946 he passed several progressive legislations for women that dealt with equal wages for equal work, casual and privilege leave, compensation in cases of injury, and pension.\nHindu Code Bill: Ambedkar\u00b4s antidote to\u00a0 Brahminical Patriarchy\nOne of the biggest testaments to Ambedkar\u2019s feminism was the Hindu Code Bill. Ambedkar was entrusted with drafting the Hindu Code Bill. This Bill was to codify property practices for men and women, design law of maintanence, marriage, divorce, adoption amongst other issues. Ambedkar used this as an opportunity to ensure women had full access to rights within the system. He included the issue of abolition of birth-right to property, property by survivorship, half share for daughters, conversion of women\u2019s limited estate into an absolute estate, abolition of caste in matters of marriage and adoption, and the principle of monogamy and divorce. Ambedkar stood by these issues in face of strong opposition from conservative Hindu men in the parliament. \nImage courtesy: Nehru Memorial Library\nThe focus of the bill was to give women absolute right over property, absence of endogamy, the access to divorce, and to relieve women of the threat of polygamy. \nThe aim was to oppose the practices of Brahminical patriarchy and thus stop its reproduction.\u00a0\nThe Bill kept getting tabled in the parliament with promises to address it \u201cat a later point in time\u201d but this never happened. The house was well aware of the power of disruption that the bill possessed. It could shake the foundations of patriarchal control over production and reproduction. \nIn despair, Ambedkar resigned. In his resignation speech Ambedkar said:\n\u201cThe Hindu Code was the greatest social reform measure ever undertaken by the legislature in this country. No law passed by the Indian legislature in the past or likely to be passed in the future can be compared to it in point of its significance. To leave inequality between class and class, between sex and sex, which is the soul of Hindu society, untouched and to go on passing legislation relating to economic problems is to make a farce of our Constitution and to build a palace on a dung heap. This is the significance I attached to the Hindu Code. It is for its sake that I stayed on, notwithstanding my differences.\u201d\nMovements headed by Ambedkar always had women walking side-by-side with the men. During the Mahad Satyagraha 10,000 men and women walked together to break the law on not allowing the Mahars to drink water. This was in contrast to Gandhi\u2019s Salt Satyagrah, during which there were no women who were allowed to participate. In the Kalaram temple-entry movement Ambedkar inspired women to come out of their social arenas and speak with courage. In 1930, 15000 people came out to be part of this movement. Radhabai Vadale, who was one of the women who was moved by Babasaheb\u2019s call, said, \u201c\u201dIt is better to die a hundred times than to live a life of humiliation.\u201d This was a testament to the fact that Ambedkar had inspired confidence in women to fight for their rights.\u00a0\nIn an address to the All-India Depressed Classes Women\u2019s Conference he told women:\n\u201cGive education to your children. Instill ambition in them\u2026 Don\u2019t be in a hurry to marry; marriage is a liability. You should not impose it upon children unless financially they are able to meet the liabilities arising from them. Above all let each girl who marries stand up to her husband, claim to be her husband\u2019s friend ad equal, and refuse to be his slave. \u201c\nThis was telling of Ambedkar\u2019s feminism and his push to ensure women were not enslaved to the patriarchal ideas as mapped in the Hindu religion. Ambedkar rallied for the rights to equal partnership in marriage well before Savarna feminists, who appropriated his call.\u00a0\nDr. Ambedkar started a newspaper called \u2018Mooknayak\u2019 in January 1920. He started a biweekly called \u2018Bahishkrut Bharat\u2019 in 1927, and both these newspapers regularly covered issues related to women and their rights. In a time where women were constantly pushed to the margins, Ambedkar worked to fight against this marginalization.\u00a0\nWhile speaking to a gathering of Dalit women, Ambedkar has asked, \u201c What is the difference between children born to Kayasatha and other savarna women sitting in this meeting and us?You must think and realise that you have as much character and purity as a Brahman woman. In fact, the courage and will to act that you possess, even the Brahman woman lacks. Then why must children born to you, be insulted? You\u2019ve not given this a thought, or else you would have organized a Satyagrah\u2026\u201d\nAmbedkar\u00b4s ideas have helped feminists in India to understand that their struggle is incomplete without Dalit women. This introspection also made led women\u00b4s movement more inclusive to the transgender people.\nDonate Independent journalism can\u2019t be independent without your support, contribute by clicking below.\n\n\n1000\u20b9\n100\u20b9\n50\u20b9\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2024\n\n\nM\nT\nW\nT\nF\nS\nS\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0123\n\n\n45678910\n\n\n11121314151617\n\n\n18192021222324\n\n\n25262728293031\n\n\n\n\u00ab Dec\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n TAGSambedkarcaste systemfeminismfeministsHindu code billIndian feministspatriarchywomen\u00b4s movement \n\n\nShare\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n Previous articleSC Slams Karnataka Govt Scrapping of 4 percent Muslim Reservation as \u201cShaky and Flawed\u201dNext articleNandini-Amul Saga: Corporatisation of Cooperatives editor  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n Karnataka \n\n2023 Karnataka Assembly Elections: What BJP Lost, Gained and Retained? \n\n \n\n\n\n Demolitions \n\nMP:Fresh Attack on Adivasis Asserting their rights and opposing Atrocities against them \n\n \n\n\n\n Karnataka \n\nKarnataka Assembly Speaker U.T Khader\u2019s love for a die-hard Hindutva Guru Sri Sri Ravishankar \n\n  \n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe To Newsletter\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter  \r\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\n\n\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n\n\n\nBatla House: Nearly 900 Rendered Homeless After Slum Demolition \nSeptember 26, 2020 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMP: Externment Notice Served to Adivasi Activist Leading Struggles for Constitutional... \nAugust 2, 2021 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDrop of 11-12 million in Salaried Jobs since Last year: CMIE... \nJune 2, 2021 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDissent and Argument \u2013 Vibhishana and Arjuna \nSeptember 25, 2021 \n\n\n Load more \n\n\n\n\n\nHOT NEWS\n\n\n\n Farmers Protest \nKMP-KGP highway blockade\u2019s success, warning to the government: SKM\n\n \n\n\n\n Law/Rights \n\u201cNot seditious to disagree with Govt:\u201d Supreme Court\n\n \n\n\n\n Law/Rights \n\u201cNo Encounters in our Name\u201d- Protest on 9th December in Bangalore...\n\n \n\n\n\n Hijab Row \nHijab not essential to Islam: Karnataka Hijab Ban in Colleges Upheld...\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Tagsadani\nAmbani\namit shah\nanti CAA protests\nBangalore\nbhima koregaon\nBihar\nBJP\nCAA\ncaste\nCongress\nconstitution\ncoronavirus\ncovid-19\nDalits\nDelhi\neconomy\nfarmers\nfarmers protest\nfarmers protests\nfarm laws\nharyana\nhindutva\nHuman rights\nIndia\nKarnataka\nKerala\nlockdown\nmodi\nmuslims\nNarendra Modi\nNRC\npandemic\npolice\nprotests\nPunjab\nRSS\nSKM\nSupreme Court\nUAPA\nup\nUS\nuttar pradesh\nwomen\nYogi Adityanath\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT USGauri lankesh news is an independent news website, pro- people and  committed to constitutional values.
