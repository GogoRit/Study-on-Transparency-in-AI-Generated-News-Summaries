Scripps\nRep. Erin Grall shares her support for the bill that would enact a 15-week abortion ban.\n\n\"We know more today than ever about the development of children in the womb,\" said Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach.Grall said the bill is modeled after a Mississippi law currently under U.S. Supreme Court review, challenging the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.She called her bill \"an opportunity\" to ready the state for change.\"We will be saving nearly 5,000 babies a year with this bill in place,\" Grall said.\n\nE.W. Scripps\nRep. Fentrice Driskell shares her displeasure with the bill.\n\nOpponents offered fierce public comment, calling the policy a dangerous and \"extreme\" barrier to women's health care.Democrats said without a Supreme Court reversal, the policy would be unconstitutional on day one and also come into conflict with Florida's privacy laws, causing another judicial hurdle.\"What are we doing right now, having this discussion? I believe it's a waste of your taxpayer dollars,\" Rep. Fentrice Driskell, D- Tampa.Others warned the bill would disproportionally impact the poor, disabled or victims of sex assault who might not have the means or time to get an abortion.\n\nE.W. Scripps\nRep. Anna Eskamani worries that the bill will negatively impact lower-income individuals seeking an abortion.\n\n\"If you need an abortion, and you have the means to travel outside of the state, you will still be able to have an abortion. The rest of us won't be so lucky,\" Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando.Both the House and Senate versions of the bill have two more stops before reaching their full chambers.Leaders in the GOP majority and governor say they\u2019re open to supporting it.\n\n\nCopyright 2022 Scripps Media, Inc.
