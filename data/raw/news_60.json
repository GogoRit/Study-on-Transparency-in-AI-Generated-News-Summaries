Local governments have added fuel to the fire by passing anti-abortion ordinances that confuse residents about their rights and increase the ever-present stigma around seeking abortion care.\nThat\u2019s why, for the first time, reproductive rights, health, and justice groups in our state are joining forces to expand essential health care access for all Texans by creating the Texas Abortion Access Network. Join us for TAAN\u2019s launch on Thursday, August 20 at 6 PM CT, to become a founding member of TAAN and hear about how you can get involved.\u00a0\nIn the last year alone, 13 cities in Texas have passed so-called \u201csanctuary cities for the unborn\u201d ordinances. These ordinances attempt to ban abortion in those cities if Roe v. Wade is overturned, and some even attempt to ban contraception. At one point, many of these ordinances even declared abortion providers and other advocacy groups to be \u201ccriminal organizations.\u201d\nWe sued and successfully pushed those cities to remove the most harmful parts of those ordinances \u2014 but those laws are just one example of the many ways Texas politicians have attacked reproductive freedom. For years, Texas politicians have piled restriction after restriction on abortion access. From enacting 2013\u2019s House Bill 2, which led to the closure of half of all Texan abortion clinics, to banning abortions during the early COVID-19 pandemic, elected officials in Texas continually work to block essential healthcare.\nBut together, we are fighting back for the right to determine our own lives and destinies.\nThe Texas Abortion Access Network (TAAN) is a new collaboration between the ACLU of Texas, AFIYA Center, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, Progress Texas, Texas Equal Access Fund, Texas Freedom Network, Jane\u2019s Due Process, and Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance. We\u2019re building community among Texas residents who are fed up with attacks on their reproductive freedom.\u00a0\nThrough TAAN, we are building grassroots power across Texas. We will not only defend against further restrictions but also empower activists to dive into action and put proactive, protective laws on the books in their hometowns. We are building a diverse base of volunteers that represent every corner of the state and equipping them with the tools they need to be leaders in their communities.\u00a0\u00a0A key component of TAAN is the Texas Abortion Access Academy, an 8-week online training program led by abortion access experts. The academy will cover a comprehensive array of topics to build each person\u2019s capacity to become an effective abortion rights advocate. We\u2019re including a crash-course on the status of abortion in Texas, how to talk to others about abortion, background on reproductive justice, and how to advocate and organize for abortion access. At the end of the program, cohort members will have gained the skills to lobby their local government, have difficult conversations about abortion, and get others involved in the movement.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s be clear: Attacks on abortion care won\u2019t stop Texans from needing, and seeking, abortion care. They\u2019ll just ensure that the most vulnerable Texans have a much more difficult and costly experience accessing it. We\u2019ve seen it again and again \u2014 restrictions to abortion care disproportionately harm Black and Brown people, people struggling to make ends meet, those who are already parenting, folks in rural areas, undocumented immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and young people.\u00a0\u00a0\nWithout access to reproductive health care, our communities can\u2019t thrive. And while abortion remains legal, the fact that the Supreme Court nearly allowed a Louisiana law\u2014 one identical to a Texas law they struck down just four years ago \u2014 to take effect shows that we can\u2019t take the judicial system for granted. Our rights won\u2019t be handed to us, we have to take them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About the Issues on This Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Abortion                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Reproductive Freedom                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            State Abortion Legislation                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nIn Alabama, Embryos Are People and It Won't Stop There\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nACLU Calls Out Junk Science at the Heart of the Supreme Court Medication Abortion Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Podcast                            \nBusy Philipps Is Fed up With Abortion Bans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nBusy Philipps Named as ACLU Artist Ambassador for Reproductive Freedom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
