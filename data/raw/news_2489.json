[+] Fund 2020 Election Forum to Focus on Abortion and Reproductive Rights event in Columbia, SC on June, 22 2019. - Many of the Democratic candidates running for president are in Columbia to make appearances at the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention and the Planned Parenthood Election Forum on June 22.

We must do everything we can to get him out of office this November,\u201d she added. \u201cFor us, and for so many, the choice is clear. Planned Parenthood Action Fund is endorsing Joe Biden for president.\u201d\n\n\nThe statement noted Biden\u2019s support for abortion, contraception and sex education and his role in getting the Affordable Care Act passed as motivations for the endorsement, while applauding his reversal of his support of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal spending on abortion.\n\nThe non-profit organization, which gets about a third of its funding from government grants and is a frequent target for pro-life Republicans, consistently backs Democrats with its PAC, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, with 98% of contributions going to Democrats and 0% to Republicans so far this cycle.\nThe endorsement comes after the PAC kicked off a $45 million program targeted at battleground states, three times what it spent in 2016 and eight times what it spent in 2018.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nPlanned Parenthood is a non-profit organization that provides reproductive health care services to millions of Americans, including contraception, cancer screenings and abortions. Its role as an abortion provider is a frequent point of critcism for pro-life Republicans, who have called to defund the organization arguing that their tax dollars should not fund abortion.\nKey Quote\n\"It\u2019s a simple proposition for me: health care is a right, not a privilege dependent on race, gender, income, or ZIP code,\u201d Biden said in response to the endorsement. \u201cAs President, I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care, including reproductive health care. I'm proud to stand with Planned Parenthood in this fight.\"\n\nChief Critic\nPro-life conservatives took to Twitter to slam McGill for telling NPR that 2020 is a \u201clife and death\u201d election, referring to health care. \u201cInteresting choice of words from Planned Parenthood. I agree this is life and death. I am proud to stand up and protect life. #ProLife,\u201d tweeted Minnesota Senate candidate and former Congressman Jason Lewis.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Andrew SolenderEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
