Thiessen\nThe Washington Post\nJanuary 24, 2020\n\n\n\nHistory is being made on Capitol Hill this week. No, I\u2019m not talking about the presidential impeachment trial; that\u2019s been done before. I\u2019m talking about President Trump\u2019s\u00a0decision\u00a0to become the first US president to speak in person at the March for Life.\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how important this development is. No president has ever attended the March for Life \u2014 not Ronald Reagan, not George H.W. Bush, not my old boss, George W. Bush. They all addressed the marchers remotely, via telephone or satellite link. The arrangement always seemed absurd. The marchers were on the Mall, literally in sight of the White House. Why not go out and join them? But despite the best of efforts of many inside previous administrations, none did.\nThe message to pro-life conservatives was clear: They were the black sheep of the Republican coalition. Their presence was tolerated because their votes were needed. But while Republican presidential candidates couldn\u2019t win the nomination without declaring themselves pro-life, the GOP establishment not-so-secretly loathed pro-lifers. The prevailing attitude was: There they go again, making people uncomfortable by talking about\u00a0abortion.\nPro-lifers took the scraps they were thrown from the GOP table because they had nowhere else to go. In today\u2019s Democratic Party, abortion is no longer treated as a necessary evil but as something to be embraced and even celebrated. In 2018, for example, New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, lit up One World Trade Center \u2014 the Freedom Tower \u2014 to\u00a0celebrate\u00a0the passage of a new law that removes most restrictions on abortion, even in the third trimester.\nPro-life Democrats have all but disappeared on Capitol Hill, and the Democratic orthodoxy today is taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand up to the moment of birth. Dissent from that orthodoxy is not tolerated. For more than 40 years, former vice president Joe Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. He said that as a Catholic, he was personally pro-life and that \u201cthose of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.\u201d But in 2020, that isn\u2019t good enough. Biden, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination,\u00a0caved in\u00a0to the pro-abortion radicals last June, abandoned his principles and embraced taxpayer funding.\nGiven their lack of other options, pro-lifers accepted their second-class-citizen status in the GOP. Then along came Trump, a man who doesn\u2019t care what the Republican establishment thinks. He has embraced the pro-life movement in a way no other president has. In 2018, he became the first sitting president to\u00a0address\u00a0the annual Campaign for Life gala of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, founded in 1992. And now he will make history again at the March for Life.\nTrump will be greeted as a pro-life hero, because he is one. He put two outstanding conservative justices on the Supreme Court and has appointed a record number of federal appeals court judges. He has allowed states to defund Planned Parenthood, defunded the pro-abortion\u00a0U.N. Population Fund, and restored and expanded a ban, known as the\u00a0Mexico City policy, on taxpayer funds for groups that perform abortions overseas. He has\u00a0exempted\u00a0organizations, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, that have moral objections to providing abortifacient drugs, from the Obamacare Health and Human Services mandate, and he has stood by the nuns as they fight to protect their religious liberty in the\u00a0Supreme Court.\nThe president recently delivered the\u00a0biggest blow to Planned Parenthood\u00a0in three decades when he implemented the\u00a0Protect Life Rule, which prohibits Title X family-planning funds from going to any clinic that performs on-site abortions. Planned Parenthood\u00a0announced\u00a0last year that it would leave the Title X program, barring a court victory.\nNo other president has amassed such a record of pro-life victories. But Trump has done more than simply govern as a pro-life conservative; he has embraced pro-life conservatives without shame or hesitation. Want to know why so many Republicans don\u2019t care about Trump\u2019s ham-handed phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president or his personal moral failings? Because he is an ally like no other in the fight to save innocent unborn lives.\nPro-life Americans sense that his pro-life record is one of the reasons Democrats have been searching for a pretext to impeach him. And they know a second Trump term would mean more conservatives justices on the Supreme Court, more conservatives on the federal appeals courts and more opportunities to rescue babies from the abortionist\u2019s hand.\nSo, let the Democrats pursue their doomed impeachment circus in the Senate. As they do, something truly important is happening on Capitol Hill: An American president is finally marching in defense of human life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMarc A.
