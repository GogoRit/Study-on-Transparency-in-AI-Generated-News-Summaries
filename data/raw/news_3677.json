She says she\u2019d vote to \u201ccodify Roe\u201d \u2013 that is, pass a bill to restore the abortion protections that Roe v Wade established in 1973, which the Supreme Court overturned this summer.\nSo the candidate\u2019s answer Sept. 8 on an Anchorage Daily News podcast was puzzling.\n\u201cAre there any limits on abortion that you would support?\u201d host Elizabeth Harball asked.\n\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m not extreme on this issue,\u201d Peltola said. \u201cI think that the standards that have been set over the last 50 years, or 49 years, in terms of middle ground on \u2013 I think most states the limit is 16 weeks, unless it\u2019s a medical emergency. I think some of the sideboards are very important. And I think most Alaskans would agree.\u201d\nIn an interview a few days later, Peltola said much the same.\n\u201cI think most states have a cap at 16 weeks. I think that\u2019s reasonable,\u201d she said.\nLimiting abortions to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy, even with exceptions, is not what you\u2019d expect an abortion-rights candidate to endorse. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has proposed a 15-week limit and it\u2019s been portrayed as a ban.\nWhen asked about it, Peltola\u2019s campaign says she misspoke and meant to refer to the viability standard in Roe v. Wade. (Roe established the right to abortion until a fetus is viable outside the womb. In 1973, viability was generally thought to occur 24 or more weeks after conception but medical technology has improved to allow for earlier survival.)\nPeltola, in an emailed statement from her campaign, said she shouldn\u2019t have gotten into it.\n\u201cPoliticians should not be discussing the number of weeks associated with viability,\u201d she said in the email. \u201cThat is a discussion that should be had between the person, their doctor, and their family \u2013 not politicians.\u201d\u00a0\nAbortion is a known political minefield for candidates. But Peltola faced no apparent blowback after her comment on the ADN podcast.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, one of several abortion-rights groups supporting her, is still on board.\n\u201cWe appreciate Congresswoman Peltola clarifying her stance as she has been a reproductive rights champion for Alaskans,\u201d Jennifer Allen, the group\u2019s chief executive said by email Tuesday.\u00a0\nAll of Peltola\u2019s rivals are running to her right on the issue. Republican Sarah Palin describes herself as \u201cunapologetically pro-life.\u201d Republican Nick Begich also calls himself \u201cpro-life\u201d and says abortion law should be left to the states. Libertarian Chris Bye supports leaving it up to the states, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t            Liz Ruskin, Alaska Public Media                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Ruskin is the Washington, D.C., correspondent at Alaska Public Media.
