Wade abortion decision. A Texas law banning almost all abortions will now take effect Aug. 25.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Jason Garza for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has issued its official judgment in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, clearing the way for Texas\u2019 \u201ctrigger law\u201d banning almost all abortions to go into effect Aug. 25.\nThe law will increase the criminal and civil penalties associated with abortion, but the procedure is already virtually outlawed in Texas under an old statute that was in effect before the high court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973.\nThe state\u2019s two dozen abortion clinics stopped providing abortions almost immediately after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June, fearing criminal prosecution under those pre-Roe statutes, which make it a crime punishable by up to five years in prison to provide or \u201cfurnish the means\u201d for an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose statutes are separate from the trigger law, which the Legislature passed in 2021. That law, which is triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, increases the penalties for performing an abortion up to life in prison. The trigger law also says that the attorney general \u201cshall\u201d bring a lawsuit to seek a civil penalty of no less than $100,000 per abortion performed.\nBoth the pre-Roe statute and the trigger law have only narrow exceptions to save the life of the pregnant patient. The trigger law specifically exempts the pregnant patient from prosecution.\nWhile other states\u2019 trigger laws went into effect immediately, Texas\u2019 was written to go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issued its official judgment, after which no rehearings or appeals can be filed. That process usually takes about a month.\nImmediately after the pre-Roe statutes went into effect, a handful of abortion clinics brought a legal challenge seeking to block them from being enforced. Although they were granted a temporary restraining order, the Supreme Court of Texas later ruled that the laws could be civilly enforced while the challenge made its way through the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been no known legal challenges filed to block the trigger law from going into effect.\nIn an advisory issued Wednesday, Attorney General Ken Paxton said his office will \u201cstand ready\u201d to help local prosecutors enforce the new penalties.\n\u201cTexas law in a post-Roe world has already been written,\u201d Paxton wrote. \u201cNow that the Supreme Court has finally overturned Roe, I will do everything in my power to protect mothers, families, and unborn children, and to uphold the state laws duly enacted by the Texas Legislature.\u201d\n\nWhen you join us at The Texas Tribune Festival Sept. 22-24 in downtown Austin, you\u2019ll hear from changemakers who are driving innovation, lawmakers who are taking charge with new policies, industry leaders who are pushing Texas forward and so many others.
