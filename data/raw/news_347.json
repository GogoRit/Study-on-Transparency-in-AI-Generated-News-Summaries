However, the president, Andrzej Duda, has proposed a slightly less strict \u201ccompromise\u201d bill to implement the court\u2019s decision.\nThis week, a series of opinion polls found that most Poles are opposed to the tribunal\u2019s ruling. The proportions expressing a negative opinion were 71% (SW research poll for Rzeczpospolita), 66% (IBRiS for Onet), and 73% (Kantar for Gazeta Wyborcza). Only 13%, 25% and 13% held favourable views of the ruling in the same polls.\nA further survey by Estymator for Do Rzeczy \u2013 which, unlike the others, excluded those who do not express an opinion from its results \u2013 found 79% assessing the court\u2019s decision negatively and only 21% positively.\n\n\n78,9 proc. badanych negatywnie ocenia orzeczenie Trybuna\u0142u Konstytucyjnego ws. przes\u0142anki eugenicznej \u2013 wynika z sonda\u017cu dla @DoRzeczy_pl: https://t.co/6QQPIjahIY\n\u2014 DoRzeczy (@DoRzeczy_pl) October 31, 2020\n\nSupport for existing abortion law\nThree of those polls also asked for respondents\u2019 views on regulation of abortion. Estymator found that a majority (67%) favour maintaining the existing law, which allows termination in only three cases: if the pregnancy threatens the mother\u2019s life or health; if it is the result of a criminal act; or if a birth defect is diagnosed.\nOnly 14% wanted further restriction of the law (as both the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling and the president\u2019s proposed compromise would do), while 19% want it to be liberalised.\nKantar\u2019s poll found a similar result, though with a differently phrased question. Most (62%) said that abortion should be \u201clegal in specific cases\u201d (as it currently is), 22% wanted it to be available on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy, while 11% want it banned completely.\n\nPresident proposes new \u201ccompromise\u201d abortion law to resolve crisis in Poland\n\nBoth of those results differ somewhat from previous polling, which has usually found stronger support (between 30-40%) for liberalisation of the existing abortion law.\nIn its poll, IBRiS asked whether respondents want a national referendum to decide on the form of the abortion law: 69% were in favour of the idea, with only 24% opposed. The leader of the Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), an opposition group, has proposed holding such a referendum to resolve the current crisis.\nMajority back the protests\nThe tribunal\u2019s ruling has triggered eleven consecutive days of mass protests around Poland. They are believed to be the largest demonstrations the country has seen since the fall of communism in 1989.\nThe protests have shown no sign of diminishing. Police reported that Friday\u2019s gathering in Warsaw \u2013 attended by around 100,000 people \u2013 was the biggest so far.\n\n\nStunning picture of Warsaw as estimated 100,000 protested for women's rights.\n(ht @BDStanley) pic.twitter.com/8Zuv18l1yu\n\u2014 Jakub Krupa (@JakubKrupa) October 31, 2020\n\nAlthough the ruling party has sought to portray the protesters as violent radicals, three polls have this week found that a majority of the public support them: 56% in Estymator\u2019s poll, 54% in Kantar\u2019s, and 64% in a survey by IBP for Super Express. The same polls found 38%, 43% and 33% saying that they do not support the protests.\nKantar also broke down its results by gender, finding that there was in fact stronger support for the protests among men (54% of whom supported them with 41% opposed) than women (for whom the respective figures were 51% and 46%).\nThe same poll also asked people whether they think that the \u201cprotests have a chance of actually changing something and preventing the introduction of new [abortion] regulations\u201d. Only 32% agreed, with 56% believing that the government will sooner or later go ahead with tightening the law regardless.\n\nPolish prosecutors seek charges against organisers of abortion protests for endangering public\n\nDeclining popularity of ruling party\nWhile the abortion ruling was officially made by an independent court, many believe that in practice it originated from PiS. The party has since 2016 exerted influence over the Constitutional Tribunal, and its leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, is a close personal associate of the court\u2019s president, Julia Przy\u0142\u0119bska.\nIn SW Research\u2019s poll, 63% of respondents expressed the view that the PiS-led ruling coalition influenced the tribunal\u2019s ruling; only 17% thought that it did not.\nThe issue also appears to have had a negative impact on support for the ruling party, which has been in power since 2015 and has won each of the six elections \u2013 presidential, parliamentary, European and local \u2013 held since that year.\n\nAbortion protests aim \u201cto destroy Poland and end the history of the Polish nation\u201d, says Kaczy\u0144ski\n\nUntil late October, PiS had been polling at around 38%. That made it by far the most popular party, ahead of the centrist Civic Coalition (KO), which was on around 27%.\nOn Wednesday, however, Kantar found that support for PiS had suddenly dropped to 26% \u2013 a decline of 10 percentage points since the last Kantar poll and the party\u2019s lowest figure since 2015, reports Gazeta Wyborcza.\nThat was followed on Friday by pollster CBOS also recording a 10 percentage point drop for PiS, to 31%. This weekend, Estymator had PiS at 33% (down over 6 percentage points) and IBRiS at 29% (down 8 percentage points).\nKO\u2019s level of support remains similar to before, but there has been a rise in the polls for Poland 2050 (Polska 2050) \u2013 a movement set up by independent presidential candidate Szymon Ho\u0142ownia \u2013 and a smaller one for The Left (Lewica), which has been active in supporting the current protests.\n\nFarmers, taxi drivers and miners show support for abortion protests in Poland\n\nThere are currently no elections scheduled for the next three years, until a parliamentary election in autumn 2023. The only way that could be brought forward is if the ruling coalition collapsed or decided to call a snap vote.\nIn September, the government did come close to falling apart, due to internal rivalries as well as disagreement over legislation on animal rights and granting legal immunity to officials who broke the law in order to tackle the pandemic. Those differences were, however, resolved and a reshuffled cabinet was announced at the end of that month.\nThere are already signs of division within the ruling camp over the abortion issue. PiS\u2019s more moderate junior coalition partner, Agreement (Porozumienie), has pushed for a compromise along the lines suggested by President Duda.\nPiS\u2019s other junior partner, the more hard-line United Poland (Solidarna Polska), is believed to favour a stricter implementation of the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling. PiS itself, by far the largest of the three parties, is reported to be internally divided over the issue.\n\nNew Polish cabinet: Kaczy\u0144ski returns alongside education minister who likens LGBT to Nazism\n\nMain image credit: Maciek Jazwiecki / Agencja Gazeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel TillesDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0Notes from Poland.
