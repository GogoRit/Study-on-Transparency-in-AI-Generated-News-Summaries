Wade last year.\n    \n\n            The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against the US Food and Drug Administration, targets the agency\u2019s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process. \n    \n\n            Medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade.\n    \n\n            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on the issue. \n    \n\n            Any decision that blocks access to medication abortion \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will significantly disrupt abortion cases nationwide.\n    \n\n            Reproductive rights advocates say that if Kacsmaryk ultimately sides with the plaintiffs, \u201cit would eliminate the most commonly used method of abortion care,\u201d according to NARAL Pro-Choice America. \n    \n\n            Here\u2019s what to know about the lawsuit:\n    \n\n    What the lawsuit is seeking\n\n\n            The lawsuit, filed last year by a coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations under the umbrella of the \u201cAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine\u201d and several doctors, is seeking a number of actions by the court, chief among them a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the FDA \u201cto withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as FDA-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants\u2019 actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cAfter two decades of engaging the FDA to no avail, plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the FDA was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the FDA\u2019s actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,\u201d the complaint reads. \n    \n\n            The challengers are also targeting the FDA\u2019s recent moves to make the pills more accessible, which include removing the requirement that the pills be picked up in person from an abortion provider.\n    \n\n    What the FDA says \n\n\n            The FDA responded to the lawsuit in January by asking the judge to deny a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that issuing one in the matter \u201cwould upend the status quo and the reliance interests of patients and doctors who depend on mifepristone, as well as businesses involved with mifepristone distribution.\u201d \n    \n\n            The agency also says a ruling against it would set a dangerous precedent.\n    \n\n            \u201cMore generally, if longstanding FDA drug approvals were so easily enjoined, even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on FDA approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical-drug infrastructure that Americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions,\u201d the FDA wrote.\n    \n\n            \u201cA preliminary injunction would interfere with Congress\u2019s decision to entrust FDA with responsibility to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. In discharging this role, FDA applies its technical expertise to make complex scientific determinations about drugs\u2019 safety and efficacy, and these determinations are entitled to substantial deference.\u201d\n    \n\n    What the drug company says\n\n\n            Danco, which makes mifepristone, also made a request similar to the FDA\u2019s in a court filing, stressing that the lawsuit could decimate the company\u2019s business. \n    \n\n            The drug company has been allowed to intervene in the case, as the anti-abortion activists are also asking the court to halt the FDA\u2019s 2016 approval of its version of the medication abortion drug. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cDanco is a small pharmaceutical company. It sells one drug: Mifeprex,\u201d lawyers for the company wrote in court papers. \u201cEntering the mandatory preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek would force FDA to withdraw approval for Danco\u2019s only product, effectively shuttering Danco\u2019s business.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cCongress entrusts decision-making like this with the FDA. And they\u2019re coming in trying to overrule that, saying this medication is unsafe because women bleed. Well, that\u2019s part of having an abortion. It\u2019s also part of having a pregnancy,\u201d said Ryan Brown, an attorney representing Danco in the case. \u201cThe bottom line being that they just want to do away with abortion across the board and for any reason.\u201d\n    \n\n    Who is the judge in the case?\n\n\n            Kacsmaryk was appointed to the court in 2017 by then-President Trump and was confirmed by a 52-46 vote in 2019.\n    \n\n            Since then, he\u2019s helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, presiding over 95% of the civil cases brought in Amarillo, Texas.\n    \n\n            In December, Kacsmaryk put on hold the Biden administration\u2019s most recent attempt to end the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d immigration program. And he has overseen Texas cases challenging vaccine mandates, the gender identity guidance issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the administration\u2019s limits on the use of Covid-19 relief funds for tax cuts.\n    \n\n            Before joining the court, Kacsmaryk served as deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty legal group, where he worked mainly on \u201creligious liberty litigation in federal courts and amicus briefs in the US Supreme Court,\u201d according to his White House biography.\n    \n\n    Red and blue states weigh in \n\n\n            The abortion drug case is being closely watched by a number of interested parties, including Republican and Democratic state attorneys general. In February, two different multi-state coalitions filed amicus briefs with the court urging them to act one way or another in the matter. \n    \n\n            A coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general urged Kacsmaryk to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, writing in court papers that \u201cannulling \u2013 or even merely limiting \u2013 any of the FDA\u2019s actions relating to medication abortion would result in an even more drastic reduction in abortion access across the entire nation, worsening already dire outcomes, deepening entrenched disparities in access to health care, and placing a potentially unbearable strain on the health care system as a whole.\u201d \n    \n\n            They noted that \u201cthe availability of mifepristone has been particularly critical in providing access to abortion in low-income, underserved, and rural communities where procedural abortion may be unavailable,\u201d adding that since the drug is used more during the first trimester of pregnancy, \u201celiminating access to this method will result in more abortions taking place later in pregnancy, further increasing costs and medical risks.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Democratic attorneys general noted that abortion clinics in their states have already seen a surge in patients because of traffic from residents of states where extreme abortion restrictions are in effect. Cutting off access to medication abortion would further overburden those clinics, the blue states argued, as surgical abortion would be the only available method.\n    \n\n            A coalition of 22 Republican attorneys general, meanwhile, asked the court to issue the preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved the medication. \n    \n\n            \u201cState laws on chemical abortion thus account for the public interests at issue \u2013 and they do so with the benefit of democratic legitimacy (and legal authority). The FDA\u2019s actions can make no such claim. By obstructing the judgments of elected representatives, the agency has undermined the public interest,\u201d they wrote.\n    \n\n    What abortion-rights advocates are saying \n\n\n            Abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the case, stressing that a ruling by Kacsmaryk in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency. \n    \n\n            \u201cIf FDA approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,\u201d NARAL said in a statement in February, pointing to internal research.\n    \n\n            \u201cThis research reveals the high stakes of this lawsuit, and we can only expect the worst from this Trump-appointed federal judge. Americans want access to abortion, but anti-choice bad actors are dead set on restricting reproductive freedom by any means possible,\u201d said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, the group\u2019s vice president of communications and research. \n    \n\n            And activists quickly mobilized in Texas around the issue, with the Women\u2019s March holding a rally at the federal courthouse in Amarillo in February to protest the suit. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019ve said it before: the fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and legal challenges like these are just the latest example of how our fight is bigger than Roe,\u201d said Rachel Carmona, the executive director of Women\u2019s March. \n    \n\n    Judge decides against fast-tracking trial\n\n\n            Kacsmaryk had been considering whether to consolidate a potential hearing on the preliminary injunction request with a trial on the merits of the lawsuit, a move that would have fast-tracked the entire case. \n    \n\n            He asked the parties to weigh in, with both the plaintiffs and Danco voicing support for the consolidation. The FDA, however, urged the judge not to fast-track the trial, saying in a brief that because of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cextreme delay in filing suit to challenge FDA\u2019s approval of the drug, there is no reason to decide this case on an emergency basis.\u201d \n    \n\n            Kacsmaryk ultimately decided against fast-tracking the trial, writing in a February 21 order: \u201cHaving considered the briefing and relevant law, the court determines that consolidation would not be appropriate in this case.\u201d \n    \n\n    When will Kacsmaryk rule? \n\n\n            Wednesday\u2019s hearing will give both sides an opportunity to present their arguments to the judge and address a number of issues he has outlined.\n    \n\n            The judge\u2019s decision to notify the public of the hearing came days after he held a private call with the case\u2019s lawyers to schedule the hearing, according to The Washington Post. The call was not publicly reflected on the case\u2019s docket for several days, nor did the judge immediately issue a public order announcing that a hearing had been scheduled. The case is not under seal.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMifepristone (Mifeprex) and Misoprostol, the two drugs used in a medication abortion, are seen at the Women's Reproductive Clinic, which provides legal medication abortion services, in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, on June 17, 2022. Mifepristone is taken first to stop the pregnancy, followed by Misoprostol to induce bleeding. - In the wake of Friday's ruling by the US Supreme Court striking down Roe v Wade and the federally protected right to an abortion, women from Texas and other states are traveling to clinics like the Women's Reproductive Health Clinic in New Mexico for legal abortion services under the state's more liberal laws. - RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP) / RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRobyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a medication abortion, also known as an 'abortion pill,' works\n\n\n\n\n            Because he has decided against fast-tracking the trial in the case, his first ruling will be only on the preliminary injunction request, which, if granted in full, would temporarily pull the abortion drug from the market.\n    \n\n    Potential Supreme Court showdown\n\n\n            A day before the plaintiffs had submitted their brief, 12 states led by liberal attorneys general sued the FDA, saying its limits on mifepristone are too strict.\n    \n\n            The suit creates the possibility of circuit courts offering conflicting takes about the safety of abortion medication and how accessible the drug should be, something that would increase the likelihood of the Supreme Court weighing in.  \n    \n\n            The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington state.
