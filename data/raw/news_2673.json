While a pro-life pregnancy center got some screen-time in actor Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s recent comedy film \u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm,\u201d the brief portrayal took some subtle hits at the center which was then supersized by abortion supporters calling it \u201cthe most horrific moment\u201d of the film.\u00a0 And that moment wasn\u2019t the trolling by the undercover title character Borat \u2013 it was the existence of options other than abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe \u201cBorat\u201d films\u2019 motives are for the actors to go undercover to expose racism and other corruption in American society. The scene depicts Cohen\u2019s character Borat and his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) purchasing a cupcake at a local bakery that must have been for a baby shower due to the plastic baby topping in the icing. When Tutar accidentally swallows the figurine, Borat rushes to find her a doctor and winds up at a pregnancy care center. A comedic exchange follows where Borat and Tutar explain that she has a \u201cbaby\u201d inside her that she wants to \u201ctake it out,\u201d to which the center worker identified as Pastor Jonathan Bright responds that they do not do abortions as \u201cwhen you say \u2018take it out\u2019 you end a life\u2026 a living, breathing life that God has created.\u201d While the scene doesn\u2019t \u201cexpose\u201d anything other than a confused worker unaware of the set-up, abortion supporters lost it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn article by TheMarySue not only called the scene \u201chorrific\u201d but described these resource centers as insidious traps for women seeking abortions. You really have some things to reevaluate if you think a pregnancy help center is horrific, and ripping a preborn baby apart isn\u2019t. The article reads, \u201cSometimes they set up vans outside actual clinics and try to lure women in with promises of convenient service, only to do everything they can to talk (and scare) those women out of having an abortion.\u201d The malice towards these resource centers that are just trying to help women who don\u2019t want to abort is one of the ugliest part of the abortion movement. They want women to be backed into a corner and abort, without access to other options.\u00a0\nAnother by GameRant stuck to the same narrative \u201cthey [pregnancy centers] often present themselves as legitimate medical centers \u2026 Once inside, the facility is set up to do everything it can to convince women to continue their pregnancy.\u201d\nBut this is not what the pro-life movement does. In fact, there are over 2,500 pregnancy resource centers around the nation to help women in crisis pregnancies, but not to \u201cscare\u201d her from having an abortion, but rather show her that she has other options than ending the life of her child. These centers can provide her with resources, prenatal care, housing, diapers and so much more than the abortion industry looking to make easy profit off her and her child\u2019s well-being. Just ask the women who have been through it themselves and been exceedingly grateful for the kind words and tangible help offered to them.\u00a0\nThe media may continue to treat abortion as a laughable matter or condemn the pro-life movement for not \u201chelping\u201d women through abortion access, but the facts stand. Abortion kills an innocent life and hurts women, and it is the pro-life community who will reach out to give women the options and resources they deserve. We will never stop serving, we will never stop fighting. Plus\u2026 abortion supporters really need to get a sense of humor.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,532\n\nShare this postJessica Nardi\nBlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawSupportersSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
