Asa Hutchinson said he would sign into law a 15-week national abortion ban if he were president, a departure from his previous stance when he said the issue should be left up to individual states.Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a conservative anti-abortion group, announced last week it would oppose any 2024 presidential candidate if they do not back a national abortion ban.Fox News host Shannon Bream asked Hutchinson on \"Fox News Sunday\" if he would sign such legislation if he were president, to which the former Arkansas governor said he would as long as the ban provides \u201cappropriate exceptions.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re calling for a 15-week minimum. If you did have both houses of Congress and were President Hutchinson, would you sign it?\u201d Bream asked.\u201cThe answer is I\u2019ve always signed pro-life bills. And a pro-life bill that comes to me that sets reasonable restrictions, but also has the appropriate exceptions, yes I would sign it.\u201dPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter GuideStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletterHutchinson would support 'a national standard' on abortionHutchinson\u2019s support for a national abortion ban is an apparent\u00a0departure from his previous resistance\u00a0to federal legislation on abortion, having previously told ABC News'\u00a0\u201cThis Week\u201d last year that states should have the \u201cprerogative\u201d on the issue.Hutchinson also told NBC News\u00a0earlier this month that \u201cit depends\u201d whether he would sign a federal abortion ban, noting that he would be \u201chesitant\u201d to take power away from the states.The former Arkansas governor reiterated those sentiments Sunday, but added that Democratic efforts to protect and strengthen abortion access means Republicans could act on the national level while still including exceptions to save the life of a mother and in cases of rape and incest.Who is Asa Hutchinson?\u00a0What to know about the former GOP governor running for president\u201cI would prefer that this is an issue that\u2019s resolved by the states because that\u2019s what the pro-life community fought for for 40 years in reversing Roe v. Wade,\u201d Hutchinson said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be more pressure on the Republican side and on the life side to put in those reasonable restrictions, and so I would support that if those restrictions are in place and that we can have a national standard to help save the lives of the unborn,\u201d Hutchinson continued.Abortion divides other 2024 GOP candidatesSBA Pro-Life America\u2019s pledge to oppose any 2024 candidate that would not support a national abortion ban came after former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign told the Washington Post that Trump believes the Supreme Court got it right when it decided states could determine access to abortion.\u201cWe will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to embrace at a minimum a 15-week national standard to stop painful late-term abortions while allowing states to enact further protections,\" SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement Thursday.The issue of whether to ban abortion on the national scale has tripped up prospective 2024 GOP candidates.Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who has announced a presidential exploratory committee, said earlier this month a 20-week national abortion ban \"makes total sense\" and then later told Fox News that afternoon he would consider a 15-week ban.The next day, Scott told MSNBC he would \"literally sign the most conservative, pro-life legislation that they can get through Congress.\"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has avoided saying whether she supports a federal ban. In February, when asked on NBC's \"Today\" whether she supported a 15-week ban proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., she said\u00a0\"We need consensus on this because I want to save as many babies as possible, and I want to support as many moms as possible.\"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to launch a presidential campaign, has generally been mum on the issue, but recently\u00a0signed a 6-week abortion ban in Florida.For his part, former Vice President Mike Pence, who is considering a White House bid, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday he would support a 15-week ban, a stance he has taken multiple times.Abortion pill:Supreme Court sides with the Biden administration, halts restrictions on mifepristoneHutchinson: Abortion will not be as important in 2024Hutchinson also said that heading into the 2024 election cycle, he anticipates abortion will not be as important of an issue in the future as it is now.As governor, Hutchinson signed a near-total abortion ban trigger law that went into effect in Arkansas after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a\u00a0constitutional right to an abortion, last summer.The ban provides an exception for when a mother\u2019s life is at risk but has no exceptions for victims of rape or incest \u2013 a lack of which Hutchinson has lamented, saying the ban should be \u201crevisited.\u201d Regardless, Hutchinson defended the bill, saying the aim of the law was to reduce abortions.Absorb the blows:How Asa Hutchinson says he'll handle Trump's withering attacks in 2024Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
