The ruling Wednesday evening came after a federal judge this week in Texas made the opposite call, barring the federal government from enforcing a legal interpretation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act that would require Texas hospitals to provide abortion services if the health or life of the mother is at risk.In Idaho, the ban makes performing an abortion in any \u201cclinically diagnosable pregnancy\u201d a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Much of Idaho\u2019s law will still go into effect Thursday, but U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled Wednesday the state cannot prosecute anyone who is performing an abortion in an emergency medical situation. \n\nThat\u2019s because abortions in those cases appear to fall under a federal health care law requiring Medicare-funded hospitals to provide \u201cstabilizing treatment\u201d to patients, Winmill said. That includes cases when the health of a pregnant patient is in serious jeopardy, when continuing the pregnancy could result in a serious impairment to a person\u2019s bodily functions, or a serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pause on enforcement in Idaho will continue until a lawsuit challenging the ban is resolved, the judge said in the written ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice sued the Republican-led state of Idaho earlier this month, saying the abortion ban set to take effect on Thursday violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor (EMTALA) Act . Idaho\u2019s law criminalizes all abortions in \u201cclinically diagnosable pregnancies,\u201d but allows physicians to defend themselves in court by arguing the procedure was necessary to avert the death of the mother.Idaho Attorney General\u2019s spokesman Scott Graf said his office would not comment on the ruling because the case is still working its way through the courts.\n\nWinmill said the case wasn\u2019t about abortion rights but about whether state or federal law takes precedence in this situation. The judge in the Idaho case said it was clear federal law did.Winmill said the Idaho law would pose a dilemma for a doctor who felt they had to, under \u201cEMTALA obligations,\u201d perform an abortion to save the life of the mother even though they are banned under state law.\u201cAt its core, the Supremacy Clause says state law must yield to federal law when it\u2019s impossible to comply with both. And that\u2019s all this case is about,\u201d Winmill wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the bygone constitutional right to an abortion.\u201dIn Texas, a federal judge took the opposite approach. Texas had sued Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Xavier Becerra last month, arguing the federal law commonly referred to as EMTALA doesn\u2019t require doctors to provide abortions if doing so would violate a state law. In a ruling late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix temporarily blocked the government from enforcing the guidance in Texas, saying it would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA \u201cis silent as to abortion.\u201d\n\nPerforming an abortion creates an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d in the fetus or embryo, the judge wrote.\u201cSince the statute is silent on the question, the Guidance cannot answer how doctors should weigh risks to both a mother and her unborn child,\u201d the judge\u2019s order said. \u201cNor can it, in doing so, create a conflict with state law where one does not exist. The Guidance was thus unauthorized.\u201dThe Department of Health and Human Services said it was reviewing the legal decision to determine its next steps. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the Texas decision, \u201ca blow to Texans,\u201d saying pregnant women in Texas may now be denied appropriate treatment for conditions such as dangerously high blood pressure or severe bleeding.\u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s backwards, and women may die as a result. The fight is not over,\u201d Jean-Pierre said in a statement. \n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services issued the guidance in July, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that abortion is not a constitutional right.The agency cited EMTALA requirements on medical facilities to determine whether a person seeking treatment might be in labor or whether they face an emergency health situation \u2014 or one that could develop into an emergency \u2014 and to provide stabilizing treatment.Texas argued that the EMTALA guidelines also violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says some laws must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest if they affect individuals\u2019 religious freedoms. In Texas, a ban on abortion at all points of a pregnancy is scheduled to take effect Thursday. It has narrow exceptions for saving the life of the unborn child or woman, preventing a serious health condition from being aggravated or caused by the pregnancy, or removing an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nTexas clinics have already stopped offering nearly all types of abortion because of uncertainty over whether the state\u2019s 1925 ban can be enforced. The state also has a ban on abortions after embryonic cardiac activity can be detected, which is generally about six weeks into a pregnancy and often before a woman realizes she\u2019s pregnant.___Find more AP coverage of the abortion issue: https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Rebecca Boone\n            \n\n                Rebecca is a correspondent based in Idaho.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
