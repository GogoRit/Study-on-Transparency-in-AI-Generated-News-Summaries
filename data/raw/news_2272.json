Only four are left in Congress. The very term \u2013 \u201cpro-life Democrat\u201d \u2013 sounds like an oxymoron. And their existence often triggers heated debate within their party, their position shunted to the side in ways they say they did not experience even a decade ago.Yet a case to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 4 shows their enduring power. At the heart of June Medical Services LLC v. Gee is Act 620, a measure written by a Democratic lawmaker from Louisiana and signed into law by that state\u2019s Democratic governor. Act 620 requires doctors who provide abortions to gain admitting privileges \u2013 or legal permission to admit patients \u2013 at a hospital within 30 miles of their abortion clinic.If the high court finds the law constitutional, Louisiana will be left with only one abortion provider. It could also, critics say, set a standard that would all but remove the right to abortion access.\nWhy We Wrote This\nAre abortion rights now a litmus test for the Democratic Party? Democrats who oppose abortion say they feel like they must choose between their religious beliefs and their chosen political identity.\nWhich is what the law\u2019s author, state Sen. Katrina Jackson, has advocated her whole career.\u201cI plan on standing with our attorney general to argue in favor of this law,\u201d she said in a phone interview with the Monitor in 2019. \u201cI will be taking calls from people, responding to emails, talking to my colleagues, posting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and trying to encourage everyone to take the pro-life stance. It\u2019s what I always do.\u201dNot long ago, Senator Jackson\u2019s views would not have been too out of sync with her party\u2019s. When the nonprofit Democrats for Life of America was founded in the early 2000s, it listed more than 40 members of Congress in its coalition. As recently as 2008, Hillary Clinton was campaigning on making abortion \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d \u2013 which still acknowledged, and tried to appeal to, Democratic voters who had moral doubts about the procedure.\nRecommended\n\n\nCourage\u2018Hamas gambled with our lives\u2019: Gazans are now daring to speak out\n\nAs the ideological distance between the two parties have grown, however, the space for internal dissent on hot-button issues like abortion has shrunk. The GOP has unequivocally become the party against abortion. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has had to wrestle with whether or not it can continue to make room for lawmakers like Ms. Jackson, who says she only splits with the platform on this one issue and has no desire to become a Republican.Democrats against abortion say that a party that prides itself on diversity and inclusion should be able to reconcile support for women\u2019s bodily autonomy with sincerely held religious beliefs about \u2013 or at least moral uncertainty over \u2013 the procedure. Abortion rights advocates argue that such a party cannot defend policies that prevent women \u2013 often poor, nonwhite women \u2013 from access to the full range of choices regarding their own bodies, including the decision of when and whether or not to parent.Now, with June Medical on the docket and the 2020 elections fast on its heels, this intraparty tension has taken on new urgency. Progressive advocates say candidates must commit to fighting the wave of legal restrictions the procedure faces at the state and national levels, and recognize the socioeconomic and racial realities experienced by women seeking abortion. They\u2019re convinced that those ideas are a cornerstone of the Democratic Party\u2019s future, and that explaining them clearly to voters is a winning strategy.Democrats for Life is pushing back hard. They\u2019re recruiting candidates who are willing to both stand against abortion and advocate comprehensive supports for women \u2013 including policies around contraception and paid family leave. They argue that it\u2019s about defending life \u201cfrom womb to tomb,\u201d a philosophy they say is consistent with Democratic positions on everything from the role of social safety net programs to minimum wage increases to the death penalty.And they worry that by excluding abortion opponents from the party, national Democrats are alienating crucial swing voters in a pivotal election year.\nRecommended\n\n\nTrustWhich country trusts institutions the most? You\u2019d be surprised.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the big-tent party, so it\u2019s mystifying to me that we\u2019re really not,\u201d says Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take the party back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ann Hermes/Staff\n\n\nView caption\nHide caption\n\n\n\n Joan Barry, a former Missouri state legislator shown here in her St. Louis home on December 10, 2019, led an effort to insert language into the state Democratic Party platform asserting that its members \u201chave sometimes different positions\u201d on abortion.\n\n The Missouri disputePerhaps nowhere has the Democratic conflict over abortion played out more clearly than in Missouri, a state once called a \u201cbarometer of the American middle.\u201dIn 2018, former state legislator Joan Barry led an effort to insert language into the state Democratic Party platform asserting that its members \u201chave sometimes different positions\u201d on the issue. This diversity of views, the statement added, is \u201ca strength.\u201d The attempt triggered a furious debate over the party\u2019s commitment to reproductive rights. It ended with members overwhelmingly voting down Ms. Barry\u2019s proposal at a public meeting that summer.The dispute left a bitter aftertaste. When the midterm elections took place a few months later, Missouri\u2019s two-term Democratic senator Claire McCaskill lost her seat to conservative Republican Josh Hawley. State Democrats bickered over the reason: Some said it was partly because Senator McCaskill had publicly supported abortion rights. Others shot back that it was because she hadn\u2019t defended them enough.The thought of Democrats fighting among themselves over reproductive rights makes Pamela Merritt sigh over her cinnamon roll. The longtime liberal activist \u2013 who was a member of the platform reform committee during the 2018 dispute \u2013 maintains that Ms. Barry and her allies at Democrats for Life hijacked a year\u2019s worth of difficult deliberations in order to foist a conservative agenda onto the party.Isn\u2019t it enough, she asks, that Missouri is one of the most abortion-restrictive states in the nation? As of January, state law requires women to wait 72 hours between mandatory in-person counseling and the actual procedure, parental consent for minors seeking an abortion, and an array of logistical standards that providers must meet before they are licensed to perform abortions. Only one abortion clinic has been active in Missouri since 2018.\nRecommended\n\n\nMonitor BreakfastPoland to US: Help Ukraine now or pay the price later\n\n\u201cWe would never say, \u2018We value the environment and clean air, but we welcome pro-coal people as a strength,\u2019\u201d Ms. Merritt says over breakfast at a cafe in St. Louis\u2019 Shaw neighborhood. \u201cWe would never say, \u2018We value our LGBTQ party members but we welcome people who support conversion therapy as a strength.\u2019 So why would we ever say it about abortion?\u201dIn her view, Democrats need to give voters the opportunity to understand why the right to choose when to parent is crucial for women, for families, and for society. Do that, she says, and they will reward your trust. Ms. Merritt\u00a0points to recent Democratic victories in Virginia, where in November the party took control of all three branches of the state government for the first time in a quarter-century. As part of the campaign, Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arm in Virginia spent more than $1 million on candidates who supported abortion access. Abortion rights activists called it a victory for the cause.Ms. Merritt chafes at Missouri Democrats\u2019\u00a0reluctance to take a similar course. \u201cRather than learn how to talk about this and educate potential constituents \u2026 we\u2019re just going to pretend like it\u2019s not workable,\u201d she says.At her home in the suburbs just outside St. Louis, Ms. Barry, dressed in a lavender sweater and dark slacks, shakes her head.Like many moderate Democrats, she holds the view that focusing on abortion could antagonize voters in relatively conservative places like Missouri. Abortion did flare briefly ahead of the 2018 midterms, during the controversial Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. But it\u00a0was kitchen-table issues like health care that energized voters in swing districts and won Democrats control of the U.S. House of Representatives that year \u2013 not abortion.Why not try to sway voters with those issues, instead of pushing Democrats like her away?\nRecommended\n\n\nResponsibilityThe last coal plant in New England is sputtering. What happens next?\n\n\u201cThey think that everybody feels like them, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d Ms. Barry says of abortion rights advocates.\u00a0\u201cWe should not be ostracized. We belong in there.\u201dA home for the movement?Where Missouri is a battleground for Democrats for Life, Louisiana is about as close as its members have to a stronghold. The state\u2019s brand of socially conscious religious conservatism is fertile ground for abortion opponents of all political stripes. More than half of Louisiana residents, including nearly 40% of Democrats, say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, according to a 2016 survey. (Nationally, nearly two-thirds of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, with 76% of Democrats in agreement.)The governor, John Bel Edwards, is one of the organization\u2019s most prominent members.In this environment, Ms. Jackson, the Democratic state senator, has bloomed into a star. Born and raised in Monroe, Louisiana \u2013 a city of about 48,000 \u2013 she grew up in a household that placed great store by duty to God and to community. Prayer and fasting mark her life milestones, including the decision to run for the state legislature in 2011. She hails from a family of Democrats, and feels strongly about her party\u2019s commitment to defending the marginalized.\u201cThey still fight for those who can\u2019t fight for themselves,\u201d she says.She draws a hard line at abortion. To her, it\u2019s unequivocal: Abortion is murder, and murder goes against God\u2019s will. Over two terms as a state representative \u2013 she joined the Senate in 2019 \u2013 Ms. Jackson put her name to a slew of laws that have made headlines and drawn furious protests from abortion rights activists in Louisiana and nationwide.\nRecommended\n\n\nSafetyAs hunger grips Gaza, law and order crumbles\n\nAct 620, which passed in 2014, is among her crowning achievements.\u201cOne of my best moments in the legislature was when this bill came up for final passage \u2026 and almost 80-some members, both Democrat and Republican, stood at the mic with me to pass this bill,\u201d she says. \u201cIt showed a unity in the state of Louisiana that is not often seen.\u201dThe experience also came with angry phone calls, nasty social media posts, even death threats that forced her to hire police to ensure the safety of her staff. But Ms. Jackson refuses to budge on the issue. \u201cTo the extent that the party is on the wrong side of an issue \u2013 and what I mean by the wrong side is that they veer away from the Christian faith \u2013 then I have to stand with God,\u201d she says.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t support the party,\u201d she adds. \u201c[But] I will not choose the party over God.\u201dFighting for a placeTo Ms. Day at Democrats for Life, Ms. Jackson is a model of leadership. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we need at this point \u2013 someone who\u2019s solidly pro-life,\u201d she says. The group is actively recruiting state and local candidates to run in 2020, and raising funds to support their campaigns.Existing members have also grown bolder.\u00a0Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the few members of Congress endorsed by the organization, co-signed an amicus brief at the start of the year that urged the Supreme Court to \u201crevisit\u201d Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, \u201cand, if appropriate, overrule it.\u201d The move prompted Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to announce her bid to challenge Representative Lipinski in the 2020 primary, making her the third Democrat to do so.\nRecommended\n\n\nThe Monitor's ViewResetting Haiti through trust\n\nDemocrats for Life members have also gathered at the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debates in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston, and elsewhere, calling on candidates to publicly recognize their views.Some have argued that if Democrats were committed to progressive principles, they would focus on coalition building and finding common spaces on difficult issues \u2013 like abortion. Jane Kleeb, a board member of the progressive nonprofit Our Revolution,\u00a0compares the challenge to early efforts to stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.Climate change activists had led the charge against the project, crying out against potential risks to the environment.\u00a0But the strength of the movement came from other stakeholders, who \u201ccame to work with us on that because of eminent domain, sovereign rights, water \u2013 all sorts of reasons,\u201d\u00a0says Ms. Kleeb, who is also chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party.\u00a0\u201cIf I\u2019d said to farmers and ranchers and tribal nations: \u2018You can only come to the table and work with us if you\u2019re against Keystone XL because of climate,\u2019\u201d she says, the coalition wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\u00a0The Trump administration has since approved a right-of-way permit that would allow the pipeline to be built on U.S. lands, taking the project a step closer to reality despite activists\u2019\u00a0efforts. Still, Ms. Kleeb says, the Democratic Party needs to think of abortion the same way.\u201cIt\u2019s [about] going to voters and saying, We may disagree on abortion and gun reform. Here are the 20 other areas we agree on,\u201d she says. \u201cYou now have a choice. Do you stick with the party that agrees with you on those two issues, but completely abandoned you on these other 20?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jeff Roberson/AP\n\n\nView caption\nHide caption\n\n\n\nPamela Merritt, a reproductive\u00a0rights advocate, speaks to supporters on May 30, 2019, in St. Louis. Since 2018 Missouri has had only one active abortion clinic. Ms. Merritt calls Democrats for Life a \u201cmessaging machine\u201d that\u2019s trying to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement.\n\n Democratic party officials and progressive activists play down the notion of a rift over abortion within the party. In an email, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee affirmed the organization\u2019s commitment to supporting women\u2019s right to choose. The Missouri Democratic Party said in a separate statement that while it recognizes that Democrats hold a range of beliefs, \u201cwe can come together and support reproductive rights.\u201dMs. Merritt in St. Louis dismisses Democrats for Life as a \u201cmessaging machine\u201d that\u2019s trying to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement.\u201cPeople who try to advance reproductive oppression must be met, every single time they do it, with resistance,\u201d she says.And despite all the steps they\u2019re taking ahead of 2020, Democrats who want the party to reverse itself on abortion have a steep climb ahead. Louisiana is an anomaly; nationwide, 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center. Among party moderates, the figure dips a bit to 75%; among liberals, it surges to 91%.Ms. Barry knows this. At a November meeting of the Oakville Democratic Organization in St. Louis County, where Ms. Barry serves as committeewoman, she gently asks the Monitor to avoid bringing up abortion. Later, she admits that her work on the platform hurt some of her relationships with other party members. \u201cIt\u2019s still very sad to think that my party feels that everyone should be included, except someone who is pro-life,\u201d she says.\u201cI believe in what the Democratic Party stands for,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut I also believe that I need to be known as a member of that party.\u201d\n \nGet stories that empower and uplift daily.\n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy.\n\n\nAlready a subscriber?

My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things \u2018boring\u2019 simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.\u201d\nIf you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We\u2019re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We\u2019re the bran muffin of journalism.\nBut you know what? We change lives. And I\u2019m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.\nThe Monitor is a peculiar little publication that\u2019s hard for the world to figure out. We\u2019re run by a church, but we\u2019re not only for church members and we\u2019re not about converting people. We\u2019re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper\u2019s founding in 1908.\nWe have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We\u2019re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, \u201cYou are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15. You\u2019ll get the Monitor Weekly magazine, the Monitor Daily email, and unlimited access to CSMonitor.com.\n\n\nSubscribe to insightful journalism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRead this article in\n\t\t\t\thttps://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0204/Looking-past-Roe-Can-pro-life-Democrats-still-find-home-in-party\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStart your subscription today\n\t\t\thttps://www.csmonitor.com/subscribe\n\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGet stories that empower and uplift daily.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSee our other FREE newsletters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPolicy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAlready a subscriber?
