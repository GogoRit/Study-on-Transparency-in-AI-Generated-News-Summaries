(CNS photo/Sarah Silbiger, Reuters)WASHINGTON (CNS) \u2014 Two members of a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising said April 5 that five fetuses taken by the police a week earlier from the Capitol Hill residence of one of the activists were \u201cproof of illegal abortions\u201d being performed at a Washington abortion clinic.Activists Lauren Handy, 28, and Terrisa Bukovinac, 41, made the comments at a news conference, where they were joined by Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue.The same day, a group of 23 congressional Republicans wrote a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Robert J. Contee III asking for a thorough investigation of the remains \u201cof five preborn children\u201d and urging they not assume\u2014\u201dwithout conducting any medical evaluations\u201d\u2014that \u201ceach child died as the result of a legal abortion.\u201dHandy and Bukovinac said the fetuses are from a box of medical waste they got from the driver of a medical waste truck at an abortion clinic, and they claimed the fetuses looked like they were from late-stage abortions.Handy and Bukovinac said the fetuses are from a box of medical waste they got from the driver of a medical waste truck at an abortion clinic, and they claimed the fetuses looked like they were from late-stage abortions. The box also contained more than 100 fetuses that appeared to be from early stage abortions, they said.According to a Washington Post story and other news accounts, the two women described walking up to a Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services truck outside the Washington Surgi-Clinic, one of a few U.S. abortion clinics that does late-term abortions. They said they asked the driver if he had picked up anything from the clinic.The driver told them yes, they said, so they asked for a box. \u201cThe driver asked what they would do with the remains inside,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cAfter they told him they would give the (fetal) remains a funeral and bury them...the driver gave them a box.\u201d\u201cThe activists said they want authorities to evaluate whether any of the fetuses may have been aborted in violation of federal laws,\u201d the story added.\u201cWhile other horrific methods of abortion unfortunately remain legal for the time being, killing a child through a partial-birth abortion is a crime under federal law,\u201d wrote several Republican lawmakers in a letter.\u00a0The Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services has since stated that their driver did not hand over the box to the two women, according to the Post. The Washington Surgi-Clinic has not yet issued a statement.In their letter, the members of Congress referenced photos and videotapes Handy and Bukovinac said they took of the five fetuses reportedly showing they are from late-stage abortions.\u201cAs members of Congress, we have an obligation to conduct oversight over the District of Columbia ... to ensure D.C. upholds laws enacted by Congress, particularly those enacted to protect and uphold the sanctity of human life,\u201d they wrote.\u201cWhile other horrific methods of abortion unfortunately remain legal for the time being, killing a child through a partial-birth abortion is a crime under federal law,\u201d they said. \u201cUnder the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, a partial-birth abortion occurs when a physician partially delivers a living child for the purpose of performing an overt act that intentionally takes the life of the child.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, Congress passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act to provide equal protections for children who are born alive during an abortion,\u201d they added.Police said the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner currently has no plans to perform an autopsy on the remains.The police were first alerted to the five fetuses in Handy\u2019s apartment through an email she and Bukovinac sent to the medical examiner about them.\u00a0Police took the fetuses from Handy\u2019s apartment March 30, and the same day the FBI arrested her on federal charges for allegedly violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by blocking a reproductive health center in 2020. She pleaded not guilty and was released on her own recognizance.[Want to discuss politics with other America readers?
