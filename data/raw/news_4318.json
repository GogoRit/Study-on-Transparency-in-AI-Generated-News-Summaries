We\u2019ve rounded up 10 times Healy wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up for his beliefs in a major way. You can check those out below.\u00a0\n1. When he promised the 1975 would only play gender-inclusive shows\nhttps://twitter.com/Truman_Black/status/1227553391460671489\nIn February, Healy announced that the band will no longer be playing festivals where the lineup doesn\u2019t have equal gender representation. Healy has spoken about misogyny in the music industry in the past, and this was a major way for the 1975 to act as an ally to other acts.\u00a0\n2. When he gave an intense speech about reproductive rights\nhttps://twitter.com/Truman_Black/status/1129554882715881473\nHealy railed against the abortion ban and advocated for women\u2019s rights by giving a passionate speech during the band\u2019s performance in Alabama last year. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m so angry is because I don\u2019t believe [the ban] is about the preservation of life. I believe it\u2019s about the controlling of women,\u201d Healy says from the stage at Hangout Music Festival. Fans praised him for speaking out, especially at a show in the state where the ban was effective.\u00a0\n3. When he protested anti-LGBT laws in Dubai by kissing a male fan\nhttps://twitter.com/Truman_Black/status/1161846382833090560\nHealy protested Dubai\u2019s anti-LGBTQ laws by kissing a male fan during a gig in the Arab state. While the band played \u201cLoving Someone,\u201d he left the stage to kiss a male fan on the lips.\u00a0\nRead more: Matty Healy performs in hospital gown with the 1975 after health issues\n4. When the band addressed mental health with \u201cFrail State Of Mind\u201d\n\nThis past October, the 1975 dropped \u201cFrail State Of Mind,\u201d which tackles anxiety. Healy spoke about the Notes On A Conditional Form track after it dropped, saying the band went inward for the song because they were frightened.\u00a0\n5. When they partnered with teen climate activist Greta Thunberg\u00a0\n\nThe band released a self-titled track featuring Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, which was the perfect pairing considering Healy and the band are relentless supporters of climate change activism. They also endorsed a campaign that\u2019s fighting for emergency climate change action.\nRead more: Matty Healy wants to sing one of the 1975\u2019s songs in Simlish\n6. When Healy declared that he felt like he was \u201cin one of the only punk bands in the world\u201d\n\nLast August, Healy gave an interview where he expressed that he\u2019d \u201cgo to jail\u201d for his beliefs, which included standing up for women, gay people and minorities. He also said he feels \u201clike [he\u2019s] in one of the only punk bands in the world.\u201d\u00a0\n7. When he spoke about misogyny in the music industry during an award speech\n\n\n.@The1975 collect the BRIT Award for British Group with an important message. #BRITs\nWatch The #BRITs 2019 live here: https://t.co/qj4KiENtGs pic.twitter.com/z0wntv09jB\n\u2014 BRIT Awards (@BRITs) February 20, 2019\n\nAt the 2019 BRIT Awards, Healy addressed \u201cmale misogynist acts\u201d in the music industry when he accepted the 1975\u2019s award for Best British Group. He was inspired by a piece from The Guardian about allegations against Ryan Adams.\u00a0\nRead more: Matty Healy wants audio of \u201churtful thing[s]\u201d said about fans for new song\n8. When Healy called out bands for making music without a message\n\nHealy made some comments about Imagine Dragons for lacking a message in their music and their frontman\u2019s response to some negativity. \u201cMy point wasn\u2019t that Imagine Dragons aren\u2019t good. I don\u2019t care,\u201d Healy says. \u201cIf you\u2019re that big, if you\u2019re the biggest alternative band in America radio-play wise, and you\u2019re saying nothing in your music\u2014if you\u2019re just saying words \u2018radioactive whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa,\u2019 you know what I mean\u2014it\u2019s just like, what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n9. When the band showed their support for LGBT youth\n\n\nThank you for the \u2764\ufe0f @the1975! https://t.co/VK2eJm48T1\n\u2014 It Gets Better (@ItGetsBetter) April 14, 2017\n\nIn 2017, the 1975 partnered with the It Gets Better project, a nonprofit geared toward empowering LGBTQ+\u00a0youth. The band created a hoodie inspired by their anthem \u201cLoving Someone\u201d to raise funds for the project.\u00a0\n10. When they supported Planned Parenthood\n\n\nBanning abortion is NOT what people in America want \u2014 and we will never stand for it. Together we stand, unified with nearly 140 musicians and millions more people across the country to tell politicians: get your #BansOffMyBody! \nSign the petition: https://t.co/tPehfVEiSM pic.twitter.com/NtKOtp3vze\n\u2014 Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) August 24, 2019\n\nThe 1975 joined dozens of other artists in a protest conceived by Planned Parenthood to fight against restrictive abortion laws. It was part of the organization\u2019s plans to call fans to action at music festivals.\u00a0\n\n\nFiled under:\u00a0\n\n\nalternative press,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nalternative press magazine,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\naltpress,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nap magazine,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBRIT awards,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nfrail state of mind,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\ngreta thunberg,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHangout Music Festival,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nimagine dragons,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nlgbtq,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nlgbtq youth,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nloving someone,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nmatty healy,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nmisogyny,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nnotes on a conditional form,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nplanned parenthood,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nreproductive rights,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nryan adams,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nthe 1975\n\n\n\n\nCategories:\u00a0\n\n\nFeatures,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nList\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Used and Story of the Year announce tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Day to Remember announce huge North American summer tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson to join Joel Madden on Ep. 62 of Artist Friendly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More Different \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Used and Story of the Year announce tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Day to Remember announce huge North American summer tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson to join Joel Madden on Ep. 62 of Artist Friendly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround Our Network \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisible Oranges \u2013 The Metal Blog\n\n\n\n\nBaazlvaat Take Us from the Stronghold to the Gutter (Interview)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooklynVegan\n\n\n\n\nOur 20 Favorite Hardcore Albums of 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisible Oranges \u2013 The Metal Blog\n\n\n\n\nMorta Skuld Channel Old-School Fury on \u201cCreation Undone\u201d (Interview)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooklynVegan\n\n\n\n\n33 great 2023 albums from indie / alternative legends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE AP STORE IS NOW OPEN \n\nEXCLUSIVE VINYL, COLLECTIBLES, MERCH + MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For Our NewsletterEmail Address(Required)\n\nCommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Used and Story of the Year announce tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Day to Remember announce huge North American summer tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson to join Joel Madden on Ep. 62 of Artist Friendly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem announce summer tour with Joyce Manor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBktherula is a student of the universe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRising dream-pop duo crushed share hypnotic video for \u201cwaterlily\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Press \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInformationAdvertise\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\n \n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\nVisit us on Instagram\n\n\n\nVisit us on Twitter\n\n\n\nVisit us on Facebook\n\n\n\nVisit us on Youtube\n\n\n\nVisit us on TikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Alternative Press magazine.
