(photo: Courtesy photo from McQuade family)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nFeatures\nApril 29, 2022\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Deirdre McQuade, who served as spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on pro-life issues for more than a decade, died April 21 during Easter Week, after a three-year battle with metastatic breast cancer. She was surrounded by family, a large community of friends and yellow flowers \u2014 the color she called a reminder to have \u201cgreat hope.\u201d\nBaltimore Archbishop William Lori, chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 pro-life committee, told the Register that McQuade, 53, was \u201ca woman of great faith and deep love who devoted her considerable talents and energy to protecting and fostering the vulnerable \u2014 especially the unborn.\u201d\u00a0\nA funeral Mass will be celebrated for McQuade on May 3 at St. Jerome Church in Hyattsville, Maryland.\nTom Grenchik, the executive director of the USCCB Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities, commented that in his years of working with McQuade, \u201cit was inspiring to see how she was always focused on the other. This was especially true in her work with those who were fighting their own battles with a terminal illness. Deirdre left a legacy of not only helping to share their stories of faith and trust in God\u2019s providence, but also in giving witness with her own story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMcQuade\u2019s mother, Genevieve, told the Register that she saw the good of the path that God had led her daughter on starting in her early years with a strong grounding in the faith.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought she would have influence on people in the business world, in the corporate world, never ever thinking she would find her path in pro-life work,\u201d she said. She revealed to Deirdre in her final weeks that she recognized that she has \u201chad far more influence and far holier influence with how her life developed\u201d in contrast to the corporate career path that her daughter left behind after prayerful discernment.\nDeirdre\u2019s younger sister, Pamela Shannon, told the Register that her sister \u201cwas open to being used for God\u2019s work\u201d throughout her life. The sisters overlapped for two years at Bryn Mawr College, where Deirdre received her undergraduate degree in 1990. McQuade went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in philosophy and a master of divinity degree from the University of Notre Dame.\u00a0\nDuring their time at Bryn Mawr, Shannon said they helped found a pro-life group, where they \u201clearned to speak to very diverse women who did not agree with us. It was a very liberal campus, very few Catholics and very few pro-life women.\u201d She said this was an early example of how her sister \u201cwas being used\u201d by God.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile studying afterward at Notre Dame, McQuade worked as a counselor at a pregnancy-help center and then served as director of pastoral research and outreach for the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana. Prior to beginning her service with the USCCB\u2019s pro-life office in 2005, she also worked as the national program director at Feminists for Life, supervising its college-outreach program,\u00a0\nShannon emphasized that her sister was \u201cimperfect\u201d and \u201cbroken\u201d in many ways, but her openness to being used by God only increased with her cancer diagnosis, and she \u201cevolved through that,\u201d with \u201cother people benefiting from that,\u201d as well.\nShe said she witnessed her sister \u201clinking her suffering to Jesus on the cross\u201d and also \u201coffering her suffering for other people and their situations\u201d during her battle with cancer. She described her as \u201ca person who lived with a lot of intention, and that carried through with her academic life, her relationships, hospitality\u201d \u2014 all grounded in \u201cher Catholic faith and values.\u201d\u00a0\nShannon once captioned a photo of her sister with her two housemates as a \u201clittle church,\u201d something she said resonated with people because her sister\u2019s home was a \u201creflection\u201d of parish life, with religious art and a welcoming community of relationships.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDrusilla Barron, one of McQuade\u2019s housemates and a longtime friend, told the Register that, for McQuade, \u201cthe thing that mattered was the person she was encountering.\u201d She described her friendships with the neighbor girls who even tried to invite her to their limited-attendance high-school graduation. She also befriended \u201cthe person who tended the shop where she bought food on her way back from chemo\u201d and asked him \u201cto pray for her and promised to pray for him.\u201d\u00a0\nBarron said McQuade wasn\u2019t an angel, but laughingly added that \u201cangels are scary,\u201d describing her as someone who chose to \u201clove from rather than live from her flaws.\u201d\u00a0\nIn her final days, McQuade had many of her friends come to visit. Barron said there was laughing and talking throughout the house. People also brought yellow paper plates, as \u201cshe loved yellow. It was, for her, a symbol of hope.\u201d She said that there were realizations for her at the end of how deeply McQuade cared for her friends, including discovering that she had been paying most of the mortgage while charging her and their other housemate very little. \u00a0\nKathryn Jean Lopez, a friend of McQuade\u2019s and columnist at National Review, told the Register that McQuade \u201chad such a pure heart and solid faith. She radiated his light. This was so before cancer, and the light only grew brighter as she suffered. She introduced countless people to the Sisters of Life\u2019s Litany of Trust and Sister Thea Bowman, who was a true friend to her, even if she did not get the physical healing so many were praying for.\u201d\u00a0 \nDeirdre McQuade (r) was friends with Kathryn Jean Lopez (c) and the Sisters of Life. | Courtesy of Kathryn Jean Lopez \n\nMcQuade\u2019s family is asking anyone who is so inclined to donate to the Sisters of Life in her honor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe last issue I worked on with Deirdre when she was at the bishops' conference was assisted suicide. She believed suffering had meaning as a moral and intellectual truth,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cShe advocated to protect the vulnerable in public policy, law and education. And she embraced suffering when it became her cross. She suffered with joy. That\u2019s possible! It almost seemed a miracle to watch her \u2014 even from afar. She truly wanted to do the will of God. She marveled in his creation. She knew her true home is heaven.\u201d\u00a0\nPro-life advocate Arina Grossu, another longtime friend of McQuade\u2019s, called her \u201ca champion for life and a devout Catholic,\u201d saying that \u201cshe will always be known for her love of others and her joyful and peaceful presence, even in the midst of great suffering. She lit up any room she walked in and thought of others before herself until her last breath. She lived well and she died well, surrounded by friends and family, and having received the sacraments.\u201d\nGrossu also pointed out that someone at Notre Dame shared a picture of the tulips at the university grotto shortly after McQuade\u2019s passing \u2014 they had bloomed in yellow array.\n\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \nDeirdre McQuade\nprolife movement\nlauretta brown\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown
