There is no pro-life information up here, can you send me some?\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0\nIn 2008, he reached out to the Couple to Couple League, an international nonprofit that promotes the Church teaching of natural family planning, to join its board of directors.\n\u201cFather wrote a letter to Couple to Couple League one day saying, \u2018I\u2019m interested in helping,\u2019\u201d said CCL chairman and former executive director Mike Manhart of Cincinnati. \u201cHe was proactive about it.\u201d\n\"He\u2019s just done so much across the board. I think his very wonderful witness to life and human dignity in general as a priest has allowed him to reach people in so many different ministries in so many different ways \u2026 You felt he was making Christ present to you. I\u2019ll always remember that about him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA calling within\nPro-life efforts have been a priority for Bishop-elect Pohlmeier not only throughout his 24 years of priestly ministry, but a calling within his calling, and encompass a variety of pro-life aspects. Even at the press conference announcing his appointment May 24, the baby feet pin, a popular pro-life symbol, was fastened to his lapel.\u00a0\nCatherine Phillips, diocesan respect life director, said he has consistently participated in prayer campaigns like 40 Days for Life and advocated for a consistent ethic of life.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s really an advocate for human dignity and respecting people every day,\u201d Phillips said. \u201c... He\u2019s just done so much across the board. I think his very wonderful witness to life and human dignity in general as a priest has allowed him to reach people in so many different ministries in so many different ways \u2026 You felt he was making Christ present to you. I\u2019ll always remember that about him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInstrument for healing\nDierks, who founded the Project Rachel post-abortion healing ministry in the Diocese of Little Rock, became \u201cfast friends\u201d with Bishop-elect Pohlmeier even before his 1998 ordination. His heart for pro-life issues made him a perfect priest, among others, who helped offer Mass and confession during Project Rachel retreats.\u00a0\n\u201cThe ladies loved him,\u201d Dierks recalled. \u201cHe was just a gentle spirit, and they went to confession for the first time in who knows how many years and he was a great instrument in their healing. ... He wanted the mothers of those babies that were lost to feel the forgiveness of the Lord.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd time was not an issue, spending three or more hours at the retreats, being there for those who needed him, Dierks said.\u00a0\n\u201cHe had the most beautiful homilies. John\u2019s Gospel of the adulterous woman, when he said, \u2018Neither do I condemn you,\u2019 they really felt it. It\u2019s just such a beautiful moment he brought to them,\u201d Dierks said. \u201cHis spirit comes through in what he says and the way he does it. He was a gift to the ladies of Project Rachel in a very special way, and to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdvocate for healthy couples\nWith as much care and compassion as he\u2019s displayed for mothers in need of healing, Bishop-elect Pohlmeier has a heart for setting married couples and their future families up for success by promoting natural family planning, a Church-approved way of intimacy to help couples become pregnant or delay pregnancy, without the use of contraception.\u00a0\nThough NFP classes were offered in the Diocese of Little Rock since the 1980s, Bishop-elect Pohlmeier along with family life director Elizabeth Reha spearheaded a campaign in 2010 to make it a requirement for marriage preparation. At the time when it was implemented in 2012, only eight other dioceses in the country had made that a requirement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe role of families\nTyler and Erin Boelkens, parishioners at Christ the King Church in Little Rock, trained with Bishop-elect Pohlmeier 10 years ago to teach Couple to Couple League NFP classes.\u00a0\n\u201cI would say that he was such a great supporter and spiritual guide for us during the time of our teaching formation,\u201d Erin Boelkens said. \u201c... I would say if I had to sum up Bishop-elect Erik, I\u2019d say he is a very fascinating person, fascinating and accessible. It never felt out of reach to invite him to whatever we were doing. He\u2019s easy-going and easy to talk to. He\u2019s so supportive of families and so good with children. He\u2019s constantly stressing the importance of the role of family in the Church. It\u2019s what he believes, not just what he preaches.\u201d\u00a0\nManhart witnessed it first-hand as Bishop-elect Pohlemier served on CCL\u2019s national board for eight years.\u00a0\n\u201cHe was a very active participant in the board and brought a lot of good insight. He was one that always had a perspective offered during a critical discussion,\u201d which led other members \u201cin a unifying direction that ended up being the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRelatable perspective\nIn 2011, Bishop-elect Pohlmeier led a three-part video intro series focused on John Paul II\u2019s famous teaching, Theology of the Body, in a simplified way.\u00a0\nIn one of the videos, Bishop-elect Pohlmeier explains our call to love as God loves in his image, explaining this concept of \u201chis image\u201d in a relatable way: \u201cThink of a mirror and think of yourself brushing your teeth in front of that mirror. When you brush your teeth and face the mirror, the image in the mirror brushes its teeth. So now imagine that God is looking in a mirror. What, or who, would he see in the reflection? He would see all of us since we\u2019re created in his image. So just as the image in our mirror in the morning does what we do, combs its hair, brushes its teeth, so we should always do what God does. That\u2019s what it means to be an image of God, and that\u2019s what it means to be a human person.\u201d\u00a0\nManhart said the series is still presented today to every class, equaling about 5,000 to 6,000 couples annually.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s had a significant impact. We often joke that NFP is kind of a gateway to understanding your Catholic faith. Some of the other stuff the Church teaches begins to make some sense,\u201d Manhart said, so the videos go beyond just understanding God\u2019s plan for marriage.\u00a0\nDuring Bishop-elect Pohlmeier\u2019s tenure, which ended in 2016, Manhart said the board created an online version of the class and a national online registration platform.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile Father was on the board, many innovations that moved us into the 21st century \u2026 he was very strongly assertive in that and really pushed us to do those things,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nManhart also said Bishop-elect Pohlmeier would visit other dioceses with board members throughout the country about four times a year, always the one to pick out interesting sites to see at each place.\u00a0\n\u201cIn Boys Town, Omaha, we saw the world's largest stamp ball,\u201d Manhart said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA pro-life heart\nWhile many will attend Bishop-elect Pohlmeier\u2019s July 22 ordination, it\u2019s been a long time coming for Dierks. Originally supposed to attend his priestly ordination, she said \u201cGod had a different plan,\u201d when her daughter gave birth to twins on his ordination day.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out there (in Jacksonville, Fla.), and I\u2019ll be praying for him. It\u2019s very important I be there. He\u2019s a very special man in my life,\u201d Dierks said while holding back tears. \u201cHe was always available for me, I don\u2019t know that he ever said \u2018no.\u2019 He has it in his heart \u2014 he is a purified pro-lifer.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBishop Taylor wants you to know more about your faith & the Church:\u00a0Sign up for\u00a0Arkansas Catholic's free digital edition.\n\nClick for the Bishop Erik Pohlmeier index\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\nPlease read our Comments Policy before posting. \nArticle comments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\nJuly 28, 2022\u00a0Another Arkansas priest raised to the ministry of bishop\nJuly 22, 2022\u00a0Bishop-elect Pohlmeier reveals his episcopal coat of arms\nJuly 20, 2022\u00a0Pohlmeier's service helped mold diocese's faith formation \nJuly 19, 2022\u00a0Bishop-elect says he will miss \u2018shared life\u2019 with Arkansans\nMay 24, 2022\u00a0El mensaje del Obispo Taylor sobre Padre Erik Pohlmeier\nMay 24, 2022\u00a0Bishop Taylor's statement on Bishop-elect Pohlmeier\n\n\nCurrent News\nMarch 19, 2024\u00a0'Why, Lord?' appropriate prayer in grief, Pope says\nMarch 18, 2024\u00a0History of most contested swath of land in Middle East\nMarch 15, 2024\u00a0Two Catholic communities receive state's safety grants\nMarch 14, 2024\u00a0Struggling Catholics addiction support in Charleston\nMarch 13, 2024\u00a0A Catholic You Want to Know: John Bui\nMarch 11, 2024\u00a0One Church drive for small Decatur church at halfway\n\n\nNews & Views From You\n\u00a0Jim Thielemier dies \n\u00a0Rite of Election in LR\n\u00a0William Rainer DeClerk dies\n\u00a0Soup & Salad Dinner and Live Stations of the Cross\n\u00a0Betsy Gary dies\n\u00a0Senior Saints Program celebrates 30 years\n\n\nFrom the Bishop\nMarch 12, 2024\u00a0Crosses: Adversities you could avoid, but are embraced\nMarch 5, 2024\u00a0Jesus\u2019 best friends: Peter, James, the beloved disciple\nFebruary 28, 2024\u00a0The freedom to sin is result of invitation to holiness\nFebruary 21, 2024\u00a0When you pray, ask the Lord for an understanding heart\nFebruary 13, 2024\u00a0Selfless sacrifices are the cost of every great love\nFebruary 6, 2024\u00a0When storms come, don\u2019t forget to praise God\n\n \n \n \n\n\nJoin Us on Facebook | Follow Us on Twitter | Privacy and Terms of Use | View and Buy Photos | Advertise | About Us\n\u00a9 2024 Arkansas Catholic | 2500 N.
