Along with political conservatives, left-leaning advocates for the poor like Ron Sider spoke out against abortion.\nIn 1987, he published Completely Pro-Life as an explanation for why Christians should support a consistent life ethic. Sojourners magazine, the leading periodical of the evangelical Left, published several pieces against abortion in the 1980s.\nBut that moment is gone. This summer, when the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade ignited a political firestorm, the abortion debate became even more partisan than it already was, and some progressive evangelicals found it difficult to harmonize their social justice commitments and defense of women\u2019s rights with antiabortion advocacy.\nThough still claiming to be \u201cconsistently pro-life,\u201d Sojourners reacted to the SCOTUS decision by publishing an editorial titled \u201cWomen\u2019s Needs Are Holy. Overturning Roe Ignores That.\u201d Another one of their editorials called for churches to help women find safe spaces for abortion.\nIf this is true of some Christian magazines and organizations, it\u2019s probably even more true of Christians in the pews. Evangelical pastors who believe in the sanctity of unborn life know this better than anyone.\nThose with urban congregations in blue states (or blue cities) have progressive-leaning attendees who now associate the pro-life label only with red-state Republicans, whom they sometimes view as Trump-supporting misogynists. Those church leaders may wonder if it\u2019s even possible to talk about unborn life in a way that won\u2019t drive their churches\u2019 social justice\u2013oriented progressives away.\n\nNow more than ever, it\u2019s important to remember two things: The church\u2019s concern for the unborn long predates the Republican Party, and the pro-life movement is not an invention of American conservatism.\nThere is a way to defend the pro-life cause without falling into political partisanship. But doing so will require us to move our conversations about abortion out of the framework of American nationalism and into a broader, global Christian tradition that connects concern for the unborn with compassion for the marginalized.\nWith that in mind, here are five reasons why Christians who care about social justice should oppose abortion:\n1. Concern for the unborn unites us with a 2,000-year Christian tradition of viewing human life as a unique creation of God.Article continues below\n\nFree NewslettersGet the best from CT editors, delivered straight to your inbox!\n\n\n\n More Newsletters\nBoth abortion and infanticide were common in the ancient Roman world, but opposition to these practices distinguished ancient Christians from their pagan neighbors.\nSome of the earliest extrabiblical Christian writings we possess\u2014including the second-century works Didache and Epistle of Barnabas\u2014condemn abortion. Though not all branches of the church have consistently opposed the practice, both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church view it as a grave sin.\nThe pro-life cause, then, unites evangelicals with historic Christian teaching and the largest branches of Christianity throughout the world. It also unites us with a biblical witness that emphasizes the conception of Jesus by the Holy Spirit as the moment when God himself became united with humanity through the Incarnation.\nThe assertion that our lives belong ultimately to God\u2014not to the state, not to the community, and not even to our parents\u2014is a radically liberating Christian declaration that applies even to the preborn.\n2. Concern for the unborn is a countercultural witness against a contemporary Western society that devalues children.\nIt was no accident that support for legalized abortion in both the United States and the larger Western world increased at the precise moment when concerns about overpopulation prompted many people in North America and Europe to view children and larger families as a social or ecological imposition.\nA Christian witness against abortion is a countercultural protest against a society that too often treats children as an afterthought, a luxury, or even a burden.\nThe Christian responds to the early pro-choice slogan \u201cevery child a wanted child\u201d with the affirmation that every child is already a wanted child in God\u2019s sight. We believe the church has a moral duty to value those children and affirm the fact that they\u2019re wanted. A baby is not merely a choice but instead a divine image-bearer\u2014a creation of God with an eternal future.\n3. Pro-life advocacy is a countercultural affirmation that women deserve better options than abortion.\n\u201cDo women want abortion?\u201d asks the Orthodox writer Frederica Mathewes-Green. \u201cNot like she wants a Porsche or an ice cream cone. Like an animal caught in a trap, trying to gnaw off its own leg, a woman who seeks an abortion is trying to escape a desperate situation by an act of violence and self-loss. Abortion is not a sign that women are free, but a sign that they are desperate.\u201dArticle continues below\n\nIf Mathewes-Green is correct, the real pro-woman stance is not to advocate for greater abortion availability but rather to release the trap in which so many mothers (especially poor ones) are caught.\nSeventy-five percent of women who get abortions are living either below the poverty line or just barely above it. The majority are already mothers of at least one child but find it difficult to contemplate welcoming another child into their home.\nInstead of merely giving these women the opportunity to terminate their pregnancies, pro-life advocates insist they deserve something better. They find a way to empower these women so they can leave the trap they\u2019re facing without metaphorically gnawing off their own legs.\n\n4. Pro-life advocacy unites us with a global movement of people in lower-income, non-Western nations who are resisting the individualistic message of the secular West.\nAbortion is illegal or heavily restricted in 50 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries, and some African pro-life activists are sharply critical of Western efforts to make it legal.\nMost \u201cdeveloping nations don\u2019t want abortion,\u201d argues Obianuju Ekeocha, the Nigerian biochemist who founded Culture of Life Africa. But Western international family planning agencies often ignore these countries\u2019 traditional values. She views their actions as a form of \u201cneo-colonialism\u201d and \u201ca distraction to the development project that should be happening in developing countries.\u201d\nInstead of providing food, water, and education, Western-funded family planning agencies assume that what Africa really needs is fewer people\u2014and Ekeocha resents this.\nAfricans themselves value children as a \u201cgift,\u201d Ekeocha says, even when they are experiencing deep poverty. She believes the pro-life movement affirms this traditional African value.\n5. Pro-life activism is a way to defend the value of those with severe disabilities, who are the most likely to be victims of abortion in an age of widespread prenatal screening tests.\nIn Iceland, there are now only one or two children with Down Syndrome born each year\u2014not because the country has found a cure but because nearly every mother there whose unborn child tests positive for the condition opts to have an abortion.\nWhat\u2019s happening in an extreme version in Iceland is happening to a slightly lesser degree throughout the Western world.Article continues below\n\nWhile it is certainly true that a child with Down Syndrome requires an extraordinary amount of care, a Christian witness against abortion is in part a declaration that the world needs all the people God created\u2014including those with Down Syndrome and even more severe disabilities.\nIt\u2019s a declaration that people cannot be \u201cscrapped like so many defective parts that fail to pass inspection at the end of a production line,\u201d as Georgetown University philosophy professor Germain Grisez wrote in 1970.\nThese five reasons for opposing abortion might inspire some people to give the pro-life cause a second look, but if we want our witness to be genuinely persuasive to progressives, we need to make sure we\u2019re not simply invoking a few progressive platitudes as window-dressing for a conservative movement. We need to make personal sacrifices to care for the marginalized people we insist are valuable.\nIf we declare that low-income women facing crisis pregnancies deserve better than abortion, we need to work hard to release them from the financial and relational traps they\u2019re experiencing. If we insist that children with Down Syndrome are valuable, we need to make sure we\u2019re offering support to parents who have undertaken the challenge to care for those kids.\nIf we say that children are valuable, we need to treat them as valuable in every sphere of our lives, whether they\u2019re preborn or already born. And if we say that we\u2019re pro-life because it connects us to the witness of the Bible, historic Christian teaching, and the global church, we need to make sure we\u2019re open to that witness in every area of our lives.\n\nAs we witness to progressives in our midst, perhaps it\u2019s especially important for us to genuinely care about women\u2019s rights. What are we doing, for example, to promote better family leave policies in the workplace, or childcare options that empower women and promote their economic security?\nOver time, we may well find that a lot of what passes for pro-life politics in this country is really not consistent with these larger values and will have to be jettisoned. And Christians who are concerned about the unborn may well disagree among themselves over exactly how to translate those values into law\u2014which means that many pro-lifers may not necessarily support all antiabortion political initiatives that are labeled \u201cpro-life.\u201d\nBut the core pro-life message\u2014that unborn human beings have great value in God\u2019s sight and deserve our support\u2014is one that all Christians need to affirm, regardless of our political ideology.\nIt\u2019s a deeply countercultural message even for political conservatives\u2014which is all the more reason that progressive evangelicals should embrace it in today\u2019s partisan environment.\nDaniel K.
