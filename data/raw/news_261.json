Greg Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting \u201cnon-essential\u201d medical procedures for 30 days. State Attorney General Ken Paxton clarified the next day that the order would include a ban on nearly all abortions.*\nDozens of states have delayed non-urgent procedures since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0to conserve equipment and safeguard medical personnel during this crisis. While we support these difficult but necessary steps to preserve public health,\u00a0the abortion ban in Gov. Abbot\u2019s order doesn\u2019t protect Texans \u2013 it hurts them. Abortion is safe, urgent, and essential health care.\nProhibiting abortion, or attempting to delay it for a number of weeks, can increase the risk and cost of what is otherwise a very safe procedure, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A temporary ban on abortion is particularly harmful in a state like Texas, where state-mandated waiting periods, strict gestational limits, and mandatory parental consent or judicial bypass for minors already impede access to care.\nPregnant people are already in a precarious situation during this public health crisis. Even under normal circumstances, pregnancy can bring physical, emotional, and financial challenges. Amid the excitement of welcoming a new life into the world, expecting parents must navigate childbirth, parental leave, and childcare. Being pregnant during a global pandemic adds an entirely new layer of risk and anxiety. For those carrying planned pregnancies to term, prenatal appointments might require leaving home multiple times as due dates draw nearer. News reports\u00a0are warning that pregnant individuals may have to labor without their partner or other support systems as \u201cthe coronavirus threatens an already strained maternal health system.\u201d\nSexual violence also tends to rise during periods of quarantine and lockdown and domestic and sexual violence hotlines have reported an increase in calls over the last two weeks. This means that thousands of people sheltering in place with abusers may find themselves pregnant against their will. Forcing someone who doesn\u2019t want to be pregnant to continue the pregnancy is cruel under any circumstance and does nothing to improve public health during the current crisis.\nIn the midst of a global pandemic, with uncertainty and large-scale economic insecurity looming, the last thing state officials should be doing is withholding reproductive health care from patients who need it. Politicians and state officials must listen to experts in the medical and science communities and focus on ensuring that everyone has the health care access they need.\nBeing pregnant during a pandemic should never lead to a delay in care.\nIf you live in Texas, consider taking a few minutes to call Gov. Abbott and urge him to ensure that abortion remains accessible during this time.\n*Similar executive orders banning abortion as a non-essential procedure were issued\u00a0in Alabama, Iowa, Ohio, and Oklahoma\n\n\n\n\n\nReproductive Health and Rights\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nAlly Karpel\n\n\n\n\nAlly Karpel is a rising second-year rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles.
