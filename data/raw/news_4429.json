The kits, which contain surgical and N95 masks, face shields, eye goggles, long-sleeve gowns, surgical and non-surgical gloves, hand sanitizer and liquid antiseptic, will provide essential support to maintain uninterrupted reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services and information \u2013 and to ensure that front-line health workers are protected as they deliver these services.\u00a0Zanzibar\u2019s Ministry of Health will quickly distribute the PPE kits to health facilities across the country to address the shortages of PPE items. This crucial support, financed by Global Affairs Canada as part of the Girls Reproductive Health, Rights and Empowerment Accelerated in Tanzania Project, will go a long way in protecting health workers enabling them to continue providing life-saving reproductive services to women and girls in need.\u00a0Addressing UNFPA, Ms. Halima Maulid, Zanzibar\u2019s Deputy Principal Secretary at the Ministry of Health, said, \u201cYou have been supporting us for many years and are still working with us to save the lives of women and children of Zanzibar.\u201d\u00a0UNFPA has also distributed dignity kits to address quarantined women and girls\u2019 immediate hygiene needs. The kits include sanitary pads, underwear, antibacterial soap and washing powder.\u00a0\u00a0UNFPA will continue working with the Government of Canada to support reproductive health efforts and improve maternal and child health outcomes in Zanzibar and the rest of Tanzania as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\u00a0\u00a0With Global Affairs Canada\u2019s support, UNFPA also procured a boat ambulance to serve the smaller surrounding islands of the archipelago and provided financial assistance to renovate the maternity ward at Kivunge Hospital, increasing access to quality care for women living in rural areas in the north of Zanzibar\u2019s Unguja Island.\u00a0\nThe Government of Canada is a staunch advocate of sexual and reproductive health and rights and a champion of women and girls\u2019 empowerment and gender equality.\u00a0\nIn 2019, Canada was UNFPA\u2019s \u00a0top humanitarian partner and 3rd largest government donor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nUpdates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nMali conflict carries heavy toll for pregnant women amid rising insecurity\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nChampion of change: How a Tanzanian youth activist is rallying for gender\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\u201cI must continue fighting to keep her in school\u201d: Following the Ruta de los\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
