Suzanne Geist\nFollowing extended debate on procedural motions related to the legislative agenda, senators resumed debate on LB814, which previously was discussed on general file July 30. Introduced by Lincoln Sen. Suzanne Geist, the bill would ban \u201cdismemberment\u201d abortion except in emergency situations.\nThe bill defines a dismemberment abortion as a procedure in which a person purposely dismembers and extracts a living fetus from the uterus using clamps, forceps or similar instruments. It would not apply to an abortion in which suction is used to dismember a fetus, or removal of a fetus that already is dead.\nThe majority of Nebraskans support ending the \u201cbarbaric\u201d practice of dismemberment abortion, Geist said, including both liberals and conservatives.\n\u201cI disagree with people who say that this is not important to the people of Nebraska,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are pro-choice women and men who support this.\u201d\nLB814 also would allow for professional injunctions and civil action against any abortion provider found to be in violation of the bill\u2019s provisions.\nThe intentional and knowing performance of the procedure\u2014unless performed due to a medical emergency\u2014would be a Class IV felony, punishable by up to two years imprisonment with 12 months post-release supervision, a $10,000 fine or both.\nCreighton Sen. Tim Gragert supported the bill, calling it one of the most important proposals to come before the Legislature.\n\u201cMy wife and I were recently blessed with our fourth grandchild,\u201d Gragert said. \u201cI would hate to see anyone miss out on that amazing experience.\u201d\nOmaha Sen. Megan Hunt filed a motion to indefinitely postpone the bill, which would end consideration of it for this session. She said that when someone decides to end a pregnancy, their care should be safe, affordable and free from punishment or judgment.\n\u201cThe courts have already recognized that there are no workarounds that could make a [dilation and extraction abortion] ban constitutional,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThese are points that the Supreme Court has not wavered on for 40 years.\u201d\nBennington Sen. Wendy DeBoer said that even though the provisions of LB814 would apply only to a small number of abortions in Nebraska, she could not support it.\n\u201cAll constitutional rights are equally protected for each person in the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience knowingly vote for a bill that violates the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\nAfter three hours of debate, Geist filed a motion to invoke cloture, or cease debate and vote on the bill. The motion succeeded 34-11. Thirty-three votes were needed.\nSenators then voted 6-32 to reject Hunt\u2019s motion to indefinitely postpone LB814 and 34-9 to advance the bill to select file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Human trafficking bill narrowed, returned to final reading\nLast-minute tax package advances after cloture vote \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost readDACA provision removed from law enforcement measure, bill advancedBudget advances with minor adjustments, more changes likelyFarmer, restaurateur earns seat at the tableAgriculture proposal amended, advancedDark fiber licensing authorizedResources\n\nLegislative interim hearing schedule\nLive video of Legislature via NPM\nLegislative publications\nCivic education resources\nLegislative calendar\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n October 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n October 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n July 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n October 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n October 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n May 2014 \n April 2014 \n March 2014 \n February 2014 \n January 2014 \n December 2013 \n October 2013 \n July 2013 \n June 2013 \n May 2013 \n April 2013 \n March 2013 \n February 2013 \n January 2013 \n October 2012 \n June 2012 \n May 2012 \n April 2012 \n March 2012 \n February 2012 \n January 2012 \n December 2011 \n November 2011 \n October 2011 \n June 2011 \n May 2011 \n April 2011 \n March 2011 \n February 2011 \n January 2011 \n December 2010 \n November 2010 \n October 2010 \n April 2010 \n November 2009 \n May 2009 \n April 2009 \n March 2009 \n February 2009 \n January 2009 \n January 2008 \n January 2007 \n January 2005 \n January 2003 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Unicameral Update.
