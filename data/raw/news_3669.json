Cramer Op-Ed: One Simple Way Congress Can Support Women and Unborn Children\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) penned an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on his bill, the Unborn Child Support Act, which requires child support payments to begin when life does: at conception. While this idea is not new, there is now a greater responsibility to protect and support life in a post Roe v. Wade society.\n\u201cPro-abortion activists often quip that pro-life supporters only care about the unborn child. This is fundamentally untrue. We believe each and every life is sacred. Therefore, we must particularly emphasize compassion and support for new mothers, unborn children, and families,\u201d wrote Senator Cramer. \n\u201cThough I believe fatherhood is both a blessing and obligation and that fathers bear responsibility for the child they helped create, I also recognize that child support is not the solution for every situation. That\u2019s why the Unborn Child Support Act protects mothers who do not wish to seek financial compensation from the father by exempting them from a paternity test if it would put the mother or child at risk,\u201d continued Senator Cramer. \n\u201cIn this age of polarization, the Unborn Child Support Act is something all Americans should rally behind. It is a vital step toward ensuring mothers and children are well cared for and fathers embrace the responsibility of bringing life into the world,\u201d concluded Senator Cramer.\u00a0\nOne Simple Way Congress Can Support Women and Unborn Children\nBy Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND)\nWashington Examiner\n9.16.2022\n\u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade is one of the most consequential court decisions of my lifetime. Countless lives are saved by this decision and society is a much better place for it. When new souls are born, new ideas, dreams, and purpose come alive, which enlightens and enlivens our world.\u00a0\n\u201cPro-abortion activists often quip that pro-life supporters only care about the unborn child. This is fundamentally untrue. We believe each and every life is sacred. Therefore, we must particularly emphasize compassion and support for new mothers, unborn children, and families.\n\u201cTo help achieve this mission, I introduced the Unborn Child Support Act in July\u00a0 to provide assistance for children long before they are delivered. Maximum care must begin at the first moment of life: conception. My bill empowers mothers by giving them the choice to receive child support payments as early as the first month of their pregnancy.\n\u201cThough I believe fatherhood is both a blessing and obligation and that fathers bear responsibility for the child they helped create, I also recognize that child support is not the solution for every situation. That\u2019s why the Unborn Child Support Act protects mothers who do not wish to seek financial compensation from the father by exempting them from a paternity test if it would put the mother or child at risk.\u00a0\n\u201cHowever, if the mother reconsiders, the courts are required to issue a paternity test and retroactively award child support payments, starting from conception. Child support payment eligibility, which requires confirmation of the father\u2019s identity, remains the same. The best interest of the mother and child are always paramount.\n\u201cThese ideas are not new \u2013 I introduced this same legislation during Congress\u2019s last term.. But with the advent of Dobbs v. Jackson and its overturning of Roe v. Wade, there is an even greater opportunity to protect life in this country.\u00a0\n\u201cPublic polling proves most Americans want to take advantage of this opportunity. According to the Bucknell Institute for Public Policy, there is widespread, bipartisan support for child support payments that begin at conception. Nearly half the respondents were in favor of child support payments beginning at conception (47%), including 53% of Democrats, and 49% of those who described themselves as pro-choice.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt seems this is one issue on which both sides of the political aisle can agree. Take, for example, a tweet from liberal actor and activist Ken Olin published in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision. \u2018In states where abortion is illegal, the father should be financially on the hook at the moment of conception,\u2019 he wrote. While I reject the notion that a father\u2019s financial obligations should be limited only to certain states, Olin\u2019s sentiments reflect a basic consensus: mothers and their children should be supported by the father.\n\u201cIn this age of polarization, the Unborn Child Support Act is something all Americans should rally behind. It is a vital step toward ensuring mothers and children are well cared for and fathers embrace the responsibility of bringing life into the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Print\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n      \n\n\n\n\n Tweet\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Previous Article\n              \n\n\n\n                Next Article\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            How Can We Help?\n          \n\n\n\n            About Kevin\n          \n\n\n\n            News\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Cramer Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal\n\nmodal close button\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              How Can We Help?\n            \n\n\n                      Scheduling Requests\n                    \n\n                      Academy Nominations\n                    \n\n                      Help With A Federal Agency\n                    \n\n                      Internships\n                    \n\n                      Tour Requests\n                    \n\n                      Flag Requests\n                    \n\n                      Congratulatory Letters\n                    \n\n                      Vaccination Requirements for Guard Members\n                    \n\n                      Mobile Office Hours\n                    \n\n\n              About Kevin\n            \n\n\n                      Biography\n                    \n\n                      Media Kit\n                    \n\n                      Committee Assignments\n                    \n\n\n              Issues\n            \n\n\n                      Issues\n                    \n\n                      Legislation\n                    \n\n                      2020 Presidential Election Court Cases\n                    \n\n\n              News\n            \n\n\n                      Press\n                    \n\n                      Weekly Town Hall Schedule\n                    \n\n                      Media Kit\n                    \n\n                      Newsletter Archive\n                    \n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n                      Contact Kevin\n                    \n\n                      Newsletter Signup\n                    \n\n                      Offices\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal\n\nmodal close button\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
