(Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nA lawsuit that seeks to strike down the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban on the basis of Indiana\u2019s controversial religious freedom law was certified Tuesday as a class action by a Marion County Superior Court judge.\nThe legal challenge up for debate was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of Hoosier Jews for Choice, as well as four anonymous women who represent a variety of faiths.\nThe lawsuit argues that the new abortion law violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nThe plaintiffs include practitioners of Judaism, Unitarian Universalism, Episcopalianism and paganism \u2014 all belief systems that allow abortions under circumstances outside the ban\u2019s narrow exceptions.\nThe ACLU asked the court in September to grant certification of a class that includes all Hoosiers whose religious beliefs \u201cdirect them to obtain abortions in situations\u201d prohibited by Senate Enrolled Act 1 \u2014 the near-total abortion ban \u2014 and \u201cwho need, or will need, to obtain an abortion and who are not, or will not be, able to obtain an abortion because of the Act.\u201d\nAccording to Indiana Trial Rule 23, for a lawsuit to be certified as a class action case, one or more members of a class may sue or be sued only if:\n\n\u00a0the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;\nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class;\nthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and\nthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\n\nIn her 29-page order, Marion County Superior Court Judge Heather Welch determined that all of the unnamed plaintiffs in the case share a common claim with those that are named, that there is a large group of potential plaintiffs and that the named plaintiffs have claims that are representative of the entire class.\n\n\u201cEven within denominations, there are legitimate disagreements among observant followers on how members of a particular religion should approach issues in our world in accordance with articles of faith,\u201d Welch wrote in her ruling. \u201cThe Court\u2019s role then is to determine that the alleged religious infringement is objective and observable rather than rely solely on the subjective assessment of the class members.\u201d\nThe state opposed the proposed class, saying in multiple court filings that it depends on class members\u2019 \u201cindividual circumstances, states of mind, and subjective beliefs at any given moment.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Indiana Attorney General\u2019s Office argued that there is not an objective way to determine who would be motivated by religious reasons to obtain an abortion, and that there is no consensus among the religions, to which the current plaintiffs belong, \u201cover whether and what circumstances the plaintiffs would be directed to obtain an abortion as part of their religious practices.\u201d\nWelch conceded that \u201cthere are certainly conflicts within religious traditions on when a practitioner may be compelled to seek an abortion on religious grounds.\u201d\u00a0\nStory continues below.\nProposed Order (No Motion) (2)\n\u00a0\nBut the judge maintained in her ruling that there is \u201csufficient evidentiary support that the religions to which plaintiffs and putative class members belong would guide its practitioners to seek abortions under particular circumstances based on testimony from leaders of these faiths.\u201d\nThis is the second case involving the ban. In January, Indiana Supreme Court justices heard a case against the ban based on liberty and privacy rights.

One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime. Rape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization.\nIt also strips abortion clinics of their state medical licenses, and provides that only hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory surgical centers can provide abortions.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXJudge grants class action certification for RFRA-based lawsuit against Indiana abortion ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle June 7, 2023\nJudge grants class action certification for RFRA-based lawsuit against Indiana abortion ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle June 7, 2023\n A lawsuit that seeks to strike down the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban on the basis of Indiana\u2019s controversial religious freedom law was certified Tuesday as a class action by a Marion County Superior Court judge.\nThe legal challenge up for debate was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana on behalf of Hoosier Jews for Choice, as well as four anonymous women who represent a variety of faiths.\nThe lawsuit argues that the new abortion law violates Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nThe plaintiffs include practitioners of Judaism, Unitarian Universalism, Episcopalianism and paganism \u2014 all belief systems that allow abortions under circumstances outside the ban\u2019s narrow exceptions.\nThe ACLU asked the court in September to grant certification of a class that includes all Hoosiers whose religious beliefs \u201cdirect them to obtain abortions in situations\u201d prohibited by Senate Enrolled Act 1 \u2014 the near-total abortion ban \u2014 and \u201cwho need, or will need, to obtain an abortion and who are not, or will not be, able to obtain an abortion because of the Act.\u201d\nAccording to Indiana Trial Rule 23, for a lawsuit to be certified as a class action case, one or more members of a class may sue or be sued only if:\n\n\u00a0the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;\nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class;\nthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and\nthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\n\nIn her 29-page order, Marion County Superior Court Judge Heather Welch determined that all of the unnamed plaintiffs in the case share a common claim with those that are named, that there is a large group of potential plaintiffs and that the named plaintiffs have claims that are representative of the entire class.\n\n\u201cEven within denominations, there are legitimate disagreements among observant followers on how members of a particular religion should approach issues in our world in accordance with articles of faith,\u201d Welch wrote in her ruling. \u201cThe Court\u2019s role then is to determine that the alleged religious infringement is objective and observable rather than rely solely on the subjective assessment of the class members.\u201d\nThe state opposed the proposed class, saying in multiple court filings that it depends on class members\u2019 \u201cindividual circumstances, states of mind, and subjective beliefs at any given moment.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Indiana Attorney General\u2019s Office argued that there is not an objective way to determine who would be motivated by religious reasons to obtain an abortion, and that there is no consensus among the religions, to which the current plaintiffs belong, \u201cover whether and what circumstances the plaintiffs would be directed to obtain an abortion as part of their religious practices.\u201d\nWelch conceded that \u201cthere are certainly conflicts within religious traditions on when a practitioner may be compelled to seek an abortion on religious grounds.\u201d\u00a0\nStory continues below.\nProposed Order (No Motion) (2)\n\u00a0\nBut the judge maintained in her ruling that there is \u201csufficient evidentiary support that the religions to which plaintiffs and putative class members belong would guide its practitioners to seek abortions under particular circumstances based on testimony from leaders of these faiths.\u201d\nThis is the second case involving the ban.
