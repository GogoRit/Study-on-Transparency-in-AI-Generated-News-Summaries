Metropolitan Police Department arrested two students Saturday morning for defacing property after they wrote pro-life messages in chalk, MPD told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nStudents for Life of America and the Frederick Douglass Foundation had planned to write the words \u201cBLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER\u201d on the sidewalk outside an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C.

The group also said it obtained a permit for the event.\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nVideo footage captured by the Daily Caller News Foundation shows police arresting two students for chalking messages outside the abortion clinic. The students said they chalked outside the abortion clinic every week as part of an effort to persuade women not to get abortions.\u00a0\n\nMPD spokeswoman Alaina Gertz told the DCNF that the students were arrested for \u201cthe defacing of private/public property.\u201d She said the students were \u201cboth citation released\u201d and referred the DCNF to a description of what \u201cDefacing public or private property\u201d means.\nBoth advocacy groups had sent a July 20 letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser requesting permission to paint the words \u201cBlack Pre-Born Lives Matter\u201d in order to \u201cto celebrate the beautiful children with endless potential who are the future of their community and deserve the opportunity to make their mark in the world.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDCNF video screen capture\n\nNeither Bowser nor MPD immediately responded to requests for comment regarding the permit.\u00a0\nThe incident took place in the 1200 block of 4th Street, Northeast, MPD confirmed.\nChalking messages is a common method of advocacy, particularly as protests and riots against racism and police brutality have erupted across the nation. Bowser had the slogan \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted on a D.C. street in massive yellow letters in early June.\n\nMuriel Bowser Twitter\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe DCNF asked MPD whether graffiti on the streets of D.C. done in the name of George Floyd or Black Lives Matter also counted as defacing of private/public property. MPD did not immediately respond to this question.\nProtestors and rioters throughout the nation have chalked messages on streets and buildings against police, police brutality and racism.\nTweet This: While chalking messages is a common advocacy method DC Metro PD arrested 2 pro-life students for \u201cthe defacing of private/public property\u201d \nAs recently as January 2020, the nonprofit Speech First sued Iowa State University President Wendy Wintersteen as well as 14 other university administrators and nine members of the State Board of Regents, saying the school sought to restrict free speech by prohibiting chalking.\nEditor's note: Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
