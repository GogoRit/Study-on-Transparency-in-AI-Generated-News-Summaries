(photo: Courtesy photo / ACDP)\n\n\nDavid Ramos/CNA\nWorld\nJanuary 25, 2022\n\n\nAlfonso Gald\u00f3n, founding president of the Spanish political party Valores, denounced Friday the Murcia city government for banning the pro-life \u201cCancelled\u201d ad campaign.\nIn a Jan. 21 YouTube message, Gald\u00f3n stated that \u201cthe constitutional rights of the Spanish people have been violated by the Murcia City Council.\u201d\nPressure from the abortion lobby has led several Spanish city councils, including those of Valencia, Valladolid, and Murcia to ban the advertisements.\nThe \u201cCancelled\u201d campaign opposes a bill being pushed by the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party which would criminalize \u201charassing women going to clinics for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy.\u201d Anyone promoting, favoring, or participating in demonstrations near abortion facilities would be subject to penalties.\nPenalties for what would be deemed harassment would include jail terms of three months to a year, or community service from 31 to 80 days. Depending on circumstances, an individual could also be barred from a particular location for between six months and three years.\nThe mayor of Murcia is a member of the PSOE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday the Murcia city government has done a great disservice to our democracy by trampling on the right to freedom of speech, requiring the removal the pro-life posters that until this afternoon could be seen in the streets of Murcia,\u201d Gald\u00f3n declared.\nIn opposition to the bill, beginning Jan. 18, 260 posters were placed in ad kiosks on streets and at metro stops in 33 Spanish cities to \u201craise our voices against prison sentences.\u201d\nAccording to the bill making its way through Spain\u2019s lower house, pro-lifers could be prosecuted without the aggrieved person or their legal representative being required to file a complaint.\u00a0\nThe \u201cCancelled\u201d campaign \u201dseeks to combat political correctness, the cancel culture and the repression of freedoms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posters read: \u201cPraying in front of abortion facilities is a great thing.\u201d By using a QR code on the poster, the testimony of Dr. Jes\u00fas Poveda, one of the main promoters of the pro-life movement in Spain, can be accessed.\u00a0\nThe campaign will also include interviews, educational videos, and written material.\nThe posters state that \u201cmore than 99,000 abortions abortions are performed in Spain every year. The crime of those who pray in front of abortion facilities is to want to save some of these lives.\u201d \u00a0\nIn his video message, Gald\u00f3n stated that these efforts to cancel the campaign have trampled on the freedom of speech, \u201cwhich only seeks to defend the life of the weakest, the unborn.\u201d Gald\u00f3n told the politicians and those promoting abortion that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to silence us, we are growing in the face of injustice.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nspain\npro-life ads\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest
