Ms.\u00a0Dunn\u00a0says abortion\u00a0providers\u00a0\u201cpeddle abortions.\u201dNobody peddles abortions. Nobody stands outside\u00a0clinics to convince anyone\u00a0to have\u00a0an\u00a0abortion. I'm sure\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Dunn knows\u00a0that the people\u00a0who stand\u2212 sometimes\u00a0menacingly\u2212\u00a0outside of clinics aren\u2019t\u00a0there to\u00a0peddle abortion, but to\u00a0intimidate\u00a0the women seeking an abortion and the\u00a0nurses and doctors who\u00a0care for\u00a0them.Nobody\u00a0is killed for not\u00a0choosing to have an abortion, but between 1976\u00a0and\u00a02015, at least\u00a011\u00a0people were\u00a0killed for\u00a0providing abortions. This in\u00a0addition to\u00a0non-lethal bombings and arson\u00a0attacks\u00a0on\u00a0clinics. So\u00a0much\u00a0for\u00a0pro-life.\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Dunn also\u00a0stated that the heart\u00a0starts\u00a0to\u00a0beat at\u00a021\u00a0days of\u00a0gestation, but partially\u00a0differentiated\u00a0cells\u00a0rhythmically contracting\u00a0is not a\u00a0heart. She\u00a0also claims\u00a0that there\u00a0are detectable brain\u00a0waves at\u00a045 days,\u00a0but\u00a0partially differentiated\u00a0cells\u00a0generating electrical\u00a0signals\u00a0is\u00a0not a brain, and they don\u2019t support anything\u00a0approaching consciousness.\u00a0Hear more Tennessee Voices:\u00a0Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.Women have the right to make their own health decisionsMs.\u00a0Dunn\u00a0interprets\u00a0the\u00a0location of\u00a0clinics that provide abortion\u00a0services in Black neighborhoods\u00a0as evidence of\u00a0a genocidal agenda. This assertion rests\u00a0upon\u00a0the\u00a0blatantly false claim\u00a0that\u00a0such clinics are\u00a0peddling abortion.All women\u2212\u00a0no matter where\u00a0they\u00a0live, the\u00a0color of\u00a0their skin or\u00a0what\u2019s\u00a0in their\u00a0pocketbooks \u2212\u00a0have the\u00a0right to\u00a0make their own healthcare\u00a0decisions.\u00a0Statistically,\u00a0Black\u00a0women,\u00a0who are\u00a0more likely to live in poverty, do\u00a0seek\u00a0abortion more\u00a0often than\u00a0white\u00a0women.Abortion is not being peddled to them. Often, they seek\u00a0abortions\u00a0because they\u00a0lack\u00a0the resources necessary\u00a0for child\u00a0rearing\u2212 safe housing, access to medical care,\u00a0access\u00a0to\u00a0childcare\u00a0for\u00a0children\u00a0already\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0families or access\u00a0to affordable fresh food.\u00a0And\u00a0if a\u00a0Black woman\u00a0seeking abortion\u00a0cannot\u00a0obtain it,\u00a0she is three\u00a0to\u00a0four times more likely, than her white counterparts, to\u00a0die\u00a0of pregnancy complication.\u00a0Not to mention, the United States' overall infant mortality\u00a0rate is\u00a0higher\u00a0than\u00a0in other Western countries and\u00a0steadily rising. Estimates predict that forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies will produce\u00a0a 33%\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0pregnancy-related\u00a0deaths\u00a0among\u00a0Black\u00a0women. So\u00a0much\u00a0for\u00a0pro-life.Arguments against abortion often portray\u00a0abortion\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0frivolous choice, but\u00a0nothing\u00a0could be\u00a0farther from the truth.\u00a0Sixty percent\u00a0of\u00a0women seeking abortion are already\u00a0mothers and\u00a0unprepared to\u00a0parent another child\u2212\u00a0often\u00a0because of economic stress.\u00a0Sign up for Black Tennessee Voices newsletter:\u00a0Read compelling columns by Black writers from across Tennessee.Sign up for Latino Tennessee Voices newsletter:Read compelling stories for and with the Latino community in Tennessee.\u00a0Some studies show that 75%\u00a0of women\u00a0seeking abortion were\u00a0living below\u00a0poverty level. Many abortions\u00a0are driven by\u00a0medical\u00a0complications: ectopic\u00a0pregnancy,\u00a0fetal\u00a0abnormalities incompatible with\u00a0life, premature\u00a0rupture\u00a0of membranes\u00a0prior\u00a0to\u00a0fetal viability, and concurrent medical conditions\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0cancer\u00a0demanding\u00a0immediate treatment not\u00a0compatible with\u00a0pregnancy.The will of people supports abortion rights under certain circumstancesMs. Dunn also says protesting against the Tennessee\u00a0abortion\u00a0ban thwarts the will of the\u00a0people. Which\u00a0people?\u00a0Recent polling shows\u00a0that 80%\u00a0of Tennesseans\u00a0support access\u00a0to\u00a0abortion at least\u00a0in\u00a0certain circumstances.\u00a0The\u00a0Republican supermajority in\u00a0the\u00a0Tennessee\u00a0legislature\u00a0doesn\u2019t represent\u00a0the\u00a0majority of Tennesseans when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0to abortion.Ms.\u00a0Dunn\u00a0adds,\u00a0\u201cThe Human Life Protection\u00a0Act\u00a0will save\u00a0thousands\u00a0of\u00a0lives.\u201d\u00a0Not\u00a0the\u00a0lives of\u00a0women\u00a0forced\u00a0to carry\u00a0pregnancy\u00a0to\u00a0term. Not the\u00a0lives of babies born\u00a0into poverty,\u00a0facing\u00a0an\u00a0obscenely high\u00a0infant mortality rate. Not the lives of\u00a0girls subjected to\u00a0rape\u00a0and incest, already traumatized beyond\u00a0the imaginations\u00a0of\u00a0those\u00a0who\u00a0have\u00a0not\u00a0walked in\u00a0their shoes.Even when it's the best choice in\u00a0a\u00a0given circumstance, abortion\u00a0is often tragic. To quote\u00a0my former pastor Rev.\u00a0James\u00a0M. Lawson, Jr., \u201cAbortion\u00a0is\u00a0not a\u00a0moral sin, but\u00a0a moral tragedy.\u201dTo\u00a0encounter this\u00a0moral\u00a0tragedy less often, we\u00a0need to\u00a0engage in\u00a0the\u00a0moral\u00a0work of\u00a0alleviating the\u00a0circumstances which make\u00a0abortion the\u00a0tragically best choice for many persons\u00a0facing\u00a0problematic\u00a0pregnancies.\u00a0That\u00a0is\u00a0pro-life.\u00a0\u00a0Donna Krupkin Whitney is a retired physician who currently serves on the ministerial staff of Metropolitan Interdenominational Church in Nashville.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
