Some Polish women said that if they are denied the right to terminate pregnancies in cases of badly deformed fetuses, they would not try to have children at all.\nREAD MORE: Women\u2019s groups lead more protests over Poland\u2019s abortion law\nPoland\u2019s top human rights official denounced the further restriction of what was already one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, calling it a tragedy for women.\n\u201cThe state wants to further limit their rights, risk their lives, and condemn them to torture,\u201d said Adam Bodnar, the human rights commissioner, or ombudsman, whose role is independent from the Polish government. \u201cThis offensive is opposed by civil society.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n \u201cThe state wants to further limit their rights, risk their lives, and condemn them to torture.\u201d\n\u2013 Adam Bodnar, Poland\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights \n\nThe only remaining legal justifications for abortion under Polish law are if the woman\u2019s life or health is at risk or if a pregnancy results from rape or incest. To date, about 98% of all legal abortions in the country \u2014 of which there were 1,110 in 2019 \u2014 were performed on the grounds of fetal malformations.\nThe restriction of abortion comes amid a broader erosion of civil liberties under right-wing populist authorities in Poland, as well as Hungary. The erosion of democratic rights in the two nations also is spreading to other parts of ex-communist central Europe, presenting a challenge for the European Union and U.S. President Joe Biden as he seeks to restore democratic norms at home and abroad.\nPoland\u2019s constitutional court on Wednesday issued a justification of a controversial October ruling that bans abortions in cases of fetuses with congenital defects, even ones so severe that there is no chance of survival upon birth. The government then published the court\u2019s ruling in a government Journal of Laws. Those steps were the formal prerequisites required for the new law to enter into force.\nMembers of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party, which is aligned with the Roman Catholic Church, had sought the new restriction. They argued that it was a way to prevent the abortion of fetuses with Down syndrome, which have made up a significant share of the legal abortions in Poland.\nWomen\u2019s rights activists consider the new law to be draconian.\nThe protesters are demanding a full liberalization of the abortion law and the resignation of the government, neither of which seem likely in the short term.\nIn the meantime, women\u2019s rights groups are seeking new strategies to help women. The Federation for Women and Family planning says it will seek redress in international courts, arguing that the new law violates prohibitions of cruel treatment and torture. It is also assisting women who want to obtain abortion pills or travel abroad for the procedure.\nSome protesters Wednesday covered their faces with green handkerchiefs, which are the symbol of the abortion rights movement in Argentina. The South American country recently legalized abortion, a historic change in deeply Catholic Latin America.\nAmnesty International, calling Poland\u2019s law taking effect \u201ca terrible day for women and girls in Poland,\u201d said bans never prevent abortions.\n\u201cInstead, they serve only to damage women\u2019s health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to travel to foreign countries to access abortion care they need and to which they have a right,\u201d Amnesty senior research adviser Esther Major said.\nIn a more than 200-page ruling, the constitutional court argued that allowing abortion when there are congenital defects is unconstitutional because the Polish Constitution protects human life.\nThe constitutional court is made up mostly of Law and Justice appointees who ruled on a motion brought by lawmakers from the party.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A demonstrator holds a placard during a protest against the verdict restricting abortion rights in Warsaw, Poland, January 28, 2021.
