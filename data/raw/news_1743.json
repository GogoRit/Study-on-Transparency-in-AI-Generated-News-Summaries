Here\u2019s what you need to knowLauren Chapman & Violet Comber-Wilen Article origination IPB NewsProtesters gathered at the Indiana Statehouse last year ahead of a special legislative session in which lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban. The ban was temporarily halted after a challenge was heard by the Indiana Supreme Court. It takes effect Aug. 1. Alan Mbathi/IPB News\r\n\tIndiana lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban on Aug. 5, 2022, which Gov. Eric Holcomb signed into law quickly after. Two lawsuits temporarily halted the ban shortly after it took effect, until the Indiana Supreme Court ruled the ban did not violate the state\u2019s constitution.\n\n\r\n\tHowever, a\u00a0last-ditch effort by Indiana abortion providers\u00a0to halt the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban is creating uncertainty about when that ban might take effect.\n\r\n\tWe asked members of the Indiana Two-Way for their questions about the ban. To join the Indiana Two-Way text \u201cIndiana\u201d to 73224.\n\nWhat does the law do?\u00a0\n\r\n\tThe law bans abortion in Indiana, with\u00a0a few, narrow exceptions.\n\r\n\tAbortions would only be allowed if the pregnant person\u2019s serious health or life is at risk; if there\u2019s a lethal fetal anomaly up to 20 weeks post-fertilization; and in cases of rape or incest, but only up to 10 weeks.\n\r\n\tIt also\u00a0limits abortion to only hospitals\u00a0and surgical centers owned by hospitals \u2013 and specifically bans abortion clinics.\n\nWhat happened to the lawsuits challenging the ban?\n\r\n\tThe\u00a0Indiana Supreme Court ruled June 30\u00a0that the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban\u00a0does not violate\u00a0the Indiana Constitution.\n\r\n\tThe lawsuit brought by Indiana abortion care providers specifically challenged a provision of the law that banned abortion clinics outright, limiting the procedures to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers owned by hospitals. However,\u00a0that issue was not part\u00a0of the appeal heard by the Indiana Supreme Court, and it sent the case back to the trial court to flesh out that challenge.\n\r\n\tAnd that particular lawsuit did not give the Indiana Supreme Court the opportunity to more clearly define the circumstances when a pregnancy endangers someone's life or health \u2013 which could be the subject of future lawsuits.\n\r\n\tThere is also another lawsuit challenging the abortion ban. That suit argues that the ban violates the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act by infringing on the rights of those whose religions accept and even encourage abortions in certain circumstances.\n\r\n\tA Marion County judge\u00a0temporarily halted the law\u00a0from taking effect in that case, but only as it applies to the small handful of people who brought the suit. The judge later expanded the lawsuit to cover anyone whose religious beliefs clash with the abortion ban, but it's unclear how that now applies to enforcement of the ban.\n\n\n\nWill there be more lawsuits challenging the ban?\u00a0\n\r\n\tIndiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban is set to take effect Tuesday after the state Supreme Court OK'd its constitutionality in a recent ruling.\n\r\n\tA law professor says that same ruling opened the door for more lawsuits around the ban.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0said the abortion ban doesn\u2019t violate the state constitution\u2019s guarantee of liberty. But Indiana University law professor Jody Madeira said the ruling almost explicitly invites other challenges to the ban.\n\r\n\t\u201cThe court just felt that this challenge was too broad,\" Madeira said. \"So, the court might be quite willing to entertain other litigation.\u201d\n\r\n\tMadeira said one of the few exceptions to the ban that the court said was constitutionally guaranteed was in cases where the life or serious health of the pregnant person is at risk.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t abortion restrictions decided by a ballot question in Indiana?\n\r\n\tA lot of Hoosiers wanted to know why there\u2019s not a public question about abortion on the ballot this November \u2013 especially after a high-profile\u00a0Kansas referendum\u00a0in early August 2022.\n\r\n\tBallot questions (other than school funding referendums) are fairly rare in Indiana. There is no legal avenue for what\u2019s known as a \u201ccitizen-led\u201d initiative \u2013 for instance, gathering enough signatures to put a question on the ballot.\n\r\n\tStill, there\u2019s nothing in state law stopping legislators from creating one on abortion. But House and Senate Republicans rejected efforts from Democrats to do so.\n\r\n\tSenate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray (R-Martinsville) said that crafting such a question is difficult.\n\r\n\t\u201cCould you say \u2013 should abortion be legal? Should it be legal for the first trimester?\u201d Bray said. \u201cShould abortion be illegal with exception of the life of the mother, or the life and health of the mother, or the life and health of the mother and rape and incest? And if you say rape and incest or life of the mother, how do you define life of the mother?\u201d\n\r\n\tOhio voters will decide on two constitutional amendments in the next few months. One in August,\u00a0which would raise the threshold\u00a0for constitutional amendments to pass. And the second in November, which would\u00a0codify a right to abortion care\u00a0in the Ohio constitution.\n\nWill the ban affect access to contraceptives and emergency contraceptives?\n\r\n\tDuring testimony on the measure, Sen. Sue Glick (R-LaGrange) emphasized contraceptives and emergency contraceptives like Plan B would not be banned by this bill.\n\r\n\tHowever, the legislation signed into law leaves much of this promise up in the air, said Jennifer Drobac, an Indiana University law professor.\n\r\n\tShe said that language in the law could \u201cconceivably\u201d outlaw certain forms of birth control, including IUDs, that can interfere with the implantation process.\n\r\n\t\u201cThe problem with all of this is, how is a normal human being, person who's pregnant, supposed to know whether or not they're taking a medication or using a contraception that is actually prohibited \u2013 because they honestly think that what they're doing is OK, and, under the law, is not prohibited,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tShe added\u00a0this vague language\u00a0leaves room for interpretation. Drobac said the law does not go far enough in detailing what is acceptable, leaving contraceptive users potentially vulnerable to accidentally doing something illegal.\n\r\n\t\u201cSo that's the problem with the Indiana law, is it's dealing in an area of science that is sophisticated, with law that is not sophisticated,\u201d Drobac said.\n\nWhat might the FDA\u2019s expansion of abortion pill access mean for Hoosiers?\n\r\n\tThe Food and Drug Administration expanded access of abortion pills to more pharmacies, including large chains, mail-order companies and online pharmacies. But how this would affect Indiana\u2019s ban is complicated and unclear.\n\r\n\tJennifer Drobac is a law professor at Indiana University. Drobac said this ruling could make it easier for pregnant people to get an abortion \u2013 as they would not have to do an in-person visit to get this prescription. However, Indiana\u2019s abortion law requires abortion patients to be in the presence of a doctor.\n\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court blocks lower court decision in case on FDA approval of abortion pill\n\r\n\tShe said if Indiana\u2019s abortion law is put back into effect, this FDA ruling could make abortions more accessible for pregnant Hoosiers.\n\r\n\t\u201cIf a woman wants to avoid the law, it's easier for her to do so because she can get an electronic prescription,\u201d Drobac said. \u201cAnd she can get the medication through the mail. That doesn't make it legal, but it makes it easier.\u201d\n\r\n\tDrobac said Indiana\u2019s current abortion law only permits the prosecution of the doctors providing abortions, not for the pregnant people receiving them.\n\nHow will Indiana\u2019s abortion law affect medications that treat other conditions like lupus?\u00a0\n\r\n\tJody Madeira is a law professor at Indiana University Bloomington. She said this new law may affect access to these medications.\n\r\n\t\u201cPharmacists have to honor all prescriptions, but they are immune from criminal prosecution or civil liability if they refuse to honor prescriptions because in their professional judgment, it would be contrary to the law or a patient's health and safety are against the patient's best interests,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tShe said in some states, women have been\u00a0refused medication treating conditions\u00a0like arthritis.\n\r\n\tIn Indiana, pharmacists are typically expected to prescribe as the doctor ordered. But\u00a0a 2019 law\u00a0expanded protections for medical professionals who object to abortion on \u201cethical, moral, or religious grounds\u201d to refuse to participate in abortions, to include pharmacists who refuse to dispense abortion-inducing drugs.\n\r\n\t\u201cThere's nowhere in the abortion bill where it addresses pharmacists, refusals. Nor does it necessarily give pharmacists leave explicitly in the bill to sign off on prescriptions for abortion medication,\u201d she said.\n\nHow are hospitals preparing for the law taking effect?\u00a0\n\r\n\tDr. David Ingram is IU\u2019s Health chief medical officer. He said IU Health, Indiana\u2019s largest health care system, has spent the past few months deciding how to best provide support for health care providers.\n\r\n\t\u201cAll of our sites are prepared for that and we\u2019re determining what\u2019s the best access point, based on a number of factors for our patients seeking care,\u201d Ingram said.\n\r\n\tIngram said the cost of abortion in Indiana will increase due to the ban.\n\r\n\tMaternal-fetal medicine specialist Dr. Caroline Rouse said IU Health has also created a 24-7 rapid response team that\u2019s prepared to answer provider questions about what they are\u00a0allowed to do under the ban.\n\r\n\t\u201cSo, in the event that a health care provider has an urgent legal question related to provision of abortion services, the rapid response team can be called for an opinion and advice,\u201d Rouse said.\n\r\n\tThe hospital will continue to provide legal abortion care through this response team, and by monitoring the impact of the abortion ban on infant and maternal mortality rates in the country.\n\nWhere do the majority of Hoosiers stand on abortion?\n\r\n\tLaura Wilson is a University of Indianapolis associate professor of political science. She said getting an answer on abortion from polling is difficult as there\u2019s often a disconnect between opinion and action when it comes to polling.\n\r\n\t\u201cMany people will say generally speaking, they support something,\" Wilson said. \"Will they vote on the basis of that? Will they write their legislator on the basis of that? Will they go to protest on the basis of that?\u201d\n\r\n\tOn abortion polling specifically, Wilson said it\u2019s a particularly tricky issue to gauge public opinion on.\n\r\n\t\u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of parameters and a lot of exceptions, explanations, context that you can add to it,\" Wilson said. \"It\u2019s not as simple as we often make it feel, where you\u2019re either in support of it or against it.\u201d\n\r\n\tWhat\u00a0little Indiana public polling\u00a0about abortion there is available suggests a large majority of Hoosiers support at least some legal access to abortion \u2013 but exactly how much access is harder to gauge.\n\nREAD MORE: More abortion lawsuits likely as Indiana's near-total ban takes effect\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation and sign up for the Indiana Two-Way.

Your comments and questions in response to our weekly text help us find the answers you need on statewide issues.\n\nWill the ban lead to more people and businesses leaving Indiana?\n\r\n\tThe morning after Governor Holcomb signed a near-total abortion ban into law, one of the state\u2019s\u00a0largest employers\u00a0said the new restrictions will hinder its ability to attract talent.\n\r\n\t\u201cGiven this new law, we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state,\u201d pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, said in a statement.\n\r\n\tThe statement was the first comment Eli Lilly, which\u00a0employs more than 10,400 people in Indianapolis, has made on the legislation.\n\r\n\tCummins spoke out the same day\u00a0Eli Lilly issued its statement\u00a0to oppose the ban. Both companies said the ban will make it hard to attract talent, and they will consider growth in other states.\n\r\n\t\u201cFor Cummins to be successful it is critical that we have a safe and welcoming workplace, and communities where we embrace our differences and enable all employees to thrive,\u201d the Cummins statement said. \u201cAs we continue to grow our footprint with a focus on selecting communities that align with our values and business goals, this law will be considered in our decision-making process.\u201d\n\nUnlike many smaller companies in Indiana,\u00a0both Cummins and Eli Lilly were publicly silent until after the decision was passed.\n\r\n\tButHolcomb largely dismissed any impact Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban will have on attracting and retaining businesses and talent to the state.\n\r\n\tThe governor insisted the state is well-positioned to continue adding jobs and investments.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s because of access to talent,\u201d Holcomb said. \u201cAnd we have that access to talent \u2013 we had it yesterday, we have it today and we\u2019ll have it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDuring the special session last year, lawmakers also passed a measure to put more money toward adoption and family supports. Is that still there?\n\nThe package included\u00a0more than $70 million to help address services and programs for pregnant Hoosiers, families and children. That includes increasing the state adoption tax credit to $2,500 per child (up from $1,000) and ensuring Hoosiers no longer have to pay sales tax on children's diapers.\n\r\n\tDuring last year\u2019s special session,\u00a0critics of the legislation\u00a0said the\u00a0one-time allocation\u00a0wasn\u2019t enough to address Indiana\u2019s poor maternal mortality and access to care.\n\r\n\tOne study through the Indiana University Richard Fairbanks School of Public Health\u00a0titled \u201cAsk the Women\u201d\u00a0included people in zip codes with high infant mortality rates in an effort to understand where they experienced gaps in care.\n\r\n\tErin Macy is a senior researcher for the Grassroots and Maternal Child Health Initiative, which oversaw the study. She said a vast majority of the participants in the study worked over the course of their pregnancy. Roughly half of the participants experienced \u201csignificant interruptions\u201d in their ability to do work.\n\r\n\t\u201cMany of our participants were pushed out of work,\u201d she said. \u201cEither because they couldn\u2019t receive really basic accommodations and have bathroom breaks or go to prenatal visits.\u201d\n\r\n\tSen. Ryan Mishler (R-Bremen) called the bill \u201cbridge funding\u201d meant to help the state get through the next several months until lawmakers write a new state budget in 2023. The majority of that money went to the Hoosier Families First Fund.\n\r\n\tThe two-year budget passed by lawmakers does not appear to have any funding for the Hoosier Families First Fund \u2013 however, there is a line item in the state budget under the Indiana Department of Health for Maternal and Child Health Initiatives. In the previous two-year budget, it was allotted about $500,000 over two years. In the new budget, it\u2019s getting nearly $16.5 million.\n\r\n\tMost of the line items that received funding in the special session measure got boosts in the new two-year budget, including the Safety PIN Grant Fund and the Nurse Family Partnership Program. A widely criticized anti-abortion organization from Pennsylvania \u2013 Real Alternatives \u2013 also saw a significant increase in state funding. In the previous two-year budget, it received $500,000 over two years. In the new budget, it is getting $7 million.\n\nThe family supports law includes credits, exemptions for adoption. Will it affect the process?\n\r\n\tMeg Sterchi is the executive director of Adoptions of Indiana, a nonprofit offering various education and support services for birth parents and adoptive families.\n\r\n\t\u201cI think that it's good that Indiana is increasing services, well, money, to provide more services to women who are pregnant. But I think we're just scratching the top of what is needed if we really want to help women who are pregnant,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tOne of the bill\u2019s major changes was raising the adoption tax credit from $1,000 to $2,500.\n\r\n\tSterchi said this price change will \u201cnot make a big difference.\u201d She said she feels the scope of this legislation should\u2019ve gone further to support pregnant people.\n\r\n\tShannon Schumacher is the president and CEO of the Villages of Indiana, the state\u2019s largest not-for-profit child and family services agency.\n\r\n\tWhile she is hopeful that adoption tax credits could encourage others to adopt, she said other issues can arise post-adoption, including limited attention on the well-being of birth mothers.\n\r\n\t\u201cOftentimes, with the birth mother, there's lots of attention on her during her pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once the child is adopted, we know that oftentimes the support for the birth mother wanes at that point. So to make sure that there's continued support for those birth mothers after the baby is adopted [is important].\u201d\n\nHow will the ban affect doctors hoping to train or work in Indiana?\n\r\n\tIndiana, like many Republican-led states, has a shortage of providers.\u00a0A 2018 report from the March of Dimes\u00a0found 27 percent of Indiana counties are considered maternal care deserts, with no or limited access to maternity care. The state has one of the\u00a0highest maternal mortality rates\u00a0in the country.\n\r\n\tDr. Wendy Tian, a third year resident, said lately she is scared and worried about her safety. Tian grew up and went to school in Chicago and chose to come to Indiana for residency because the program has a strong family planning focus. She was also open to practicing in Indiana once she completes her training.\n\nBut that\u2019s changed.\n\r\n\t\u201cI always thought I wanted to do family planning. I'm now thinking about doing something else,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I still want to incorporate it. But I, for sure, don't know if I would be able to stay in Indiana postgraduation with what's going on.\u201d\n\r\n\tStill, she feels \u201cguilty for giving up\u201d on some of the most vulnerable patients in Indiana.\n\r\n\tEven before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Tian said the medical climate in Indiana could be hostile and frustrating. Indiana,\u00a0like other states\u00a0with abortion restrictions, allows nearly all health care providers to\u00a0opt-out of providing care for abortion\u00a0patients.\n\nThis story has been updated. \n\nIndiana Public Broadcasting's Brandon Smith contributed to this story.\n\nLauren is our digital editor.
