She was rescued by neighbors and is now being cared for in a safe house in Nairobi. The attacker reportedly said he kidnapped her because he needed female company to get through the government-imposed COVID-19 lockdown.\nThe Kenya government has adopted strict measures to counter the spread of the COVID-19 virus. But these measures, as necessary as they are, are having particular impact on women and girls, including elevating the risk of gender-based violence. Last week, the National Council on Administration of Justice reported \u201ca significant spike in sexual offences in many parts of the country in the past two weeks.\u201d They noted that \u201cin some cases, the perpetrators are close relatives, guardians and/or persons living with the victims.\u201d The report pledged that \u201cthe courts will consider giving directions on early hearing dates in such cases.\u201d\nViolence is a daily reality for women and girls across Kenya. According to government data, 45 percent of women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical violence and 14 percent have experienced sexual violence. Many cases are not reported to authorities and few women get justice or receive medical care.\nThe restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to make it harder for survivors to report abuse and seek help and for service providers to respond efficiently. Sexual and other forms of violence against women have devastating consequences including injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies.\nThe Kenya government should urgently protect women and girls against violence during this crisis. Its public awareness campaigns should highlight this risk and give detailed information on how victims, including those infected with COVID-19, can access services. It should treat services for women who experience violence as essential, ensure these services have the resources they need, and make alternative accommodation available when the current limited shelters are full. Violence against women and girls is a crime, and they have a right to be protected even when the government is preoccupied with a pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAfrica Kenya \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nCoronavirus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nHealth Women's Rights Domestic Violence \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nSouth Africa: Set Rights-Centered COVID-19 Measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\n          Interview\n        \n\n\nWaiting for the Storm: The Coronavirus in Africa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cGirls Shouldn\u2019t Give Up On Their Studies\u201d\n\n\nPregnant Girls\u2019 and Adolescent Mothers\u2019 Struggles to Stay in School in Mozambique\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 9, 2021\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Always Remember That Day\u201d\n\n\nAccess to Services for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nSouth Africa: Set Rights-Centered COVID-19 Measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\n          Interview\n        \n\n\nWaiting for the Storm: The Coronavirus in Africa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIsrael Not Complying with World Court Order in Genocide Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
