The Catholic Pro-Life Community, Texans for Life Coalition, the Catholic Diocese of Dallas, and the Diocese of Fort Worth North hosted the Texas March for Life rally where people gathered to instigate the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a Supreme Court decision that permitted states throughout the country in legalizing abortion under certain regulations. The 49th anniversary of the decision to legalize abortion falls on January 22.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nShares\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blog.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion bans are not pro-life. They're pro-poverty and pro-inequality.\nI'll tell you what we can do about it in a moment. But first, let me explain how these bans worsen inequalities.\n\nYou've probably heard of the two abortion cases making their way through the courts. But it's not just Texas and Mississippi's new bans. For years, Republican state lawmakers \u2013 almost entirely white men \u2013 have been chipping away at reproductive freedom: enacting laws that lead to clinic closures, force people to travel hundreds of miles for abortions, and create near-insurmountable barriers for low-income people, especially people of color.\nMake no mistake: bans like those in Texas and Mississippi won't stop abortions.\u00a0Wealthy\u00a0people will always have access, but millions of low-income people will be forced to give birth \u2013 with dire consequences for both parent and child.\nPregnant people in Texas\u00a0now have to travel an average of 247 miles to get an abortion. Who but the wealthy can afford this?\u00a0Only one third\u00a0of the lowest paid workers receive paid sick days, while 95% of the highest paid do.\u00a0Taking just one unpaid day off\u00a0from a low-wage job can mean sacrificing groceries, electricity, or gas.\nThese restrictions worsen inequality, and have lifelong effects.\nOne study\u00a0found that being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term makes it\u00a0nearly 4 times\u00a0more likely that parent and child will live below the poverty line. They're also less likely to have full-time work, and more likely to have public assistance four years later.\u00a0Decades of research\u00a0confirm that abortion access improves education, employment, and earnings \u2014 and the differences are especially large for Black people.\nIt's not just economics. Restricting abortion puts people's health at risk. Researchers found that\u00a0abortion legalization in the 1970s reduced deaths among Black mothers by 30 to 40 percent.\nThe Supreme Court's right-wing majority is poised to gut or even overturn Roe v. Wade. If they do,\u00a021 states already have laws\u00a0that will go into effect to severely restrict or outright ban all abortions immediately \u2013 threatening the livelihoods and health of millions of low-income Americans.\nCongress must codify Roe v. Wade into federal law -- now -- by passing the Women's Health Protection Act.\u00a0It's already been passed in the House\u00a0but is being blocked in the Senate by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a Republican filibuster.\nLet's be clear: there is nothing \"pro-life\" about forced pregnancy and forced birth. The freedom to choose when, how, and with whom you start a family should not be dictated by your income or where you live. Congress must act to protect reproductive now, freedom before it's too late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Robert Reich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert B.
