(photo: Courtesy photo / John Lillis)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nNation\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\n\n\u201cWill you allow your coffee to serve a greater purpose?\u201d That\u2019s the question Seven Weeks Coffee founder Anton Krecic likes to ask people. His company, founded in November, donates 10% of every sale to pro-life pregnancy centers and was built \u201cout of a desire to create a values-based business around an important issue of our day\u201d and \u201cconnect the pro-life movement through coffee.\u201d\u00a0\nHe told the Register that the name for Seven Weeks Coffee came when his wife, a nurse, told him to look up the age that an unborn baby is the size of a coffee bean. His research showed that it was at seven weeks and that that time was also when the \u201cheartbeat is clearly detectable; between six and eight weeks, usually, a mother\u2019s hearing their first ultrasound. They're hearing their child\u2019s heartbeat for the first time.\u201d He decided it was the perfect name for his company, as their mission is to \u201cpromote Godly values, provide excellent coffee, and protect every beating heart.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaking a Tangible Impact\nHis company has already given $2,800 to pregnancy-care centers since the website launched, crossing more than $30,000 in sales. \u201cWe\u2019re a new business, but we\u2019re already having a tangible impact, which is just amazing,\u201d he said. He added that transparency is \u201cbuilt into our business,\u201d so the company shares \u201cexactly how much we donate to which centers we\u2019re supporting.\u201d The centers they\u2019ve supported include Cleveland Pregnancy Center, Vans for Life, and Crisis Pregnancy of Tidewater.\nWhere the coffee originates matters to Krecic, as well. He partners with Genesis Coffee Lab, a faith-centered roaster that sources coffee from Ethiopia through direct trade, which means there is \u201ca direct relationship with the farming community where the coffee comes from.\u201d This, he said, \u201cis the only transparent way to ensure farmers are paid legitimate wages and honest wages.\u201d This is part of his company\u2019s approach: From \u201cfarm to cup, we\u2019re really creating a culture that uplifts people before profits \u2014 from the farmers who are getting paid legitimate and honest wages all the way to the moms who are getting a chance to hear their child\u2019s heartbeat.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving visited pro-life pregnancy centers, Krecic said he sees them as \u201ctruly the hands and feet of this movement,\u201d as \u201cthey are defending life and really the ones helping women choose life for their babies.\u201d He saw the importance of supporting the centers\u2019 life-sustaining work and said it was particularly important to help \u201ctheir ultrasound programs because that\u2019s the No. 1 tool used for when women choose life for their babies.\u201d He added that they are also \u201creally trying to target those tangible needs at centers\u201d to support women in choosing life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA \u2018Lifeboat\u2019 for Women\nThe pro-life issue is personal for John Lillis, who came from a career working in Catholic radio to found Lifeboat Coffee, which launched online in 2013. Lillis was adopted when his biological mother chose life for him after she was a victim of rape. He is now married with seven children and told the Register that the name for his business came from the idea of \u201cthrowing a lifeboat out for pregnant women.\u201d Lillis also has a background in the U.S. Coast Guard and at one point drove lifeboats for a living.\u00a0\nIn addition to their online presence, Lifeboat Coffee has a physical store in Phoenix. Their coffee includes several \u201cfair-trade, direct-trade, rainforest-certified, USDA organic coffees,\u201d and they have \u201cexclusive access to a Direct Trade Wild-Grown Papua New Guinea Peaberry coffee as well as Direct Trade Nicaraguan beans, too, supporting the Indigenous people of Papua New Guinea and a Christian mission in Nicaragua.\u201d Currently, Lillis said, the coffee shop offers java from 14 different countries, and he makes another eight blends.\u00a0\nHis company has pro-life groups sign up through his website and then they share the Lifeboat logo on their websites and social media, denoting they receive 6% cash back from every coffee sale. Some of their current affiliates include Mother of Life Pregnancy Center, Women\u2019s Care Center-Duluth, Inc., and the Southern California Chapter of Right to Life.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have about 25 registered affiliates,\u201d he said, adding that they label coffee on behalf of several other pro-life groups that are able to sell it for a profit. He added that every first-time Lifeboat Coffee customer receives a \u201cprecious hands\u201d or \u201cprecious feet\u201d pin from Lifeboat Coffee with a thank-you note as a reminder of the pro-life message.\nRichard Lafond of Mother of Life Pregnancy Center in Providence, Rhode Island, told the Register that he ran across the company more than a year ago and reached out to become an affiliate because \u201cit really made sense\u201d since \u201ceverybody is drinking coffee anyhow,\u201d and the center could benefit from some money from their supporters\u2019 coffee purchases. He said that while people are particular about the coffee they drink, he and \u201ca lot of people I know like to shop by the quality of the roast, the variety of beans, and the integrity of the company \u2014 and. because of that, Lifeboat is a perfect fit for us.\u201d\u00a0\nHe said that because of Lifeboat\u2019s values, the business deserves support, and he appreciates that \u201cthey\u2019re helping to spread the pro-life message in their own way, just like we are.\u201d He encouraged other pro-life organizations to sign up for an affiliation because \u201cit\u2019s a simple thing to do, and, basically, it is a low-effort way to receive a little bit of extra support.\u201d\u00a0\nHaving the option of a portion of money from a coffee purchase going to lifesaving pregnancy centers is refreshing, as pro-lifers have raised concerns and even boycotted Starbucks due to the coffee giant giving to Planned Parenthood through an employee donation matching program. Lillis said that Catholics should be thoughtful about where their money goes, saying that while it\u2019s difficult and requires more effort, it\u2019s worthwhile to support a pro-life cause. \u201cPeople can buy lots of different products, and I\u2019m glad to see that there\u2019s an emerging market for pro-life coffee, because coffee is a great marketplace and competition is great for the marketplace.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal police officer Lt. Gregg Rath, a self-described \u201ccoffee snob,\u201d told the Register that it was the smell of good coffee that first drew him to Lifeboat\u2019s physical location in Phoenix. He said he is very passionate about the pro-life issue and to discover their pro-life mission was \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d as he has avoided Starbucks for having opposing values. He spends hours every day in the coffee shop and said that discussions with a local priest who is also a frequent customer and with Lillis were crucial for him, as he recently began the process of converting to Catholicism from an evangelical background.\nHe appreciates that the coffee shop is \u201cmatter of fact\u201d about their beliefs, noting the crucifix and pro-life poster that greet patrons. He added that people from all walks of life come in, and it is an open, family-friendly environment. He believes God has put people in his life through coffee \u201con purpose\u201d and values the shop as a special place of community and fellowship.\n\n\nKeywords: \npro-life groups\ncatholic businesses\nlifeboat coffee\nseven weeks coffee\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60% Abortion Drop in Texas?
