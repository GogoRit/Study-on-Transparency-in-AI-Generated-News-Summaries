Photo credit: Ben Klocek, Flickr Creative Commons\n\n\n\n\nBy Rachel Crumpler\nAbortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are no longer legal in North Carolina, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, marking the first erosion of abortion access in the state since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision in late June.\nU.S. District Judge William Osteen Jr. reinstated North Carolina\u2019s 20-week abortion ban, cutting the limit of time pregnant people have for seeking abortions in the state from fetal viability, which typically falls between 24 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. For the past three years, the ban had been blocked by an injunction Osteen issued in 2019.\n\u201cThe significant problem with this ruling is that it will criminalize important health care that\u2019s needed in certain extraordinary circumstances,\u201d Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, an abortion rights supporter, said in a statement.\n\u201cAbortion past 20 weeks in pregnancy is exceptionally rare and happens because of a devastating health emergency or diagnosis,\u201d the governor\u2019s statement continued. \u201cDenying women necessary medical care in extreme and threatening situations, even if rare, is fundamentally wrong.\u201d\u00a0\nIn 2020, there were 30 abortions performed at 21 weeks or later in North Carolina, comprising about 0.1 percent of total abortions in the state.\u00a0\nDespite briefs filed earlier this month by doctors, district attorneys and the attorney general\u2019s office in favor of allowing the injunction to stand, Osteen lifted it on Aug. 17, explaining that the legal foundation of the injunction no longer stands since, under the Dobbs decision, there is no constitutional right to a pre-viability abortion.\n\n\n\u201cNeither this court, nor the public, nor counsel, nor providers have the right to ignore the rule of law as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d Osteen wrote in his court order.\nSenate leader Phil Berger (R-Eden) and House Speaker Tim Moore (R-Kings Mountain) had urged Osteen to restore the ban in a July 27 brief.\n\n2020 NC Resident Abortion Statistics from the State Center for Health Statistics\u00a0\n25,058 abortions were provided to NC residents (98.5 percent obtained in-state).56.6 percent of abortion seekers were 20 to 29 years old.49.3 percent of abortion seekers were African American, 27.9 percent were white and 13.1 percent Hispanic.58.7 percent of abortion seekers had 13+ years of education.Two-thirds of abortion seekers were already parents to one or more children.A total of 48 NC residents obtained abortions taking place after 21 weeks. Thirty of those procedures were performed in-state and 18 took place out of state. \n\nBan causes concern\nWhile the number of abortions performed after 20 weeks are minuscule compared to the state\u2019s total, abortion rights groups said in a joint statement that \u201cpeople will suffer from this dangerous ban\u201d as the abortion access landscape in North Carolina and the surrounding region changes.\n\u201cPeople seeking abortion later in pregnancy often do so because they face delays in accessing abortion care or dangerous complications with their pregnancy,\u201d Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement. \u201cMany need time to secure funds, time off work, transportation, and childcare, and often encounter other barriers in obtaining care, including medically unnecessary, state-mandated restrictions like North Carolina\u2019s 72-hour forced waiting period.\u00a0\n\u201cOthers may seek abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy after learning new information about their own health or the health of the fetus, which may present a serious medical emergency.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe reinstatement of the 20-week abortion ban came just a day after three Duke Health physicians voiced concern in a media briefing on Aug. 16 about how further restrictions could compromise pregnancy care in the state and nation.\n\u201cWe need these conversations to be between pregnant individuals, individuals considering pregnancy and folks who can really understand and give very thoughtful and helpful information,\u201d said Maria Small, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Duke Health.\nRamifications on pregnancy care\nStates across the country have implemented strict abortion bans, leaving health care workers in increasingly complicated positions as they navigate caring for pregnant patients.\u00a0\nMost abortions are banned in at least 10 states and an additional four states ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, a time before many women know they are pregnant, according to an abortion tracking map created by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization that aggregates information on reproductive health issues.\n\u201cIn states like Texas and others that already had a strict ban in place, they\u2019re seeing how the changes are happening right before their eyes,\u201d said Beverly Gray, residency director at Duke\u2019s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing patients\u2019 lives being put at risk on a daily basis. They\u2019re having to give patients non-evidence-based advice and recommendations because their state legislators are saying that that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nCompared to neighboring states such as Georgia and Tennessee which have banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, North Carolina\u2019s 14 abortion clinics remain abortion access points for state and out-of-state residents.\u00a0\n\nBut the quickly changing legal landscape related to abortion access is detrimental to the future of women\u2019s health care, Gray argued. She said she expects restrictions to have many downstream consequences.\n\u201cI am worried that there will be an increase in maternal mortality,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI worry that patients are going to have to travel further for care. As residency director, I worry about the next generation of physicians that we're training.\u201d\nLaws enacted by legislators to restrict abortion have more consequences than they realize, the three Duke physicians explained throughout the media briefing.\n \n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nFirst Name Email*\n\nZip Code* CommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the other downstream effects that I don't think we're prepared for nationally is an increase in birth rates,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWe already see rural hospitals closing their obstetric units. And now, at Duke, we're seeing more and more deliveries every year. And so I think that's another thing that, as medical providers across the country, we need to start thinking about \u2014 how we're going to prepare for more pregnancies.\u201d\nPatient concerns\nWhile access to abortion hasn\u2019t changed drastically in North Carolina since June, physicians are hearing a flood of new concerns come from patients of reproductive age.\u00a0\nMegan Clowse, a rheumatologist at Duke Health who cares for patients with a rheumatic disease who are pregnant or wish to become pregnant, said more patients are seeking tubal ligation, a surgery to permanently close a woman\u2019s fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy, instead of relying on other contraceptives such as birth control pills or an intrauterine device.\n\u201cI am hearing women who are afraid of having something bad happen to them during a pregnancy to the point that they're willing to sacrifice their desire for future children even though they're not really entirely sure,\u201d Clowse said.\nSmall, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, treats women with high-risk pregnancies. At 18 weeks she often performs an ultrasound because it\u2019s the best time to see if fetal organs are developing adequately and to identify serious birth defects. Since the Roe v. Wade ruling was overturned, her patients are increasingly asking how much time they have to make a decision about terminating a pregnancy if their lives are in danger or major birth defects are discovered that could severely compromise the child\u2019s quality of life.\u00a0\nThe constraint on the time limit permitted for abortion is an added stressor to an already difficult decision, she said.\nSmall said that the option of ending a pregnancy \u2014 one that she says patients never make lightly \u2014 needs to be available to individuals who need it and that the decision should be between a doctor and the patient, not legislators who do not understand pregnancy.\n \n\n\n\nmore stories about abortion access in north carolina\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat else grabbed your attention in 2023? North Carolina\u2019s top health topics. \n \nby Rachel Crumpler, Rose Hoban, Anne Blythe, Will Atwater and Charlotte Ledger \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccess to abortion fraught with more logistical challenges as patients confront increased restrictions \n \nby Rachel Crumpler \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNew numbers reveal ongoing impact of abortion restrictions, loss of access to care in NC \n \nby Rachel Crumpler \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysician concerns\nDoctors get into health care to help patients live the best lives they can, Clowse said, and, at times, that means talking about abortion with patients and helping them access it. With growing regulation, she and her colleagues are worried about their ability to continue to do that and the legal consequences it could bring in some states.\nAnother challenge physicians are facing come from laws that create exceptions for the life of the mother. Many in the general public may think that the risk is easy to define \u2014 either someone is dying or they aren\u2019t \u2014 but doctors know it isn\u2019t always clear. Gray knows physicians in Texas operating under strict abortion bans with narrow exceptions and are making challenging determinations about when the risk is high enough for medical interventions. Does the patient\u2019s organs need to be failing? Does someone need to be hemorrhaging to the extent of needing a blood transfusion?\n\u201cEssentially, they were having to watch those patients until they were on the brink of a catastrophic outcome and then they could take care of them,\u201d Gray said.\nSmall added that the United States already has a maternal health crisis and she is bracing for it to get worse. In 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the maternal mortality rate ticked up to 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births from 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019. For Black women, the rate was even higher at 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.\u00a0\n\u201cIt really is sad and disturbing that we are fighting so hard to decrease maternal mortality rates and yet we have conditions where people are wondering, \u2018Can I intervene in this condition that usually is associated with maternal death, like an ectopic pregnancy?\u2019\u201d Small said.\nGray said restrictive abortion bans are creating a medical environment where physicians are offering worse care to patients.\nMore restrictions coming?\nAbortion in North Carolina could be restricted further next year if Republicans gain two seats in the state Senate and three in the state House of Representatives to obtain a veto-proof supermajority. Some Republicans have already expressed a desire to pass more abortion restrictions but they have yet to do so because Gov. Cooper has been able to use his veto power to block such restrictions.\u00a0\nThe state\u2019s abortion opponents have vowed that Osteen\u2019s ruling is \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cWe are going to work hard to get legislation passed which will protect as many unborn babies and their mothers as possible,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, in a statement released after Osteen\u2019s ruling.\nBut physicians retort that abortion bans have negative ramifications on pregnancy care.\n\"There\u2019s this idea that a ban will make care safer for the patient \u2013 that\u2019s absolutely not true at all,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIn fact, it makes care less safe.\u201d\nRepublish This StoryRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.\n \nClose window XRepublish this articleThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nYou are free to use NC Health News content under the following conditions:\n\nYou can copy and paste this html tracking code into articles of ours that you use, this little snippet of code allows us to track how many people read our story.\nPlease do not reprint our stories without our bylines, and please include a live link to NC Health News under the byline, like this:By Jane DoeNorth Carolina Health News\nFinally, at the bottom of the story (whether web or print), please include the text:North Carolina Health News is an independent, non-partisan, not-for-profit, statewide news organization dedicated to covering all things health care in North Carolina.

With growing regulation, she and her colleagues are worried about their ability to continue to do that and the legal consequences it could bring in some states.</p>\n<p>Another challenge physicians are facing come from laws that create exceptions for the life of the mother. Many in the general public may think that the risk is easy to define \u2014 either someone is dying or they aren\u2019t \u2014 but doctors know it isn\u2019t always clear. Gray knows physicians in Texas operating under strict abortion bans with narrow exceptions and are making challenging determinations about when the risk is high enough for medical interventions. Does the patient\u2019s organs need to be failing? Does someone need to be hemorrhaging to the extent of needing a blood transfusion?</p>\n<p>\u201cEssentially, they were having to watch those patients until they were on the brink of a catastrophic outcome and then they could take care of them,\u201d Gray said.</p>\n<p>Small added that the United States already has a maternal health crisis and she is bracing for it to get worse. In 2020,<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20861%20women%20were,20.1%20in%202019%20(Table).\"> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the maternal mortality rate ticked up to 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births from 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019. For Black women, the rate was even higher at 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is sad and disturbing that we are fighting so hard to decrease maternal mortality rates and yet we have conditions where people are wondering, \u2018Can I intervene in this condition that usually is associated with maternal death, like an ectopic pregnancy?\u2019\u201d Small said.</p>\n<p>Gray said restrictive abortion bans are creating a medical environment where physicians are offering worse care to patients.</p>\n<h4><strong>More restrictions coming?</strong></h4>\n<p>Abortion in North Carolina could be restricted further next year if Republicans gain two seats in the state Senate and three in the state House of Representatives to obtain a veto-proof supermajority. Some Republicans have already expressed a desire to pass more abortion restrictions but they have yet to do so because Gov. Cooper has been able to use his veto power to block such restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The state\u2019s abortion opponents have vowed that Osteen\u2019s ruling is \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are going to work hard to get legislation passed which will protect as many unborn babies and their mothers as possible,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.ncvalues.org/staff\">Tami Fitzgerald</a>, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, in a statement released after Osteen\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p>But physicians retort that abortion bans have negative ramifications on pregnancy care.</p>\n<p>\"There\u2019s this idea that a ban will make care safer for the patient \u2013 that\u2019s absolutely not true at all,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIn fact, it makes care less safe.\u201d</p>\n\n\n This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2022/08/19/abortion-access-diminishes-in-nc-after-federal-judge-reinstates-20-week-ban/\">article</a> first appeared on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org\">North Carolina Health News</a> and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-favicon02.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:1em;height:1em;margin-left:10px;\"><img id=\"republication-tracker-tool-source\" src=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/?republication-pixel=true&post=40928\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\">\n Copy to Clipboard\n1\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTagged: abortion,\u00a0abortion clinic,\u00a0Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization,\u00a0Duke Health,\u00a0Gov.
