(Photo by Dave Kaup / AFP via Getty Images)\n\n Donald Trump won Kansas by a 15-point margin in 2020, sweeping 100 of the state\u2019s 105 counties as the presidential candidate of a Republican Party that has for decades pledged to overturn the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights. So a lot of folks just presumed, prior to Tuesday\u2019s Kansas vote on whether to remove protections for abortion access from their state Constitution, that the anti-choice position would prevail.\nBut the first statewide vote on abortion rights since the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court overturned Roe didn\u2019t go as the right had planned. Kansans voted 59-41 to maintain legal barriers to Republican efforts to ban abortions. Hailing a \u201chuge and decisive victory,\u201d Rachel Sweet, the campaign manager for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which successfully promoted a \u201cno\u201d vote in Tuesday\u2019s election, announced, \u201cThe people of Kansas have spoken. They think that abortion should be safe, legal and accessible in the state of Kansas.\u201d\nPundits who are now treating the Kansas vote as \u201ca stunning upset\u201d and \u201ca surprising victory\u201d had assumed that conservative voters would support what was widely understood as an effort to clear the way for an abortion ban. But while the pro-choice margin was striking, the win for abortion rights was not exactly a shocker. In fact, it followed a pattern that\u2019s been noted for decades by savvy observers of voting trends.\nWhen reproductive rights issues are on the ballot, even in Republican-leaning states, well-organized and unapologetic pro-choice campaigns have established a winning record. That\u2019s what happened in South Dakota in 2006, when voters rejected a sweeping abortion ban by a 55-45 vote, and where they did the same thing two years later\u2014in a presidential election year\u2014by roughly the same margin. That\u2019s what happened in Mississippi in 2011, when voters opposed a so-called \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendment to the state Constitution, which sought to eliminate reproductive rights, by a 58-42 vote. That\u2019s what happened in Florida in 2012, when, by a 55-45 margin, voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited the state from spending public funds for abortions or health insurance that covers abortions. That\u2019s what happened in North Dakota in 2014, when voters rejected a so-called \u201cright-to-life amendment\u201d by an overwhelming 64-36 margin.\nThere have been some setbacks over the years, often by narrow margins, in states such as West Virginia, where a 2018 amendment that said \u201cnothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion,\u201d won by a 51.73 to 48.27 vote. But, by and large, when anti-choice proposals are on the ballot, voters tend to protect abortion rights. And that\u2019s reasonably likely to be case in states across the country now that the Supreme Court has delivered its ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. \nRelated Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fight for Abortion After \u201cRoe\u201d Falls\nAmy Littlefield\n\n\nThe Kansas victory on Tuesday resulted from grassroots boots-on-the-ground organizing and honest engagement on the issue. Television ads urged Kansas voters to reject a \u201cstrict government mandate\u201d that \u201cputs a mother\u2019s life at risk\u201d and that could \u201cban any abortion with no exceptions.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t just a media campaign. Pro-choice activists mounted an energetic grassroots organizing drive that reached out to a wide range of communities, including those in historically Republican rural counties\u2014a number of which voted \u201cno\u201d on Tuesday. In some western Kansas counties, support for the pro-choice position on the ballot question ran more than 25 points better than the 2020 vote for Joe Biden.\nAs the 2022 election season unfolds, activists in other states can learn a good deal from the Kansas activists who spoke bluntly about how banning abortion will take away fundamental rights, criminalize health choices, and prevent doctors and nurses from providing necessary care.\nFramed in those terms, the fight to preserve abortion rights takes on a dynamic character as an electoral project. Hillary Clinton said Wednesday, \u201cAbortion rights are crucial. Abortion rights are popular. Abortion rights are a winning issue.\u201d It is, indeed, likely, to be a winning issue in other states\u2014Kentucky , California, Vermont, and Michigan\u2014that hold referendums on reproductive rights this fall. It could also be a winning issue in contests between pro-choice and anti-choice candidates for governorships, attorneys general positions, and control of legislative chambers and the Congress.\nThis is something Republicans have understood for some time.\nWhen Trump debated Joe Biden in the fall of 2020, the Republican president bristled at the Democrat\u2019s suggestion that the election should be considered a referendum on reproductive rights. \n\n \n\nMore From John Nichols\n\n\n\nA Short History of the Aaron Rodgers for Vice President Campaign\nToday 5:00 am \n\n\nBiden Should Channel His Inner FDR and Soak the Rich\nMarch 13, 2024 \n\n\nThe \u201cUncommitted\u201d Movement Keeps Getting Stronger\nMarch 11, 2024 \n\nBarely 10 minutes into the first televised clash between the two candidates, Biden stated, \u201cThe point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v. Wade. That\u2019s on the ballot as well and the court\u2026that\u2019s also at stake right now.\u201d Before Biden could finish, Trump interrupted him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot?\u201d asked the 45th president. \u201cWhy is it on the ballot? It\u2019s not on the ballot.\u201d\nWhy was Trump so fretful? Because he\u2019s a cynical politician who used a promise to pack the Supreme Court with anti-choice judges as a tool to secure the Republican nomination in 2016, and to maintain support among social conservatives even when his own actions were morally reprehensible and should have been seen as politically disqualifying. But Trump did not want to have to face the consequences of his position, or of his actions, after he nominated three high court justices who would, indeed, vote to overturn Roe.\nThe same goes for a lot of other Republicans. That\u2019s why in Kansas GOP legislators and operatives schemed to put their confusingly worded constitutional amendment on the ballot in an August primary, where turnout was expected to be low and where Republican contests for governor and attorney general were the big draws. Pro-choice organizing that sought and secured a high turnout upended their calculations. When all the votes are counted, the 2022 Kansas primary election turnout will very nearly double the turnout for the comparable primary in 2018.\nAs Democrats look to November, they would be wise to take their cues from Kansas abortion rights activists. Abortion is not the only issue that brings people to the polls and influences how they vote. But if party activists make the case that abortion is on the ballot in November, if they boost turnout from pro-choice voters, and if Democratic candidates can achieve even a small measure of the swing seen in Kansas, the 2022 political calculus could be dramatically improved for Biden and for his party.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
