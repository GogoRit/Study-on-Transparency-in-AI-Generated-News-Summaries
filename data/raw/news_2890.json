If you\u2019re still looking for pro-life opportunities (and want to get some travel in!), Students for Life Action (SFLAction) has got you covered\u2014get ready for a summer of sun and service.\u00a0\u00a0\nSFLAction will be hosting 23 different activism trips over the summer, and you\u2019re invited to come along for the ride. Differing from our door-knocking trips, this summer\u2019s SFLAction activism trips will prioritize a pro-life cultural experience to give you a feel of what the pro-life movement is really like. Learn more about these trips below:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat would I do on this trip?\u00a0\nTrip participants will engage in a number of pro-life activities including door-to-door canvassing, apologetics trainings to grow your pro-life knowledge, networking with fellow pro-life activists, team \u2013bonding fellowship time, sidewalk counseling, phone/text message efforts, and much more. SFLAction will train you to be an effective and confident advocate for life, especially if you have never engaged in a public policy effort before.\u202f\u00a0\nHow much will this cost me?\u00a0\u00a0\nIt won\u2019t! SFLAction will fully cover your expenses on the trip\u2014which includes travel, lodging, and food expenditures. And guess what? On longer trips, SFLAction will also pay participating activists an additional stipend for their time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhere are the trips and when?\u00a0\u00a0\nCheck out SFLAction\u2019s summer activism trip locations below to see which one (or two or three or four!) that you would be interested in participating in:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArizona\u00a0Colorado\u00a0\nFlorida\u00a0Georgia\u00a0Nevada\u00a0New Hampshire\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0\nPennsylvania\u00a0Virginia\u00a0Wisconsin\u00a0New Mexico\u00a0Minnesota\u00a0\nMaine\u00a0Michigan\u00a0Iowa\u00a0\n\nWhy is this important now?\u00a0\nWith the Supreme Court closer than ever to reversing\u202fRoe v. Wade, this summer is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the pro-life movement to act. The Pro-Life Generation needs to be working to protect life in law and service, and these trips are a great opportunity to do so. By protecting life in law and service, we can ensure that preborn children and women are both taken care of in a Post-Roe America.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow can I sign up?\u00a0\u00a0\nTo sign up for one (or more!) of SFLAction\u2019s summer activism trips, click HERE and fill out the corresponding volunteer form.
