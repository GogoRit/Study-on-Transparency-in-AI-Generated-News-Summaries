(AP) \u2014 Kansas voters on Tuesday sent a resounding message about their desire to protect abortion rights, rejecting a ballot measure in a conservative state with deep ties to the anti-abortion movement that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban the procedure outright.It was the first test of voter sentiment after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June that overturned the constitutional right to abortion, providing an unexpected result with potential implications for the coming midterm elections.While it was just one state, the heavy turnout for an August primary that typically favors Republicans was a major victory for abortion rights advocates. With most of the vote counted, they were prevailing by roughly 20 percentage points, with the turnout approaching what\u2019s typical for a fall election for governor.\n\nThe vote also provided a dash of hope for Democrats nationwide grasping for a game-changer during an election year otherwise filled with dark omens for their prospects in November.\u201cThis vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter calling on Congress to \u201crestore the protections of Roe\u201d in federal law, Biden added, \u201cAnd, the American people must continue to use their voices to protect the right to women\u2019s health care, including abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kansas vote also provided a warning to Republicans who had celebrated the Supreme Court ruling and were moving swiftly with abortion bans or near-bans in nearly half the states.\u201cKansans bluntly rejected anti-abortion politicians\u2019 attempts at creating a reproductive police state,\u201d said Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity. \u201dToday\u2019s vote was a powerful rebuke and a promise of the mounting resistance.\u201d\n\nThe proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution would have added language stating that it does not grant the right to abortion. A 2019 state Supreme Court decision declared that access to abortion is a \u201cfundamental\u201d right under the state\u2019s Bill of Rights, preventing a ban and potentially thwarting legislative efforts to enact new restrictions.The referendum was closely watched as a barometer of liberal and moderate voters\u2019 anger over the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling scrapping the nationwide right to abortion. In Kansas, abortion opponents wouldn\u2019t say what legislation they\u2019d pursue if the amendment were passed and bristled when opponents predicted it would lead to a ban. Mallory Carroll, a spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, described the vote as \u201ca huge disappointment\u201d for the movement and called on anti-abortion candidates to \u201cgo on the offensive.\u201dShe added that after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, \u201cWe must work exponentially harder to achieve and maintain protections for unborn children and their mothers.\u201d \n\nThe measure\u2019s failure also was significant because of Kansas\u2019 connections to anti-abortion activists. Anti-abortion \u201cSummer of Mercy\u201d protests in 1991 inspired abortion opponents to take over the Kansas Republican Party and make the Legislature more conservative. They were there because Dr. George Tiller\u2019s clinic was among the few in the U.S. known to do abortions late in pregnancy, and he was murdered in 2009 by an anti-abortion extremist.Anti-abortion lawmakers wanted to have the vote coincide with the state\u2019s August primary, arguing they wanted to make sure it got the focus, though others saw it as an obvious attempt to boost their chances of winning. Twice as many Republicans as Democrats have voted in the state\u2019s August primaries in the decade leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election.\u201cThis outcome is a temporary setback, and our dedicated fight to value women and babies is far from over,\u201d the coalition leading the vote yes campaign said. The electorate in Tuesday\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t typical for a Kansas primary, particularly because tens of thousands of unaffiliated voters cast ballots. \n\nKristy Winter, 52, a Kansas City-area teacher and unaffiliated voter, voted against the measure and brought her 16-year-old daughter with her to her polling place.\u201cI want her to have the same right to do what she feels is necessary, mostly in the case of rape or incest,\u201d she said. \u201cI want her to have the same rights my mother has had most of her life.\u201dOpponents of the measure predicted that the anti-abortion groups and lawmakers behind the measure would push quickly for an abortion ban if voters approved it. Before the vote, the measure\u2019s supporters refused to say whether they would pursue a ban as they appealed to voters who supported both some restrictions and some access to abortion.\n\nStephanie Kostreva, a 40-year-old school nurse from the Kansas City area and a Democrat, said she voted in favor of the measure because she is a Christian and believes life begins at conception. \u201cI\u2019m not full scale that there should never be an abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cI know there are medical emergencies, and when the mother\u2019s life is in danger there is no reason for two people to die.\u201dAn anonymous group sent a misleading text Monday to Kansas voters telling them to \u201cvote yes\u201d to protect choice, but it was suspended late Monday from the Twilio messaging platform it was using, a spokesperson said. Twilio did not identify the sender.The 2019 Kansas Supreme Court decision protecting abortion rights blocked a law that banned the most common second-trimester procedure, and another law imposing special health regulations on abortion providers also is on hold. Abortion opponents argued that all of the state\u2019s existing restrictions were in danger, though some legal scholars found that argument dubious. Kansas doesn\u2019t ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy.The Kansas vote is the start of what could be a long-running series of legal battles playing out where lawmakers are more conservative on abortion than governors or state courts. Kentucky will vote in November on whether to add language similar to Kansas\u2019 proposed amendment to its state constitution.Meanwhile, Vermont will decide in November whether to add an abortion rights provision to its constitution. A similar question is likely headed to the November ballot in Michigan.In Kansas, both sides together spent more than $14 million on their campaigns. Abortion providers and abortion rights groups were key donors to the \u201cno\u201d side, while Catholic dioceses heavily funded the \u201cyes\u201d campaign.The state has had strong anti-abortion majorities in its Legislature for 30 years, but voters have regularly elected Democratic governors, including Laura Kelly in 2018. She opposed the proposed amendment, saying changing the state constitution would \u201cthrow the state back into the Dark Ages.\u201dState Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican hoping to unseat Kelly, supported the proposed constitutional amendment. He told the Catholic television network EWTN before the election that \u201cthere\u2019s still room for progress\u201d in decreasing abortions, without spelling out what he would sign as governor.Although abortion opponents pushed almost annually for new restrictions until the 2019 state Supreme Court ruling, they felt constrained by past court rulings and Democratic governors like Kelly.___This story has been updated to correct the attribution for the quote that begins, \u201cThis outcome is a temporary setback.\u201d It came from a statement issued by the coalition that led the \u201cvote yes\u201d campaign, not Emily Massey.___Stafford reported from Overland Park and Olathe.___Follow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna.
