Bob Casey, D-Pa., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Get Philly smart \ud83d\udca1with BP\u2019s free daily newsletter\nRead the news of the day in less than 10 minutes \u2014 not that we\u2019re counting.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc8c Love Philly?

As a pro-life Democrat, he wants to limit the number of abortions that take place in the U.S. \u2014 but he also doesn\u2019t approve of Republicans\u2019 recent attempts to weaponize the issue.\nA draft of a U.S. Supreme Court decision leaked Monday night, indicating a likelihood that the justices will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Casey responded to the leaked opinion in a statement Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cIf this draft opinion becomes the final opinion of the Court, I have serious concerns about what overturning almost 50 years of legal precedent will mean for women in states passing near or total bans on abortion,\u201d Casey said. \u201cCongress should be working to reduce the number of abortions and unintended pregnancies and doing much more to support women and families.\u201d\n \n \n\nAfter the SCOTUS draft leaked, pro-choice advocates renewed calls for federal lawmakers to pass a law that would preserve abortion rights.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act last fall. The Senate then voted in late February, but the act failed to get majority support.\nJust two of the 50 sitting Democratic senators held back from co-sponsoring the bill. One was West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who ultimately joined Republicans (as he has on other issues) and voted against moving the act forward.\nThe other holdout who declined to sponsor the bill was Casey, who has throughout his political career described himself as a pro-life Democrat. His father, former Pa. Gov. Bob Casey Sr., was famously pro-life.\nCasey, however, did vote to begin debate on the act. He was one of 46 Democrats that voted to do so. Six senators, three Democrats and three Republicans, did not vote.\n \n \n\n\u201cGiven the recent Supreme Court rulings, potential rulings this year, and the Republican Party\u2019s clear and unrelenting use of this issue as a political weapon, I will vote \u2018yes\u2019 to allow debate on this bill,\u201d Casey said in a statement ahead of the vote. \u201cI have long worked to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions, and I hope that as part of this debate we will also focus on new and substantial funding for pregnant women, infants, and children.\u201d\nStill, Casey\u2019s vote in favor of debate wasn\u2019t enough. The act needed 60 votes to overcome Republicans\u2019\u00a0 filibuster \u2014 when senators exercise their right to unlimited debate, which can keep a bill from being voted on indefinitely.\nThe bill wasn\u2019t actually ever expected to pass in the Senate, but did create a record of where sitting senators stand on the issue. The vote showed that even if all three non-voting Democrats backed the bill later, it would lack a majority because of Manchin\u2019s vote against.\nA look back at his statements and votes provide some insight into how he might respond if SCOTUS does vote to end constitutional protections for abortion.\nUnusual stance for a Northeast Democrat\nCasey has addressed his position as a pro-life Democrat before. In a 2018 interview with Politico, he said:\n \n \n\n\u201cWhat it means is I try to support policies that help women and children both before and after birth. Part of that is making sure you are honest about differences but also at the same time trying to focus on ways to reduce both the number of abortions and the number of unwanted pregnancies, and I think my record reflects that.\u201d\nCasey has said he supports allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest.\nHe has also said certain measures taken to limit abortions have gone too far. In an interview with Morning Call in 2019, soon after the passage of a near-total abortion ban in Alabama, he said:\n \n\ud83d\udc8c Love Philly? Sign up for the free Billy Penn daily newsletter and stay in the know\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMost Republicans have clearly committed to this \u2026 litigation strategy, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting much of a result for it. \u2026 The policies that have reduced abortion the most have been wider access to health care, wider access to contraception, programs that support families.\u201d\nHowever, Casey also has a history of voting with Republicans on some abortion issues.\n \n \n\nIn 2020, he voted in favor of two anti-abortion bills that were sponsored by Republican senators. Both bills failed to advance.\nOne of them would have criminalized abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy (with exceptions for a pregnancy that is life-threatening for the woman, or pregnancy as the result of rape or incest). Casey and Manchin voted for it.\nThe other bill would have required health care providers to make every attempt possible to save the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion. Casey, Manchin and Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, voted for the bill.\nLooking at Casey\u2019s voting record from the lens of advocacy groups shows how split his stance has been.\nHis votes aligned with NARAL Pro-Choice America 72% of the time in 2020, according to that organization\u2019s Congressional Record on Reproductive Freedom. And his votes have aligned with Planned Parenthood\u2019s priorities two-thirds of the time since 2015.\n \n\n\n\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f more from Billy Penn\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhilly floats plans for another intercity bus terminal \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMore police, street cleaning, \u201ctriage facilities\u201d: Takeaways from Mayor Parker\u2019s first city budget proposal \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t forget about us\u2019: Advocates hope Parker moves the needle on Parks & Rec funding \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHundreds march through Center City to demand cease-fire in Israel-Hamas war \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGetting to know you: This is what chatGPT says Philly is famous for \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u201cThose bathrooms are going to get better at the airport\u201d: Parker pledges improvements \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\ud83e\udd70 Nice to see you. \ud83e\udd70(Instead of a paywall)\nLocal news should be free and accessible, which is why we ask readers like you to support our work rather than charging a fee to see it.
