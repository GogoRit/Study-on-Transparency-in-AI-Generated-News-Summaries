This is really happening.Wajahat AliUpdated\u00a0Mar. 22, 2022\u00a04:41PM EDT\u00a0/\u00a0Published\u00a0Mar. 19, 2022\u00a012:03AM EDT\u00a0opinionIllustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastThe modern GOP is now willing to empower and reward a rapist and his family if it means they can control a woman\u2019s body, end abortion rights, and implement minority rule for white Christian men.You might think that\u2019s an outlandish and hyperbolic statement, but then again you probably haven\u2019t read Idaho\u2019s S.B. 1309 bill, which is expected to be signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little. It will go into effect 30 days after signing, and there are multiple copycat bills moving forward, such as the one in Oklahoma.This latest bill from hell is modeled after the Texas SB8 \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d which makes it illegal to terminate a pregnancy after six weeks\u2014even though most women don\u2019t even realize they are pregnant by then. That\u2019s precisely the point. The Supreme Court, whose extremist majority was intentionally vetted and picked by Republican activists to overturn Roe v. Wade, has refused to intervene in the Texas case, thereby signaling the end of abortion rights and galvanizing copycat bills across red states.  Idaho has decided to pick up the baton from Texas and advance the GOP\u2019s death march. It\u2019s sweetening the pot, allowing vigilantes to sue abortion providers and win a lucrative $20,000 bounty plus legal fees\u2014double the size of the Lone Star State\u2019s reward, proving that everything isn\u2019t always bigger in Texas. Idaho Republicans are also allowing the father and relatives of a \u201cpreborn child\u201d to veto an abortion, effectively allowing a father to force his adult daughter to carry an unwanted pregnancy.  Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern of Slate did an excellent breakdown of the bill and the profound ways it further victimizes the victim. In order to have a legal abortion, a rape victim is required to file a police report, which many women avoid for fear of retaliation from abusers, the prospect of being shamed, and the very real possibility that the legal system won\u2019t believe them. If the woman terminates her pregnancy without filing a police report, the rapist\u2019s family, including up to 10 relatives, can still sue the provider and collect a $20,000 bounty per relative. This is \u201cpro-life.\u201dFor the modern GOP, it pays to be soft on rape, but hard on women\u2019s rights. According to Lithwick and Stern,\u201cIdaho has not only nullified [Planned Parenthood v. Casey\u2019s] protections for abuse victims, even before the Supreme Court has pronounced Casey dead. It\u2019s also empowered the families of those denied a veto in Casey cash prizes for exercising that veto.\u201dI asked Emily Halvorson, the press officer of state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, if it\u2019s fair to conclude that this GOP bill does more to protect a rapist and his supporters than it does to protect vulnerable women.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this legislation is protective of anyone, but certainly it does not offer any protections to pregnant people seeking abortion, and would be especially threatening to survivors of rape and to people experiencing domestic or inter-partner violence,\u201d she replied. In addition to allowing family members of the rapist to bring a lawsuit on the rapist\u2019s behalf, Halvorson mentioned Idaho\u2019s SB 1309 would \u201cotherwise allow an abuser to sue a provider so long as the pregnancy was not itself the result of a rape.\u201dBut don\u2019t worry. It gets worse.Moving from Idaho to Missouri, we have H.B. 2810 introduced by Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz that would make it a felony punishable by 10 years to life in prison to perform an abortion after 10 weeks of pregnancy.One would assume that Republicans giving women 10 weeks instead of six weeks to terminate their pregnancy is a form of compassion and enlightenment, but not in this case where even ectopic pregnancies are not allowed. These pregnancies, which are not viable, are the leading cause of death for women in their first trimester as the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus and often leads to hemorrhaging if not aborted. But Republicans will never let science and women\u2019s health stand in the way of their zealous, regressive crusade. If this bill is passed, the only choice a woman will have is the following: jail or death.Rep. Seitz, without irony or self-awareness, says, \u201cThis bill is about protecting life.\u201d He left out whose life, but we all know women aren\u2019t on the multiple-choice. Unfortunately, he\u2019s not an outlier.  In 2019, Ohio state Rep. John Becker, a Republican (surprise!), proposed a bill that \u201cwould have prohibited insurers from covering abortion services but provided an exception for doctors to \u2018reimplant\u2019 an ectopic pregnancy into a woman\u2019s uterus.\u201d Rep. Becker later conceded he hadn\u2019t studied whether such a procedure was possible (it isn\u2019t), but why let reality and the laws of nature get in the way of controlling women? He was advised by Barry Sheets, a lobbyist for the Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio. Adherence to science, facts, data, and studies aren\u2019t a strong suit for anti-abortion advocates, and they certainly don\u2019t seem to be of much importance to Republican lawmakers anymore.With the upcoming midterms expecting to be a rout for Republicans, it seems any attempt to save Roe v. Wade is bleak and the latest GOP onslaught against women\u2019s rights will only accelerate\u2014even though the right to an abortion is supported by the majority of Americans.\u201cSupporters need to make their voices heard,\u201d Halvorson told me. \u201cCommunity abortion funds, health care workers, and organizers on the ground are leading this fight in states across the country\u2014as they have for years. Supporters of abortion rights need to support those organizations and donate to them to help patients get care outside of the state.\u201dRight on cue, Missouri Republicans are now considering making it illegal to \u201caid or abet\u201d out-of-state abortions. It seems Republicans find remarkable ways to be creative and productive when it comes to creating new ways to control women\u2019s bodies, even as they are unable to provide any solutions to income inequality, COVID relief, health care, climate change, and child poverty. The modern GOP is pro-fossil fuels but anti-renewable energy, pro-free speech but anti-Critical Race Theory, and pro-family but aggressively anti-women.But, don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re still pro-life\u2014as long as the baby is in the womb\u2014and to prove their fevered commitment to their radicalized base, they\u2019re now even pro-rapist.
