Republican candidate tweeted that he is \u2018a black gay guy\u2019 and the internet had questions Dean Browning bills himself on Twitter as \u201ca proud pro-life & pro-2A Christian conservative.\" So what he tweeted Tuesday came as something of a surprise.Dean Browning.Read moreThe Morning Callby Chris Brennan Published\u00a0Nov. 10, 2020, 5:53 p.m. ETDean Browning had some explaining to do.The Republican former Lehigh County commissioner, who lost a congressional primary this year, bills himself on Twitter as \u201ca proud pro-life & pro-2A Christian conservative dedicated to enacting common sense solutions to Keep America Great.\u201dSo it came as something of a surprise when he tweeted this message Tuesday morning:\u201cI\u2019m a black gay guy and I can personally say that Obama did nothing for me, my life only changed a little bit and it was for the worse. Everything is so much better under Trump though. I feel respected -- which I never do when democrats are involved.\u201dAdvertisementSocial media had a field day.Several people suggested Browning accidentally posted the message from his real Twitter account, thinking he was logged on to a \u201cburner\u201d account \u2014 a fake persona tactic some people use to pretend to be others.There were suspicions that Browning\u2019s tweet sounded similar to the thoughts of another Twitter account, whose owner identified himself as a gay Black man and Trump fan.The owner of that account, under the name Dan Purdy, posted a video, insisting that he was a real person and that Browning\u2019s tweet was a message Purdy had sent to Browning.\u201cDean accidentally posted somehow and that\u2019s the end of the story,\" Purdy said in the video.Twitter then suspended the The Purdy account, which is owned by William Holte, a nephew to famed Philly singer Patti LaBelle. Holte, in a series of text messages with Clout, claimed the suspension was due to his support for Trump. He acknowledged this is the second Twitter account he has had suspended.Browning, who did not respond to a request for comment, went viral in a way politicians dread. Twitter ranked him at No. 2 on its list of trending topics.The original tweet was deleted. Browning addressed that in a follow-up tweet more than five hours later, claiming he was \u201cquoting a message that I received earlier this week from a follower. Sorry if the context was not clear.\u201dSocial media was unconvinced.It was swiftly noted that Browning\u2019s original tweet contained no context.\u201cFormer Lehigh County commissioner Dean Browning has apparently lived quite a life,\u201d tweeted news producer James Santelli of the Pittsburgh station KDKA.Others were more pointed.-Staff Writer Allison Steele contributed to this report.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAbout UsAbout The InquirerDiversity & InclusionAdvertiseContact UsLicensing & PermissionsPhoto ReprintsNewspapers in EducationJobs & InternshipsInquirer EventsAcel Moore WorkshopsNewsroom StaffHelp and FeedbackNews & InfoNewsSportsSports BettingEntertainmentBusinessHealthFoodLifeOpinionArchivesSpecial ReportsSite MapMarketplaceSubscribeInquirer StoreJob ListingsAll ClassifiedsDeath NoticesLegal NoticesGift Subscriptionse-EditionsThe InquirerThe Daily NewsSubscriber ServicesMobile AppsApple iOSGoogle AndroidTwitterFacebookInstagram\u00a9 2024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLCTerms of Use/Privacy Policy/Cancellation Policy/California Notice/California residents do not sell my data request"
