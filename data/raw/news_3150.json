Here\u2019s how one pro-life group came up with a massive total\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents for Life of America estimates that about 150,000 people attended the March for Life in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, 2022, based an analysis of a video of the marchers. | Screen shot of Students for Life of America video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Katie Yoder \n\nWashington D.C., Jan 26, 2022 / 03:00 am\nPro-life Americans recently traveled from across the country to attend the 2022 March for Life. Despite the pandemic and local COVID-19 rules, marchers gathered in numbers comparable to years past, leaving people to ask: How many marched for life?\nThe nation\u2019s largest annual pro-life event in Washington, D.C., is held on or around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. While the march condemns abortion every year, marchers exhibited a new momentum on Jan. 21, as the Supreme Court considers a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn other words, the 49th march could also be the last.\nWhile neither the March for Life nor the police provide specific numbers, organizers estimated that tens of thousands attended the 2022 March for Life, in a statement to CNA.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother pro-life group made a more exact estimate: roughly 150,000 marchers. Students for Life of America (SFLA) made the estimate by reviewing footage from their timelapse video capturing the entire 2022 March for Life. They shared the 45-second clip just hours after the march concluded.\n\n\u201cWe froze a frame of the timelapse, counted all the people individually, and multiplied that by total frames,\u201d Lauren Enriquez, deputy media strategist for SFLA, told CNA.\nAhead of the 2022 march, organizers guessed that 50,000 Americans would attend, in their permit application. After the event, news reports estimated anywhere between \u201cthousands\u201d and \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Americans attended. SFLA stands by their 150,000 estimate.\n\u201cThe Pro-Life Generation showed up in force to remember the sisters, brothers, friends, classmates, children, and neighbors lost to abortion in our lifetime \u2014 millions of priceless, beloved individuals who should be here with us today,\u201d Enriquez told CNA. \u201cWe also showed up to represent the nearly five decades of activism and hard work that have led to this truly historic moment of potentially reversing Roe.\u201d\nShe emphasized the resilience of the pro-life marchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more is that those thousands and thousands of marchers, young and elderly, braved sub-freezing temperatures to be out there,\u201d Enriquez added, commenting on the harsh weather that day. \u201cTheir sacrifice is a testament to the unshakable fervor of this generation \u2014 and this moment. We are ready for a Post-Roe America!!\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nStudents for Life, \nStudents for Life of America, \nAbortion in the United States, \nMarch for Life 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
