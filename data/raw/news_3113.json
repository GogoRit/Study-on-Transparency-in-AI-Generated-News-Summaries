Wade\u00a0may no longer be the law of the land. Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision, elective abortion has been legal in all 50 states. If\u00a0Roe\u00a0heads to the chopping block soon, the abortion industry is no longer assured of a foothold in every state. It\u2019s not that abortion will suddenly be outlawed in the United States, but rather that the question of legal killing of the preborn will be decided by each state. When\u00a0Roe\u00a0is reversed, the rights of each state to protect its own children will be restored, and the Pro-Life Generation will fight harder than ever to ensure that all 50 states do in fact protect their children from abortion violence.\nPro-lifers have been planning for this, and there is widespread grassroots support for ending abortion. How do we know this? The rise of\u00a0pro-life oases.\u00a0\nState Laws Protecting Life\nPro-lifers at the state level are already passing more laws that protect babies in the womb. From expanding gestational limits on abortion, protecting babies with a heartbeat, and passing \u201ctrigger laws,\u201d which will outlaw elective abortion in the event that\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0is overturned, pro-lifers are preparing to protect more babies. In mid-2021 the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute declared it \u201cAlready the Worst Legislative Year Ever\u201d\u00a0\u00a0for elective abortion laws in the U.S. States passed a record number of pro-life measures as more pro-lifers mobilized to protect life.\n\nThe abortion activists running around in\u00a0Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u00a0costumes would have us believe that a few men in power are responsible for the tidal wave of pro-life laws, but the fact is that they are the ones upholding a status quo established by a few men \u2013 the\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision handed down 49 years ago\u00a0by seven men\u00a0and abolishing every state\u2019s right to protect children and women from the abortion industry. The Pro-Life Generation, on the other hand, has plenty of evidence that pro-life support comes from the grassroots.\nSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\nPro-life oases are a name for the growing number of towns and cities that are\u00a0outlawing abortion at the local level. The abortion industry cannot profit in places that give them the boot, so the abortion industry is fearmongering by calling places like these \u201cabortion deserts.\u201d But a place that does not allow the killing of preborn babies and preying on vulnerable mothers is not dangerous; it\u2019s safe, an oasis.\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction) has been working with the Sanctuary City for the Unborn movement to help pro-lifers advocate for abortion-free towns and cities. In their own communities, pro-lifers have been gathering signatures, speaking at city council meetings, and lobbying to outlaw abortion.\u00a0\n\nSFLAction was\u00a0on the ground in Lubbock, Texas, to help pass the referendum that made Lubbock an abortion-free Sanctuary City for the Unborn. When Lubbock, a city of more than 250,000, outlawed abortion, they shut down the Planned Parenthood affiliate, which was the only abortion business within 300 miles. This was a huge victory for life. Local pro-lifers are ensuring that the abortion industry cannot operate in their backyard, ensuring that their communities are free from the violence of abortion.\nLast year, SFLA launched the\u00a0Campaign for Abortion Free Cities (CAFC), which complements the Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn work of making abortion illegal within city limits with the\u00a0service\u00a0component of the pro-life movement. Through the CAFC, we go door to door in the most abortion-vulnerable communities nationwide to tell neighbors about the free, local, nonviolent pregnancy resources available to them. We connect them with our initiative,\u00a0Standing With You,\u00a0and make sure they know they are not alone.\nOffering Mothers Real Solutions\nPro-lifers are not simply taking away abortion; they have spent decades building up a network of resources to support women and babies. SFLA\u2019s\u00a0Standing with You Initiativeconnects vulnerable moms with information and resources to provide real help. We know that the abortion industry does not do this. The abortion industry takes women\u2019s money, ends the life of a baby, and then returns that woman to the same desperate situation that compelled her to undergo an abortion in the first place. Whether she was experiencing housing insecurity, an abusive relationship, or struggling to finish school, abortion does nothing to actually help her and violently ends the life of her child.\u00a0\n\nThe abortion industry is terrified at the prospect of\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0being overturned. The legal killing of preborn babies has led to a massive and profitable industry. Pro-lifers are seeking ways to carve out protections for the most vulnerable, booting the abortion industry from their communities, and offering mothers in crisis real choices.\u00a0\nThe explosive growth and success of pro-life initiatives in recent years is not a fluke. More people, especially the younger generations, are coming to recognize the violence of abortion. The most successful pro-life efforts have not been top-down but come from grassroots organization of pro-lifers invested in their local communities and prepared to help individual women and babies.\u00a0\nThe fact that this growth in the pro-life movement coincides with the likely overturning of\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0is a fantastic opportunity to establish strong pro-life legislation and community resources at the city and state level. We can be assured that it is working, because our strategy is driving the abortion industry nuts.\n\n Post Views: 1,486\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
