Be the first to know.SubscribeAccording to the 2016 Democratic Party platform, \u201cevery woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion\u2014regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured.\u201dThe findings corroborate a January 2017 Quinnipiac poll, which found that 18- to 34-year-olds were more likely than other age demographics to support a ban on abortions after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation.\u00a0\u201cThe pro-life movement has gotten younger and larger, and I believe we\u2019re beginning to see the end of abortion,\u201d Carney told CP. \u201cThe response to the pro-life movement has been overwhelmingly positive, whereas it was overwhelmingly negative 20 years ago.\u201dLaunched in 2007, 40 Days for Life is a global movement that orchestrates 40-day spring and fall campaigns of prayer, fasting, and nonstop peaceful public vigils outside abortion clinics.Carney, himself a father of seven, said that so far, his organization is operational in more than 30 countries and in 507 cities worldwide. As a result of their efforts, nearly 17,000 lives have been saved, 196 abortion workers have quit, and 106 abortion centers have closed.\u201cWe are not protesting; we are holding prayer vigils, taking a Christ-like approach of being peaceful and law-abiding,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of this approach, we\u2019ve gotten a great response from those in the abortion industry.\u201d\u201cAnytime there's an act of violence near an abortion facility, we hear abortion advocates say, \u2018We know that wasn\u2019t 40 Days for Life,'\" the bestselling author continued. \"It\u2019s been wonderful to see such a positive response to our work. We wouldn\u2019t have saved so many lives and helped so many people leave their jobs if we took a violent and judgmental approach. That would just be fuel to help justify their jobs.\u201dOne of the most recognizable figures to leave the abortion industry thanks to the work of 40 Days for Life is former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson, whose story is featured in the 2019 film \u201cUnplanned.\u201d Following the release of the film, 40 Days for Life saw a 30 percent increase in volunteers.\u00a0\u201cAbby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood abortion center director, walked into my office on October 5, 2009, and told me she'd had a change of heart on abortion,\u201d Carney recalled. \u201cShe was the 26th abortion facility worker to have a conversion and leave the abortion industry during a 40 Days for Life campaign.\u201d\u201cObviously, abortion workers don\u2019t want us at their facilities in the beginning, but over the weeks, they start thinking about us and the work we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\u00a0Abby Johnson, left, the former director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas, stands next to Shawn Carney, National Campaign Director of 40 Days for Life, whose group prays outside the clinic. | (Photo: Coalition for Life)Despite the \u201cpositive steps\u201d toward ending abortion, Carney stressed that there is still a \u201cculture of death\u201d that pervades American society.\u00a0\u201cWe have to acknowledge that we are in a crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost over 60 million children to abortion. Three thousand children are aborted every day. It\u2019s an easy statistic to ignore because it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201dEarlier this year, Carney released the devotional To the Heart of the Matter: The 40 Day Companion to Live a Culture for Life. The book provides direction and inspiration for all pro-life advocates seeking to make a difference in the ongoing battle for the unborn.\u201cIn this book, I show how we can live out a culture of life every day, through our obligations, jobs, families, and marriages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get here overnight with the abortion crisis. I want people to know that when you live out your faith, that is living a culture of life and changing the world.\u201d40 Days for LifeIn his book, Carney draws from real-life stories and statistics to identify practical ways pro-life readers can foster a \u201cculture of life,\u201d from engaging in prayer, fasting, and Scripture-reading to being intentional in their marriages and other relationships.\u00a0\u201cOur relationships have become superficial and distant thanks to technology. We\u2019re not getting together or going to coffee, so we\u2019re not having healthy recreation and human interaction. When we don\u2019t, we can get to a very dangerous place where we no longer cherish life or care about human dignity,\u201d Carney said.\u201cI have a whole chapter on simply taking your spouse on a date,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no authentic love or respect between the parents of a child, it\u2019s easier to discard the fruit of that relationship. Couples need to be fostering and growing their relationship to help build a culture of life.\u201dCarney stressed that the most powerful way to fight abortion is through prayer, adding, \u201cWe have to pray, daily, for an end to abortion. What a tragedy to let a day go by where we don\u2019t pray for an end to abortion.\u201dFor those who feel \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the magnitude of abortion, he stressed that it\u2019s possible to \u201cchange the culture in your daily life.\u201d\u201cWe need to get back to the basics; the heart of the Gospel,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Lord came into the world through a womb and through a family. The more we drift from that, the more we will support a culture that attacks marriage and the unborn child. We need to make an intentional effort to do these small, substantial things every day to foster a culture of life, trusting in our Lord all along the way.\u201dWas this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
