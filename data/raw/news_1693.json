Lawmakers last year took up a number of high-profile abortion restriction bills that ultimately failed, as even Republican lawmakers often had conflicting views on how far abortion bans should go and what exemptions should be allowed. The House\u2019s efforts to pass anti-abortion legislation on the federal level are all but certain to fail, given the Democratic majority in the Senate and President Joe Biden\u2019s veto power.\nBig Number\n60%. That\u2019s the share of voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases as of September, according to a Wall Street Journal poll, in line with other polls showing a majority of Americans do not want the procedure to be banned.\n\nContra\nSome Republicans have railed against the party continuing to focus on abortion after it cost the GOP in the midterms. \u201cWe learned nothing from the midterms if this is how we're going to operate in the first week. Millions of women across the board were angry over overturning Roe v. Wade.\u201d Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told Politico about the House\u2019s anti-abortion votes, saying there should be a \u201cbalance between protecting women's rights and the right to life,\u201d but \u201cwhat we're doing this week is paying lip service to life.\u201d\nKey Background\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to an abortion in June, setting off a wave of state-level abortion bans nationwide and sparking widespread anger among Americans in support of abortion rights. That opposition to the court\u2019s ruling was reflected at the ballot box, with Americans in six states voting in favor of abortion rights in abortion-related ballot measures, even in conservative-leaning states like Kansas, Montana and Kentucky. Abortion was also viewed as a factor behind the GOP failing to secure the \u201cred wave\u201d of Republican wins that had been anticipated, and Democrats won many races with particularly high stakes for abortion rights, such as gubernatorial races in Michigan and Pennsylvania. The GOP\u2019s renewed interest in abortion restrictions now that the midterms are over comes even as many candidates had backtracked on publicly criticizing abortion on the campaign trail, given the political opposition to abortion restrictions, with some even changing their campaign websites to erase previous staunchly anti-abortion stances.\n\nFurther Reading\nHouse poised to vote on two abortion-related bills (Washington Post)\n\nThe new front in the right\u2019s war on abortion (Vox)\nHow some state legislatures are preparing to further limit reproductive rights (PBS)\nA \u2018born alive\u2019 measure is one of the House GOP\u2019s priorities.
