It ended the most common of the few legal grounds left for abortion in Poland and set the country further apart from Europe's mainstream.\nDaily protests have taken place across the country in the past week and have turned into an outpouring of anger against five years of nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) rule and the Roman Catholic church, which is an ally of the government.\nFar-right groups which support the court ruling also turned out in small gatherings in Warsaw on Friday, and TV footage showed police clashing with them to keep one group away from the protesters.\nThe leader of the abortion rights movement in Poland, Marta Lempart, told activists to report any attacks and to resist any threats of prosecution or fines for taking part. \"We are doing nothing wrong by protesting and going out on the streets,\" she told a news conference.\nAfter the ruling goes into effect, women will only be able to terminate a pregnancy legally in the case of rape, incest or a threat to their health.\nDancing on trams\nIn an effort to ease tensions, President Andrzej Duda proposed legislation on Friday reintroducing the possibility of terminating a pregnancy due to fetal abnormalities, although only limited to defects that are immediately life-threatening.\nPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki pledged lawmakers would proceed with the legislation quickly, but demonstrators were unimpressed.\n\"This is an attempt to soften the situation for PiS, but no sane person should fall for it,\" activist and leftist lawmaker Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus told Reuters.\nThe government has accused demonstrators of risking the lives of the elderly by defying strict pandemic rules against large gatherings. Poland reported a daily record of more than 21,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday.\nHealth Minister Adam Niedzielski drew comparisons between the Polish protest and the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality, saying demonstrations across the United States caused an \"escalation\" of the pandemic.\nPublic health experts say there has yet to be conclusive evidence of large-scale spread from the U.S. events.\nFive women were charged with organizing an illegal protest which attracted 850 people in the town of Police on Thursday, officials said.\nThe Roman Catholic Church has said that while it opposes abortion, it did not push the government or the court to increase restrictions.\nPiS, however, has sought to instill more traditional and Catholic values in public life, ending state funding for in vitro fertilization, introducing more patriotic themes into school curricula and funding church programs.\nIt has also launched a crackdown on LGBT rights and a reform of the judiciary the European Union says subverts the rule law. PiS says it seeks to protect traditional Polish values against damaging western liberalism.\nOpinion polls have shown its support falling sharply in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters\n\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.
