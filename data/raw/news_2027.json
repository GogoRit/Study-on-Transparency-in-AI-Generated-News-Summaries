Parenthood of Wisconsin says they will resume abortion care services next week after a judge ruled a state law from 1849 did not apply to abortion procedures.\n    \n\n            On September 18, Planned Parenthood\u2019s Water Street Health Center in Milwaukee and Madison East Health Center in Madison will again offer abortion care, Tanya Atkinson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said in a video posted on social media. \n    \n\n            \u201cA ruling by the Dane County Circuit Court in July made it clear that the 1849 law is not enforceable for voluntary abortions,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cIn consultation with attorneys, physicians, partners and stakeholders, Planned Parenthood Wisconsin is confident in our decision to resume abortion care in Wisconsin.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee where abortions are banned and legal \u2014 and where it's still in limbo\n\n\n\n\n            Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin suspended abortion care last year after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade due to uncertainty around the enforceability of a 1849 state law that prohibited the procedure. Thirteen other states have banned or severely restricted access to abortion procedures since that 2022 ruling. \n    \n\n            Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion law says, \u201cAny person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty of a Class H felony,\u201d which is punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. It also says anyone who causes the death of the mother or \u201cintentionally destroys the life\u201d of an \u201cunborn quick child\u201d would face a Class E felony, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The law would not apply to the mother and makes exceptions for abortions necessary for the pregnant person\u2019s life. \n    \n\n            In June 2022, the state\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul brought a lawsuit to the Dane County Circuit Court challenging the 173-year-old ban. Defendants, including Republican Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, sought to dismiss the case.\n    \n\n            This July, Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper ruled against the motion to dismiss from defendants.\n    \n\n            In her ruling, Schlipper wrote that she found the 1849 law only applies to \u201cfeticide,\u201d which was defined as an \u201cact or instance of killing a fetus, usually by assaulting and battering.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cThis pre-Roe statute says nothing about abortion \u2013 there is no such thing as an \u20191849 Abortion Ban\u2019 in Wisconsin,\u201d Schlipper\u2019s ruling stated. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz celebrates after the race was called for her during her election night watch party in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., April 4, 2023. \n\nEvelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal judge's victory in Wisconsin Supreme Court race marks political shift in key swing state\n\n\n\n\n            The lawsuit could still reach Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, which flipped to a Democratic majority after liberal Janet Protasiewicz defeated former conservative justice Daniel Kelly in April.\n    \n\n            Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers praised Planned Parenthood\u2019s decision in a news release Thursday. \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ve been clear from the beginning that I would fight to restore reproductive freedom in our state with every power and every tool we have, and I\u2019ve spent every day over the last year doing just that,\u201d Evers said.  \n    \n\n            \u201cToday\u2019s announcement from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin as a result of our lawsuit regarding Wisconsin\u2019s criminal abortion ban means Wisconsinites will once again be able to access vital reproductive healthcare and abortion services without exception for the first time since June of last year,\u201d he said. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis is critically important news for Wisconsin women and patients across our state who, for a year now, have been unable to access the healthcare they need when and where they need it.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
