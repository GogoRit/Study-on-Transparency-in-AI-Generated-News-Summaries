All rights reserved.\n\nA video posted by a British pro-life group on Facebook that contains multiple misleading claims about New Zealand\u2019s abortion laws has been viewed tens of thousands of times. The video includes a false suggestion that abortion in New Zealand is \u201cavailable on-demand, for any reason, up to birth\u201d. Similar claims were published in multiple other anti-abortion posts shared in the United States.\nThe video was published by Right To Life UK here on Facebook on October 14, where it has been viewed more than 120,000 times.\u00a0\n A screenshot of the video, taken October 22, 2020.  (A screenshot of the video, taken October 22, 2020. )\nSimilar claims were also posted in this article uploaded by the UK-based pro-life organisation Right To Life. The article has been interacted with more than 400,000 times on Facebook according to CrowdTangle data.\nThe claims have also been shared in similar US-based Facebook posts here and here; and by a conservative news show in the United States.\nMost of the claims, however, are misleading.\nThe Abortion Legislation Act (2020), which came into effect March 2020, decriminalised abortion in New Zealand.\nIt amended the Contraception Sterilisation and Abortion Act (CSA) and sets out most of the regulatory circumstances in which abortions can be authorised and carried out.\u00a0\nBefore the legislation was introduced, access to abortions\u00a0was regulated by the New Zealand Crimes Act (1961).\nUnder that law, abortions after 20-weeks gestation were only permitted if it was \u201cnecessary to save the life of the woman or girl or to prevent serious permanent injury to her physical or mental health\u201d.\n\u2018On-demand abortion\u2019\nAt the ten-second mark of misleading video, it claims: \u201cThe New Regime will allow: abortion on demand, up to birth, for any reason\u201d.\nThe claim is false.\u00a0\nAbortions are permitted after 20-weeks, but only in\u00a0specific circumstances, taking into account factors including the woman's physical and mental health. Two qualified\u00a0health practitioners\u00a0have to agree the procedure is necessary.\n A screenshot of section 11 of the Abortion Legislation Act (2020), taken August 27 2020.  (A screenshot of section 11 of the Abortion Legislation Act (2020), taken August 27 2020. )\nUniversity of Otago bioethicist and legal scholar Dr Jeanne Snelling told AFP \"to say that \u2018abortion is available on demand, for any reason, up to birth\u2019 is based on an assumption that a clinician would be prepared to perform an abortion without any consideration of the clinical circumstances, including the woman\u2019s physical and mental health, the gestational stage of the pregnancy, the opinion(s) of his/her peers and ethical and professional standards\".\nDisability-selective abortion\nAt the video\u2019s 14-second mark, it claims: \u201cThe new regime will allow: disability-selective abortion up to birth\u201d.\nThis is misleading.\nBefore the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 came into effect the Crimes Act 1961 only explicitly allowed for abortions on disability grounds before 20 weeks.\n\n\n\u201cThe way that [Right to Life UK] are framing it is that the restriction has been removed -- the reality is that it was never really there in the first place\u201d - Dr Helen Paterson, University of Otago\n\n\nHowever,\u00a0University of Otago Gynaecologist and Senior Lecturer, Dr Helen Paterson, told AFP by phone\u00a0women were\u00a0able to access abortions after 20-weeks if the baby was going to\u00a0be severely disabled before the new Abortion Legislation.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t previously a gestational limit around maternal mental health and many abortions were done for congenital abnormalities (disabilities) post 20 weeks under the circumstances that they would cause serious problems for the mental health of the mother.\n\u201cThe way that [Right to Life UK] are framing it is that the restriction has been removed -- the reality is that it was never really there in the first place\u201d she added.\u00a0\nThe New Zealand Law Commission found in their 2018 report on abortion that \u201cvirtually all abortions performed after 20 weeks relate to wanted pregnancies and occur because a serious fetal abnormality is detected or there is a serious risk to the woman\u2019s life or physical health\u201d.\u00a0\n\"Fetal abnormality is not in itself a ground for abortion after 20 weeks, so it is likely that the legal ground relied on in those cases would be to prevent serious permanent injury to the woman\u2019s mental health,\" the report added.\nMedical Support\nAt the video\u2019s 22-second mark, it claims: \u201cNO legal requirement: that babies born alive after an abortion are given medical support\u201d.\nThis is false.\n\n\n\u201cOnce alive and living outside the mother's womb, the neonate is a legal person and has the same rights as any other person, and there is a requirement to provide health care in the same way as for any other neonate.\" - New Zealand Ministry of Health\n\n\nThe New Zealand Ministry of Health told AFP in an August 8 email: \u00a0\u201cOnce alive and living outside the mother's womb, the neonate is a legal person and has the same rights as any other person, and there is a requirement to provide health care in the same way as for any other neonate.\u201d\nHolly Hedley, health law expert at Buddle and Findlay lawyers, also said the claim at this point in the video was incorrect. \u201cEvery health practitioner in New Zealand is obligated to follow New Zealand's general law, and that includes a general duty to care as is clinically appropriate for any baby born alive, pursuant to the Code of Health and disability consumers' rights and also to other criminal and common law principles,\u201d she said.\nPain relief\nAt the video\u2019s 22-second mark, it claims: \u201cNO legal requirement: to give pain relief for babies aborted after 20 weeks\u201d.\nThe claim omits important context.\u00a0\nUniversity of Otago senior lecturer in Women and Children\u2019s health, Dr Janet Downs, told AFP in a November 3 email \"there is no scientific evidence that the fetus is capable of feeling pain before around 24 weeks\".\nWhen a fetus\u00a0is aborted after 22 weeks,\u00a0Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist guidelines require measures to be taken to make sure it is dead\u00a0before being\u00a0delivered,\u00a0negating the need for pain killers, abortion provider Dr Simon Snook told AFP in an email.\nThis is also outlined\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Interim Standards for Abortion Services, which dictates New Zealand\u2019s standards for abortion providers.\n\u201cShould a woman not consent to feticide, the New Zealand Maternal Fetal Medicine Network, considers the abortion should not go ahead, because induction of labour where there is the possibility of neonatal survival is not an abortion,\u201d the standards state.\nMethods of abortion\nAt the video\u2019s 17-second mark, it claims: \u201cThe new regime will allow: controversial abortion methods\u201d.\nThe Right To Life group\u2019s accompanying article links to another website which purports to describe \u2018partial-birth\u2019 abortion. A screenshot can be seen below:\n A screenshot of the website describing what it calls \"partial birth abortions\"\nThe claim is misleading.\nAccording to Dr Janet Downs, the outlined \u201cpartial birth\u201d procedure does not happen in New Zealand. \u201cThe so-called 'partial birth' process described in the 2nd & 3rd bullet points... is not performed in NZ (or, to my knowledge, elsewhere),\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n        AFP New Zealand and Pacific Islands      \n\n\n\n\n        All articles      \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n        Taylor THOMPSON-FULLER      \n\n\n\n\n        All articles      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n \n\n\nHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrections \n\n\n\nTerms of usePrivacy policyLegal information \n\n\n\n\n\nFact Check\n\nCopyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2024.
