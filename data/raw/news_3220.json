Wade was overturned goes something like this: \u201cAbortion hasn\u2019t been outlawed, the Supreme Court is just returning the decision to the states. Don\u2019t be so hysterical.\u201d While technically true, in practice, this argument is, of course, total bullshit. Abortion has now been restricted in roughly half the country, eight states banned the medical procedure the day Roe was struck down, and 13 states will forbid it within 30 days of the June 24 ruling. If someone tries to claim to you that the Court\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t that big a deal and/or doesn\u2019t change much, you are legally obligated to inform them they have shit where their brain should be. If you can stand to breathe the same air as them for a moment longer, you should also inform them of the many ways the various states in question have proceeded to use the opportunity afforded to them by the Supreme Court to advocate for not only forced births, but the state-sanctioned murder of pregnant people.Over the weekend, the Idaho Republican Party voted against adopting an amendment that would have added an exception to its official policy on abortion for cases to save the life of the mother. Scott Herndon, a Republican running unopposed for a state Senate seat, argued to delegates that \u201cfor the last 49 years we have essentially lost the argument in the culture because we have focused on abortion as the termination of a pregnancy and not the termination of a living human being.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will never win this human rights issue, the greatest of our time, if we make allowances for the intentional killing of another human being.\u201d Obviously, he did not note that withholding life-saving care from a pregnant person, knowing they could die, is also an intentional killing, because that would apparently require too much reflection on his part. The decision not to add an abortion exception to save the life of the mother was decided 412-164; as The Independent notes, the party platform \u201cis used to direct policy within the state\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature.\u201dCurrently, Idaho\u2019s \u201ctrigger\u201d law, passed in 2020, outlaws abortions with exceptions for rape and incest, though only if the crimes are reported to law enforcement. (The Idaho GOP platform has no exceptions for rape or incest; a regional Planned Parenthood organization and an Idaho abortion provider have sued to block the law and a hearing is scheduled for August 3.) According to Newsweek, in a Facebook video\u00a0after the Supreme Court struck down Roe, Herndon declared, \u201cyou don\u2019t put to death the innocent child for the crime of its father, but that\u2019s what this [trigger] law would allow.\u201d He also claimed that such exceptions give women \u201ca free pass,\u201d and said that \u201cif a mother really wants to kill her child, she could lie, say she was raped, file a police report, and go get her child killed in the state of Idaho and nobody would be prosecuted.\u201d Because Herndon apparently wanted to make it abundantly clear that not only is he anti-abortion, he\u2019s also a colossal asshole too. (On his website, Herndon says he \u201cbelieves in preserving and protecting human life\u201d and \u201chas followed this in word and deed as an active Abortion Abolitionist and Pro-Gun advocate.\u201d We\u2019re going to guess that no, he doesn\u2019t see the irony.)Elsewhere in reports of horrifying repercussions from the Supreme Court merely kicking the abortion question to the states, a woman bled for more than 10 days after suffering an incomplete miscarriage because a Wisconsin hospital wouldn\u2019t perform the procedure; a woman with an ectopic pregnancy had to seek emergency, out-of-state care because a doctor in her home state was worried he\u2019d run afoul of the law; administrators at a Kansas City, Missouri hospital temporarily required \u201cpharmacist approval\u201d before prescribing medications that stop postpartum hemorrhages\u2014as in hemorrhages that occur after someone has given birth\u2014because they are also sometimes used for abortions; and a 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio was told they must give birth to their rapist\u2019s child or seek care elsewhere.If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click\u00a0here\u00a0to\u00a0subscribe.But wait, there\u2019s moreX contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Ted Cruz wants same-sex marriage ruling overturnedLuckily for the Texas senator, marriage between humans and gelatinous tube worms is not on the line, otherwise he and Heidi would have to start thinking about moving abroad. Per CNN:\u201cObergefell, like Roe v. Wade, ignored two centuries of our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Cruz said in a clip posted on his YouTube channel for his podcast. \u201cMarriage was always an issue that was left to the states. We saw states before Obergefell, some states were moving to allow gay marriage, other states were moving to allow civil partnerships. There were different standards that the states were adopting.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe way the Constitution set up for you to advance that position is convince your fellow citizens, that if you succeeded in convincing your fellow citizens, then your state would change the laws to reflect those views. In Obergefell, the court said, \u2018No, we know better than you guys do, and now every state must, must sanction and permit gay marriage\u2026. I think that decision was clearly wrong when it was decided,\u201d Cruz said. \u2018It was the court overreaching.\u201dMost PopularPhotos From Inside the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar PartySee the Glam in Motion on the Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2024 Glam CamBy Kase WickmanBarry Keoghan, Charles Melton, and Hunter Schafer Kick Off Oscar Week in Style at Vanity Fair and Instagram\u2019s Vanities PartyBy Kara WarnerIn June, in a concurring opinion to\u00a0Dobbs v.
