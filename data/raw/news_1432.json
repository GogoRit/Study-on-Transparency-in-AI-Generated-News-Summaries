Lindsey Graham announces a new bill on abortion restrictions on September 13 on Capitol Hill. Graham\u2019s proposal would enact a national ban on abortions after the 15-week mark. At left is Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of\u00a0Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicole Narea\n        covers politics and society for Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of\n      \n      The 2022 midterm elections, explained\n    \n\n\n\nSenate Republicans\u2019 plans for a national abortion ban in the wake of the US Supreme Court\u2019s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade may be backfiring on them. \nOn Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a bill that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy based on the unproven claim that fetuses can feel pain at that point in development. It includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the pregnant person. \nThe proposal is stricter than versions of the bill Graham has previously introduced, which would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and goes further than many existing state restrictions on abortion. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 44 states ban abortion after a certain point in pregnancy, most after about 20 weeks since the pregnant person\u2019s last menstrual period. \nFew Republicans have announced their support for the bill, however. It comes at a delicate moment for the party nationally, just weeks ahead of the midterms and as they try to temper voters\u2019 concerns about what they might do to further restrict abortion access if they win control of Congress. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) all suggested to Politico that Graham\u2019s bill did not reflect the tack that most other Republicans would take when it comes to abortion. \n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a conference decision. It was an individual senator\u2019s decision,\u201d Cornyn said. \nDemocrats have already begun to attack the legislation as a first step toward a total ban. \u201cFor MAGA Republicans\u2014it\u2019s always been about making abortion illegal everywhere,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted Tuesday. Republicans, however, claim it is only a ban on \u201clate-term abortions,\u201d seemingly in an effort to paint Democrats as extreme for supporting a bill that would have banned states from enacting many kinds of abortion restrictions.\n\u201cThat [Democratic bill] is extreme in every fashion and we should be talking about legislation for the nation as a whole that would put us in line with the science and the civilized world,\u201d Graham said in a press conference Tuesday. \nAbortion rights advocates argue that having an abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy does not qualify as a \u201clate-term abortion,\u201d which is not a medical term and typically refers to abortions after at least 21 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Though most abortions happen earlier in pregnancy, many medical anomalies, including ones that are inconsistent with life, can only be detected in tests conducted at the 20-week mark. There\u2019s also a concern that demand from states that have banned or severely restricted abortion could stretch abortion clinics\u2019 resources thin, forcing pregnant people to wait longer than they might have previously for an abortion. \nGiven these concerns \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 support for abortion access \u2014 there\u2019s little chance of Graham\u2019s bill coming up for a vote this year. Instead, Graham promised action on it if Republicans retake control of Congress following the midterms this fall.\n\u201cIf we take back the House and Senate, I can assure you that we\u2019ll have a vote on our bill,\u201d Graham said.\nThe bill probably won\u2019t become law, even if the GOP is in power\nIt\u2019s not clear that the bill would pass even if the GOP reclaims Congress.\nSome 85 percent of Americans think that abortion should be legal in some circumstances, according to a long-running survey by Gallup. Embracing such a broadly unpopular policy could carry electoral costs for Republicans by further activating Democratic voters. And the party would need to consolidate power not just in Congress but also in the White House to actually make it law.\nThough Republicans initially celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe, they have since avoided the subject on the campaign trail in an apparent effort to avoid turning off persuadable voters ahead of the midterms. On Tuesday, McConnell did not take a stance himself and told reporters that most GOP senators would prefer abortion to remain under the purview of the states rather than pursue a national ban like Graham\u2019s.\nWhile abortion is still behind the economy, gun policy, and education in terms of voters\u2019 top priorities, it appears to be animating voters. In New York\u2019s 19th District, the Democratic winner of a special election centered his campaign on abortion access. In Kansas, voters turned out in record numbers to resoundingly reject a constitutional amendment that would have allowed state lawmakers to further restrict abortion access in the state. Young people (particularly young women) are also registering to vote at a significantly higher rate in states where abortion rights are under threat.\nRepublicans are no longer favored to win control of the Senate and are preparing for the prospect of a narrow majority in the House. But even if they reclaim the Senate, the bill would need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, a significantly tougher task considering not even all Senate Republicans are in favor of restricting abortion. Republicans could also potentially choose to eliminate the filibuster to pass the ban.\nThey have previously introduced bills that would recognize life from the moment of fertilization, which would effectively ban abortion nationwide. But only 19 senators and 164 House members supported the legislation the last time it was introduced, far short of the numbers it would need to pass.\nShould they overcome that issue, a Democrat in the White House would likely veto any such legislation. But there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will hold the executive branch after 2024, especially given that President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating continues to struggle, and that polling early this year found most Americans don\u2019t want Biden to seek reelection.\nThose political hurdles make Graham\u2019s bill mostly messaging on where he wants Senate Republicans to draw the line on abortion, which for now is still short of a total ban. It remains to be seen whether leaning into that stance can help them rebut Democrats\u2019 midterm attacks about the GOP being too extreme. \n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
