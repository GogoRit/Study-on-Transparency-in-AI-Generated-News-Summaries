Here\u2019s what that means\nPolitics\n\n\n                                Nov 14, 2022 5:15 PM EDT\n            \n\n\n\nAcross America, midterm voters in five states had abortion rights on the ballot. In all five, voters decided to protect those rights. \nKentucky voters rejected a measure that would have amended their constitution to clarify that there is no state right to an abortion. The outcome hands a victory to abortion-rights supporters at a time when abortion access has been sharply limited by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature, yet it does not change the fact that abortion is still outlawed in Kentucky in most cases.\nHowever, there\u2019s a chance that could change. This week, the state\u2019s Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the two laws making abortion illegal, after it kept the bans in place this summer and fall while it reviews the case. \nThe PBS NewsHour\u2019s Nicole Ellis spoke with Ryland Barton, managing editor of Kentucky Public Radio, and Tracy Weitz, a sociology professor at American University. Watch the conversation in the player above. \n\u201cKentucky has elected a lot of politicians over the years that have passed laws trying to ban abortion,\u201d Ryland Barton of Kentucky Public Radio told the PBS NewsHour. \u201cBut I think that this vote really showed that there\u2019s a lot more nuance here among voters.\u201d\nWhat happens next in Kentucky \u201creally depends on how the court ends up ruling here,\u201d Barton added. The state\u2019s two remaining abortion clinics are challenging the near-total abortion bans approved by lawmakers, and oral arguments are scheduled to begin Tuesday. \nAs for the nation\u2019s post-Roe legal landscape, Tracy Weitz of American University noted that \u201cthe state supreme courts are going to have to weigh in on this issue in ways that they have never had to do before.\u201d \n\u201cThis is just the beginning of the wave.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\nKentucky voters reject constitutional amendment on abortion\nBy Bruce Schreiner, Beth Campbell, Associated Press\n\n\n\n\nHow midterm elections could test support for Louisiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban\nBy Roby Chavez\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights protesters briefly interrupt Supreme Court arguments\nBy Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nGo Deeper\n\nabortion\nabortion access\ndigital video\nelection 2022\nkentucky\nvote 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy \u2014\n\n\nCasey Kuhn\n\n\n                    Casey Kuhn\n                \n\nCasey is a producer for NewsHour's digital video team.
