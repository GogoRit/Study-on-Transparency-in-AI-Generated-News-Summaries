U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Colorado Springs Republican, recently proposed federal legislation\u00a0to recognize embryos and fetuses in the womb as persons.\u00a0\nFaye Barnhart, one of the designated representatives for the initiative, told Newsline the group wants to protect \u201call living children from intentional abuse, harm and death\u201d while helping to connect women to \u201cnonviolent resources.\u201d Barnhart leads an anti-abortion center in northeast Colorado.\u00a0\nThe group spearheading the initiative, filed June 7 and meant for the 2024 statewide election, led a similar proposal in 2022, but it never submitted a petition with signatures to get on the ballot. Barnhart said she\u2019s more confident in how the initiative will perform among voters this year because it is the first anti-abortion measure the group has promoted since the U.S. Supreme Court removed the constitutional protection of abortion access in the Dobbs v. Jackson decision a year ago this week.\u00a0\nBarnhart said the Colorado Life Initiative has grown into a grassroots movement across the state with more than 1,500 participants across more than 200 churches and 50 other partner organizations.
