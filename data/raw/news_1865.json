That judge\u2019s order has allowed abortions to continue in Indiana since September, despite the ban.Indiana abortion doctor who spoke out about child rape victim can keep licenseRead moreAn opinion from three of the court\u2019s five justices said that while Indiana\u2019s constitution provides some protection of abortion rights, the \u201cGeneral Assembly otherwise retains broad legislative discretion for determining whether and the extent to which to prohibit abortions\u201d.All five Indiana supreme court justices were appointed by Republican governors.The Republican state attorney general, Todd Rokita, issued a statement praising the decision: \u201cWe celebrate this day \u2013 one long in coming, but morally justified. Thank you to all the warriors who have fought for this day that upholds LIFE.\u201dAlthough the court\u2019s decision strikes down the injunction blocking the ban, it was not immediately clear how soon the ban would take effect. The justices returned the case to the county judge for further action, and left open the possibility of a narrower challenge to the ban.Indiana\u2019s abortion ban also faces a separate court challenge over claims it violates the state\u2019s 2015 religious freedom law signed by GOP the then governor, Mike Pence.Indiana became the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions, acting in August, after the US supreme court\u2019s eliminated federal protections by overturning Roe v Wade in June 2022.Most Republican-controlled states have enacted tighter abortion restrictions since the US supreme court\u2019s ruling last summer. All the restrictions have been challenged in court.In the past year, judges in Arizona, Iowa and South Carolina have ruled that the bans are not permissible under the state constitutions.Besides Indiana, enforcement of restrictions are on hold as courts decide the cases in Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah and Wyoming. In North Dakota, lawmakers hav since adopted a different ban to replace the one that was blocked. In South Carolina, another ban has been put into place and put on hold by a court. And in North Carolina, a federal judge weighed whether to temporarily block parts of new abortion restrictions set to take effect on Saturday.Democratic-led states, such as Indiana\u2019s neighbors of Illinois and Michigan, have mostly taken steps to protect abortion access.The Indiana ban would eliminate the licenses for all seven abortion clinics in the state and ban the vast majority of abortions even in the earliest stages of a pregnancy. It includes exceptions allowing abortions at hospitals in cases of rape or incest before 10 weeks post-fertilization; to protect the life and physical health of the mother; and if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly.The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, which represented Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic operators, argued before the supreme court in January that the state constitution\u2019s liberty protections provide a right to privacy and to make decisions on whether to have children.The state attorney general\u2019s office countered that Indiana had laws against abortion when its current constitution was drafted in 1851 and that the county judge\u2019s ruling would wrongly create an abortion right.The Indiana supreme court\u2019s decision said the state constitution \u201cprotects a woman\u2019s right to an abortion that is necessary to protect her life or to protect her from a serious health risk\u201d.The majority opinion, however, also found that the constitution \u201cgenerally permits the General Assembly to prohibit abortions which are unnecessary to protect a woman\u2019s life or health, so long as the legislation complies with the constitutional limits that apply to all legislation, such as those limiting legislation to a proper exercise of the police power and providing privileges and immunities equally\u201d.A separate court challenge to the ban is ongoing as another county judge in December sided with residents who claim it violates the state\u2019s religious freedom law, which Republican legislators pushed through in 2015 and sparked a widespread national backlash as critics argued it allowed discrimination against gay people.The state supreme court in January turned down a request from the attorney general\u2019s office that it immediately take up the religious freedom lawsuit. The state\u2019s intermediate court of appeals is scheduled to hear arguments over that lawsuit on 12 September.The Marion county judge Heather Welch in December agreed with five residents who hold Jewish, Muslim and spiritual faiths and who argued that the ban would violate their religious rights on when they believe abortion is acceptable. For now it only directly affects those plaintiffs \u2013 legal experts say anyone else claiming religious protections of their abortion rights would need their own court order.Explore more on these topicsAbortionIndianaRoe v WadeRepublicansLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
