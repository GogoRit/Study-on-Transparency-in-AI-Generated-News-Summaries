While Smith referred to protesters against abortion as \u201canti-abortion\u201d, Rajan described them as \u201cpro-life\u201d.\u201cAs you say, Sarah, this is not the end but the end of the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause for the pro-life groups, for the pro-life coalition, who have been campaigning for this for many, many years, since Roe v Wade actually, they\u2019re very ambitious, aren\u2019t they, there\u2019s a lot more that they want to achieve.\u201dThe second time was during an interview with Erica Hofland, a clinician from Red River Women\u2019s Clinic in North Dakota, in which he said: \u201cThe argument from the pro-life organisations is that life is life\u201d.Women\u2019s organisations in the UK criticised Today\u2019s use of the term, which they said was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cspeaks to the huge power and influence\u201d of the anti-abortion lobby. Hannah Barham-Brown, deputy leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said: \u201cAnti-choice campaigners have long tried to hide behind the facade of being \u2018pro-life\u2019 when the reality is that they are anything but \u2013 they are really trying to restrict women\u2019s freedoms.\u201cBanning abortions only bans safe abortions and women will die as a result of this ruling, and thousands more will be criminalised or face continuing a pregnancy that they did not choose.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt is of course disappointing to hear a \u2018pro-life\u2019 framing on the Today programme \u2013 unintentionally or not \u2013 but it speaks to the huge power and influence of the groups and politicians at the front of these efforts to control women and push an untrue narrative that they are saving lives.\u201dKerry Abel, chair of the group Abortion Rights, said to be \u201cpro-choice\u201d was the neutral position. \u201cIt\u2019s not between an absolutist anti-abortion position on one side and pro-abortion on the other. Having access is the neutral position.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe know from the strong connections between the gun lobby and anti-abortion activists that they are not pro-life. Pro-life for who? Women die when they don\u2019t have access to safe abortions. We call these groups \u2018anti-choice\u2019 not \u2018pro-life\u2019.\u201dA BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe style guide suggests anti-abortion as the preferred term, but the use of the term pro-life by presenters and contributors is not against the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAmol RajanThe ObserverBBCAbortionRoe v WadeHealthWomennewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyAmol Rajan to be new host of University Challenge18 Aug 2022Anti-abortion US priest Frank Pavone defrocked by Vatican18 Dec 2022Jeremy Paxman to step down as University Challenge host16 Aug 2022California budget to cover some out-of-state abortion travel27 Aug 2022The\u00a0right denied the story of a 10-year-old getting an abortion \u2013 it only gets worse16 Jul 2022Joe\u00a0Biden scraps plan to nominate anti-abortion lawyer to Kentucky judgeship16 Jul 2022BBC\u00a0appoints Amol Rajan as Radio 4 Today programme presenter11 Mar 2021IVF\u00a0may be in jeopardy in states where embryos are granted personhood16 Jul 2022Independent editor: I didn't react fast enough to claims we backed Tories8 Oct 2015\u2026\u2026 commentsThe\u00a0women who wish they weren\u2019t mothers: \u2018An unwanted pregnancy lasts a lifetime\u2019 16 Jul 2022Most viewedMost viewedAustraliaWorldAU politicsEnvironmentClimate crisisIndigenous AustraliaImmigrationMediaBusinessScienceTechPodcastsNewslettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
