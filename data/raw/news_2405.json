Anthony antiabortion? Two sides are dueling over the answer \u2014 and the definition of feminism.It\u2019s become a game of \u2018political strategy,\u2019 one scholar says  By  Caroline KitchenerJuly 30, 2020 at 5:24 p.m. EDTShareAdd to your saved storiesSaveIt was not a speech about Susan B. Anthony or a speech about abortion. But that\u2019s what stuck.In May 2010, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin delivered the keynote address at a breakfast hosted by the Susan B. Anthony List, a nonprofit dedicated to electing women who are antiabortion. Six months before the midterms, Palin was there to discuss the importance of supporting female, antiabortion candidates. But halfway through the speech, she turned \u2014 for just a few seconds \u2014 to America\u2019s most famous suffragist.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight\u201cOrganizations like the Susan B. Anthony List are returning the women\u2019s movement back to its original roots,\u201d Palin said. \u201cYou remind us that the earliest leaders of the women\u2019s rights movements \u2014 they were pro-life. Women like your namesake.\u201dIt was perhaps the most visible public statement of support for what remains a hotly contested historical perspective. Advocates and scholars have long debated: Was Anthony antiabortion? After Palin\u2019s statement, leading voices from both sides immediately weighed in, painting opposing portraits of the same woman: one who was fervently antiabortion, and one who was not. In the years since, claims about Anthony\u2019s antiabortion legacy have become far more well known, prominent enough to prompt an antiabortion portrayal of Anthony by Kate McKinnon on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2017.There\u2019s a lot riding on this debate. While antiabortion groups also lay claim to other suffragists, they tend to focus most on Anthony. This makes sense, said Tracy Thomas, a professor at the University of Akron School of Law, who has studied the suffragists\u2019 views on abortion: Of all the women in the suffrage movement, Anthony is \u201cthe name everyone knows.\u201d If you were taught about any one women\u2019s rights leader in school, it was probably her.AdvertisementToday, antiabortion groups often claim to be \u201cpro-woman,\u201d focusing on the physical and emotional risks of abortion and other ways they say the procedure hurts women. If Anthony \u2014 preeminent feminist foremother \u2014 opposed abortion, it would lend historical credibility to this argument, challenging the idea that support for access to abortion is fundamental to modern-day feminism.\u201cIt\u2019s a really effective political strategy,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Our foremothers believed this about abortion,\u2019 that resonates with young women thinking about this today.\u201d Antiabortion groups also invoke this narrative to further their judicial agenda, Thomas said, filing amicus briefs that reference the suffragists\u2019 alleged antiabortion views in the overwhelming majority of abortion-related Supreme Court cases since 1983.\u201cAbortion has become so synonymous with feminism,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. \u201cIf Anthony is antiabortion, it flips the script on feminism. It puts a question in people\u2019s minds that they might not have had before.\u201dGroups like the Susan B. Anthony List have been saying that Anthony was antiabortion for decades, said Ann Gordon, a former Rutgers University professor and editor of the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony\u2019s Papers project, a collection of writings by both suffragists. She first heard these claims in the 1980s, she said, when she received a brochure referencing the suffragists from Feminists for Life, an antiabortion nonprofit which, along with the Susan B. Anthony List, has woven this narrative into their founding mission, citing evidence from Anthony\u2019s writing.Gordon and other prominent women\u2019s history scholars entirely reject this view, claiming that antiabortion groups have \u201chijacked Anthony\u2019s name and fame to support their own cause.\u201d Their evidence is \u201ccompletely made up,\u201d said Lynn Sherr, host of the podcast She Votes, who wrote \u201cFailure Is Impossible,\u201d a biography of Anthony.Advertisement\u201cAt first it hardly seemed worth discussing because it had no basis in fact, and I don\u2019t like to waste time on things I consider so obviously wrong,\u201d Sherr said. \u201cBut then it got annoying.\u201dThe debate really began when Feminists for Life started working with writer and eco-activist Mary Krane Derr to analyze articles from the Revolution, a newspaper owned by Anthony and Stanton from 1868 to 1870. In its pages, the newspaper regularly hosted lively discussions on the most prominent political issues of the day, including abortion. It was the subject of heated debate especially in New York, where Anthony lived and where legislators voted to criminalize the procedure in 1872. Abortion has previously been legal before \u201cquickening,\u201d the point in pregnancy when a woman can feel fetal movement, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University who studies the history of abortion.Many articles in the Revolution opposed abortion, including at least one written by an anonymous author, identified only by the letter A, which Krane Derr and others conclude is a pen name for Anthony herself.AdvertisementThere is very little evidence linking Anthony to A, say Sherr, Gordon and Thomas. Even some antiabortion advocates agree.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best example,\u201d said Serrin Foster, current president of Feminists for Life, referring to the writings by A, attributed to Anthony. While she says one particular antiabortion article written by A is \u201cnearly identical\u201d to an address Anthony delivered around the same time, she was unable to locate that speech. \u201cWe can\u2019t attribute certain things to her. We can\u2019t find things. But it\u2019s like, can someone give me a videotape of Adam and Eve?\u201dAnthony primarily worked on the business side of the paper, Gordon said, but on the few occasions when she did write, she signed \u201cSBA.\u201d\u201cI have read every speech Anthony ever made,\u201d Sherr said. \u201cI have never seen her sign with the letter A. Period.\u201dAdvertisementBoth sides do mostly agree that Anthony had no interest in making abortion illegal. The struggle is over her personal viewpoint.The strongest evidence that Anthony was personally opposed to abortion, Foster said, can be found in writings that scholars widely agree were penned (and signed) by Anthony herself. In a speech on \u201csocial purity,\u201d delivered in 1895, Anthony includes abortion in a list of societal ills, along with \u201cwife murders\u201d and \u201cinfanticides.\u201d She also referenced abortion in an 1876 diary entry about her sister-in-law, who aborted a pregnancy at home and was bedridden for days afterward.\u201cShe will rue the day she forces nature,\u201d Anthony writes.When Gordon discovered the diary entry in Anthony\u2019s papers in the early 2000s, she said, the antiabortion groups \u201cseized on it,\u201d immediately citing the entry as proof that Anthony opposed abortion. Gordon doesn\u2019t see it that way. It\u2019s unclear exactly what Anthony is reacting to in the entry, she said.Advertisement\u201cDoes she think her sister-in-law shouldn\u2019t have aborted the child? Or is she expressing regret that she got sick from trying to?\u201d Gordon said. Either way, she said, \u201cShe certainly says nothing about making a law about abortion.\u201dThe more important point, Sherr said, is that Anthony virtually never spoke about abortion. Sherr never mentions the word \u201cabortion\u201d in her biography of Anthony, she said, because it wasn\u2019t relevant to Anthony\u2019s life. The absence of the subject in her writings is significant, Sherr said. When Anthony cared about something, she wasn\u2019t shy about sharing her opinion. Over the years, Sherr said, she lobbied hard for a variety of different issues.Abortion just wasn\u2019t one of them.There are two museums dedicated to the life and legacy of Anthony: one at her adult home in Rochester, N.Y., and one at the house she was born in, in Adams, Mass. If you take a tour at the Adams house, you\u2019ll hear all about Anthony\u2019s alleged antiabortion beliefs. In Rochester, abortion is never mentioned, unless a visitor asks.Share this articleShareThe Rochester house is the official Anthony museum, founded in 1945, and registered as a national historic landmark. The Adams house opened in 2010, when Feminists for Life member Carol Crossed bought the property. Crossed, who lives in Rochester, had been going to the official museum for years, attending monthly luncheons. She was always frustrated, she said, by the museum\u2019s failure to highlight what she sees as a key piece of Anthony\u2019s legacy.\u201cYou might say the house in Rochester doesn\u2019t tell the full story,\u201d Crossed said.AdvertisementShe wanted to correct the historical record, she said.\u201cI think that current academia to a large extent is supportive of abortion rights,\u201d Crossed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know [about Anthony\u2019s antiabortion positions]. Of course they know.\u201dAmong many other aspects of Anthony\u2019s life, Crossed said, the Birthplace Museum highlights what Crossed says are Anthony\u2019s writings on \u201crestellism,\u201d a period term for abortion. Crossed displays many of the antiabortion articles from the Revolution in the museum, and docents are instructed to cover the issue.\u201cIt\u2019s the antiabortion museum,\u201d Gordon said. (Crossed disputes this characterization. It\u2019s a \u201cmuseum that tells the full story,\u201d she said.)Over the years, Crossed has tried to partner with the Rochester house, proposing panels where they could discuss Anthony\u2019s views on abortion. Deborah Hughes, the president and chief executive at the Rochester museum, always turns her down.Advertisement\u201cThere aren\u2019t two sides of the story, so how do you tell a side that isn\u2019t there?\u201d Hughes said.Some visitors end up at the wrong house, Hughes said, arriving in Rochester, eager to hear about Anthony\u2019s antiabortion legacy. Many more come with questions on the issue, Hughes said, wondering whether Anthony was \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice.\u201dShe\u2019s never quite sure what to tell them.\u201cIt\u2019s like asking, \u2018Did George Washington drive a Maserati?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have [a stance]. Which makes this really hard to talk about.\u201dHughes herself supports abortion rights. Sometimes she wishes that she could use her platform to further that cause, she said, especially when she sees people like Crossed using Anthony\u2019s history to support the antiabortion movement. But Anthony was not in favor of abortion, Hughes said, any more than she was against it.\u201cI wish I could use my platform, but that would not be appropriate,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not what Susan said.\u201dAbortion is not the only part of Anthony\u2019s legacy under close examination. As the 100th anniversary of suffrage nears, while protests after the death of George Floyd continue across the country, many are calling out Anthony for failing to prioritize women of color. She famously withdrew her support for the 15th Amendment, which gave Black men the right to vote in 1870, fearing it might delay the vote for White women.Advertisement\u201cI will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work or demand the ballot for the Negro and not the woman,\u201d Anthony said at a meeting with Fredrick Douglass in 1866.This comes up anytime Anthony is publicly celebrated, Gordon said \u2014 when she\u2019s chosen for a statue in Central Park or when hundreds of women leave their \u201cI voted\u201d stickers on her grave. People ask: Is this someone worth celebrating?The ramifications of Anthony\u2019s beliefs on abortion extend beyond her personal legacy. Told or received a certain way, her narrative has the potential to shape one of the most contentious political issues of the day, as many antiabortion organizations fight to be recognized as feminist.Unsurprisingly, Anthony\u2019s name came up repeatedly in January 2017, when New Wave Feminists, an organization opposed to abortion, tried to join ranks with the Women\u2019s March. Although New Wave was initially approved as an official partner, it was eventually removed from the partner list after backlash from several prominent feminists.\u201cIntersectional feminism does not include a pro-life agenda. That\u2019s not how it works! The right to choose is a fundamental part of feminism,\u201d writer Roxane Gay tweeted at the time.Crossed, who identifies as a \u201cpro-life feminist,\u201d disagrees: If abortion was so central to the Women\u2019s March that no antiabortion group could lend its leadership, she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed, then Anthony \u201cwould never have joined.\u201dThe modern-day feminist movement completely ignores \u201cpro-life feminists,\u201d said Foster, the president of Feminists for Life: Many on the left say that label is a contradiction in terms. But support for abortion rights was not always a prerequisite for feminism, she said. Abortion became foundational in the 1970s, she said, when Betty Friedan and the National Organization for Women mobilized on the issue.\u201cYou were either a feminist who supported abortion or you weren\u2019t a feminist,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI felt homeless.\u201dAnthony was not a fervent antiabortion advocate. But she was not a fervent abortion supporter, either. She felt she was capable of fighting for women\u2019s rights without making the issue a priority.Maybe Anthony quietly wished that women wouldn\u2019t have abortions, Gordon said. Maybe not. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure. Even if she personally opposed the procedure, Gordon said, she\u2019s not sure it would matter. Her legacy as a women\u2019s rights champion would remain fully intact, she said.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with anything.\u201dShareSign upTOP STORIESAdviceMoral dilemmas, relationships, parenting and moreMiss Manners: I keep stumbling into proposalsAsk Amy: Can I help my boyfriend reconnect with his estranged family?Carolyn Hax: Parent embarrassed that college-grad son is a bartenderbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
