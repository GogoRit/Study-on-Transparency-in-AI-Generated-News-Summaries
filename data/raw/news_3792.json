And according to many in the field, it\u2019s been a long time coming.Employees of color, and especially Black employees, feel stuck in lower-paying roles at powerful organizations primarily run by white women, and they say they regularly experience microaggressions, tokenization, and racism at institutions that often tout intersectional feminism as their ethos. And when they try to push for more inclusivity \u2014 both publicly and internally \u2014 they say they are ignored or brushed off.In interviews, internal meetings, and on social media, dozens of current and former employees in the reproductive rights field are pointing out hypocrisy at their own organizations and coming forward with a clear message: The time for \u201cwhite feminism\u201d is over.While months of protests over police brutality and racism have sparked calls for change across many industries, the field of reproductive rights is in a unique position. Access to abortion, contraception, and other reproductive and sexual health care have always disproportionately affected Black people.According to a study of abortion rates in the US published in the American Journal of Public Health, Black people were \u201coverrepresented among abortion patients and had the highest abortion rate\u201d at 27.1 per 1,000 people ages 15 to 44, while non-Hispanic white people had the lowest rate. Another study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Black people are more than three times more likely to die in childbirth than white people.And yet, 26 employees at Planned Parenthood affiliates and the national office of NARAL, as well as 16 employees of other reproductive rights organizations, told BuzzFeed News that people of color, and especially Black people, were often stuck in lower-paying administrative roles, causing high turnover rates among staff of color and preventing nonwhite employees from rising to positions of power within the organizations. NARAL and Planned Parenthood are two of the most powerful reproductive rights groups in the US.The employees provided screenshots of emails, text messages, internal staff surveys, union proposals, and other internal documents to support these stories.\u201cI do think it's worse in reproductive rights, because it is insidious. The movement prides itself on working on issues affecting the most marginalized in society \u2014 women, trans and nonbinary folks, and people of color,\u201d one woman who used to work at a major public relations firm that works with reproductive rights organizations told BuzzFeed News. \u201cAnd yet, in their own workplaces, they don\u2019t value those people.\u201dPlanned Parenthood\u2019s national board is uncharacteristically diverse for the field, and its new president, Alexis McGill Johnson, is Black. But the state-level affiliates, which independently run its clinics across the nation, with their own boards and own CEOs, are much whiter; of Planned Parenthood\u2019s 49 state-level affiliates, only eight CEOs identify as people of color or multiracial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Cheriss May / Sipa USA via AP\n\n\n\nAlexis McGill Johnson, current President of Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack current and former staffers at four of the affiliates told BuzzFeed News they faced racism and were berated and belittled by their bosses while their non-Black colleagues were not. They also said they were unable to move up within the organization, while their white colleagues were promoted.NARAL lists 10 leadership positions on its website, but only one of them is occupied by a person of color, while four other of the 21 total leadership and director-level staff are Black or Latinx. The board for its electoral and lobbying wing comprises 11 members, only two of whom are Black women, while the education and advocacy side has three Black women on its 14-person board. There are no other employees of color on the board.Staff at NARAL told BuzzFeed News that it was an \u201copen secret\u201d that the organization is \u201cby and for cis white women,\u201d and that the board is more committed to the appearance of diversity than the reality of it.Both NARAL and Planned Parenthood said that they are taking steps to address the problems. The organizations also pointed to their diversity, inclusion, and equality initiatives, as well as work they already do fighting racism and prejudice, as examples of their commitment to the issues.\u201cWe have definitely failed in places and certainly fallen short of our goals at times,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \u201cI take responsibility for each instance where a person on our staff or board, a member, or an ally felt the impact of that failure. This is \u2026 an opportunity for institutions like ours to own our history and commit to do better.\u201dIn a statement, Planned Parenthood\u2019s national office told BuzzFeed News, \u201cIt is among leadership\u2019s top priorities to ensure our commitments are intentional, actionable, and public so that we, alongside our supporters, patients, and staff, can hold ourselves accountable and more truly fulfill our mission of reproductive freedom for all.\u201dMany of the current and former employees at NARAL who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that they were made to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) that they interpreted as preventing them from speaking openly about their experiences. A NARAL spokesperson, however, said the agreements \"are not intended to and would not be used to prevent any current or former staffer from sharing publicly concerns about discrimination and harassment.\"Other employees of NARAL and Planned Parenthood still work at those organizations or elsewhere in the field, and asked to remain anonymous because they fear professional retribution.The threat from the anti-abortion movement, which has been steadily whittling away abortion rights, has also kept many employees from speaking out; they fear giving ammunition to abortion opponents, they said. Four people who worked at Planned Parenthood clinics said that walking through protesters standing outside their office every day made them feel they had to stand in solidarity with their white colleagues.But the current reckoning has caused many of these workers to change their thinking. In order for the abortion rights movement to survive and grow stronger, they said, it needs to self-examine and change.A Movement\u2019s Troubled HistoryThis conflict is not new. The feminist movement has been called out for excluding women of color and ignoring the issues that affect them since its inception, and even more loudly in the past several decades.\u201cThe abortion rights activists of the early 1970s should have examined the history of their movement,\u201d Angela Davis wrote in her 1981 book Women, Race, and Class. \u201cHad they done so \u2026 they might have understood how important it was to undo the racist deeds of their predecessors, who had advocated birth control as well as compulsory sterilization as a means of eliminating the \u2018unfit\u2019 sectors of the population.\u201dOne of the main specters of reproductive rights\u2019 checkered history with race is Margaret Sanger. The founder of Planned Parenthood was an open eugenicist, though whether her views applied to race is widely debated. In July, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced it would remove her name from its Manhattan health center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  AP Photo / File\n\n\n\nMargaret Sanger appears before a Senate committee discussing federal birth control legislation in 1934.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The removal of Margaret Sanger's name from our building is both a necessary and overdue step to reckon with our legacy and acknowledge Planned Parenthood's contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color,\" the chair of PPGNY's board, Karen Seltzer, told reporters.In part because they felt excluded from the movement and had different priorities, Black and Latinx activists began to form a separate, parallel movement. In 1994 it was given the name \u201creproductive justice.\u201d\u201cReproductive health and rights has always been approached as a privacy issue, while reproductive justice has been approached as a human rights issue,\u201d Marcela Howell, the founder and president of the National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cWe look at all of the intersections that come into account when Black women and women of color decide whether or not to start a family.\u201dTraditionally, reproductive health and rights organizations tackle sexual and reproductive health care access and the laws around abortion and contraception. Reproductive justice groups work on those issues as well, but take a hyper-intersectional approach that focuses on specific communities and fights economic injustice, police brutality, anti-gay and anti-trans prejudice, food insecurity, education, inequality, and any other issues that would prevent Black people and people of color from having the freedom to choose whether to have a family.Generally speaking, reproductive justice groups are smaller and have less funding. They don\u2019t have the network of high-power donors that reproductive rights groups do, leaders of two reproductive justice groups told BuzzFeed News, curbing their ability to expand their work.Now, reproductive justice leaders say leaders of the mainstream reproductive rights movement need to put their money, and their actions, where their words are.\u201cRight now, predominantly white women's organizations are struggling as to what their role is in stopping [racism], and we embrace their attempt to figure that out,\u201d Howell told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut I don't believe it's my job to tell them how, it\u2019s not my job as a Black woman to fight white supremacy. I think that's the job of white women.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Nikki Kahn / The Washington Post / Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington, DC, affiliate for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Problems In Local OfficesIn response to a request from BuzzFeed News for stories about experiencing racism in the reproductive rights world, eight current and former employees from Planned Parenthood affiliates in Western Pennsylvania, the Great Plains, Washington, DC, and Illinois described race-based pay disparities and \u201ctoxic\u201d work environments for employees of color.At one affiliate, these issues already had bubbled to the surface. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York\u2019s CEO was ousted in late June after being accused of racism and mismanagement in a series of public letters written by staff members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ron Adar / Sipa USA via AP\n\n\n\nLaura McQuade, former CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter years of complaints from staff about issues of systemic racism, pay inequity, and lack of upward mobility for Black staff, highly-paid consultants were brought in three separate times to assess the situation,\u201d the letter signed by hundreds of Planned Parenthood staff and supporters in New York reads. \u201cEach time, employees of color were brutally honest about their experiences, but nothing changed.\u201dThe employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News described similar problems.Two former employees of Planned Parenthood affiliates \u2014 one in Pittsburgh, and the other in Washington, DC \u2014 sent BuzzFeed News copies of their resignation letters, in which they detailed instances of racial ignorance, open racism, and a culture that prevented them from moving up professionally while their white colleagues were promoted. Both women asked to remain anonymous out of fear that speaking up could hurt their careers.\u201cPlanned Parenthood advertises that it exists as a safe space to protect and support women, especially women of color, but from my experiences I can confidently say that it does not practice what it preaches,\u201d the Pittsburgh employee, who worked at the affiliate from 2017 to 2019, wrote in her resignation letter. \u201cAn unsafe environment has been created here, one where management is comfortable and unaccountable while employees suffer and go unheard.\u201dThe Pittsburgh affiliate, called Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania, didn\u2019t have an HR department until November 2019, so the woman went to the CEO, Kim Evert, to file complaints and to suggest management implement a diversity and inclusion training and a mentorship program. Evert told her they didn\u2019t have the time or money for that, the former employee said.Another woman who worked at Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh from 2018 to 2019 had similar experiences and provided BuzzFeed News with notes she kept at the time.Both women said there was a glaring lack of diversity among staff while they were there and that the few employees of color were frequently undermined while their white colleagues were promoted around them. Without an HR department, they felt helpless.In response to a request for comment on the specific allegations made by former Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania employees, the organization said that the clinic developed a career ladder for healthcare assistants (many of whom are people of color) to encourage career advancement, and that all employees were required to complete diversity training online annually.\u201cWhen our staff speak out about our failures to live up to our values, we must stand with them,\u201d Evert told BuzzFeed News in a statement. \u201cThe leadership of PPWP is committed to directly addressing our own internal and structural racism and confirming our commitment to end implicit bias and structural racism within our organization.\u201dThe former employee of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, DC, worked on the administrative side in 2018 and 2019, and said she was the only Black person on her team. She said she was treated noticeably differently from her non-Black colleagues.Despite her high-ranking role, she said she was constantly told to serve board members food, clean up after meetings, organize people\u2019s parking permits, and other assistant-level work. She and two other Black women who worked at the DC affiliate around the same time said their white colleagues would constantly use racially charged terms like \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cdomineering,\u201d and \u201cthreatening\u201d to describe another black male employee; they found him mild mannered and kind.In her resignation letter, the woman wrote that she had been repeatedly singled out, berated, and even screamed at by a supervisor. Once when she was on vacation, the supervisor yelled at her so loudly over speakerphone that colleagues and HR reached out to her after the call to make sure she was OK, she told BuzzFeed News.\u201cI\u2019ve worked at plenty of nonprofits, and I have never been treated so horribly in my life as I was at Planned Parenthood, to the point where I grew very depressed, had a lot of anxiety, and cried in the bathroom almost every day,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Courtesy Franchesca Melendez\n\n\n\nAngelica Melendez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree other employees who worked at the Washington, DC, affiliate told similar stories of their own. Gabrielle Martinez, who worked at the DC affiliate from 2011 to 2018, and Angelica Melendez, who worked there for 90 days in 2017, both of whom are Black and Latinx, said their colleagues would frequently confuse them or imply that they were the \u201csame person.\u201dAll four Planned Parenthood DC employees told BuzzFeed News that the office was segregated, with the few women of color all sitting at the same row of desks. Martinez and Melendez both said that their colleagues, including their white manager, would sometimes refer to the Black and Latinx women in that row as the \u201cbarrio\u201d or the \u201cghetto girls.\u201dMartinez made many complaints to HR about racially insensitive comments or incidents during her time at Planned Parenthood, emails provided to BuzzFeed News show. In one incident, Martinez told BuzzFeed News, she was wearing a purple headscarf when a non-Black coworker grabbed and shook her hair without asking, saying that she was checking if it was a scarf or if she had dyed her \u201creal hair\u201d purple.Martinez emailed HR saying that her coworker touched her \u201cvery inappropriately,\u201d the emails show. HR responded saying they confirmed the event and its \u201cinappropriateness\u201d with a witness, the emails show, and told Martinez that an apology from her colleague was forthcoming.Martinez told BuzzFeed News the colleague said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were offended.\u201dA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, DC, said she could not speak to \u201cindividual personnel matters,\u201d but that the affiliate takes \u201cany allegation of racist actions, harassment, or similar conduct very seriously.\u201d She added that the affiliate provides \u201cmultiple avenues for reporting\u201d and thoroughly investigates each report and takes action when appropriate.In another incident in 2017, Martinez asked her white manager if she and Melendez could attend a summit focusing on Afro-Latina health, and her manager texted back, questioning whether the women were in fact Latinx, both women said. The manager told them that she had never heard Martinez or Melendez speak Spanish, and that she was \u201cmore of a Latina\u201d than them because she spent time in Spanish-speaking countries when she was younger, they told BuzzFeed News.The manager, they said, then sent the women a photograph of herself in what Martinez described as \u201cwhite girl vacation braids.\u201d Neither woman currently has access to this correspondence, which was sent to their work phones, but Martinez also provided BuzzFeed News with emails to HR from March 2018 in which she told them that she did not feel safe meeting with her manager alone.\u201cI feel I am being forced into a hostile work environment where I am micro aggressively being bullied,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI would like to request that until you and I are able to sit down and have a conversation that I am not obligated to meet with [my manager] on my own.\u201dShe said that after that email she still had to regularly meet alone with her manager. Melendez and another employee at the affiliate said that the manager would frequently make staff of color feel \u201cothered\u201d and uncomfortable.\u201cWhen you know there are no consequences for your actions, you can say whatever, do whatever, say ignorant or just rude things and know it will go unpunished,\u201d the other employee said.BuzzFeed News tried repeatedly to reach the manager for comment but received no response. The manager still works at Planned Parenthood\u2019s DC affiliate. Melendez no longer works in reproductive rights.\u201cYou\u2019re losing quality highly educated people with a wealth of knowledge because of that behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cThe white fragility there is really getting in the way of the reproductive justice work \u2014 you can\u2019t be as radical in the work because of the insecurities of some of these women.\u201dThe spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington highlighted that the current leadership at the affiliate, for both the medical clinic and administrative side of the organization, is diverse, with four of the eight members of the executive leadership team identifying as Black or African American, and 73% of the 30 members of management identifying as Black, Indigenous, and people of color.The spokesperson also provided BuzzFeed News with a list of diversity trainings conducted since 2016, as well as other efforts, both completed or in the works. This included an all-staff training on racial microaggressions, plans to establish a diversity, equity, and inclusion council, and a collaboration with outside consultants to develop an \u201caffiliate-wide, multi-year\u201d diversity and inclusion plan.\u201cWe know, of course, that PPMW is not immune to the systemic racism that permeates our society, and over the past several years we have prioritized our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including training on microaggression and engaging an outside consulting group to conduct a comprehensive assessment and plan to strengthen this work,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imag\n\n\n\nPro-choice demonstrators holding NARAL signs rally outside the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissent Within NARALRenee Bracey Sherman, a major figure in the reproductive rights movement, left NARAL in 2017. This June, amid a flood of tweets from fellow people of color who left reproductive rights organizations, she tweeted, \u201canti-Blackness and refusal to address racism is why I quit the board.\u201dThe last straw, she told BuzzFeed News, came during a conversation with the incoming chair of the organization\u2019s board of directors, Brina Milikowsky, in October 2017.\u201cI asked her point-blank what she was going to do to address the racism on the board and how things were going to change, because I was frustrated that all but one seat on the executive committee was held by a white person,\u201d Bracey Sherman said.Milikowsky, she said, brushed off the question. But Bracey Sherman kept asking, she said, while getting the same nonanswers each time.\u201cAnd then I asked her, \u2018Do you think that racism is a problem? Do you think it's a problem that almost no people of color were voted into these seats?\u2019 And she kept avoiding it,\u201d Bracey Sherman continued. \u201cSo I resigned on the spot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Eric Kayne / Center for Reproductive Rights via AP\n\n\n\nRenee Bracey Sherman at a rally outside the US Supreme Court earlier this year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBracey Sherman was one of only a few women of color on the board during her three years at NARAL, the country\u2019s oldest abortion rights organization (and one of only two on the executive committee before she left). She said she was repeatedly questioned by her fellow board members for voicing dissent.Five former NARAL employees and board members told BuzzFeed News that Bracey Sherman was often described by NARAL leadership as a \u201cproblem child.\u201d When Bracey Sherman fought back on proposals or language she saw as exclusionary to women of color or trans people, they said, she was met with resistance and eye rolls.In an email to a fellow board member about why she resigned, which was provided to BuzzFeed News, Bracey Sherman wrote, \u201cI said that I simply could not move forward with an organization that questioned me like that after I voiced dissent in support of Black women and people of color.\u201dToward the end of her time at NARAL, Bracey Sherman was pushing for another woman of color, a South Asian lawyer, to be added to the board, and one of her white colleagues asked her, \u201cWell, how is she different from you? What can she bring that you can\u2019t?\u201d Bracey Sherman recalled.\u201cMind you, this woman is a lawyer, I\u2019m not. She\u2019s queer, I\u2019m not. She\u2019s a completely different race and ethnicity than me, the difference was clear,\u201d Bracey Sherman said. \u201cIt was just really so frustrating to be reminded that as folks of color we are interchangeable to them. It was dehumanizing.\u201dDaniel Grossman, who was on the board with Bracey Sherman at the time, said the issues she raised around race were \u201chard for people to hear.\u201d\u201cI can corroborate that,\u201d Grossman said of that specific circumstance, as well as the reasons Bracey Sherman left the board. \u201cI saw the way she was treated by others on the board, for sure.\u201dIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, Milikowsky did not directly address the incidents recounted by Bracey Sherman, but wrote that the NARAL board has \u201cbeen actively engaged for many years to increase diversity and equity at the board, staff, and membership levels, and to foster an inclusive environment.\u201dTen staff members \u2014 three of whom overlapped with Bracey Sherman and six of whom worked there after she left \u2014 told BuzzFeed News that the resistance Bracey Sherman said she faced at the top exists throughout the entire organization. \u201cThe fact that NARAL is by and for cis white women is an open secret in the reproductive rights world,\u201d one current NARAL employee told BuzzFeed News.Twelve current and former employees who worked at the organization from 2014 to present told BuzzFeed News that the few staff of color at NARAL were concentrated in lower-paying roles and on the finance and operations side of the organization, rather than in roles that interact with members or have a say over the organization\u2019s direction. The few staff members of color who did work there were frequently used in photos and at public events.A spokesperson for NARAL told BuzzFeed News the organization recognized that Black and brown employees felt tokenized and that NARAL was sorry about the actions that had caused those feelings.All of the NARAL staff who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that when people raised issues about diversity, pay equity, or microaggressions, they were ignored, dismissed, and sometimes reprimanded.One incident recounted by several employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News took place at an annual staff retreat in the summer of 2018. NARAL held a mandatory diversity, equity, and inclusion session, which staffers, particularly people of color, felt didn\u2019t adequately address issues of racial inequity, especially at NARAL itself.The following day, at another all-staff meeting, several employees expressed disappointment with the training, and one of the few women of color told Hogue, NARAL\u2019s president, that she believed the organization had a race equity and inclusivity problem, both in the work it does and the makeup of staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Noam Galai / Getty Images\n\n\n\nIlyse Hogue of NARAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, four members of staff present at the meeting told BuzzFeed News, Hogue launched into a heated rebuttal, defending her work to eradicate racial inequality. Throughout her remarks, she kept looking at or motioning toward a small group of Black operations staff sitting together, two members of staff told BuzzFeed News, and suggested that the staff of color present should start a working group on the issue. Two employees present said the staff of color looked visibly uncomfortable.At the end of the meeting, two people present said, Hogue told staff to provide suggestions to managers and executives on ways NARAL could improve its diversity and inclusivity. In the days following, six managers, including two who spoke to BuzzFeed News \u2014 Leslie McGorman, the deputy policy director at the time, and another manager who asked to remain anonymous \u2014 collected feedback from their employees and compiled a document to provide executives.\u201cI got a call after hours from my boss and she basically asked me, \u2018Why did you guys do this?\u2019\u2019\u2019 the second manager said, adding that she felt reprimanded. \u201cShe said one page we couldn\u2019t even send to Ilyse because it was just all attacking her.\u201dA spokesperson for NARAL told BuzzFeed News that the organization does not condone any reprisals or reprimands for staff voicing complaints. She added that Hogue and the executives were aware of the staff\u2019s issues with the retreat, and that they recognized the training at the retreat and the following conversation were missteps.The executives received the letter from management and held a meeting about it, the spokesperson said. These incidents caused executives to seek to improve diversity and inclusion at the organization, they said, and NARAL has begun concrete efforts to do so.A year after the 2018 incident at the retreat, Hogue announced that they were hiring a managing director who would lead NARAL\u2019s diversity initiative as one of their chief responsibilities. They hired a white woman.Staff currently at the organization say that a full year after that hire, NARAL has not had a diversity and inclusion training. NARAL said training sessions are, in fact, being planned.\u201cLiving out our values around diversity, equity and inclusion is both an ethical and a strategic imperative not only for NARAL, but also for our broader movement,\u201d Hogue told BuzzFeed News in a statement when asked about the incidents described at her organization. \u201cWe are proud of the work we are doing to grow and improve and I take responsibility for where we\u2019ve fallen short. \u2026 [W]e know that we must continue to listen, learn and evolve.\u201dTen people who worked at NARAL told BuzzFeed News that leadership constantly cited the fact that their donors and volunteers are majority white, middle class, and centrist as the reason for not always using more trans-inclusive language, like changing \u201cpregnant women\u201d to \u201cpregnant people\u201d in press releases, or signing onto progressive, intersectional causes.One woman who worked at NARAL in 2018 said that when she asked a member of leadership why they didn\u2019t do more outreach to women of color, she was told that NARAL\u2019s \u201ctarget was suburban women.\u201dAt an all-staff meeting in May, an outside messaging research contractor gave a presentation, alongside NARAL\u2019s communications team, in which the contractor argued against using transgender-inclusive language. \u201cWe recognize that using \u2018woman\u2019 (or \u2018women\u2019) does not reflect the real lived experience of transgender men and people who are non-binary who need abortion care,\u201d the slide read. \u201cHowever, we have found that using \u2018people\u2019 instead of \u2018women\u2019 can create considerable confusion among our audience.\u201dThe slide suggested that using the singular \u201ca woman\u201d in messaging helps communicate how personal the decision to have an abortion is, while using \u201cpeople\u201d could \u201ctrigger a suspicion that we are implying men should have more control\u201d over abortion care.In response, a spokesperson for NARAL said the research presented was conducted on its behalf by the outside contractor to inform NARAL\u2019s messaging to \u201cconflicted voters.\u201dEmployees who attended the presentation said this did not come across, and they interpreted the slide \u2014 which referred to \u201cour audience\u201d and had no specific mention of conflicted voters \u2014 as a direction of how to speak to all voters.NARAL\u2019s spokesperson added that the organization is \u201ccommitted to educating our members and voters\u201d on how attacks on reproductive rights affect \u201cnot only women, but also people who are trans and non-binary.\"Trans and nonbinary people are also leaders in our movement and members of our organization,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe believe that using both gendered and gender-inclusive language is our most effective strategy to acknowledge the important realities of who needs access to reproductive healthcare.\"Internal emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News also show that despite recently expanding NARAL into Arizona and Nevada, which have large Latinx populations, NARAL didn\u2019t hire Spanish-language translators. When staff pushed back in meetings and emails, NARAL leadership said they wanted to focus on current donors, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News.In response to questions about their resistance to hire translators, a spokesperson for NARAL said that the organization has \"recognized the need to provide more materials and resources in different languages\u201d as it expands into more states, and that it has begun the work to do so.China Dickerson, who worked as NARAL\u2019s deputy national political director from 2017 to 2018, said that she felt she was \u201clabeled a problem\u201d for pushing for more intersectionality in NARAL\u2019s work and pushing back on racist or discriminatory attitudes.\u201cEvery single time we wanted to in a way embrace reproductive justice, to talk about the people most impacted, it was essentially a \u2018no, because our audience is white middle-class women and they\u2019re not gonna understand,\u2019\u201d she said.When she left, she said, she told NARAL all of her issues in her exit interview.\u201cI don't think it was blindness, because you can't be blind if I'm telling you over and over again that this is a problem,\u201d Dickerson told BuzzFeed News. \u201cNone of us were quiet about these issues, even the white women who I consider accomplices.\u201dIn a statement sent to BuzzFeed News, Hogue said she was \u201cnot aware of skipping opportunities because of donor or member concerns.\u2019\u2019Spokespeople for NARAL provided several examples from the past year of the organization using gender-inclusive language in its tweets and emails to donors and volunteers, as well as intersectional issues NARAL participated in, including sponsoring the Movement for Black Lives conference and supporting criminal justice reform.They also highlighted a recent summit the organization held for their donors and volunteers during which they openly discussed white fragility, white supremacy, and the importance of intersectionality and anti-racism. Hogue also recently held a call with donors in which she explained transgender-inclusive language, the spokespeople said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Monica Schipper / Getty Images\n\n\n\nMonica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive justice organization, has challenged organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL for years over racial issues.When there is a major cultural moment, like the recent protests surrounding the killing of Black people by police or when the Black Lives Matter movement began in 2015, there will be signs of progress and major reproductive rights groups will be more proactive about collaborating and making changes, Simpson said. But when pressure on the groups subsides, Simpson said, that progress can stall.\u201cWe, as folks of color, will shine this light on these larger, mainstream organizations and say, \u2018Hey, we need you to do things differently,\u2019\u201d Simpson said.\u201cAnd when the light is on, we\u2019re doing great, the changes are being made, we\u2019re moving forward. But then it\u2019s like, are we the ones who have to keep the light on? To keep checking up on you?\u201d \u25cf\nTopics in this articleOrganizationsEma O'ConnorBuzzFeed News ReporterSkip to footerSectionsArts & EntertainmentBooksCelebrityCulture & CriticismHealthInternet CultureInvestigationsJPGLGBTQOpinionPoliticsTechCompanySupport UsBuzzFeed.comPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementFollow UsFacebook FacebookTwitter TwitterInstagram InstagramBuzzFeed News Homea BuzzFeed brand."
