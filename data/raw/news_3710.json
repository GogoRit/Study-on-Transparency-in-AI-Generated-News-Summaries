Politically, she urged pro-lifers to go door knocking and write to representatives, but she also asked them to consider more permanent cultural solutions, such as providing a \u201chealthy dating culture\u201d and looking toward \u201cmarriage and commitment as the building blocks of flourishing life.\u201d\u00a0\nDeSanctis encouraged pro-lifers to be wise.\u00a0\n\u201cI certainly would not advocate that we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\u201d DeSanctis said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re at a moment where pro-lifers have to be discerning about what it is we want.\u201d \nabortion, Alexandra DeSanctis, journalism, Pro-life\n\nPrevious PostQ &A: Fall Pulliam Fellow, Alexandra DeSanctisNext PostGOAL adds new mentorship program: SOARMore posts\n\nNovember 30, 2023November 30, 2023\nCountry music needs a reset\n\nCountry music needs to change.
