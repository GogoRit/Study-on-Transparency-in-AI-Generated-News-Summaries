(AP) \u2014 The only five women in South Carolina\u2019s 46-member Senate have vowed to resist new abortion restrictions up for debate after the group filibustered a near-total ban last month.\nBut it remains to be seen whether the coalition known as the \u201csister senators\u201d \u2014 three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent \u2014 will be able to block a new version of a bill that cleared the state Senate earlier this year with some of the bloc\u2019s backing.\nThe Republican-led state Senate on Tuesday is expected to debate a bill banning most abortions after an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, generally around six weeks and before most people know they are pregnant.\nBut the proposal includes new regulations inserted by\u00a0the Republican-dominated South Carolina House\u00a0last week during proceedings slowed by hundreds of amendments from Democrats across two days.\nHouse Republicans axed a section allowing minors to petition the court for an abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. They also added a requirement that biological fathers pay child support beginning at conception.\n\u201cWe had told them, if you want it to pass, don\u2019t move a semicolon,\u201d Republican Sen. Sandy Senn, who does not support a ban around six weeks, told The Associated Press earlier this month. \u201cThey were very, very substantive changes. So, yes, we will be filibustering.\u201d\nSome senators are pulling their support for the bill after the changes \u2014 including the two Republican women who as recently as February supported a similar ban around six weeks. But it is unclear whether enough Republicans disagree with the changes to hurt the chances that the measure heads straight to the governor\u2019s desk.\nREAD MORE: Texas man fatally shoots girlfriend after she got an abortion, police say\nAlthough Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson voted for the bill back in February, she said the House made \u201cdramatic\u201d changes that she does not support.\n\u201cI want to restrict abortions and I\u2019m very upset about what\u2019s happening in our state,\u201d Gustafson told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I\u2019m a legislator first. I\u2019ve got to look at the bill and see how it can be upheld, how it can be implemented.\u201d\nStill, she expects most members of her party \u2014 which holds 30 seats in the chamber \u2014 will back the measure as it stands.\nThe women senators entered the State House together Tuesday to rousing cheers from the dozens of abortion rights supporters gathered on the main floor. All five donned buttons that read \u201celect more women.\u201d\nThis week marks the fourth time that the chamber has taken up abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. During last month\u2019s filibuster, the five women criticized male leadership for repeatedly calling the debate. Speaking consecutively from the well, they at times talked about the physical changes that occur throughout pregnancy or highlighted separate issues they wanted to solve.\nThe Senate\u2019s 15 Democrats, unified against both abortion bans, have largely let the Republican majority debate the issue among themselves. Opponents argue that South Carolina\u2019s high maternal mortality rates \u2014 with even poorer outcomes among Black patients \u2014 would grow worse under the new restrictions.\nAbortion currently remains legal through 22 weeks in South Carolina, though other regulations largely block access after the first trimester at the state\u2019s three clinics. But the law has gone unchanged amid a\u00a0Republican disagreement\u00a0over how far to restrict access that has only recently moved toward resolution.\nIn a statement last week, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said the \u201cpro-life members of the Senate believe this is unacceptable.\u201d Republican leaders have noted provisional state Health Department data that show rising numbers of abortions in South Carolina.\n\u201cTwenty-nine Republican Senators have voted twice to pass a heartbeat bill, and I look forward to returning with these members \u2026 to continue the fight for life in South Carolina,\u201d Massey said.\nThe action comes one week after Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly moved to enact a 12-week abortion ban by overriding the Democratic governor\u2019s veto \u2014 pushing Virginia closer to being the last state in the region with relatively easy access.\nLawmakers anticipate legal challenges for any ban that ultimately becomes law. The South Carolina Supreme Court overturned a similar 2021 law as a violation of the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy in a 3-2 decision this January. But many Republicans believe the latest version would stand after changes to both the proposal\u2019s language and the\u00a0court\u2019s makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                South Carolina State Capitol building, in Columbia, viewed from the southeast.
