Martin\nStudents for Life of America, in conjunction with Texas Right to Life and other pro-life organizations, has signed an amicus brief to defend the free speech of pro-life activists in the Texas Supreme Court case Mark Lee Dickson/East Texas Right to Life vs. The Afiya Center/Texas Equal Access Fund. This case began in 2020 when the abortion industry filed a defamation lawsuit against pro-life activist Mark Dickson, the founder of Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn which creates city ordinances to outlaw abortion facilities within municipal parameters. Students for Life Action worked alongside Dickson in cities like Lubbock, Texas, to make them abortion-free and now is standing behind Dickson as he is being personally sued for speech used to describe the horrific injustice of abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen his lawsuit made it to the Texas Supreme Court, pro-life advocates submitted an amicus brief arguing that the case should be dismissed since Dickson did nothing wrong. Students for Life Action joined this brief, spearheaded by Texas Right to Life, in support of Dickson and in defense of pro-life students like those with whom Students for Life of America works. Every day, our students are involved in the same kind of activism that Dickson has been taken to court over\u2014and that is pro-life speech. It makes no difference whether this speech is occurring on campus or in the community. If this lawsuit against Dickson were to favor the speech censors at the pro-abortion Afiya Center and Texas Equal Access Fund, it would set an unconstitutional precedent affirming endless attacks on pro-lifers and our Students for Life of America groups for simply stating that abortion is murder and that the abortion industry profits off of that evil practice.\u00a0\nMark Dickson with Students for Life of America\u2019s Texas Regional Coordinator Faith Elwonger and student. \nIn the amicus brief, the pro-life free speech allies state: \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cMr. Dickson may encourage the pro-life community to fight the \u201ccrime\u201d of abortion, just as Respondents may encourage abortionists to promote the \u201cright\u201d to abort unborn children. Advocating for killing innocent human beings in their mothers\u2019 wombs is deeply offensive to Amici. However, the ability to advocate for and promote policy change is constitutionally protected activity. 15 It is the very nature of free speech and public policy in the United States. The winner of the abortion debate is to be decided by the public at large through petition, through legislation, and through judicial review of such policies. The debate should not be silenced through chilling defamation lawsuits.\u201d\u00a0\nStudents for Life of America faces similar battles all the time as our students are often told they are not allowed the freedom to speak out against the atrocity of abortion. Just recently, a high school group was not allowed to start a pro-life organization at their school, and these high schoolers had to go through a legal battle just to enjoy the same right as other students to form clubs and speak on what they\u2019re passionate about. \u00a0\nWith Students for Life Action\u2019s assistance, they won the right to meet as an official group. Unfortunately, this is just one example of many of pro-abortion harassment towards pro-lifers. Many pro-life students have their campus displays vandalized, posters torn down, events cancelled or protested, or find that their pro-life beliefs are reason enough to be barred from official recognition\u2014all while trying to defend the preborn in the womb who really cannot speak for themselves. This case is important to the pro-life movement as a whole and the preborn children we exist to protect because it has the opportunity to set a precedent for our ongoing activity. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nTexas Right to Life explains the injustice of this lawsuit further in the amicus brief, stating: \u201cThe aim of these lawsuits is to confuse the general public on whether abortions are currently illegal within the State of Texas, and to serve as a deterrent for other individuals and organizations to stand down, be quiet, or risk exposing yourself to hundreds of thousands of dollars in an expensive lawsuit.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the Midwest Regional Manager, I have faced attacks firsthand for my pro-life beliefs\u2014whether it was about a pro-life word on my shirt, having the audacity to testify on a pro-life bill, or stating that I would press charges against abortionists who illegally committed abortions in Texas. In every one of these instances, the Supreme Court of Texas has a duty to uphold my free speech\u2014and everyone else\u2019s, including Mark Dickson. Regardless of the threats thrown at us by the abortion lobby, the Pro-Life Generation does have a duty to continue speaking up, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to take their unconstitutional bullying. The pro-life movement is standing strong with Mark Dickson as his case is a symbol of all free speech for the pro-life movement. Our eyes are on you, Texas Supreme Court\u2014we haven\u2019t forgotten our duty; don\u2019t forget yours.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,664\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
