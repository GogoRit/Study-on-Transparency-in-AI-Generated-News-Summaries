From the brave Suffragettes who fought for women's right to vote, to Tarana Burke launching the #MeToo movement, to Winona LaDuke leading the fight against climate change, these are the women of the 20th and 21st century who are paving the way for gender equality, the real definition of feminism.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below1The SuffragettesGetty ImagesIn the first major rallying cry for feminism, The Suffragettes fought vehemently for women's rights, most specifically, the right to vote.

Anthony, Alice Stone Blackwell, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Emmeline Pankhurst, Sojourner Truth.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below2Simone de BeauvoirGetty ImagesAn outspoken political activist, writer and social theorist, in 1949 de Beauvoir wrote The Second Sex, an ahead-of-its-time book credited with paving the way for modern feminism.

From 1935 to 1962, Roosevelt wrote \"My Day,\" a newspaper column that addressed women's work, equality and rights before there was even a word for \"feminism\"\u2014the social issues at the time were considered \"controversial,\" especially for that of a First Lady to speak about. After her time as First Lady, she became the first US delegate to the United Nations, served as first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights and also chaired JFK's President's Commission on the Status of Women to promote equality and advise on women's issues.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below4Marlene DietrichGetty ImagesWhile her efforts didn't directly fight for women's rights, Dietrich made a contribution to feminism through fashion. The Hollywood actress wore trousers and men's suits during a time where it was considered extremely scandalous and taboo; both on screen and privately, once almost being arrested for wearing pants in public during the 1930s. She was famously quoted saying, \"I dress for the image. Not for myself, not for the public, not for fashion, not for men.\" Dietrich's way of dressing went on to influence generations of women after her, lending many the confidence and power of wearing a suit.
