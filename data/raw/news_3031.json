Wade allowed many states to restrict or ban abortion.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs Sisters of Life, we've been walking with women facing unexpected pregnancies for the past 30 years and we see the miracles born of hope,\u201d Sister Agnus Dei of the Sisters of Life, told CNA. \u201cWe see that when a woman is loved and supported, she can do anything, she can make that choice for life.\u201d\nThe sisters and Knights hope that Life Fest, which will feature live music and speakers as well as Mass and adoration, will move attendees to build a new culture of life, founded on a spirituality that embraces \u201cevery human life as a gift.\u201d\u00a0\nLife Fest will showcase the musical talents of Catholic artists such as Brother Isaiah and Sarah Kroger as well as talks from inspiring speakers including Pete and Tricia DeMaio and Sister Bethany Madonna.\u00a0\nSince the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June, 13 states have enacted total bans on abortion. Unsurprisingly, states with total abortion bans have seen dramatic drops in abortion rates. An example is Texas, where abortion is illegal except to save the life of the mother. Texas saw 4,879 abortions in July 2021, and only 68 in July 2022, according to data gathered by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.\u00a0\n\u201cThe end of Roe is a crucial milestone, but we should not mistake the ruling as the end of abortion. The fight to protect life will now evolve,\u201d Patrick Kelly, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, said in prepared statement.\n\u201cEven with the overturning of Roe v. Wade,\" Sister Agnus Dei told CNA, \"there are new battles, and there's really a call to renew our commitment to love and really to press on forth from the foundation that these last 50 years have built.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs abortion rates have dropped, organizations like the Sisters of Life and the Knights of Columbus are calling for a new sense of compassion and care from the pro-life movement.\u00a0\n\u201cWe exist to love,\u201d Sister Agnus Dei said. \u201cEach and every person has a gift to give at the service of life ... this is the time to give it. This is the time to recommit ourselves to love.\u201d\u00a0\nSister Agnus Dei told CNA that early registration numbers have made the sisters hopeful they will fill the entire 4,200 capacity of the DC Entertainment and Sports Arena, located adjacent to the Congress Heights Metro station.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll are welcome, but the sisters note that \u201cCatholic youth and young adults will especially benefit from this dynamic experience.\u201d Tickets are required and may be purchased for a suggested donation of $5\u00a0here.\u00a0\nAccording to Sister Agnus Dei, registrants are coming from across the country and though the majority are young, the sisters expect to see participation from the \u201cwhole human family.\u201d\nAfter the rally attendees can head to the March which is 12 minutes away by car or bus, and 25 minutes by Metro.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn past years, the March for Life has gathered crowds from across the nation, with estimated numbers ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, a large percentage of which are Catholic. The 2009 March for Life is said to have been the largest on record, with 650,000 attendees.\u00a0\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 March for Life will be the first since the overturning of Roe v.
