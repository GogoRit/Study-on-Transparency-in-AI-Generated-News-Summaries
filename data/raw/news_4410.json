Meanwhile, women\u2019s rights associations such as Differenza Donna have been gathering testimonies to coordinate joint legal action.\nThe scandal has shed light on the stigma Italian women face, as well as the barriers to their reproductive rights, even though the right to abortion has been legal since 1978.\nWomen have the legal right to end a pregnancy up to 90 days old.\nAfter three months, as in Rossi\u2019s case, abortions can take place if the child\u2019s birth or fetal abnormalities pose a severe risk to the woman\u2019s life and mental health.\nBut over the years, Roman Catholic groups have been conducting fetus burials by striking agreements with local public facilities, including hospitals and cemeteries.\nAssociations such as Difendere la vita con Maria \u2013 Defend life with Mary \u2013 are liaising with about 20 hospitals across Italy after having signed \u201ccollection and storage\u201d deals.\nAt their own expense, these groups sometimes provide the hospital\u2019s morgue with a dedicated refrigerator for the remains.\nThey justify the practice by their own interpretation of a law which states that if an abortion takes place after 20 weeks of pregnancy, family members or \u201csomeone on their behalf\u201d can request \u2013 within 24 hours \u2013 to bury the fetus.\nIf such a request is not put forward, the local health authority is responsible.\nCatholic groups interpret \u201csomeone on their behalf\u201d as an authorisation to collect and bury a fetus regardless of the woman\u2019s consent.\n\u201cThe fetus is an individual, it\u2019s no one\u2019s property, hence it holds rights as much as the woman,\u201d said Stefano Di Battista, spokesman for Difendere la vita con Maria.\nBut Italian law states an individual gains legal standing following their birth, and not before.\nDi Battista said his association was not involved in the burials at Flaminio cemetery.\nSan Camillo Hospital, the facility where the woman denouncing the practice online terminated her pregnancy, and the branch of the Rome municipality that deals with cemeteries also denied any responsibility.\n\n\u2018The ultimate punishment\u2019\nRossi said discovering her name at the cemetery felt like \u201cthe ultimate punishment\u201d in a painful journey.\nShe had already experienced stigma and feelings of abandonment.\n\u201cI am irritated that the first comments by politicians focused on [the breach of] privacy, while we should be way more scandalised by how women get physically and psychologically tortured in hospitals,\u201d she said.\nIn September 2019, Rossi decided to terminate her pregnancy after discovering the fetus had a serious heart problem.\n\u201cThe psychiatrist of the hospital kept trying to change my mind. They kept showing me by ultrasounds the shape of the baby, to hear the sound of the heartbeat to make me change my mind as if the pain was not enough already,\u201d she said.\nRossi was given four abortion pills, with no information, she said, and with no one assisting the seven-hour ordeal.\nShe and her husband later paid for themselves to go to trauma therapy following the abortion; no mental health support was provided.\n\u201cI was in no man\u2019s land,\u201d she said.\nA taboo\nRossi\u2019s story reflects the challenges faced by women and the medical community against the backdrop of increasingly influential Catholic movements, particularly in areas that vote for right-wing parties.\nFor instance, the local council of Verona, a stronghold of the far-right League party, passed a motion in 2018 allowing the use of public funds for anti-abortion rights programmes while the mayor declared the city \u201cpro-abortion rights\u201d.\nAlso in 2018, Member of Parliament Maurizio Gasparri of Forza Italia proposed to give legal rights to fetuses, which would rule as illegal any termination of pregnancy. Parliament is still reviewing his proposal.\nIn June, the region of Umbria abolished the one-day hospital treatment of the RU-486 abortion pill, forcing women to stay in hospital for three days to \u201crecover\u201d. Known as a \u201cmedical abortion\u201d, in many other countries this procedure does not require hospital stays of any length, and can often be carried out at home.\nTo complicate matters, a growing number of doctors and anaesthesiologists have reportedly objected to perform abortions as the practice goes against their religious or personal beliefs, as the law permits.\nSeventy percent of gynaecologists object, as well as 46.3 percent of anaesthesiologists, according to Italy\u2019s health ministry.\n\n\u00a0\nObjectors can pose a challenge to non-objectors who may find themselves alone and overloaded, both technically and emotionally.\n\u201cOf course the majority do not want [to perform abortions] \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of troubles: you are stigmatised, exhausted, always in the eye of the storm, doing a massive effort, for no additional money,\u201d said Marina Toschi, member of the pro-choice group, Italian network contraception and abortion (RICA).\nAfter retiring, Toschi returned to perform abortions in the Marche region where there is a 90 percent objection.\nSilvio Viale, a gynaecologist in the Sant\u2019Anna hospital in Turin, however, blames a lack of dedicated services.\n\u201cThere is no political will to create a dedicated sector with qualitative and appropriated services for abortion,\u201d said Viale, who spent years advocating for Italian hospitals to offer medical abortions to women.\nHe added that pro-abortion rights movements have been emboldened by this void, combined with the lack of action by left-wing pro-choice movements.\n\u201cWe live in a Catholic country where abortion is a taboo, a theme to do political ideology with, but for which no one is willing to dirty the hands.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
