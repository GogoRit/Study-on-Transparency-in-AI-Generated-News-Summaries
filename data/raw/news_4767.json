Ascik| \n\n\nThe contemporary frequency of parents, especially mothers, killing their children\u2014not only newborn babies but toddlers too\u2014is a new phenomenon. Does this have something to do with the relentless loosening of abortion laws in America since Roe v. Wade? We live in an era where we pretend that we do not know when life begins, but we certainly do know when it ends and how to end it.\n\nIn light of the passage of the New York state abortion statute exactly one year ago that brought the issue of \u201cinfanticide\u201d into national consciousness for the first time, the fundamental role that abortion has played for a long time in the moral and political division of the country\u2014its importance rivaled only by Brown v. Board of Education\u2014and the certainty that abortion will be an even more important issue in the November 2020 presidential elections even than it has been in the past, this essay attempts a review of the legislative, judicial, political, and social developments of recent years in regard to abortion.\nThe precipitating event has been the New York abortion statute enacted after the capture by the Democratic party of the New York state senate in the 2018 elections, ending thirty years of Republican control of that body, to go along with the Democrats\u2019 long-standing control of the state Assembly, and with\u00a0Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo the Democrats controlled the New York state government completely. The party made abortion its first order of business when the new legislature convened in January 2019. The motivation, as explicitly stated by Gov. Cuomo, was to codify\u00a0Roe\u00a0v. Wade\u00a0into New York state law because of the fear that the Supreme Court might overturn it.\nIn\u00a0Roe, the Supreme Court spoke of \u201cpotential life\u201d and said that it need not decide the supposedly \u201cdifficult question of when life begins.\u201d Even though Justice Blackmun for the Court did not know, the science of embryology knew the answer to the question then and now: \u201cthe sex of the new individual . . . is determined at fertilization\u201d (Langman\u2019s Medical Embryology,\u00a0p. 41).[1] The ruling of\u00a0Roe, together with its companion case,\u00a0Doe, made abortion available throughout the nine months of pregnancy, the actual equivalent of infanticide, in the last months. That fact was scrupulously ignored and suppressed by the mainstream media and by feminist and other progressive advocacy groups. Until 2019, it had never become a public and national issue.\u00a0Roe\u00a0invented a new constitutional right, available only to women: a \u201cright of privacy\u201d then and now restated as a woman\u2019s \u201cright to control her body.\u201d In the 7-2\u00a0Roe\u00a0majority were Justices Willam Douglas, Thurgood Marshal, William Brennan, Potter Stewart, Harry Blackmun, Lewis Powell, and Warren Burger, the last five of whom had been appointed by Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon.\nRoe\u00a0had ambiguously allowed a state, \u201cin promoting its interest,\u201d in what it called \u201cthe potentiality of human life,\u201d to \u201cproscribe\u201d abortion \u201csubsequent to viability,\u201d that is, the point at which a baby may be expected to live outside the womb. The Court said that \u201cViability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. . . . [t]he infant has a 90% percent chance of surviving\u201d if born at \u201c6.5 to 7 months\u201d after fertilization.[2] But the exceptions of not only the \u201clife\u201d of the mother but also her health\u201d essentially undermined the \u201cproscribing\u201d authority of states. In\u00a0Roe\u2019s companion case,\u00a0Doe v. Bolton, the Court and concurring opinions extensively discussed and made clear that the \u201chealth\u201d basis for an abortion includes \u201cmental\u201d health, that is, \u201chealth in the broadest medical context\u201d and \u201cpsychological as well as physical well-being,\u201d and that it applied throughout the nine months of pregnancy. Likewise, in the later abortion case,\u00a0Casey\u00a0(1992), the Court, with similar equivocation had recognized a state\u2019s \u201cpower to restrict abortions after viability\u201d and a state\u2019s \u201clegitimate interests\u201d in \u201cthe life of the fetus,\u201d up to and even including a \u201clegislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions.\u201d But the\u00a0Casey\u00a0court followed up on the\u00a0Roe\u00a0court\u2019s smokescreen by providing that a state law may not place an \u201cundue burden\u201d of a woman\u2019s right to abortion supposedly before viability, but other places in the opinion used language to establish that as a standard throughout pregnancy, that is, after \u201cviability.\u201d And this was more explicitly enlarged in the\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health\u00a0case (2016).\nFrom the beginning of the abortion era, many states reacted to\u00a0Roe\u00a0by attempting to restore some version of their abortion laws, and with the motivation of trying to establish some kind of protection for the independent, sensate reality of the unborn child. (\u201cDuring the fifth month, movements of the fetus can be felt by the mother.\u201d[3]). In the 47 years since\u00a0Roe, the Supreme Court has handed down approximately 20 major abortion decisions, all prompted by the continuing rejection by the states of\u00a0Roe. There is no other issue like it.\nNew York and Virginia in 2019\nEven after\u00a0Roe, the state of New York continued its outright prohibition of abortion after 24 weeks, except when the woman\u2019s life was in danger. With the leadership of Gov. Cuomo, and the fear in progressive circles that the Supreme Court might overturn\u00a0Roe, the specific purpose of the new statute is to repeal that provision of the law. The new wording establishes the right to abortion at any time if there is an \u201cabsence of fetal viability\u201d or to protect the woman\u2019s \u201clife or health.\u201d Thus, with decades of practice beginning with\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Doe\u00a0that a woman\u2019s \u201chealth\u201d includes mental health and with the vague concept of \u201cfetal viability,\u201d it is clear that New York has established a right to abortion at any time during pregnancy. And as New York state senator, Liz Krueger, a main sponsor of the New York bill, said, abortion \u201clater in pregnancy,\u201d can be indicated by a \u201cwoman\u2019s mental health.\u201d[4]\nNonetheless, with the support of the New York and national media, Gov. Cuomo himself authored an opinion in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0that disguised and denied his own explicit purpose when he said that the new law \u201cdoes not allow abortions minutes before birth, nor does it allow third-trimester abortions \u2018for any reason\u2019,\u201d and said that \u201cthird-trimester abortions are extremely rare, making up only about 1 percent of all abortions.\u201d[5] He also disguised that misrepresentation by changing the subject from human life to attacking \u201cthe religious right\u201d and professing his own Catholicity and stating that \u201cmost Catholics are pro-choice.\u201d\nGov. Cuomo\u2019s new law is in keeping with the state code of New York which, unlike three-fourths of the states, has no criminal statute outlawing the fetal homicide that is the result of a violent attack on a pregnant woman.\nLikewise, and at the same time and for the same purpose, a proposed Virginia state law, strongly supported by Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, a\u00a0pediatric\u00a0neurologist by trade, had the specific purpose of extending abortion into the third trimester. Its specific language provided that abortion \u201cafter the second trimester of pregnancy\u201d was permitted if a physician determines that the continuation of the pregnancy would be \u201clikely\u201d to \u201cimpair the mental or physical health of the woman.\u201d In introducing the bill into the Virginia legislature, Virginia state Delegate Kathy Tran said that the bill would be \u201cchanging the standard\u201d for third trimester abortions and would allow abortion \u201cthrough the third trimester all the way up to forty weeks\u201d and when a woman was \u201cdilating.\u201d[6] Gov. Northam went further and said that \u201c[t]he infant would be delivered; the infant would be kept comfortable; the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desire, and then a discussion would ensue between physicians and the mother.\u201d[7]\nNow, the Virginia Democrat party, via the 2019 state legislative elections, controls the entire Virginia state government. Like New York in 2019, the Democrats have made abortion their first order of business. Although final details of different versions of the two legislative houses have not been worked out, the bills are directed at eliminating state restrictions, such as who may perform abortions and parental consent, on abortion. With Governor Northam, a new abortion law is certain to be enacted. Supporters have said that they want to make Virginia the new \u201csafe haven\u201d for abortion. Significantly and unlike 2019, Democrats avoided any legislative measure intended\u00a0 to ensure that abortion is available until birth.\nViability, Eugenics, and Partial-Birth Abortion Today\u00a0\nAs for \u201cfetal viability\u201d and \u201cinfanticide,\u201d the Supreme Court in the 2019\u00a0Box\u00a0case let stand a decision of the Seventh Circuit that held Indiana\u2019s new statute unconstitutional because it prohibited abortion before viability. The state had enacted a statute, the Abortion Nondiscrimination Provision, outlawing pre-viability abortions based on the discriminatory categories of \u201crace, color, national origin, ancestry, sex,\u201d or upon a diagnosis or potential diagnosis of \u201cDown syndrome\u201d or \u201cany other disability.\u201d In rejecting the case, the Supreme Court said that not enough appeals courts had yet ruled on \u201cthis kind of law.\u201d In its essentially jurisdictional ruling about the absoluteness of \u201cviability\u201d as the key issue, the Seventh Circuit had avoided any recognition or discussion of those civil-rights and eugenic limitations on abortion. Although agreeing with what was a jurisdictional decision of the Court, Justice Thomas wrote a long \u201cconcurrence\u201d reviewing the history of American eugenics and its connection to abortion. Justice Thomas accused the Indiana case of highlighting \u201cthat abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation.\u201d He pointed out that the Supreme Court had approved of eugenics in its never-overturned \u201cthree generations of imbeciles are enough\u201d decision in\u00a0Buck v. Bell\u00a0(1927). Justice Thomas did not mention that the\u00a0Buck v. Bell\u00a0vote was 8-1 against the imbeciles. He also did not bring up\u00a0Roe\u2019s citation of\u00a0Buck\u00a0as a case supporting the\u00a0Roe\u00a0decision. Citing research, Justice Thomas said that the abortion rate for babies diagnosed with Down Syndrome is 67 percent in this country and much higher in Europe. Additionally, he referred to what is now commonly known about the ubiquity of sex-selection abortions in China and India.\nJustice Thomas argued that\u00a0Casey\u00a0\u201cdid not decide whether the Constitution requires States to allow eugenic abortions.\u201d Pennsylvania, he said, had in 1991 enacted a ban on race, sex, or disability abortions, but Planned Parenthood, the plaintiff in\u00a0Casey, had not challenged that part of Pennsylvania\u2019s law. During the pendency of the\u00a0Box\u00a0case in the Seventh Circuit,\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0editorial-page-editor Ruth Marcus, in a vociferous justification, said that she had had the pregnancies of her two born children tested in the womb and asserted that \u201cI would have terminated those pregnancies had [Down syndrome] testing come back positive.\u201d[8]\nIn\u00a0Gonzalez v. Carhart\u00a0(2007), the Supreme Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71531, the terms of which apply to any stage of pregnancy. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion for the five-man majority. He pointedly held that part of\u00a0Casey\u00a0included the right of a state to be interested in fetal life, that the Act concerned an abortion method only, and did not impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the right to an abortion. Justice Kennedy referred to \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d as \u201cthe usual abortion method\u201d in the \u201csecond trimester,\u201d described it in detail, including \u201ccollapsing the skull,\u201d and said that it was \u201cthe impetus\u201d for the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, although the Act applied only to \u201ca living fetus\u201d and, therefore, did not prohibit dilation and evacuation. He also said that after the first trimester, \u201cmost\u201d abortions occur in the second trimester. He said along the way in his lengthy opinion that \u201ca fetus is a living organism within the womb\u201d that \u201cmay become a child.\u201d The appeals court had ruled the statute unconstitutional because it did not have an exception for the \u201chealth\u201d of the mother. The Act had been passed in the Senate by 47 Republicans and 17 Democrats; in the House by 218 Republicans and 63 Democrats.\nIt has to be wondered how and whether New York\u2019s newly enacted law of 2019 and the proposed but not-enacted 2019 bill in Virginia comport with the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, which prohibits a \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d[9] in which the\u00a0person\u00a0performing the abortion\n\ndeliberately and intentionally vaginally\u00a0delivers a living fetus\u00a0until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the\u00a0person\u00a0knows will\u00a0kill the partially delivered living fetus; and performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIn his opinion, Justice Kennedy made the point that the Act applied \u201cfor purposes of criminal liability\u201d only when \u201cthe overt act causing the fetus\u2019 death must be separate from delivery.\u201d So, it seems that the overt killing act can occur right before delivery.\nUnder current federal law, the \u201cdeath\u201d of or \u201cbodily injury to . . . an unborn child\u201d caused in the perpetration of stated list of federal violent crimes is itself a separate crime. The \u201cunborn child\u201d is defined as \u201ca member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\u201d 18 U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a71841. It was enacted in 2004 as the Unborn Victims of Violence Act by sixty percent majorities in both the House and Senate. Thirty-eight states have similar laws.\nThree 2019 Cases After New York and Virginia\u00a0\nIn three cases in 2019, all based on responses to and in the context of the New York and Virginia abortion initiatives, federal district courts completely avoided any consideration of the issue of human life, including the supposed \u201cpotentiality\u201d\u2014or actuality\u2014of the child in the womb by concluding in all three cases that the only thing that mattered was\u00a0Casey\u00a0viability. Georgia, Ohio, and Mississippi states had enacted laws prohibiting abortion after the heartbeat is perceived which is well before viability, of course. Their purpose was to have the Supreme Court confront and overturn\u00a0Roe\u2014exactly Gov. Cuomo\u2019s fear\u2014by enacting state laws that directly challenged it. In the Georgia case, the legislature, responding to the New York infanticide law, banned abortion after \u201ca detectable heart beat.\u201d The federal court in Georgia held that viability is \u201cthe most central principle of\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u201d\u00a0and that no state interest in \u201cpotential life\u201d can override that. The new Georgia law, the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, provided that a \u201cnatural person\u201d includes an unborn child which is \u201ca member of the species\u00a0homo sapiens\u00a0at any stage of development . . . carried in the womb.\u201d The court found this \u201cunconstitutionally vague\u201d when, of course, the legislature was making it precise, doing the exact opposite. The court also gave a racial aspect to its decision, saying that black Georgians have four times the abortion rates as whites.\nAs for heartbeat, the court agreed with the challenge to the Georgia law and stated that \u201ccells\u00a0that eventually form the basis for development of the heart later in pregnancy produce\u00a0cardiac activity\u00a0that is generally detectable\u2014via ultrasound\u2014beginning at approximately six weeks LMP [from a woman\u2019s last menstrual period]\u201d (emphasis added). (\u201cThe heart begins to beat at approximately 21 days of gestation.\u201d[10]\u00a0In the Ohio case, the legislature, citing \u201cthe ongoing advancement of medical technology,\u201d banned abortion after a detectable heartbeat. But the federal district court, relying completely on and citing\u00a0Casey, ruled that viability was \u201cthe critical fact\u201d and \u201cmost central principle of\u00a0Roe.\u201d In the Mississippi case, the federal district court concluded that viability must be determined \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nFrom \u201cRight of Privacy\u201d to \u201cMeaningful Life\u201d\nFor these courts, the supposed constitutional rights and rulings of\u00a0Roe\u00a0and its progeny cases are not enough. Abortion is not only a unique and super constitutional right, it goes beyond that. The Georgia court said that abortion is \u201cessential to a person\u2019s dignity, equality, and ability to shape a meaningful life.\u201d The Mississippi court, citing\u00a0Casey,\u00a0said that it is \u201ca woman\u2019s free choice, which is central to personal dignity and autonomy.\u201d\nIndeed, Justice Rehnquist in his dissent in\u00a0Casey\u00a0spoke of\u00a0Roe\u2019s \u201call encompassing \u2018right of privacy.\u2019 \u201d In\u00a0Bellotti v. Baird(1979), Justice Powell, writing for the Court, called it \u201ca constitutional right of unique character.\u201d In\u00a0Casey\u00a0(1992), the three Republican-appointed co-authors of the opinion of the Court, Antony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, and David H. Souter, said that the only other \u201crare, comparable\u201d case of the stature of\u00a0Roe\u00a0\u201cin our lifetime\u201d was\u00a0Brown v. Board of Education.\nIn\u00a0Dred Scott\u00a0(1857), the question was whether black slaves and free men were \u201ccitizens\u201d under the United States Constitution and under the laws of most of the states, not whether blacks were \u201cpersons.\u201d In numerous passages, the opinion for the 7-2 Court spoke about blacks as persons, including the phrase \u201cseparate class of persons.\u201d But, concerning the two sections of the Constitution concerning the slave trade that the Court construed (I.2 & I.9), the Court said that black people \u201care not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word \u2018citizens\u2019 in the Constitution.\u201d\u00a0Dred Scott, of course, was before the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, which language of \u201cperson\u201d the Supreme Court in\u00a0Roe\u00a0specifically denied included the unborn: \u201cThe word \u2018person\u2019 as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868.\nThree years after\u00a0Dred Scott, the American Medical Association in 1860 sent a \u201cMemorial\u201d to each state legislature and governor. Explicitly based on the modern and up-to-date development in the science of embryology, that is, \u201cactual and various proof.\u201d[11] The key passage in full of the Memorial was:\n\nThe moral guilt of Criminal Abortion depends entirely upon the real and essential nature of the act. It is the intentional destruction of a child within its parent; and physicians are now agreed, from actual and various proof, that the child is alive from the moment of conception.\n\nThe Current and Unprecedented Politics of Abortion\nBesides \u201csocialism,\u201d abortion is the clearest of all issues that define the differences between the two political parties. Even as late as the Clinton presidency, it was satisfactory for Democrats to say of abortion merely that it be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d The 1996 platform said: \u201cless necessary and more rare.\u201d But the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Democratic party platforms stated that the party \u201cunequivocally\u201d supported \u201csafe and legal\u201d abortions, although with the qualifying language of its goal to \u201creduce the need for abortion.\u201d The 2016 platform called for the first time for a repeal of the Hyde amendment which prohibits federal funding of abortion and which had been in effect since 1976.\nThe Republican party has long stated its support for the \u201cright to life\u201d and a human-life constitutional amendment outlawing all abortion. The section on abortion of the 2016 platform was lengthy and detailed. The Republican party supported a human life amendment, the appointment of judges who \u201crespect\u201d the \u201csanctity of innocent human life\u201d informed and parental consent laws, adoption assistance and counseling that encourages women \u201cto choose life,\u201d \u201cborn alive\u201d laws for \u201can infant who survives abortion,\u201d laws outlawing \u201cpain capable abortions,\u201d laws outlawing sex-selection and disability-selection abortions, and opposed the selling of fetal body parts. The 2012 Republican platform had spoken of the \u201cbarbaric practice of partial-birth abortion\u201d and its opposition to \u201csex-selective\u201d abortion and its support for legislation banning abortion of \u201cunborn children who are capable of feeling pain.\u201d\nAt issue in the\u00a0Gee\u00a0abortion case scheduled for oral argument in the Supreme Court on March 4 is a suit by abortionists challenging a recently enacted Louisiana law that requires them to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. After concluding after hearings that health and safety incidents occurred disproportionately more at abortion clinics as compared to other out-patient clinics, the legislature had decided to include abortionists, the only kind of doctor in Louisiana not previously required to have such privileges, to refer women patients with complications to local hospitals.\u00a0Gee\u00a0is a variation on the similar fact pattern in\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health\u00a0in which the Supreme Court overturned a similar Texas law as an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.\nA total of 197 members of Congress, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gellibrand, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bennett, along with party leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, have filed an amicus brief in\u00a0Gee\u00a0asking the Court to overturn the Louisiana law. Likewise in the 2018\u00a0Becerra case, in which the Supreme Court, by only a 5-4 vote, the narrowest of margins, overturned a newly-enacted California statute requiring anti-abortion women\u2019s clinics to post pro-abortion information concerning referrals for and the availability of abortion, that is, to speak in support of a moral position against their consciences. Senators Harris, Booker, Sanders, and Warren, along with other Democrats, a total of 16 Democrat senators and 85 Democrat representatives, including Nancy Pelosi, filed a brief in favor of that unprecedented coercion of free speech. In February, 2019, Senate Democrats blocked the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, introduced by Republican senator Ben Sasse, from coming to a vote. The bill, an attempted national response to the New York and Virginia developments, would have required doctors to save the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion. Sen. Sasse had openly described the bill as an \u201cinfanticide ban.\u201d[12]\nAll the Democratic presidential candidates, remaining and withdrawn, have included strong support for abortion in their campaigning. Peter Buttigieg, a Rhodes scholar (but not an embryologist), took it to the next level when he said that \u201chow life begins\u201d is a \u201ccosmic question\u201d and proposed that the abortion issue be decided by birth\u2014claiming the Bible endorses that conclusion: \u201cThen again, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, thereby, like Gov. Cuomo, made abortion a religious rather than a legal and constitutional issue.[13] Elizabeth Warren has endorsed abortion throughout pregnancy if there is a \u201cfetal abnormality.\u201d[14] Bernie Sanders, when asked about third-trimester abortions, said that the decision \u201cbelongs to a woman and her physician.\u201d[15] Former presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke had said the same thing. Joe Biden essentially agreed when he asserted that he would codify Roe v. Wade\u00a0into federal law, thereby seeking to make any new Supreme Court decisions on abortion irrelevant, and said that he would overturn the Hyde amendment which has prohibited federal funding of abortion since 1976.\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump campaigned more explicitly on abortion than any previous Republican presidential candidate. He brought up the issue of late-term abortion and has continued to speak out against late term abortions as president. He has made abortion a centerpiece of his presidency. He reinstated the \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d regarding federal funding of non-governmental agencies (NGO\u2019s) active in foreign countries. Barack Obama had repealed it. He promised to appoint pro-life judges and has advocated that the Supreme Court should return the issue to the states. In 2019, his Department of HHS promulgated a new rule under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, the federal program that provides funding for birth control, that prohibits funds recipient from referring clients for abortions. President Trump supported Senator Sasse\u2019s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Mr. Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has filed a brief in the\u00a0Gee\u00a0case supportive of Louisiana\u2019s law. On January 20, 2020, on essentially a partisan vote, the Democratic majority of the House rejected by a vote of 219-187 an amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act that would have added \u201cthe unborn child\u201d to the \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d protected by the Act. Pregnant women are already designated in the Act as an \u201cat risk\u201d group.[16]\nIn the context of this sharpest of political divides have been allied initiatives to promote abortion. Instead of a \u201cprivate choice,\u201d there is a new rhetorical tactic of \u201cshouting your abortion.\u201d[17] At a movie awards this year, the shouting of Michelle Williams, apparently an actress, that her own abortion was a key to her successful career received widespread national publicity. A new California law requires all public colleges to make abortions available on campus. In June, 2019, a new campaign asserting that restrictions on abortion are \u201cbad for business,\u201d was launched in a full-page ad in the\u00a0New York Times.[18] Among the better-known businesses or businesspersons appearing in the ad, were Bloomberg LP, Yelp, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, and Tinder. At the same time, Netflix and Disney threatened to stop producing movies in Georgia because of its new abortion law.\nLate-Term Abortions Are \u201cRare\u201d\nAgainst accusations that third-trimester abortions are infanticide, a uniform response by the elite media and the Democrat Party has been that such abortions are \u201crare.\u201d As already mentioned above, Gov. Cuomo has said that such abortions are \u201cextremely rare.\u201d And Elizabeth Warren has stated that \u201cinfanticide is illegal everywhere in America.\u201d[19] Former Planned Parenthood President Leana Wren has said that \u201c[a]bout 1% of abortions occur after 24 weeks, and when they do occur, they are often due to complex circumstances.\u201d[20]\nBut to use as an argument that late-term abortions are rare is to accept those \u201crare\u201d late-term abortions. How rare? According to the Center for Disease Control, there were 7,481 abortions (1.2%) performed at or after 21 weeks gestation in 2016.[21] According to the Alan Guttacher Institute, there were 862, 320 abortions in 2017, of which 11,210 were performed at or after 21 weeks gestation.[22] As already referenced above, a child born at 6.5 to 7 months has a \u201c90 percent\u201d chance of survival.\nIn 2012, the Journal of Medical Ethics (est: 1975) had published a paper entitled \u201cAfter-birth abortion: why should the baby live?\u201d, in which the co-authors argued that,\n\nIf criteria such as the costs (social, psychological, economic) for the potential parents are good enough reasons for having an abortion even when the fetus is healthy, if the moral status of the newborn is the same as that of the foetus and if neither has any moral value by virtue of being a potential person, then the same reasons which justify abortion should also justify the killing of the potential person when it is at the stage of a newborn.[23]\n\nSuch logic is a natural extension of\u00a0Roe. And, of course, there is Princeton University professor Peter Singer\u2019s stance, clearly set out in his\u00a0Practical Ethics\u00a0(1980), now in its third edition, \u201cjustifying infanticide.\u201d[24]\nAbortion and Homicide\nDoes this have something to do with the apparent rise in mothers killing their born children? In California in 2019, the mother of a newborn and her boyfriend are alleged to have strangled their baby in the hospital.\u00a0 In Ohio, a woman pleaded guilty last year to killing her three children on three separate occasions over a two-year period. A mother in Boston is alleged to have killed herself and her two children, ages four and sixteen-months, by throwing them and herself off a building in December 2019. In Louisiana in 2019, a mother was charged with murder of her five-year-old daughter after falsely claiming that the child died in an automobile accident. In Alabama, a mother was arrested for allegedly murdering her two sons, ages 9 and 3, in 2019. In Texas, a mother is alleged to have killed herself together with her six-year-old son in 2019. A grandmother in Arizona was just sentenced this year for the 2019 murder of her two autistic twin grandsons.\nAnd fathers: In New York City in 2019, a father is said to have murdered his 5-year-old daughter and beheaded his wife before killing himself. In Florida, a man has been charged with killing his wife and her four children, ages 1, 2, 5, and 10 in 2019.\u00a0 And the murders of his wife and two daughters, ages 3 and 4, by Colorado father Chris Watts has been continuously in the news since the crimes and his guilty plea in 2018 and are now the subject of two separate movies.\nThis writer of sufficient age and personal memory reaching back to 1973 contends that the contemporary frequency of these kinds of child killings is a new phenomenon. They occur in the era of abortion where we pretend that we do not know when life begins, but we certainly do know when it ends and how to end it.\nThe Imaginative Conservative\u00a0applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics\u2014we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility.

I too have personal memory going back to the years preceding ROE in which Washington State made abortion legal by voter approval of a NARAL supported referendum to the people in 1970.  Arguing against the measure I made the case  that philosophically and morally no distinction could be made between abortion in the womb and infanticide outside the womb and that the latter would follow the former.  I made that argument on essentially the same grounds as used in the  Journal of Medical Ethics paper,  \u201cAfter-birth abortion: why should the baby live?\u201d. \nWhen I first read that article shortly after it was published I was struck with how strange it seemed to me that the argument I had made against abortion 42 years earlier was now being used by those advocating infanticide. How sad it is that I was not wrong in my vision of what was to come. \nBy profession I am a Police Officer  now retired after having served 33 years with a large metropolitan department. Nearly 20 of those years were as a uniformed patrol officer working the night shift.  I have witnessed human created hell  in every way imaginable and some unimaginable. Yet I have never see anything or any act that  I would think more damaging to the human soul than the specter of a mother killing her own child.  Indeed, your  essay is aptly titled: The Road to Hell..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Corrigan\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJan 23, 2022 at 10:57 am - Reply \n\nThank you for your carefulness and your courage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarol\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAug 28, 2022 at 4:00 am - Reply \n\nHello\u2026\n  I was looking for the exact infanticide Bill I have heard of recently\u2026 specifically for the state of New York, California and Colorado. Is this true. Is there really a bill that protects women when they kill their child? This is so evil! I was telling my brother about this\u2026 and he didn\u2019t believe me. I want to find that Legislation so I can show it to him.  I hope there no legislation like this. I can\u2019t even imagine such a wicked wicked thing.\nThank you,\nCarol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave A Comment Cancel replyComment\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n\u0394 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearchRECEIVE OUR ESSAYS VIA EMAIL! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunsubscribe from list\n\n\n\n\nGet Weekly Updates!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\nName\n\n\nFirst\n\n\n\nLast\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n \n\n\nRecent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal Education: Piercing the Dome\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 18th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJoseph\u201d\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 18th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning the Whole Soul: The Moral Journey of the Philosophic Nature in Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic\u201d\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 17th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Single-Minded Saint\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 17th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Catholic Literary Revival\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 16th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter to the Soldiers of Coroticus\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 16th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomie and the Saints\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 15th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Day of Private Infamy: An Alzheimer Odyssey Postscript\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 15th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Reasons to Support the American Solidarity Party\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 14th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrutus: An Honorable Hero?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 14th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic As If Beauty Mattered: Composer Michael Kurek in Conversation\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 13th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican History on the Banks of the Potomac\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 13th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMircea Eliade & the Mythological Origins of Literature\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 12th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Great Violin Concertos You Must Hear\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 12th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire From the Gods: Oppenheimer as a Greek Tragic Hero\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 11th, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Austen, C.S.
