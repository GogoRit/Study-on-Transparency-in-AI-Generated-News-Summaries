Tricia Bruce, affiliate of the Notre Dame's Center for the Study of Religion and Society and adjunct research associate professor of sociology with the University of Texas at San Antonio, led a team of sociologists who asked a sample of 217 Americans what they believe about abortion, why they believe it and what factors have influenced those beliefs.\nTheir first finding? Americans tend not to talk about abortion, and most interviewees reported they had never been asked their opinion on the topic, nor listened to, in any in-depth way.\nAccording to Bruce, the researchers gathered the kinds of textured data that fixed-choice polls cannot extract, deploying in-depth interviews to measure attitudinal limits, exceptions, rationales and the contexts that informed interviewees\u2019 abortion views. \u201cThe study is distinct in approach and in sample \u2014 a cross-section of ordinary Americans \u2014\u00a0 as most interview studies on abortion include only activists in social movements, people with personal experiences of abortion and affiliates of particular religious traditions,\u201d she said.\nThe five-person research team found that mutually exclusive labels like \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro- life\u201d paint an incomplete, potentially misleading, picture. According to Bruce, these labels signal beliefs that are both polarized and consistent, while most Americans hold neither polarized nor consistent beliefs toward abortion.\nThese tensions were particularly evident in how interviewees discussed the morality and legality of abortion.\nAsked for their stance on the legality of abortion, 51 percent of interviewees said abortion should be legal under certain circumstances; 35 percent said abortion should be legal under any circumstance; and 14 percent said illegal in all circumstances. Asked about the morality of abortion, the split looked quite different: 38 percent said \u201cit depends;\u201d 33 percent identified as morally opposed to abortion; and 29 percent said they are not morally opposed.\nThe \u201cwhy\u201d of held positions was as important to this study as the positions themselves, and the researchers found that categories of influence on abortion attitudes were, in some ways, predictable: abortion experience, parenthood, facts, religion and politics. Less predictable, however, were diverging views on the role fathers should play in abortion decisions, and also the conflicts self-identifying Catholics expressed in connecting their faith with their abortion views.\n\u201cWhen you really ask people what forms their beliefs on abortion, they point to personal experience and relationships, not political policies and rhetoric,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cAlso, many will admit they lack basic knowledge about gestational development, moral frameworks, the abortion laws in their state and how much an abortion costs.\u201d\nThe study also offers a set of recommendations for fostering a healthier public conversation about abortion, including expanded education in science, law and moral reasoning; realizing the limits of position labels to fully express a person\u2019s point of view; focusing on reducing the social circumstances that give rise to abortion decisions; and attending to the personal impact from which someone may be expressing their views, without immediately translating that into a political position.\n\u201cThis sort of research \u2014 whatever it uncovers \u2014 is essential in our educational mission to create resources that promote the dignity of human life from conception through natural death,\u201d said Jessica Keating, director of Notre Dame\u2019s Office of Human Life and Dignity. \u201cBy identifying gaps in knowledge and formation, this study helps us address those challenges more effectively.\n\u201cAnother key takeaway from this study is the level of moral seriousness interviewees expressed about abortion as it belies popular rhetoric claiming abortion as a desirable good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nContact: Amanda Skofstad, assistant director of media relations, skofstad@nd.edu, 847-525-7492\n\n\n\n\nPosted In:\nResearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeLatest NewsExpertsND in the NewsSubscribeAbout Us\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\n\nMedieval Institute to host Medieval Academy of America\u2019s 99th meeting in mid-March\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 07, 2024\n\n\nWomen Lead 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n\nNotre Dame literacy research can improve learning outcomes and fight global poverty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n\nA vision of hope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\n\nAI among us: Social media users struggle to identify AI bots during political discourse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Media\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Public Affairs and Communications\n\nNotre Dame News\n\n\n\n500 Grace Hall\nNotre Dame, IN 46556 USA\n\n\n\n Facebook X/Twitter Instagram YouTube Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 University of Notre Dame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nMobile App\nNews\nEvents\nVisit\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n X/Twitter\n Instagram\n YouTube\n LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
