(Photo: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust months since hitting the market in November, a pro-life coffee company has donated more than $3,500 to pregnancy resource centers.\nSeven Weeks Coffee, founded by Anton Krecic with the help of his wife, Christa, offers ethically sourced coffee with a mission of supporting life.\n\u00a0\u201cAt seven weeks, a baby\u2019s the size of a coffee bean. So, that\u2019s where we get our name,\u201d Krecic said in a phone interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cIt\u2019s the same time a heartbeat is clearly detectable. So, our mission is to protect every beating heart by supporting ultrasound services in pregnancy care centers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe company, which is based in a D.C. suburb and sells its coffee online, donates 10% of each sale to various pro-life pregnancy centers. \nKrecic said that since the charitable donations are calculated from the selling price, not from profit, customers can be sure $1.69 of each $16.99 purchase goes directly to pro-life causes.\u00a0\n\u201cWe like to say it\u2019s leading with our tithe, giving first,\u201d Krecic said. \u201cIt\u2019s as transparent as it gets. I like to say we just move the decimal place over one spot.\u201d\u00a0\nKrecic said he has always loved coffee and always supported the pro-life movement, so he decided to combine his two passions. He also saw an opening in the coffee market for alternatives to companies such as Starbucks, which donates to Planned Parenthood through its matching gift program.\n\u201cThere was more of a need than I saw, because where you buy your products is very important. Especially either as Christians or as conservatives, it\u2019s really hard to buy products from companies that align with our values,\u201d he said, noting:\nOne of the things I like to say is we\u2019re not asking for a donation. We\u2019re saying, if you drink coffee, but would consider drinking it through us, we\u2019re going to have a really big impact in defending life and protecting the unborn.\nAnton Krecic started Seven Week Coffee as a way to support pro-life centers while delivering ethically sourced, top-quality coffee from Ethiopia. (Photo: Anton Krecic)\n\nSeven Weeks Coffee has donated to resource centers such as the Cleveland Pregnancy Center; Mosaic Virginia,\u00a0an abortion clinic alternative; and Vans For Life, which provides mobile pregnancy help centers outside of abortion facilities. \nKrecic said he drew inspiration for his company from visiting a pregnancy center and seeing its mission firsthand.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re the hands and feet of the pro-life movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really the ones that are helping women, in really difficult circumstances, to choose life for their child and share with them the Gospel and also some practical resources to help them through pregnancy.\u201d\nKrecic said, in addition to the pro-life mission, a huge focus of Seven Weeks Coffee is the coffee itself. After learning about low wages for farmers, untraceable sourcing, and pesticides in the coffee industry, he searched for ethically sourced, top-quality beans.\u00a0\n\u201cWe partnered with a faith-based coffee roaster who sources their coffee through direct trade. This means they have a direct relationship with the people who are farming and processing the coffee,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s from Ethiopia, which is the home of coffee. It\u2019s where coffee was originally found.\u201d\nIn Krecic\u2019s view, Seven Weeks Coffee can be a role model for the coffee industry.\n\u201cNo pesticides, no coffee plantations, no big commercial farming equipment. So, it\u2019s as clean and as natural as it gets,\u201d he said, adding:\nFrom farm to cup, we\u2019re transforming the coffee industry by uplifting people well before profits\u2014from the farmers who are growing our coffee to, ultimately, the pregnancy care centers we get to support.\nHave an opinion about this article?
