The prohibition is meant to preserve personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, that is in short supply nationwide and to free up bed space as hospitals prepare for a possible surge in COVID-19 patients.\nBut abortion providers have accused state officials of exploiting \u201ca public heath crisis to advance an extreme, anti-abortion agenda\u201d and argued the procedure does not usually require hospitalization nor extensive protective gear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 22, Gov. Greg Abbott barred medical procedures that are not \u201cimmediately medically necessary,\u201d and Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly said the gubernatorial order applies to abortions, except when one is needed to protect the woman\u2019s life or health.\nThe order, which extends through April 21 but can be modified, exempts procedures that would not deplete protective gear or eat up hospital resources needed to cope with the pandemic.\nLawyers for Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lawyering Project sued state officials on behalf of abortion providers March 25, kicking off a weekslong court fight that has pingponged twice between a federal district judge in Austin and the politically conservative appeals court before landing at the Supreme Court this week.\nU.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel first blocked the state\u2019s order, arguing that it \u201cprevents Texas women from exercising what the Supreme Court has declared is their fundamental constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is viable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe later issued a more narrow ruling allowing abortion providers to offer medication-induced abortions \u2014 which are provided in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 that do not consume the scarce protective equipment, he said. The state, represented by Paxton, argued in court filings that medication abortions may require personal protective equipment during initial doctors\u2019 visits and in the small percentage of cases that result in trips to the emergency room.\n\u201cRespondents claim that medication abortion consumes little PPE, but, again, all PPE is valuable at this time,\u201d a state filing said.\nYeakel, appointed to the bench by former President George W. Bush, also made an exception for patients who would pass the legal limit for an abortion \u2014 22 weeks after their last menstrual cycle \u2014 by April 22, when the gubernatorial order lapses.\nPreviously, the appeals court twice largely upheld the state\u2019s restrictions, saying the order is a \u201cvalid public health measure\u201d that does not single out abortions. Constitutional rights, including those to peaceably assemble, publicly worship and have an abortion, can be \u201creasonably restricted\u201d during a public health crisis, the judges said \u2014 adding that the order is best understood as a \u201ctemporary postponement\u201d and not an \u201cabsolute ban.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge James Dennis, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, dissented. Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Kyle Duncan, nominated by Bush and President Donald Trump, respectively, were in the majority.\nIn a weekend filing to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the abortion providers had asked that pill-induced abortions be allowed to continue as the case proceeds.\nCasting the state\u2019s near-total ban as \u201cthe most restrictive abortion policy in the nation,\u201d the lawyers said it would \u201ccontinue to deny hundreds of Texas residents their constitutional right to obtain an abortion,\u201d forcing patients to \u201ceither remain pregnant and endure the physical, economic, and emotional consequences of pregnancy or to undertake risky and expensive travel to other states where abortion is still available.\u201d\nDoing so could increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission, the filing said, and more personal protective equipment and hospital resources would be needed for patients having an abortion later in their pregnancy or giving birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas decision comes as other states, like Alabama and Oklahoma, have waged similar legal battles over whether temporary restrictions on nonessential medical procedures apply to abortions.\nThe legal wrangling in Texas has thrown abortion providers into a state of uncertainty as the procedure flipped from permissible to illegal in most cases and back again in a matter of days.\nPatients have been turned away from Texas clinics and sought abortions out of state, according to the lawyers and media reports. One woman who spoke to The Texas Tribune said she was planning to drive to New Mexico to get an abortion but was able to get oral medication to end her pregnancy from an Austin clinic in the midst of the legal whiplash.\nEmma Platoff contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
