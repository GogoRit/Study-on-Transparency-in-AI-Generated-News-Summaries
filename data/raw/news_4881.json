WadeJosh Salman Kevin McCoyUSA TODAYWhile a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett was among hundreds who signed an anti-abortion letter that accompanied\u00a0a January 2006 newspaper\u00a0ad calling for\u00a0\"an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.\"The two-page advertisement was placed in the South Bend Tribune by the Indiana anti-abortion group St. Joseph County Right to Life. On one page, Barrett and her husband Jesse's names appear under the message, \"We, the following citizens ... oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death.\"On the next page, the anti-abortion group attacked the 1973\u00a0Supreme Court ruling that it said, \"legalized abortion for any reason\" and allowed late-term abortions, which it referred to as \"the brutal partial-birth abortion procedure.\"Barrett, who met with senators at the\u00a0Capitol on Thursday,\u00a0declined to respond to\u00a0questions about the ad. The existence of the ad\u00a0was first revealed by The Guardian.\u00a0Experts say it\u2019s not surprising that she opposes abortion,\u00a0given her religious beliefs and conservative tutelage. She's viewed as an acolyte to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked.But the appearance of Barrett's name next to a\u00a0call to overturn Roe v. Wade is likely to\u00a0increase scrutiny of her nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to begin confirmation hearings\u00a0Oct. 12.Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said the ad, Barrett's comments on precedent and her record on the bench\u00a0\"raise serious concerns about whether she would uphold the law.\"The Republican-led committee did not comment on the\u00a0ad,\u00a0pointing instead to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham's comments after meeting with Barrett on Tuesday.\"I think the American people are going to see over the coming days someone who is very capable of understanding the difference between personal beliefs \u2013\u00a0whatever they may have, we all have personal beliefs \u2013 and that of being a judge,\" Graham said.\u00a0Appointment would create 6-3 conservative majorityIf the 48-year-old is confirmed, conservatives would lock in a 6-3 majority, probably for\u00a0years to come.During Tuesday night's presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden said abortion rights are on the ballot.\u00a0Jumping in, President Donald Trump said: \"You don't know her (Barrett's) view on Roe v. Wade.\"Experts predict a more conservative Supreme Court would not immediately overturn Roe v. Wade because\u00a0the cases before them would be more narrowly targeted and justices\u00a0wouldn't want to shift so quickly from precedent.Instead, abortion-rights groups believe Barrett\u2019s appointment would allow justices to effectively secure the same end by upholding\u00a0state abortion restrictions.At an event held just before the 2016 presidential election, Barrett said she expects\u00a0a conservative court could\u00a0address abortion regulations, but not the right to abortion itself.\u00a0\"I don't think that abortion or the right to abortion would change.\u00a0I think some of the restrictions would change,\" Barrett said\u00a0at an event sponsored by Jacksonville University's Public Policy Institute.\u00a0\"I think the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion.\"She\u00a0referred\u00a0to a June 2016 ruling in which the court voted 5-3,\u00a0without Scalia, to strike down restrictions on Texas doctors and clinics that provide\u00a0abortions.\u00a0\"The court has held in some circumstances the states can render partial-birth abortions illegal \u2013 very late-term abortions,\" Barrett said during the Jacksonville University event. \"I think that's the kind of thing that could change. ... Whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions could be put on clinics, I think that would change.\"That's what abortion rights advocates fear.\u201cThe court will kill Roe v. Wade slowly by 1,000 cuts,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University\u00a0who specializes in public health. \u201cAny state law that puts restrictions on abortion, other than a complete ban, has a good chance of being upheld by the Supreme Court.\u201dA conservative shift will have disproportionate impacts on women who are poor, lack access to health care, or live in rural communities. Women who are more financially secure may be more able to commute to another state with fewer restrictions, Gostin said.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a lot the court can do to make it virtually impossible for poor women in red states to get an abortion,\u201d he said.\u00a0Most recently, the court struck down a Louisiana law that required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The justices agreed to hear the case after a federal appeals court had upheld the law \u2013\u00a0despite a Supreme Court ruling in 2016 striking down a similar Texas law as an undue burden on women seeking abortions.This time, anti-abortion forces expected a different result. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to strike down the Texas law, had retired. His successor was Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who had\u00a0praised\u00a0Chief Justice William Rehnquist's dissent in Roe v. Wade. As a federal appeals court judge, Kavanaugh\u00a0had dissented from a\u00a0decision in 2017 allowing an\u00a0undocumented teenager in government custody\u00a0to get an abortion.\u00a0But in the end, Chief Justice John Roberts switched sides and voted with liberals to strike down the Louisiana law. Kavanaugh would have let it stand.Ruling invalidated Texas restrictions:Supreme Court strikes down abortion restrictionsSteve Aden, chief legal officer for Americans United for Life, called Roe v. Wade \u201cexample A for rampant judicial activism.\u201d His organization was among the first anti-abortion groups to support Barrett.\u201cThat compass needle in this instance points to a judge like Amy Barrett,\u201d Aden said.Barrett has said court is unlikely to outlaw abortionSimilar anti-abortion ads were placed in the South Bend Tribune\u00a0at least 11 times from 1992 through 2019. Some spanned multiple pages\u00a0and included anti-abortion images and language. Of those 11 ads, Barrett and her husband's names appeared only in 2006, according to an online search of the paper's archives.A former member of the University of Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cFaculty for Life,\u201d\u00a0Barrett signed a\u00a02015 letter\u00a0to Catholic bishops that affirmed the \u201cteachings of the Church as truth.\u201d Among those teachings: the \u201cvalue of human life from conception to natural death\u201d and marriage-family values\u00a0\u201cfounded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman.\u201dIn a 2013 speech at Notre Dame on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Barrett said the ruling \"essentially permitted abortion on demand.\" But she declared it \"very unlikely\" the Supreme Court ever would overturn its core protection of abortion rights, according to coverage of her remarks in university publications.\"The fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand,\" Barrett was quoted as saying in the student newspaper The Observer. \"The controversy right now is about funding. It's a question of abortions will be publicly or privately funded.\"Beyond abortion, liberals are most concerned about Barrett's impact on health care, specifically the\u00a0Affordable Care Act. The law will come before the court again in November, with Texas leading a group of states seeking to strike it down. If confirmed by the Senate before Election Day, Barrett could be on the bench to hear that case a week later.About 25 former classmates and law students roundly praised\u00a0Barrett's legal mind and dismissed\u00a0questions about whether her personal beliefs will affect her jurisprudence.\"Her personal beliefs will have no bearing,\u201d Raymond Tittmann, a California attorney who attended Notre Dame Law School with Barrett, said in an email.But it's not unanimous.\"Judge Barrett is unfit for the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013\u00a0not because of her faith beliefs, which I share, but because of her mantle of being a so-called Constitutional \u201coriginalist,\" Kathleen Ley Bruinsma, who also attended law school with Barrett, told USA TODAY in an email.\"This will be disastrous for women,\"\u00a0Bruinsma said. \"Those of us who attended law school with Judge Barrett know from her comments in class and her leadership of Notre Dame\u2019s law students against abortion chapter that, if given the chance, she would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.\"Contributing: Richard Wolf, Christal HayesFeatured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
