'Why would you force \u2014 and it is force \u2014 pregnancy, why wouldn\u2019t you allow termination?' Melissa BrownNashville TennesseanTennessee lawmakers are debating whether to add exceptions to the state's strict abortion ban.Anti-abortion advocates, including Tennessee Right to Life, oppose the changes.Editor's note: This story was originally published March 2 for subscribers only.

Wade decision. But even there, doctors can legally perform abortions for certain medical emergencies.\"The state has chosen zero lives over one life right now, in the cases where we know the baby won\u2019t survive,\u201d DeRoche said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a pro-life position. But that\u2019s what the state is doing with these lives.\u201dTennessee is one of only three anti-abortion states without legal exceptions to protect a patient\u2019s life. Six months in to the total abortion ban, state lawmakers are now deep into negotiations over adding certain medical exceptions to the law.\u00a0Exception push in legislatureThe exceptions push has shown momentum in the House, where Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, has openly backed the effort and provided cover for members of his Republican caucus supportive of changes.\u00a0But the effort faces an uphill battle in the Senate amid an opposition campaign from Tennessee Right to Life and reticence from Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, to add changes to the law.\u00a0Gov. Bill Lee, a fellow Republican, also says he's comfortable with the current law, which provides an affirmative defense for doctors who might be charged for abortions performed to save a patient's life.The bill with the most momentum rose from the House, where Sexton publicly chastised Right to Life\u2019s lobbyist in an early committee meeting over what some saw as \u201cpolitical threats\u201d to lawmakers\u2019 anti-abortion bona fides.\u00a0The Senate version, SB 745, was supposed to be heard in the crucial Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday but sponsor Sen. Richard Briggs, R-Knoxville, delayed it for two weeks amid rumblings it didn\u2019t yet have the votes to advance.Briggs, a physician, has been among the most outspoken of his colleagues about the critical implications of the state\u2019s current law, pushing Right to Life to disendorse him last fall.\u00a0The Senate delay has also slowed HB 833, which was delayed in a full House Health committee on Wednesday despite overwhelming, bipartisan support at its initial subcommittee hearing last month. Democrats have called the narrow legal exceptions outline in the bill the \"minimum\" action needed on the issue but have pledged to support the Republican-sponsored bill.Related legislation:Tennessee bill to add rape, incest exceptions to abortion ban faltersIn email blasts in recent weeks, Right to Life has urged its supporters to actively oppose the exceptions bill through emails and calls to lawmakers.\u00a0\"The current law has been in effect for nearly six months and is working as the legislature intended,\u201d Tennessee Right to Life said in a statement. \"An estimated 900 unborn children are being saved each month from abortion in our state and no doctors have been charged for saving a woman\u2019s life. This law should be allowed to remain strong in order to save our most vulnerable citizens.\"Trying to avoid 'catastrophe'Dr. Laura Andreson, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Franklin, didn\u2019t consider herself particularly politically active until last year, when she began speaking out about the potential implications of limited abortion access on women\u2019s health care and her job, which treats high-risk patients and pregnancies.\u00a0She\u2019s since joined a coalition of physicians lobbying lawmakers for changes, traveling to Nashville when she\u2019s not on call and trying to learn the ropes of legislative politics while juggling her caseload.\u00a0\u2018When it's your person that's in the ER for 10 hours waiting for the lawyers to decide if they can treat an ectopic pregnancy, it's a very different situation than when you're sitting up here talking about it in a committee hearing,\u201d Andreson said.Andreson outlined the case of a recent patient diagnosed with cervical insufficiency. Before Tennessee\u2019s ban, Andreson would have presented the options to her patient, which included pregnancy termination or stitching the cervix, which has risks of infection and other complications.\u00a0The cervical issue eventually led to the patient\u2019s amniotic fluid slowly leaking, a condition Andreson said presented a significant risk of bleeding or infection if care is delayed.\u00a0In depth:How Gov. Bill Lee's push for $100M in grants is putting pregnancy centers in the spotlight\u201cIt's not patient abandonment, but it feels like you're washing your hands (of the situation.) That's just a really ugly feeling because you're used to helping your patients through the hard times. You're not used to just saying, \u2018Okay, well, I hope things work out,\u2019\" Andreson said. \u201cAnd that's kind of where we're stuck right now.\"Another recent patient, who Andreson had seen through other previous pregnancies, began experiencing bleeding issues. She ultimately came in with what Andreson called an \"inevitable abortion,\" when irreversible symptoms will eventually result in a miscarriage, but the fetus still had a heartbeat.\"If we had just watched her bleed, she wouldn't have lived,\" Andreson said.Right to Life currently opposes proposed exceptions to the law as they would allow doctors to make \"subjective\" calls on what constitutes a medical emergency, lobbyist Will Brewer told a House subcommittee in February.\"The\u00a0Human\u00a0Life\u00a0Protection Act that was passed by\u00a0the\u00a0General Assembly in 2019 is\u00a0the\u00a0preferred language.\u00a0It protects\u00a0the\u00a0right\u00a0to\u00a0life\u00a0of\u00a0all unborn children in our state with\u00a0a\u00a0provision\u00a0for\u00a0those situations when\u00a0the\u00a0mother\u2019s\u00a0life\u00a0is in danger,\" Right to Life said. \"Although Tennessee\u00a0Right\u00a0to\u00a0Life\u00a0has made it clear that we would not oppose efforts\u00a0to\u00a0simply clarify language in\u00a0the\u00a0current law, HB 883 does much more than clarify.\"Some high-risk conditions will \"work themselves out,\" Brewer said, and anti-abortion advocates worry changes to the law would allow doctors to proactively terminate pregnancies for conditions that could be waited out to \"see how it goes.\"Doctors say this is a fundamental misunderstanding of how medical practice works, with Andreson arguing she needs the ability to prevent issues from developing into full-blown crises.\u00a0DeRoche compares the conflict to that of air traffic controllers. It isn't sound policy to wait until two planes are about to collide before taking action, DeRoche said, but instead to move them out of the way \"before there's a problem to prevent a catastrophe.\"\u00a0Would you criminalize air traffic controllers for moving a plane out of the way too early, DeRoche asks?\"If you think in those terms, you\u2019d say this is the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever heard,\" DeRoche said. \"We\u2019re trying to avoid that same catastrophe.\u201dIt\u2019s not a perfect metaphor when you have two or more lives at stake, DeRoche said, but doctors must be allowed to head off disaster when the mother\u2019s life is threatened.\"In pregnancy, it\u2019s the only branch of medicine where you can potentially have a second life come out of it, but it\u2019s not guaranteed,\u201d DeRoche said. \u201cThe only guaranteed life we have is mom's.\"'I'm not pro-abortion, I\u2019m pro-woman'Allie Phillips, a Clarksville resident, describes herself as an avowed abortion rights defender, but she never thought she'd seek an abortion herself. Phillips, who already has one daughter, began trying to conceive with her husband Bryan last fall.\u00a0The couple quickly became pregnant in November. Though they had some early concerns about the pregnancy due to Phillips\u2019 previous gastric bypass surgery, they excitedly told friends and family, found out they were having a daughter and chose a name, Miley Rose.\u00a0But a routine anatomy scan in mid-February led her doctor to refer her to a high-risk specialist, who delivered heartbreaking news after a follow-up scan. Miley Rose was measuring a month behind schedule. Her kidneys were undersized, her heart had developed only two chambers, and there were signs of a serious condition where the brain isn't correctly formed.\u201cWhen she started talking about her brain, I felt all the blood leave my face,\u201d Phillips said in an interview with The Tennessean. \u201cI felt my heart sink to the back of my chest. I was there physically, but I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience.\u201dIt\u2019s unlikely Phillips could carry to term and would be at risk for miscarriage and other complications for the remainder of her pregnancy. Were she to deliver at term, the baby was unlikely to survive or would live just a short time on hospice care.\u00a0These weren\u2019t options Phillips and her husband wanted for their family. Instead, Phillips plans to seek out-of-state abortion care next week, something she can\u2019t do in Tennessee. She\u2019s lucky to have family support to care for her older daughter, Phillips said, but it\u2019s still an immense financial cost on top of navigating the grief and depression of of losing the life they dreamed of for Miley. \u00a0On top of handling medical logistics, Phillips must also figure out how she might be able to transport Miley\u2019s remains home.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s extremely inhumane to force anybody out of their own home to have to seek healthcare. It\u2019s wrong on so many different levels,\u201d Phillips said.\u00a0Phillips has shared her news on social media, which led to an onslaught of support but also criticism that she should continue her pregnancy until a point of no return, a risk she doesn't want to take with a daughter to care for at home.\u201cI have a daughter here. I can get pregnant again \u2014 that\u2019s not saying Miley\u2019s life didn\u2019t matter, that we don\u2019t think she should live \u2014 but if there is a choice to be made in a moment like that, I have more to lose than the fetus does,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIn situations like mine, when there is no chance of viability, when there is zero chance of treatment, when it\u2019s not going to happen, why would you still say a woman should have to go through pregnancy? Why would you force \u2014 and it is force \u2014 pregnancy, why wouldn\u2019t you allow termination?\"There's an undercurrent of fear threaded through Tennessee's medical community at present as no one \"wants to be the first one they go after\" under the new law, DeRoche said.\u00a0At least one maternal fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Leilah Zahedi-Spung, has already left the state over fears of practicing medicine under the law.\"It makes me angry. It disgusts me. But it truly saddens me that for 20 years, I\u2019ve tried to get patients through their pregnancies,\" DeRoche said. \"I've spent my life delivering devastating news and trying to help people, regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy, get through the pregnancy.\"\"I'm not pro-abortion, I\u2019m pro-woman. I\u2019m talking about appropriate medical care and a bad law. These are bad laws.\"Though Right to Life points out that no doctor has been charged under the new law, DeRoche said this is cold comfort when doctors must knowingly choose to commit a felony to practice what they know to be good medicine.\"We\u2019re trying to get two lives out of there. When we can\u2019t, I\u2019d rather get one. And the state is telling me if I choose one, they could throw me in jail,\" DeRoche said. \"It can\u2019t be that bad of a law because no one has been charged yet? That is dangerous.\"Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
