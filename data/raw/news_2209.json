Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., are renewing their attempts to force taxpayers to fund elective abortions by attacking the Hyde Amendment.\nThe attack came on Tuesday during a\u00a0subcommittee hearing\u00a0of the powerful Appropriations Committee for the House of Representatives, titled \u201cThe Impact on Women Seeking an Abortion but Are Denied Because of an Inability to Pay,\u201d in which DeLauro, the incoming committee chair, expressed her intent to no longer incorporate the Hyde Amendment into annual appropriation bills.\nWhat is the\u00a0Hyde Amendment, and why does it matter? And importantly, what does the absence of the Hyde Amendment mean for taxpayers if congressional Democrats and the abortion lobby get their way?\nOne of the pro-life movement\u2019s first victories following the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions in 1973, which effectively legalized abortion on demand across the country, came about thanks to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in 1976. He championed an amendment to the annual Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies funding bill, which prohibited the department from expending taxpayer dollars for most abortions.\nSince then, similar language has been included in annual appropriation bills for the U.S. Department of\u00a0Health and Human Services and other departments, and was held constitutional by the Supreme Court in 1980.\nThis important guardrail has, for 44 years, ensured that taxpayer dollars do not pay for most abortions (the language includes an exception for rare instances of rape or incest, for example).\u00a0\nUnder its first iteration, the amendment applied to the Medicaid health program. Since then, the similar language has been incorporated to apply funding restrictions in other services and programs, including Medicare, TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nThe Hyde Amendment has saved an estimated\u00a02.4 million lives\u00a0since 1976. These lives aren\u2019t abstractions\u2014they\u2019re real people that we live and work alongside each day. They have gone on to have families and children of their own, faced trials and challenges, and achieved victories small and large in their homes and their communities.\nThese lives are more than a statistic. Each and every one of these 2.4 million individuals has immeasurable worth and dignity. The Hyde Amendment saved roughly\u00a060,000 lives\u00a0in 2019 alone, and about 30,000 through the first half of 2020.\nIf congressional Democrats have their way and the Hyde Amendment is no longer incorporated in annual appropriations bills\u2014which DeLauro and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have said will be the case\u2014thousands of unborn boys and girls will pay the price.\nThe only thing standing between the Hyde Amendment and pro-abortion members of Congress might be the Senate. However, the exact makeup of the Senate remains an open question.\u00a0\nIf pro-life policymakers hold the majority in the upper chamber, they will have an opportunity to reject calls to do away with the Hyde Amendment during spending negotiations, and they should do so unequivocally.\nThe Hyde Amendment is good policy as a matter of principle. It is also a\u00a0popular\u00a0policy, too. After all, 6 in 10 Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortion, including 42% of independents and one-third of Democrats.\nSo why the calls to do away with a popular, consensus policy? Three words: the abortion lobby.\nRadical and\u00a0well-funded\u00a0actors like Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and others have exerted increasing influence on the left in recent years. As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden even\u00a0reversed\u00a0his decades-long history of supporting the Hyde Amendment and abandoned his long-held position in light of the left\u2019s new abortion orthodoxy.\nCongressional policymakers must stand firm in the upcoming 117th Congress and reject all\u00a0attempts\u00a0to force American taxpayers to pay for elective abortions. And the pro-life movement should continue its good work supporting women facing unplanned pregnancies and difficult circumstances.\nAccording to a recent Charlotte Lozier Institute\u00a0report, last year roughly 2,700 pro-life pregnancy resource centers served 2 million people, provided 486,000 free ultrasounds, offered 291,000 clients parenting and prenatal education programs, and provided millions of supplies, such as diapers and clothing for babies.\nThe Hyde Amendment is a life-saving policy. Rather than repeal it, Congress should make it\u00a0permanent law\u00a0by enacting the\u00a0No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. Millions of fellow Americans are with us today thanks to the amendment\u2019s continued presence in federal funding bills.\nCongress must reject attempts to change course, and the pro-life movement must continue its efforts to provide women, children, and families with the tools and resources\u2014not abortion\u2014that they need to flourish and thrive.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
