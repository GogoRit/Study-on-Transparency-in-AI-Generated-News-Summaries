    "text": "\n\nUninsured Rate for People of Reproductive Age Ticked Up Between 2016 and 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninsured Rate for People of Reproductive Age Ticked Up Between 2016 and 2019\n\n\n\n\nYear\nJanuary 1, 2021\n\n\nAdam Sonfield, Guttmacher Institute\n\n\n\nAfter years of dramatic improvement under the\u00a0Affordable Care Act (ACA), the uninsured rate for people of reproductive age ticked upward under\u00a0destructive\u00a0Trump-era policies. Moreover, major disparities in\u00a0the uninsured\u00a0rates remain by income, race and ethnicity, and citizenship.\u00a0To improve the health of U.S. residents\u2014including\u00a0their\u00a0sexual and reproductive health\u2014the Biden-Harris administration, Congress and state policymakers must work together to pursue\u00a0additional\u00a0expansions to public and private insurance.\u00a0\nExpansions to health insurance coverage are\u00a0crucial\u00a0for sexual and reproductive health and rights.\u00a0Medicaid\u202fand\u202fprivate insurance\u202finclude strong coverage protections for family planning, maternity care, STI-related services, testing and treatment for reproductive cancers,\u00a0and many other key services commonly used by people in their reproductive years and beyond. In some states, these\u00a0protections also\u00a0include\u00a0abortion coverage: Although the\u00a0Hyde Amendment\u00a0and similar restrictions bar federal funding for abortion coverage,\u00a016 states\u00a0direct Medicaid to pay for all or most medically necessary abortions with state funds, and\u00a0six states\u00a0require abortion coverage in private health insurance plans.\u00a0\nProgress Has Stalled\nAccording to a\u00a0Guttmacher Institute\u00a0analysis of the most recent government data, 14% of people, or 21.5 million individuals,\u00a0in the United States\u00a0aged 15\u201349 were uninsured in 2019.\u00a0At first glance, that represents tremendous progress from\u00a0the\u00a022%\u00a0who were\u00a0uninsured in 2013; the progress was\u00a0driven by the ACA\u2019s\u00a0major expansions to Medicaid\u00a0and subsidized private insurance coverage. However,\u00a0this\u00a0progress stalled and reversed slightly under the Trump-Pence administration;\u00a0the uninsured rate\u00a0for\u00a0people of reproductive age\u00a0increased\u00a0by nearly a percentage point between 2016 and 2019 (see figure\u00a01).\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\nProgress has also halted since 2016 on\u00a0reducing\u00a0long-standing\u00a0disparities\u00a0in coverage.\u00a0In 2019, one in four people\u00a0aged 15\u201349 with family incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level\u00a0were uninsured, about twice the rate of higher-income people. Hispanic people aged 15\u201349\u00a0were\u00a0far more likely than White, Black or Asian people to be uninsured\u00a0(see\u00a0background tables). Similarly, immigrants aged 15\u201349 who\u00a0were\u00a0not citizens had three times the uninsured rate of U.S.-born people or naturalized citizens.\u00a0Furthermore, those inequities intersect,\u00a0magnifying\u00a0their harm: For example, 50% of low-income\u00a0noncitizens\u00a0aged 15\u201349 were uninsured in 2019, as were 37% of low-income Hispanic people\u00a0in that age-group.\u00a0\nImprovements in insurance coverage since 2013 are\u00a0connected\u00a0to the ACA\u2019s coverage expansions, particularly the major Medicaid expansion\u00a0that has been\u00a0adopted by\u00a038\u00a0states and the District of Columbia.\u00a0Collectively, the states that implemented the ACA\u2019s\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0expansion experienced steeper declines since 2013 and had\u00a0about\u00a0half the uninsured rate in 2019 (11% vs.\u00a020%) than\u00a0nonexpansion\u00a0states\u00a0(see figure 2).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDuring the Trump era, expansion states fared slightly better than\u00a0nonexpansion\u00a0states. Overall, 20 states showed statistically significant increases in their\u00a0uninsured rate between 2016 and 2019, and only\u00a0three\u00a0states had significant declines\u2014two of which, Louisiana and Virginia, expanded Medicaid during that time period\u00a0(see background tables).\u00a0\nHow to Close the Gaps\nMaking further progress on closing gaps in U.S. health insurance coverage will require action on two fronts. First, the Biden-Harris administration and Congress must\u00a0reverse\u00a0harmful Trump-era policies\u00a0(such as\u00a0Medicaid work requirements\u00a0and sweeping\u00a0exemptions to contraceptive coverage) and\u00a0address\u00a0the potential harm from a\u00a0looming U.S. Supreme Court decision on the ACA.\u00a0\u00a0\nSecond, federal and state policymakers must work toward\u00a0additional\u00a0expansions to public and private insurance. That\u00a0could\u00a0include\u00a0incremental improvements to the ACA and Medicaid, following the model of the\u00a0American Rescue Plan Act, which provided new incentives for holdout states to expand Medicaid, gave states authority to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months and expanded subsidies for ACA marketplace health plans. That could also include bolder policies, such as\u00a0one based on\u00a0President Biden\u2019s proposal\u00a0for a new public health insurance option or a single-payer solution such as\u00a0Medicare for All. Regardless of the approach, policymakers must ensure that all health insurance coverage upholds\u00a0core principles of sexual and reproductive health and rights\u00a0so that everyone can get the care they want and need.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe research in this article was conducted by\u202fAyana Douglas-Hall\u202fand\u00a0Mira\u00a0Tignor\u202fof the Guttmacher Institute, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey.\u00a0The\u00a0attached background tables\u00a0include additional\u00a0data\u00a0on insurance status by demographic group and by state for all people\u00a0aged 15\u201349, women\u00a0aged 15\u201349\u00a0and men\u00a0aged 15\u201349.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource URL: https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/04/uninsured-rate-people-reproductive-age-ticked-between-2016-and-2019\n\n\n"
