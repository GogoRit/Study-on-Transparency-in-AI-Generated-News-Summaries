(Otto Kitsinger for States Newsroom)\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana lawmakers scuttled proposals Wednesday to carve out more exceptions to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban this year, in spite of months of complaints from doctors and pregnant women that the law has unintended consequences.\nThe Louisiana House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice voted down two bills that would have allowed more people to legally terminate their pregnancies if they result from rape or incest. But three other pieces of legislation that deal with medical exemptions and penalties for doctors remain in play for lawmakers.\u00a0\nRep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, pushed off until next week a vote on her proposal, House Bill 522, that lessens criminal penalties for doctors who perform illegal abortions. Freeman said in an interview that she hopes she can make adjustments to the legislation that will make it more likely to pass.    \n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Reps. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, and Mary DuBuisson, R-Slidell, hope to get their bills that deal with medical exemptions to the abortion ban moved to another committee for consideration.\nNewell\u2019s\u00a0House Bill 598 would clarify that abortion is legal when a person is undergoing treatment for cancer, blood disorders and other medical challenges. DuBuisson\u2019s House Bill 461 also attempts to clear up when a person qualifies for a medical exemption to the abortion ban and lowers the barrier to getting permission for one.\u00a0\n\nThe criminal justice committee agreed to refer Newell\u2019s legislation to the House Health and Welfare Committee. DuBuisson said she is also trying to get her legislation reassigned to the health committee. \n \n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\nThe current legislative session presents the first opportunity for lawmakers to change Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban since it went into effect last year. Legislators had not convened a regular lawmaking session since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June.\u00a0\nAdvocates of loosening abortion restrictions faced an uphill battle, however. The Legislature is overwhelmingly conservative and opposed to abortion. Criminal justice committee members rejected bills to allow for rape and incest exceptions on 10-5 and 9-5 votes Wednesday, with all Republicans on the committee opposed.\n\nThose votes came after hours of gut-wrenching testimony from rape victims, incest victims and medical professionals on both sides of the issue.\n\u201cIf you are forcing survivors of rape and incest to carry a pregnancy, you are not supporting victims,\u201d said Katie Hunter-Lowry, a rape survivor who runs Louisiana Survivors for Reform.\n\u201cRape has always been used as an excuse to legalize abortion,\u201d said former Rep. Woody Jenkins, a Baton Rouge Republican testifying against the bills.\nOne of the sponsors of the legislation to provide rape and incest exceptions, Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, had a personal connection to the issue. Boyd said her mother was 15 years-old when she gave birth to Boyd after being raped by a 28 year-old man. Boyd\u2019s mother, who died before she was 30 years-old, never got over the event, she said.\n\u201cMy mother did not survive her trauma. It was overwhelming for her and she didn\u2019t have a choice in the 60s,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI didn\u2019t always understand, but I get it today.\u201d\nRep. Tony Bacala, R-Prairieville, had a different take on Boyd\u2019s story.\nBacala told Boyd that he was more inclined to vote against Boyd\u2019s legislation because he thought it was a blessing that a good person like Boyd was born and her mother wasn\u2019t given the option to terminate her pregnancy.    \n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\nThe rape and incest exceptions would do nothing to address another concern with the abortion ban however. Doctors have said the current law is interfering with their efforts to treat people who face complications with pregnancy because physicians and hospitals fear the criminal charges they might now face.\nThe law allows people to still have abortions if their life is threatened by pregnancy or they are in danger of damaging a \u201clife-sustaining\u201d organ. They can also terminate pregnancies if they are miscarrying or their fetus is diagnosed as being \u201cmedically nonviable\u201d by two doctors \u2014 meaning their pregnancy is expected to produce a baby that can\u2019t survive outside the womb.\nBut at least a couple of women have come forward in Louisiana to say they have had difficulty getting care after their pregnancies had failed. Baton Rouge resident Nancy Davis said she had to fly to New York to terminate a pregnancy after being told her fetus would never grow a skull and couldn\u2019t survive after birth. She said she couldn\u2019t find a Louisiana hospital to perform the abortion for her.\nAnti-abortion advocates have suggested the statute isn\u2019t the problem. Hospitals, doctors and their attorneys might be interpreting the law much more narrowly than it should, they said.\nSome medical professionals have also said its a barrier for rural hospitals and smaller medical clinics to find two doctors who can sign off the paperwork needed for a legal abortion due to medical complications.\nNewell and DuBuisson seek to address some of that confusion over medical exceptions through legislation.\nNewell wants to list more specific conditions \u2014 such as cancer and blood disorders \u2014 that would allow for an exception to the abortion ban in the statute. DuBuisson would allow just one doctor \u2014 instead of the two required now \u2014 to authorize the termination of a pregnancy because of miscarriage or another medical condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLouisiana lawmakers won\u2019t allow for rape, incest exceptions to abortion ban\nby Julie O'Donoghue, Louisiana Illuminator May 10, 2023\nLouisiana lawmakers won\u2019t allow for rape, incest exceptions to abortion ban\nby Julie O'Donoghue, Louisiana Illuminator May 10, 2023\n Louisiana lawmakers scuttled proposals Wednesday to carve out more exceptions to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban this year, in spite of months of complaints from doctors and pregnant women that the law has unintended consequences.\nThe Louisiana House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice voted down two bills that would have allowed more people to legally terminate their pregnancies if they result from rape or incest.
