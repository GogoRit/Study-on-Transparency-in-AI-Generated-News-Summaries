Eric Weddle/WFYI\r\n\tMore than 80 percent of Hoosiers believe an abortion ban should have at least some exceptions. And more than half say abortion should be legal in most cases.\n\r\n\tThose are results from the Indiana Public Broadcasting-Ball State Hoosier Survey.\n\r\n\tAbout 78 percent of those polled say abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest. And 62 percent say it should be legal if the fetus is likely to be born with severe disabilities or health problems.\n\r\n\tThose results remain strong even among Republicans. For cases of rape or incest, 67 percent of those who identified as Republican in the poll said abortion should be legal. And for disabilities or health problems, 47 percent of Republicans said abortion should be legal \u2013 still more than the 44 percent who believe it shouldn't.\n\r\n\tIndiana GOP lawmakers passed a ban this year that allows abortions only in some cases of rape or incest. And the law permits abortion if the fetus can\u2019t survive outside the womb.\n\nREAD MORE: Abortion stays legal in Indiana through end of 2022; state Supreme Court to hear challenge to ban\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\r\n\tSome conservatives want the state to restrict abortion further. But Bowen Center for Public Affairs Director Chad Kinsella said given these poll numbers, that\u2019s a tough sell.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt could be politically, a political landmine if \u2013 it\u2019s a big if, capital I-F \u2013 if they go that route,\u201d Kinsella said.\n\r\n\tAbortion is a key issue to many Hoosiers. 77 percent of people in the poll described it as extremely or somewhat important.\n\r\n\tAnd Kinsella noted that nearly half of those polled said they wouldn\u2019t vote for a candidate whose abortion views were different from theirs.\n\r\n\t\"So, it's a lot more intense than what I thought. People still drew a pretty hard line in the sand,\" Kinsella said. \"Those surprised me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nJoin the conversation and sign up for the Indiana Two-Way.

Republicans didn't dominate in many states the way many people expected. Even in Indiana, where the GOP won every statewide race by a comfortable margin, Republicans only gained one seat in the state Senate and lost a seat in the state House, while Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan (D-Highland) fended off a fierce challenge.\n\r\n\tKinsella said the intensity of the abortion issue, as reflected in the Hoosier Survey numbers, is likely a major reason why.\n\r\n\tThe Hoosier Survey polled 600 people in late October and early November. The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. The interviews were conducted by telephone (42 by landline and 257 by cell phone) and online.\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nContact reporter Brandon at\u00a0bsmith@ipbs.org or follow him on Twitter at @brandonjsmith5.\n\r\n\tCopyright 2022 IPB News.
