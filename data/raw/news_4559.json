Nationwide, states that ensure the right to abortion are preparing to help people from states that ban it.   Rich Pedroncelli/The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court decides in June, as expected, that all states can limit abortions to the earliest stages of pregnancy or ban the procedure altogether, hundreds of thousands of Americans are likely to start traveling to states where abortion remains legal. \nIn preparation, lawmakers in those states are considering bills that would remove hurdles such as waiting periods and parental notifications, and some are proposing to help low-income patients by paying for travel and other practical expenses that add to the true cost of abortion care. \nAbortion providers and rights advocates also are urging states to remove barriers both to telehealth and to medication abortion, expand Medicaid coverage of the procedure, ensure the privacy of patients, protect providers from potential lawsuits from other states and invest in training and facilities for abortion providers. They want to ensure adequate capacity for what likely will be a surge of abortion refugees in some parts of the country. \n\u201cIf lawmakers address barriers to abortion for people in need, who are most impacted by strict state abortion laws, they\u2019ll address barriers for everyone, no matter where they come from,\u201d said Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, which assists and advises state policymakers. \nNearly three-quarters of people receiving an abortion in the United States are living in poverty, according to 2014 data from abortion advocacy and research group the Guttmacher Institute.\nAnd in 2019, 38% of abortion patients were Black, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. But the percentage of people receiving an abortion who were Black was substantially higher in Mississippi (74%), Georgia (65%), Alabama (62%) and other Southern states with strict abortion bans. \nAbortion Patchwork\nIf the Supreme Court weakens or jettisons its 1973 abortion rights ruling, 26 states are expected to ban or severely restrict the procedure, according to Guttmacher. \nAbortion rights are considered protected for the long term in the District of Columbia and 15 states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, which enshrine the right to abortion in state law, according to Guttmacher.\nTwo other states may soon join that list. The Colorado legislature this month passed a bill that, once signed by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who supports the measure, would codify the right to abortion. And New Mexico, where an old abortion ban was repealed last year, is widely expected to be the next state to enshrine abortion rights in state law.\nLawmakers in many of those states already have experienced an influx of pregnant people from outside their borders over the past five years as a record number of GOP-led states enacted ever stricter abortion bans. Many blue states are considering new measures that would accommodate even greater demand for abortion in a post-Roe environment.\nBacked by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who last year signed a bill protecting the privacy of people who receive abortions, lawmakers in the state have proposed a dozen abortion bills this session designed to address racial and economic inequities in abortion access and boost the state\u2019s capacity to serve both residents and visitors as quickly as possible. \nLegislation also is moving through statehouses in more than a dozen other states that would make it easier for residents and people from out of state to receive an abortion. \n\u201cIn the past three years since 2019, we\u2019ve seen the most action to protect abortion rights and increase access that we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate at Guttmacher. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is blue states reacting to an onslaught of conservative state abortion bans and a solidly anti-abortion Supreme Court. This is a direct reaction to all of that.\u201d\nCalifornia Leads\nLast week, Newsom signed a bill that will require private insurers and the state\u2019s low-income Medicaid health plan to pay the full cost of abortion with no copays or deductibles. \nThe new law is one of a dozen bills proposed by California legislators this session aimed at supporting more equitable access to abortion care. \nThe package of bills, sponsored by the California Legislative Women\u2019s Caucus and other top legislative leaders, is based on 45 recommendations for expanding access to abortion for state residents and those living elsewhere outlined in a December report from an advisory council convened by the governor. \n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about being a refuge for anyone in the United States who wants to come to California,\u201d Assemblymember Cristina Garcia, who chairs the caucus, said in an interview with Stateline. \u201cBut the package of bills also aims to shore up access here in California and improve reproductive justice, making abortion accessible to our most marginalized community members.\u201d\nBeyond California, bills aimed at boosting access to abortion are under consideration in more than a dozen states, the largest number of proposals in any legislative period in history, Nash said. \u00a0\nWith roughly two months left before most legislative sessions adjourn, lawmakers are pushing hard in an election year to pass abortion access legislation. In addition to California\u2019s insurance coverage bill, Colorado\u2019s abortion rights bill and a New Jersey abortion rights bill signed in January by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, bills in three other states have been approved. \nMaryland\u2019s General Assembly this week passed an abortion protection bill, marking the first time in three decades the legislature approved a measure aimed at expanding abortion access statewide, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., wrote in a news release. \nThe bill, which is headed to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s desk, would ensure private insurance covers the procedure without cost-sharing, expand Medicaid coverage of the procedure, appropriate $3.5 million for medical professionals who want to train in abortion care and allow not just physicians but also advanced practice nurses and physician assistants to perform abortions. \nHogan has not said whether he will sign the bill, but it received strong support among Democratic lawmakers, who hold a veto-proof majority in the Maryland General Assembly. \nIn March, Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill prohibiting the state from taking legal action against people seeking an abortion and those who assist them, to ward off any attempts to enact a Texas-style abortion ban that calls on private citizens to sue anyone suspected of aiding an abortion. \nAnd the Oregon legislature\u00a0approved\u00a0 million in state funds to help abortion providers buy equipment and expand their workforce. The money also is slated to fund a hotline for patients seeking abortions in the state and to pay for travel and other expenses associated with an abortion. \nBoth the Washington and Oregon measures came in response to anticipated demand from people in Idaho seeking abortions after the Republican legislature passed a Texas-style abortion ban in March, prohibiting the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, before many patients know they\u2019re pregnant. \nLegal Protections\nCalifornia and Connecticut are the only states considering bills that would protect resident abortion providers from lawsuits filed by officials in other states where abortion is illegal.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big gap that other states need to fill,\u201d David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University School of Law, said in an interview. In a soon-to-be-published paper, he outlines the risks to abortion providers and the steps states can take to protect them.\nTo protect patients, providers and anyone who assists them, Cohen suggests, states should enact laws that block law enforcement agencies from cooperating with civil or criminal out-of-state investigations related to the legal provision of abortion in their states. \nHe and his co-authors Greer Donley\u00a0and\u00a0Rachel Rebouch\u00e9 also suggest that \u201cstates where abortion remains legal can instruct their medical boards and in-state malpractice insurance companies to abstain from taking any adverse action against providers who give out-of-state patients abortions that are legal in the provider\u2019s state.\u201d\nCohen pointed to a provision in a bill proposed this year in Missouri that would make it illegal for a Missouri resident to seek an abortion in another state. He said Missouri is not likely to be the last state to try to do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColoradoIllinoisMarylandOregonUnited StatesWashington \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXBlue States Enact New Laws to Create Abortion Havens\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline April 1, 2022\nBlue States Enact New Laws to Create Abortion Havens\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline April 1, 2022\n If the U.S. Supreme Court decides in June, as expected, that all states can limit abortions to the earliest stages of pregnancy or ban the procedure altogether, hundreds of thousands of Americans are likely to start traveling to states where abortion remains legal. \nIn preparation, lawmakers in those states are considering bills that would remove hurdles such as waiting periods and parental notifications, and some are proposing to help low-income patients by paying for travel and other practical expenses that add to the true cost of abortion care. \nAbortion providers and rights advocates also are urging states to remove barriers both to telehealth and to medication abortion, expand Medicaid coverage of the procedure, ensure the privacy of patients, protect providers from potential lawsuits from other states and invest in training and facilities for abortion providers.
