(AP) \u2014 The Florida Senate on Monday approved a bill to ban abortions after six weeks, a measure supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis as the Republican prepares to launch his expected presidential candidacy.The vote prompted demonstrations at the state\u2019s capital that resulted in the arrest of the leader of the Florida Democratic Party and a state senator by city police.The proposal must still be approved by the House before it reaches the governor\u2019s desk. Florida currently prohibits abortions after 15 weeks.A six-week ban would more closely align Florida with the abortion restrictions of other Republican-controlled states and give DeSantis a political win on an issue important with GOP primary voters ahead of his potential White House run.Florida Democrats and groups advocating for abortion rights say this proposal disproportionally affects low-income women and people of color. \n\nThe party said that Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, and Lauren Book, Florida\u2019s senate minority leader, were arrested late Monday at a sit-in protest outside the Florida State Capitol. Images shared on social media showed the two women and other demonstrators as they are handcuffed by police officers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA Tour stays in Florida.

They did not identify them by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill would have larger implications for abortion access throughout the South, as the nearby states of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi prohibit the procedure at all stages of pregnancy and Georgia bans it after cardiac activity can be detected, which is around six weeks. \u201cBodily autonomy should not give a person the permission to kill an innocent human being. We live in a time where the consequences of our actions are an afterthought and convenience has been substitution for responsibility, and this is unacceptable when it comes to the protection of the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican who sponsored the bill. \n\nThe proposal allows exceptions to save the life of the woman and exceptions in the case of pregnancy caused by rape or incest until 15 weeks of pregnancy. In those cases, a woman would have to provide documentation such as a medical record, restraining order or police report. DeSantis has called the rape and incest provisions sensible. It would require that the drugs used in medication-induced abortions \u2014 which make up the majority of those provided nationally \u2014 could be dispensed only in person by a physician.The new bill would only take effect if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court. Republicans control a supermajority in the Legislature and have largely focused on DeSantis priorities during the ongoing legislative session. DeSantis is expected to announce his presidential candidacy after the session ends in May, with his potential White House run in part buoyed by the conservative policies approved in the statehouse this year.\n\nDemocrats have conceded that they cannot stop the proposal from moving forward. During debate earlier on Monday, Democratic Sen. Book urged women to contact her office directly, reading her phone number aloud on the Senate floor, if they are considering getting an abortion and need to connect with healthcare providers. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take matters into your own hands. Do not put your safety at risk. No back-alley abortions. There are people and funds that will help you. No matter where you live, no matter how desperate of a situation you are in, no matter how helpless it may seem. I promise, you are not alone. Call my office,\u201d Book said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
