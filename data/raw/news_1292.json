GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT / AFP   The law is one thing, but putting it into effect is another. At the end of November, the French Assembl\u00e9e Nationale will host new debates on whether or not to include abortion rights in the Constitution. But health professionals who perform abortions know one thing: voting for a law doesn't automatically guarantee its implementation. This is made clear by the uneven rollout of the latest legislative change dealing with abortion in France, the Gaillot Law, which extended the legal deadline for abortion by 15 days, from 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy.  Eight months after its adoption on March 2, \"there are still places in France where women aren't taken care of beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy, and are redirected to centers that apply the law,\" stated doctor Laura Marin Marin, spokeswoman for l\u2019Association Nationale des Centres d\u2019IVG et de Contraception (ANCIC), a coalition of health professionals performing abortions.  Read more Subscribers only The unsung hero of the trial that decriminalized abortion in France    ANCIC has branches in many parts of the country, and the feedback on care of women who wish to have late abortions varies, shedding light on the wider difficulties of access that women encounter. \"Sometimes, they're not properly informed about the extension of the time limit, including by health professionals who aren't necessarily aware of this legislative change,\" said Dr. Marin Marin. New instrumental medical procedures During the lively debates that preceded the adoption of the law, the health professionals who opposed the bill criticized the new instrumental medical procedures that abortion requires after a certain amount of time. \"Some of those who were against it gave mainly technical reasons, which were quite shocking, to explain their reluctance,\" said Dr. Marin Marin. \"However, it has long been possible in our country to terminate pregnancies up to term, within the framework of medical abortions. Moreover, abortions at 14 weeks or more are practiced without risk in neighboring countries such as the Netherlands or Spain.\"  From 13 weeks of pregnancy, \"a simple aspiration may not be enough, depending on the size of the embryo. Forceps are often needed to remove the remains from the uterus,\" said Doctor Philippe Faucher, who is nevertheless in favor of lengthening the legal deadline. \"I can understand that some people refuse to do it, even if it raises ethical questions when you work in a public hospital, and that this same argument was used during the previous extension of the deadline, in 2001, which didn't involve any new procedure,\" observed the gynecologist-obstetrician and president of R\u00e9seau Entre la Ville et l\u2019H\u00f4pital pour l\u2019Orthog\u00e9nie (REVHO). \"But what is needed then is a quick referral to an abortion center that is willing to take them on.\" According to REVHO, within a network of doctors in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, only 21 centers out of 63 perform abortions between 12 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. And 19 out of 40 centers do so in Occitania. You have 59.16% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.                Lecture du Monde en cours sur un autre appareil.
