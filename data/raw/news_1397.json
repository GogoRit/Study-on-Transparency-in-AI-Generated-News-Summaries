Data for other states shows their status as of Sept. 13.\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\n\n\tAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to end a constitutional right to an abortion, many states have moved to bar the procedure earlier in pregnancy or to ban it outright, though several of the strictest bans remain tied up in court. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced legislation for a federal 15-week ban on Tuesday, though the bill is considered unlikely to pass in the current Congress.\n\n\n\tUnder the standard set by Roe v. Wade and later reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey \u2014 both of which the Supreme Court overturned in June \u2014 abortions were protected until a fetus was viable, usually at 22 to 24 weeks gestation. About half of states still follow that standard.\n\n\n\tThe overwhelming majority of abortions in the United States occur in the first trimester, but 36,000 abortions occurred after 14 weeks of gestation in 2019, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation\u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
