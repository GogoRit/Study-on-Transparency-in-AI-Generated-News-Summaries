(Dana Wormald | New Hampshire Bulletin)\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the New Hampshire Bulletin published a story by senior reporter Annmarie Timmins about the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban and the absence of an exception in the event of a \u201cfatal fetal diagnosis.\u201d Timmins talked with three women who were forced to make the \u201cimpossible decision\u201d to terminate a pregnancy they very much wanted because the fetus was nonviable. Their stories are deeply personal, heartbreaking, and so very important. I sat down with Annmarie this week to talk about how the story came about, how she approached it, and how it affected her. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nYou\u2019ve written several stories about the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban. This one focuses on the ban\u2019s lack of an exception for a fatal fetal diagnosis. What interested you about that?\nHaving covered the issue of abortion for so long in this state, first I thought it was interesting that this new law was really gaining traction in the State House, and it looked like it was going to pass, and then it did in an unusual way: It was tucked into the budget. So I think what first interested me was the legislative fight. We have a state that\u2019s rejected attempts in the past to restrict abortion in any way. We have a parental notification law, whereby minors must tell their parents or get a judicial bypass if they feel they can\u2019t go to a parent. And there was a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions more recently. But typically these efforts come up and they fail.\nI think if the 24-week ban bill had had to stand on its own, it would have been harder to get through. There would have been more opposition to it than there was by putting it in the budget. We knew the governor wasn\u2019t going to reject the whole budget over this one bill, so it seemed it was clearly going to become law.\nOnce that was obvious, I think the next focus was what does this bill mean for women? And the focus for the choice community was that there was going to be this required ultrasound for all abortions. And the medical community really pushed back on this, too, because they felt like lawmakers who have no medical experience were deciding how medicine should be done.\u00a0\nI think fatal fetal diagnosis is such a clinical term, and it\u2019s not an exception in this case. I wanted to better understand what that meant because it\u2019s not been described in human terms in the legislative debate. And I think people maybe don\u2019t understand what that really means. There\u2019s still a misunderstanding for some lawmakers and others in this debate that an abortion at 24 weeks is elective, that you can wake up and decide you don\u2019t want to be pregnant anymore, and then go get an abortion. That does not happen anywhere in the country, best I can tell. It\u2019s not possible in New Hampshire. So I thought it was important people understand what this would mean for women who don\u2019t have the option anymore.\nWhat were the challenges of writing this particular story?\nOne was just getting my head around the science of a fatal fetal diagnosis. What does that include? And there was some discussion on this in the legislative debate \u2013 that this was discovering that your baby has Down syndrome or has a disability of some sort and deciding you don\u2019t want to raise a baby with those challenges. And that\u2019s not what it is. It\u2019s a fetus that is not going to survive after being delivered or die within days of being delivered. The challenge was explaining that in a human way.\u00a0\nSo the challenge, of course, was finding women who could speak to this issue from personal experience, about something that\u2019s so private that they, in many cases, have not shared it with family members, and then to do so in this political climate. So it took a while to find women willing to speak about this. I had for weeks been asking abortion rights advocates and advocacy groups to connect me with women. Then the Reproductive Freedom Fund of New Hampshire let me know they had three women who would talk to me, and so that made all the difference.\nYou went into this knowing you were going to hear these incredibly personal, painful stories. How did you approach the conversations?\nFirst, I let them know who I was, having been a reporter in the state for 25 years, and then I explained what the New Hampshire Bulletin was. And then I asked them if they had any questions for me before we started. What were they nervous about? Did they have questions about how reporting works? And they did have a lot of questions. So before we even started, before I asked them to agree to an interview, I wanted to lay that groundwork and raise for them the possibility that there could be a response to these stories that might be uncomfortable. And then, from there, once they felt comfortable talking to me, I said to begin wherever you want to begin. It\u2019s your story.\u00a0\nWe stopped along the way when it became emotional. I encouraged them to take their time. It was very hard to hear these stories because these are women who continue to keep that baby as a part of their life. They celebrate their birthdays. They have told their other children about this person who they see as a sibling. They have their photos. They have imprints of their feet and handprints on their walls. They remain a real part of their story. So it truly was the loss of a child and a brother or sister, and that was very hard for them to talk about even 20 years later. And so that really stuck with me.\u00a0\nI haven\u2019t cried during an interview in probably 20 years. It was very hard. I had to take a moment to sort of collect my thoughts, and I let them know that I was grateful to them for sharing this experience. And it was hard to hear because their pain was so obvious to me. So that was a challenge in these stories.\u00a0\nAnd the other thing I did that I don\u2019t normally do is I sent their part of the story back to them. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to be surprised by anything. I want you to check and make sure I have everything correct. Is the timing correct, where you went for care correct? Every piece of it.\u2019 We don\u2019t usually do that because we don\u2019t give people a second chance to backpedal on a comment if they\u2019re a government official or think twice about being honest about something. But this felt different, and I\u2019m glad that I did that. I think it helped with their comfort level and the trust between us, too.\nThe stories they told are very powerful. The way you presented their stories is very powerful. And I wonder, when it comes to policy, how important do you think it is for people to tell these kinds of stories?\nI think it\u2019s everything. If you sit through Senate committee debates or House committee debates \u2013 I mean they have 900 bills a year and there\u2019s a public hearing on every single one. The testimony from the regulars, so to speak, the lobbyists, they just don\u2019t have the impact that real people\u2019s stories do because lawmakers know what to expect to hear from this lobbyist or this organization. It\u2019s important testimony, and it\u2019s useful to them, but it doesn\u2019t hit them emotionally.\u00a0\nSo the stories from real people are what gets people\u2019s attention \u2013 and helps them understand what their decision means for real people. Nothing can replace that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXEditor\u2019s Notebook: The story about the stories \u2013 a conversation with Annmarie Timmins\nby Dana Wormald, New Hampshire Bulletin February 16, 2022\nEditor\u2019s Notebook: The story about the stories \u2013 a conversation with Annmarie Timmins\nby Dana Wormald, New Hampshire Bulletin February 16, 2022\n Last week, the New Hampshire Bulletin published a story by senior reporter Annmarie Timmins about the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban and the absence of an exception in the event of a \u201cfatal fetal diagnosis.\u201d Timmins talked with three women who were forced to make the \u201cimpossible decision\u201d to terminate a pregnancy they very much wanted because the fetus was nonviable.
