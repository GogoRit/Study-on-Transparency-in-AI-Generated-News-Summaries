Utah lawmakers once again will consider a proposal to make the state's abortion laws even stricter, this time including a measure subjecting a woman to possible criminal prosecution for not being truthful about watching a state-produced video from start to finish.By Bethany Rodgers\u00a0\u00a0| Jan. 28, 2021, 1:00 p.m. | Updated: 2:57 p.m.A bill now before the state Legislature would compel Utah women seeking an abortion to watch an online course displaying \u201cmedically-accurate\u201d images of the procedure and then attest under penalty of perjury that they\u2019ve viewed the presentation from start to finish.Completing this online module is already a mandatory step before an abortion in Utah \u2014 although right-wing advocates argue the current informed process is too porous and believe women might be skimming over or skipping the course. But abortion rights groups see these new proposed restrictions as yet another episode in a long campaign to block access to pregnancy-ending procedures in Utah.This bill\u2019s tactic, says Karrie Galloway of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, seems to be \u201ca shaming of women: \u2019You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, let me educate you. Let me educate you again and again and try it a different way so that you will change your mind.\u2019\u201dInformed consentRep. Steve Christiansen, the sponsor of HB253, said his only goal is to make sure women are fully informed before terminating a pregnancy.\u201cFor some reason, when it comes to abortion, there are some who want to push back when we try to ensure the woman receives relevant and complete information about what is about to happen,\u201d he said in a Wednesday interview. \u201cWe would never push back regarding other medical procedures that could have the same or similar types of consequences on a person\u2019s life and health.\u201dHowever, Rep. Rosemary Lesser, a freshman legislator who recently retired after decades practicing as an OB-GYN, said she\u2019s never seen an informed consent form that warns patients against committing perjury.\u201cI have counseled thousands of women through the years, and I never recall that verbiage on an operative consent form,\u201d said the Ogden Democrat, who said she\u2019s concerned the bill is essentially \u201cdeciding that there needs to be a third party in the doctor-patient relationship, an uninvited third party.\u201dUtah lawmakers have enacted a slew of abortion restrictions over the years, establishing a mandatory 72-hour waiting period and requiring women to watch the health department informational module before the procedure. The current online module states that \u201cUtah prefers childbirth over abortion\u201d and walks through the phases of fetal development and different methods for ending a pregnancy.However, Christiansen\u2019s bill would also instruct the health department to make sure the program could only be viewed from beginning to end, with no skipping or fast-forwarding allowed. The module would have to feature audio of a fetal heartbeat, ultrasound video from six different points in a pregnancy and \u201cmedically-accurate visual images of what is happening to the unborn child at each step of each type of abortion procedure.\u201dAfter finishing the program, a woman would get a certificate with a unique code that state health officials could use to verify that she completed it.The lawmaker said he\u2019s proposing these steps after hearing that people can currently type in a web address that calls up the health department\u2019s certificate of completion for the information module \u2014 a loophole that enables them to print off the required form without taking the course.While Christiansen suggested that clinic staff are sometimes complicit in these workarounds, Galloway, CEO and president of Utah\u2019s Planned Parenthood, said her organization \u201cfollows the letter and spirit of all laws.\u201d And she expressed sympathy for state health officials who have to deal with ever-shifting mandates from Utah lawmakers, who she says keep grasping for new ways to discourage abortions.In addition, the bill\u2019s requirement that an informed consent visit must take place in person is particularly ill-timed during the pandemic, she said, when many of these mandated patient-provider conversations have been happening through telehealth.\u201cI am trying to keep our doors open for people who need reproductive health care,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd instead of working on a pandemic, [Christiansen] wants to intrude into the health care system to make it more problematic for my staff and problematic for women.\u201dWhile current law contains penalties for providers who violate the informed consent process, Christiansen\u2019s legislation would expose patients to criminal liability by requiring women to affirm under penalty of perjury that they watched the entire health department module. And Christiansen\u2019s bill would add a fine of $50,000 per violation for physicians who break informed consent laws, on top of the criminal charges they would already face.Christiansen says there\u2019s a simple way to avoid these stiff penalties.\u201cThe doctor doesn\u2019t need to pay a penny,\u201d he said. \u201cAll he or she needs to do is simply comply.\u201dThe West Jordan Republican also wants the health department to collect data on abortion complications, broken down by complication type and procedure type and showing whether these patients are being treated at abortion or medical clinics, doctor\u2019s offices or hospitals. This additional data on abortion outcomes, he said, could help guide future policymaking efforts.(Photo courtesy of the Utah House of Representatives)  Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson swears in Steve Christiansen to fill the vacancy left by former Utah Rep. Ken Ivory on Monday, Sept. 16, 2019.Gayle Ruzicka, president of the Utah Eagle Forum, praised Christiansen\u2019s proposal as a way to make sure women are fully aware of what a pregnancy termination entails.\u201cAnybody should always be able to say that they had all the information before they make such a critical decision,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure that they have the opportunity to know all there is to know and that there was nothing that they felt was later withheld from them.\u201dAbortion legislation sponsored last year by Christiansen would\u2019ve forced women to undergo an ultrasound before the procedure and stirred up such a furor that all six female state senators \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 walked out of the chamber in protest to the bill. The measure died in the final hours of the legislative session.However, the Legislature in recent years has adopted several other abortion restrictions, even passing a bill that called for an outright ban on elective procedures as soon as the Supreme Court clears the way. Under that scenario, abortions would be permitted in Utah only in cases of rape or incest, if the woman\u2019s life were at stake or for a severe fetal abnormality.The Legislature in 2020 also approved legislation requiring health care facilities to dispose of fetal remains by burial or cremation after an abortion or miscarriage. A follow-up to the measure has surfaced this session, as Rep. Cheryl Acton has proposed criminalizing the out-of-state transport of fetal remains except for the purpose of burying them.Acton wrote that she does not consider HB231 to be an abortion bill, because it doesn\u2019t impose new limitations for terminating a pregnancy. The measure seeks to ensure that the aborted or miscarried fetal remains are \u201chandled with dignity and not treated as medical waste\u201d even if taken out of the state, she added.Targeting abortionPlanned Parenthood believes that the bill takes aim at them, since they send fetal tissue across Utah borders to a lab for state-mandated pathology tests following an abortion; in response, Acton, R-West Jordan, said the organization could simply switch to an in-state lab, which \u201cwould probably save them effort and money.\u201dIn the years since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the Utah Legislature has considered 95 abortion bills and passed nearly half of them, according to a review recently undertaken by the League of Women Voters of Utah. In the last five years alone, the state has passed more than a dozen new abortion laws, the League found.And abortion rights advocates say lawmakers and state residents of all political stripes are increasingly wearied by these efforts to chip away at access.\u201cUtahns are overwhelmingly united in that they do not want more punitive abortion restrictions,\u201d Lauren Simpson, policy director for Alliance for a Better Utah, said in a statement.Responding to Christiansen\u2019s proposal, Simpson said this session started as Utahns are dealing with a pandemic, financial insecurities and political extremism that has fueled a loss of trust in government.\u201cNow is not the time to be bringing forward another culture war bill,\u201d she said. \u201cLawmakers would do well to address the issues facing Utahns on a day-to-day basis, instead of running legislation meant to divide us.\u201dChristiansen disagreed that the bill\u2019s timing is wrong.\u201cI think that anytime, frankly, is a good time to make sure that we are protecting women and protecting the unborn,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a bad time.\u201dbrodgers@sltrib.comFollow @BethRodgersSLTDonate to the newsroom now.
