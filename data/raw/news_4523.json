Criminalizing abortions in Sonora, they say, has made them less safe, but it hasn\u2019t stopped them from happening.Decked out in green bandanas and carrying signs through the streets of Hermosillo, feminist protesters chanted that they will be the ones to decide whether or not to have an abortion.Abortions are heavily restricted in Sonora, like most of Mexico. But feminist collectives that helped organize the march said that despite those restrictions, in the last six months alone, they\u2019ve helped more than 2,000 women and girls in the state safely access abortions at home.\u201cWomen in Sonora and across the world have abortions independent of whether or not they are legal,\u201d said a masked protesters reading a statement from the group Marea Verde Sonora, or Green Wave Sonora. \u201cNot guaranteeing a legal interruption to pregnancy condemns women to secrecy, which can result in dangerous abortions when women don\u2019t have access to safe information and adequate assistance, as well as criminalization and social stigma that fall on women that decide to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights.\u201dProtesters said they are pushing for laws to protect women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights, and access to contraception and comprehensive sex education in Sonora. But added that even without changes to current laws, feminist groups in the state will continue to help anyone who wants to end a pregnancy to do so safely.Kendal Blust/KJZZDuring a march on Sept. 28, 2020, women in the Sonoran capital Hermosillo hold up signs supporting the decriminalization of abortion.Kendal Blust/KJZZProtest organizers lead hundreds gathered outside the state congress building in chants supporting abortion during a march in Hermosillo, Sonora on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZWomen march through the streets of Hermosillo, Sonora in support of abortion rights on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZFeminist protesters hold up signs in support of legalizing abortion during a march in Hermosillo, Sonora on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZA protester holds up a sign that says \"Legal abortion so as not to die\" during a protest in the Sonora capital of Hermosillo on Sept. 28, 2020. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA protester holds up a sign that says \"Legal abortion so as not to die\" during a protest in the Sonora capital of Hermosillo on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZ\nFeminist protesters hold up signs in support of legalizing abortion during a march in Hermosillo, Sonora on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZ\nProtesters hold up signs supporting the right to abortion in Hermosillo, Sonora during a march on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZ\nDuring a march on Sept. 28, 2020, women in the Sonoran capital Hermosillo hold up signs supporting the decriminalization of abortion.Kendal Blust/KJZZ\nProtest organizers lead hundreds gathered outside the state congress building in chants supporting abortion during a march in Hermosillo, Sonora on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZ\nWomen march through the streets of Hermosillo, Sonora in support of abortion rights on Sept. 28, 2020.Kendal Blust/KJZZ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFronteras Sonora  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for this project comes from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen\n\nLive Audio Stream\nListen to JazzPHX\nListening Options\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nContact\n\nJobs\nStaff\nEthics and Practices\nFriends of Public Radio Arizona\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nDonate\nMembership\nCorporate Sponsorship\nEvents\nShop\n\n\n\nKJZZ is a service of Rio Salado College, and Maricopa Community Colleges\nPrivacy Policy | FCC Public File | Contest Rules\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KJZZ/Rio Salado College/MCCCD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
