However, their sanctuary city movement deserves equal attention as 39 Texan cities have outlawed abortion within their city limits. Students for Life Action (SFLAction) has been helping with this effort for over a year, and we\u2019ve had students and staff join to testify for these pro-life laws across Texas, Nebraska, and Ohio. \u00a0\n\n(Click HERE\u00a0for a how-to-testify guide!) \u00a0\nLast May, SFLAction showed up in Lubbock, Texas to help pass the city\u2019s ballot referendum. Through our efforts, the referendum\u00a0passed and caused the city\u2019s sole abortion facility to close. The Lubbock abortion facility was a Planned Parenthood facility, and it also was the only one in all of West Texas until the citizens of Lubbock stood up for life. \u00a0\nWithout an abortion facility in Lubbock, local women will either forgo abortions, choosing life instead, or\u00a0drive over 300 miles towards El Paso or Dallas for an\u00a0abortion facility. Both pro-abortion and pro-life supporters agree that such a distance discourages women from choosing abortion. The result has been the protection of hundreds of lives\u2014so of course, the abortion industry is frantic.\u00a0\n\nThis\u00a0geographical phenomenon is what the abortion industry is calling\u00a0an \u201cabortion desert\u201d: any city of over 100,000 people that is more than 100 miles from an abortion facility. Here at SFLAction, we prefer to call these spots \u2018pro-life oases\u2019; places where mothers, preborn children, and the community surrounding are safe and shielded from the violence of abortion.\u00a0I\u2019m happy to tell you that Texas is home to more pro-life oases than any other state in our country. \u00a0\nHowever, Planned Parenthood is chomping at the bit, wanting to resume killing children in West Texas. The Pro-Life Generation is responding by creating yet another pro-life oasis in four more Texan cities: Abilene, Odessa, Midland, and San Angelo. Not what you were going for, Planned Parenthood? Oops. \u00a0\n\nPro-life leaders from all areas of Texas met recently to help this movement in Abilene, Texas. Due to resistance from the Abilene Republican city council, the local pro-life leaders are pushing for a ballot initiative- the same tactic that led to Lubbock outlawing abortion.\u00a0\nThe day of pro-life oasis action began\u00a0with a press conference at which\u00a0Faith Elwonger, the Texas Regional Coordinator for Students for Life of America, and Megan Roos, the leader of the Students for Life of America group at Abilene Christian University, spoke passionately about this effort to outlaw abortion locally. \u00a0\n\nAfter these motivational speeches, our group spent the day collecting petition signatures to get an ordinance which would outlaw abortion on the ballot. We collected over 200 signatures from the amazing pro-life community in Abilene, Texas\u2014a wonderful start to our mission there. It is clear that being a pro-life oasis is in their future. \u00a0\nPro-life oases are beautiful glimpses\u00a0of what the world will look like after abortion is abolished, and the Pro-Life Generation\u00a0needs to work on creating even more of these sanctuaries as a part of our Post-Roe plan. Will it make the abortion lobby mad? Definitely\u2014and to that we say, good! \u00a0\nTo find out how you can help make your own city abortion-free, click HERE. \u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,836\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
