Some Greeks excitedly look toward a future of gender equality. Others are reluctant to certain changes and are holding steadfast to tradition.\nThe primary debates in the fight for women\u2019s rights are mainly between rural and urban citizens. Women in urban areas are more likely to dismiss traditional notions of domesticity and instead seek opportunities in the workforce. However, women in more rural areas still hold fast to the status quo. They are much more likely to take care of the home and children while a male partner seeks out work to provide for the family.\nA Brief History of Women\u2019s Rights in Greece\n\n1952: Women in Greece receive the right to vote. This was significantly more recent than in other European countries, such as England, which awarded women the right to vote in 1918.\n1975: Article 22 declared a requirement for \u201cequal pay for work of equal value.\u201d Although, some sources report Greek women making only 75% of what the average Greek man will make, in the same line of work. This gap is most often observable among higher-paying careers and/or those requiring higher education.\n1983: The Greek Parliament ruled Divorce by consent, legal. Further, the long-standing tradition of dowry, which requires a bride\u2019s family to present her future husband with a sum of money, ended\u00a0as a requirement for a legal marriage.\n2000-2006: The government passed major laws, such as Law 3488/2006, to protect women from workplace harassment and improve equal opportunity employment measures.\n\nThe Current Situation\nAlthough all of these strides forward have occurred, Greek women still seem to be at a disadvantage. In terms of E.U. countries, Greece is the lowest ranking in the Gender Equality Index, with a score of 0.122. Likewise, the country\u2019s female labor force population, as of 2019, is 44.17%. Additionally, domestic violence rates seem to be on the rise, having increased by more than 30% in the last six years.\nFurthermore, migrant and Roma women are, on average, at an even worse economical and educational disadvantage. For example, the typical Romani woman in Greece will spend less than six years in school.\nRecent data reports that men make up around 70% of Greece\u2019s total workforce and 80% of the country\u2019s Parliament. Many women in the workforce remain in low-income, service and part-time positions \u2014 with only about 33% of part-time positions belonging to men.\nIn contrast, Greek women have made great strides in academia. More than 50% of Greece\u2019s citizens obtaining university degrees are female. There is hope that these well-educated women will advance in career paths and assume leadership roles. In this same vein, leadership roles are one of the primary areas in which women are currently underrepresented.\nProponents for Women\u2019s Rights in Greece\nMany people around the country are in an active fight for gender equality and women\u2019s rights in Greece. There is an ongoing discussion to address gender stereotypes and challenge norms established within the country, in nongovernmental organizations.\nThe Greek League for Women\u2019s Rights has been fighting for women\u2019s rights since 1920. Notably, it was a strong leader in the fight for a women\u2019s right to vote in 1952. It has also founded the Centre for Documentation and Study of Women\u2019s Problems and is still active today, fighting discriminatory laws and practices.\nThe National Council of Greek Women, founded in 2008, is a nonprofit fighting for the equality of men and women. The nonprofit recently released a statement from its president who maintains that although legislatively, men and women are equals \u2014 the country still has to reach true gender equality in practice.\nKaterina Sakellaropoulou became the first female president of the country in January 2020. Many saw the vote for the new president as an optimistic mark of change and growth in Greece.\nWith an adjustment to public opinion and the presence of female leaders such as President Sakellaropoulou, experts believe that the country is capable of combatting historical barriers to women\u2019s rights in Greece that still affect its culture, today.\n\u2013 Aradia Webb\nPhoto: Unsplash\nNovember 2, 2020Share this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on TumblrShare on VkShare on RedditShare by Mail\n\nhttps://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg\n0\n0\n\n\nKim Thelwell\n\nhttps://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg\n\nKim Thelwell2020-11-02 07:30:352020-10-31 22:12:41Women\u2019s Rights in Greece\n\n\n\n\nGet SmarterGlobal Poverty 101\nGlobal Poverty\u2026 The Good News\nGlobal Poverty & U.S. Jobs\nGlobal Poverty and National Security\nInnovative Solutions to Poverty\nGlobal Poverty & Aid FAQ\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake ActionCall Congress\nEmail Congress\nDonate\n30 Ways to Help\nVolunteer Ops\nInternships\nThe Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cThe Borgen Project is an incredible nonprofit organization that is addressing poverty and hunger and working towards ending them.\u201d\n-The Huffington Post\n\n\n\n\nInside The Borgen ProjectContact\nAbout\nFinancials\nPresident\nBoard of Directors\nNewsletter\n\n\n\nGet SmarterGlobal Poverty 101\nGlobal Poverty\u2026 The Good News\nGlobal Poverty & U.S. Jobs\nGlobal Poverty and National Security\nInnovative Solutions to Poverty\nGlobal Poverty & Aid FAQ\u2019s\nWays to HelpCall Congress\nEmail Congress\nDonate\n30 Ways to Help\nVolunteer Ops\nInternships\nThe Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoverty & Oppression: The Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, ChinaAddressing Period Poverty in South Sudan\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
