She said she sees Biden frequently at mass at Holy Trinity Church in Washington, D.C., when he is in the nation\u2019s capital. And this has gone on for many years. In fact, Biden is one of the most religious presidents in recent history.\u00a0\u00a0That fact is remarkable given the growing secularization in the United States where the percentage of people who profess to hold no religion has skyrocketed in recent years.\u00a0And it is a contrast to the religiosity of recent presidents.\u00a0Donald Trump did not go to church or make personal references about his own faith.\u00a0Barack Obama only rarely attended church.\u00a0 And George W. Bush, although religious, was not a regular churchgoer while president.But Biden goes further than merely attending church on a weekly basis. He also integrates his faith into his speeches. After the electoral college count that solidified his electoral victory in 2020, Biden quoted St. Francis.\u00a0In his inaugural address, he cited St. Augustine, who he called \u201ca saint of my church.\u201d\u00a0RelatedHow do Catholics in Utah feel about Joe Biden?God is not deadBiden often proclaims that his Catholic faith has been pivotal in his life. And he has had several crises in his life that have tested that faith. In 1972, Biden\u2019s wife and daughter were killed in an auto accident. In 1987, Biden nearly died when he suffered a brain aneurysm. Then, in 2015, his son, Beau, died of cancer at the age of 46.\u00a0Biden credits his faith with helping him endure these tragedies.\u00a0He said his faith has helped him \u201cthrough the darkness\u201d in his life.He once told Stephen Colbert in an interview on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d that he prays with the rosary and meditates while attending mass. He considers what he learned of Catholic catechism as helping ground him in public life.\u00a0He told Colbert that the Catholic tradition helps him know that \u201cI am here to know God, love God, serve God.\u201dBiden has been roundly criticized by anti-abortion advocates and many Catholics because he takes a pro-choice position on abortion. In reality, he does not oppose his church\u2019s teachings on abortion; he has said that he is personally opposed to abortion. However, he feels that he cannot seek to impose his personal religious views on the rest of society.\u00a0\u00a0Related\u2018This is not over\u2019: What Biden said after Supreme Court overturned Roe v. WadeThe distinction between a politician\u2019s personal views on an issue and his approach to public policy is difficult for many citizens to understand.\u00a0They believe it is a politician\u2019s job to make public policy that conforms to personal views.\u00a0However, there are other areas of public policy where that is not the case.\u00a0For example, although many people feel that alcohol use is bad for society, they do not seek legislation that would ban alcohol use. Personal beliefs and public policy do not necessarily mix.The president speaks about his faith and Catholicism in a way that is natural and not forced.\u00a0He is applying his Catholic faith in his life and that comes out in the way he talks about his priorities as a president.\u00a0He does not leave the impression he is trying to evangelize.\u00a0Rather, he is merely showing that his faith has shaped who he is.RelatedDemocrats and Republicans agree Biden is Catholic. But they still see his faith differentlyAnd, perhaps most importantly, he does so in a way that is not demeaning towards others.\u00a0 Biden is not insisting his faith is superior to the faith of others. He does not question others\u2019 faith or claim some special divine dispensation that suggests disagreement with him places one in peril with God, as some religious believers (including some politicians) do.\u00a0 Refreshingly, he is a religious believer as president who is confident in himself and his faith, while respecting the faith of others.\u00a0\u00a0Biden has set an example for future presidents. It is possible to be naturally open about one\u2019s religious beliefs. But he has set an example for religious believers that one should not use religion as a bludgeon to divide, but merely as an expression of who we are and what is important to us personally.Richard Davis is the author of \u201cThe Liberal Soul: Applying the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Politics.\u201dCompanyAbout UsEditorial StaffCareersReach OutContact UsTechnical SupportAdvertiseSend Us a TipDo Not Sell My InfoGet MoreNewslettersPrint SubscriptioniOS AppAndroid AppDeseret News MarathonReach OutTwitterFacebookInstagramCopyright \u00a9 2024 Deseret News Publishing Company.
