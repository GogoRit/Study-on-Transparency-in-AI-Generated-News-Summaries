From the moment she\u2019s standing in a high school bathroom stall holding a positive pregnancy test, her character immediately knows she\u2019s getting an abortion.While Veronica is unwavering in her decision to get an abortion, her home state of Missouri requires women under the age of 18 to get their parents\u2019 permission. But that isn\u2019t an option for Veronica, who initially isn\u2019t comfortable telling her mom. Enter Bailey (Barbie Ferreira), Veronica\u2019s former best friend who happens to be in the school bathroom when she finds out she is pregnant. Veronica doesn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to, and Bailey conveniently has a car for them to use on their 1,000-mile, weekend-long road trip to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Veronica can get her abortion.Director and screenwriter Rachel Lee Goldenberg told BuzzFeed News she thinks there\u2019s \u201ca real urgency\u201d to make films about abortion and reproductive rights in this cultural moment because they\u2019re \u201cunder attack.\u201d\u201cIn my dream scenario, this movie doesn\u2019t make sense to an audience in a couple years because it sounds absurd that someone would have to drive 1,000 miles to get an abortion in a country where it\u2019s supposedly legal. But that\u2019s obviously not the reality right now,\u201d Goldenberg said. \u201cI think that abortion should be normalized and it should be destigmatized, so showing Veronica\u2019s journey and turmoil not coming from her decision, but coming from the difficulty of access makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ursula Coyote / HBO Max\n\n\n\nRachel Lee Goldenberg on the set of Unpregnant with Haley Lu Richardson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldenberg said she read a manuscript of Unpregnant before it was first published as a YA novel, written by Jenni Hendriks and Ted Caplan, in September 2019.One of the more significant changes the film adaptation made from the book was the role of Veronica\u2019s boyfriend, Kevin (Alex MacNicoll). In the novel, Kevin pokes holes in the condoms he and Veronica use when they have sex to try to get her pregnant and trap her from going away to college and leaving him. In the movie, Kevin doesn\u2019t tell Veronica that a condom breaks.Goldenberg said \u201cpurposely poking holes in a condom is literally sexual assault,\u201d and she wanted to find \u201ca more grounded and complex version of Kevin\u201d for the film so that it\u2019s understandable why Veronica is dating him in the first place.\u201cShe can be with someone who is not the right person for her,\u201d she said. \u201cKevin\u2019s incredibly insecure and is the wrong person for her, but he\u2019s not evil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Harper Teen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldenberg said she also drew from her own experiences when working on the film. Having had an abortion herself in her twenties, Goldenberg said she related to the way Veronica\u2019s character dealt with her situation in a matter-of-fact manner. Something she didn\u2019t have in common with Veronica, however, was the fact that Goldenberg had access to abortion.\u201cI think people can have a range of different emotions and journeys to abortion, and in this movie, it was an easy decision to portray it in a way that resonated with me,\u201d Goldenberg said. \u201cFor Veronica, the struggle comes with the journey.\u201dVeronica and Bailey encounter their fair share of obstacles along the way to Albuquerque. There\u2019s the issue of Bailey\u2019s car actually belonging to her mom\u2019s boyfriend, and since she took it without permission, the cops come looking for them. This prompts the high schoolers to hitch a ride with a group of guys they find at a diner, which eventually brings them to a carnival where a seemingly innocent couple offers them a ride to Albuquerque. What Veronica and Bailey don\u2019t realize is that the couple are anti-abortion activists who try to hold the girls hostage in their house in the middle of nowhere to prevent Veronica from getting her abortion, forcing them to escape.All of their shenanigans are met with humor and bond the characters back together as friends. While sometimes funny, the issues they encounter are also hardships getting in between Veronica and her abortion.\u201cCertainly the obstacles themselves are designed to be entertaining and funny and wild, but of course there\u2019s a larger point about how hard it is for her to get the abortion,\u201d Goldenberg said. \u201cThe point is: Look at how hard it is for her to actually accomplish something that she knows she wants to do and legally should be allowed to do.\u201dGoldenberg said she toured a Planned Parenthood clinic in Los Angeles to research each step of the procedure so that she could accurately depict the onscreen abortion from Veronica\u2019s perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ursula Coyote / HBO Max\n\n\n\nBailey and Veronica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe director said when she had an abortion she took a pill, so when she learned about all of the details involved in the surgical procedure, she was \u201cfascinated\u201d and had an \u201caha moment\u201d in terms of how she wanted to portray the abortion scene.Goldenberg said \u201cit would feel like a cop-out\u201d not to show the full scope of the experience, which is what led Unpregnant to include a sequence of scenes onscreen while the abortion provider is explaining each step in the background.\u201cWhen I was at Planned Parenthood, I realized we need to show all of this. There\u2019s nothing that we shouldn\u2019t show or that we should cut out. What we\u2019re saying in the movie is that this is a fine thing to do, here\u2019s the information, and this is something that just should be destigmatized and should be normalized,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also from a character perspective, this is what we\u2019ve been doing the whole time, trying to get to this place, so I don\u2019t want to leave my hero Veronica in that moment. I want to be with her and see her emotions and see her feelings.\u201dGoldenberg said it\u2019s also relatable for Bailey\u2019s character to be nervous and anxious while she waits for Veronica because \u201cthe person who\u2019s waiting has no idea what\u2019s going on \u2014 it\u2019s a mystery.\u201dOnce the two are reunited, Bailey asks how Veronica\u2019s feeling, to which she plainly replies, \u201cRelieved and hungry.\u201d There isn\u2019t a sad or traumatic overtone following Veronica\u2019s abortion; the girls move on and go get nachos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  HBO Max\n\n\n\nBailey and Veronica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most specific and personal experience I can draw from is my own, and for me, after the abortion, I was just relieved to not be pregnant anymore,\u201d Goldenberg said. \u201cAnd life went on.\u201dEven though Veronica didn\u2019t want to tell her mom about her pregnancy or abortion, she eventually does call her from Albuquerque because the girls need help getting on a plane home.Goldenberg said Veronica\u2019s mom might not agree with her decision, but she wanted to include a scene between the two characters where the mom still shows her daughter that she loves and supports her.\u201cVeronica has gone through this journey from the beginning of the movie where she knows what she wants to do but she feels ashamed and she feels like she can\u2019t talk about it and knows that her mother wouldn\u2019t approve, so she doesn\u2019t want to bring this to her,\u201d Goldenberg said. \u201cThen by the end of the movie, she\u2019s matured and she\u2019s grown into herself and she\u2019s more confident. We see Veronica\u2019s mom loves her and she wants her to know that she\u2019s there for her even when she disagrees with her.\u201dWhen the weekend is over, Veronica and Bailey return to school on Monday as friends, something that seemed unlikely to both characters at the beginning of the film. Goldenberg said the focus of Unpregnant is about Veronica\u2019s physical journey to her abortion, but ultimately the movie is also about female friendship.\u201cThe heart of the movie is about the two of them and their relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m a passionate advocate of reproductive rights, but this is a movie about two ex\u2013best friends becoming best friends again, so while we had lots of discussions about abortion and about the procedure and how it would be portrayed in the movie, most of the effort was spent on these characters, their relationship, and bringing truth to that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sep. 12, 2020, at 00:50 AM\n  \n\n\n\nCorrection: Rachel Lee Goldenberg's last name was misspelled in an earlier version of this post.\n\n\nTopics in this articleHBO MaxAbortion RightsKrystie Lee YandoliBuzzFeed News ReporterSkip to footerSectionsArts & EntertainmentBooksCelebrityCulture & CriticismHealthInternet CultureInvestigationsJPGLGBTQOpinionPoliticsTechCompanySupport UsBuzzFeed.comPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementFollow UsFacebook FacebookTwitter TwitterInstagram InstagramBuzzFeed News Homea BuzzFeed brand."
