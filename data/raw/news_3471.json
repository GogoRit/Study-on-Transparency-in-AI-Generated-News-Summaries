(WAFB) - Pro-life advocates in Louisiana are showing their support for the overturning of Roe v. Wade and 27 bills in the state legislature that would make it harder to get an abortion.\u201cAn unborn child is a unique human being deserving of protection, and I believe that abortion is not good for women. It\u2019s not good to pit a woman against her unborn child,\u201d Angie Thomas, director of Louisiana Right to Life said.This comes after pro-choice advocates voiced their concerns.\u201cIf you can\u2019t control your reproduction, you can\u2019t control your lives,\u201d Angela Adkins, president of the National Organization of Women (NOW) Baton Rouge said.Adkins said she supports women\u2019s rights, and that is why she supports a women\u2019s right to choose if she gets an abortion.\u201cBecause we should all have the right to control our bodies and what happens to ourselves and to control our futures and come, you know, it is bodily autonomy as everything. Name me one law that restricts a man\u2019s body...there aren\u2019t any,\u201d Adkins said.Meanwhile, State Senator Katrina Jackson said the anti-abortion bills would help women.\u201cWe\u2019re standing together as Democrat women, as Republican women, as Black and White women saying that it\u2019s time for this budget to reflect dollars that really support women and their children,\u201d Jackson said.State Senator Sharon Hewitt said in addition to making abortion illegal, they want the state budget to allocate a million dollars to women.\u201cBecause you know now if you\u2019re going to take abortion off the table as an option for pregnant moms, they need to know what other options are available to them,\u201d Hewitt said.Click here to report a typo.Copyright 2022 WAFB.
