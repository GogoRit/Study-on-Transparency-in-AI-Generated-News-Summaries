So why make American Catholics feel like they shouldn't vote for life?Kristan HawkinsOpinion contributorWe are at one of those regular intervals when the subject of religious faith is allowed past the boundaries of church doors.\u00a0During presidential elections, believers are expected to line up and vote based on carefully selected values that make for great campaign ads.As a Catholic, I am well aware that as a member of the\u00a0largest single religious institution\u00a0in the United States, I am part of a voting bloc\u00a0coveted by every candidate. But, annoyingly, Catholic voters are expected to embrace only a subset of the issues that motivate us and overlook anti-Catholic bigotry in candidates'\u00a0records that occurred when they were\u00a0outside of the election spotlight.As a Catholic, the issue central to my evaluation of every candidate is a matter of life and death \u2014\u00a0abortion. My challenge to fellow Catholics is to consider this carefully.The\u00a0science of\u00a0the development of human\u00a0life\u00a0and the many\u00a0harms of abortion\u00a0for women and the preborn should be enough for us to react in horror to the loss of more than 60 million\u00a0Americans\u00a0since\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and\u00a0Doe v. Bolton\u00a0wiped out legal protections\u00a0for life in the womb. But for some of us, faith is an additional incentive to protect the least of these.\u00a0As Pope Francis has said, \u201cThe right to life is the first among human rights.\u201d\u00a0This truth is central to\u00a0Catholic teaching\u00a0throughout time.\u00a0Psalm 139:13-14 notes: \u201cFor you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb.\u00a0I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\u201dAbortion ends one life, harms anotherFaith does not intrude into politics on abortion. Instead, political operatives forced into the law and public policy an irreverent rejection of the value of preborn life.\u00a0Rather than helping pregnant women, abortion proponents attempt\u00a0to eliminate the child, a potential sufferer, rather than the woman's\u00a0suffering. But the day after\u00a0her\u00a0abortion, a\u00a0mother\u00a0still needs economic opportunity, equal protection under the law, access to education and empowerment. The act of abortion ends\u00a0the life of her child\u00a0and offers nothing in return.\u00a0Shoddy, dangerous care:I was an abortionist. The abortion industry isn't willing to prioritize patient safety.In this election, stark contrasts also exist between candidates on issues like\u00a0\u201ccodifying\u00a0Roe,\u201d\u00a0a term of art that means creating a federal law to allow for abortion through all nine\u00a0months of pregnancy,\u00a0sometimes with taxpayer funding. Getting rid of the\u00a0Hyde Amendment\u00a0\u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden's position\u00a0\u2014\u00a0means support for taxpayer funding of abortion. Eliminating the\u00a0Mexico City policy\u00a0means taxpayer funding of abortion worldwide. \"Medicare for All\" could\u00a0equal\u00a0forcing abortion coverage into all health care.The tragic passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a clear reminder of the ever present issue of judicial appointments as a reason to vote for those who want to see life protected in law.\u00a0But believers like myself have\u00a0also been very troubled by political trends of \u201callowing\u201d Catholics access to political opportunity only if they don\u2019t support all that is taught.Anti-Catholic lawmakersIn hearings of multiple recent\u00a0judicial nominees,\u00a0senators\u00a0\u2014 including the Democrats' vice presidential nominee,\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0\u2014\u00a0attacked candidates like Judge\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett, who is on President Donald Trump's\u00a0short list for the Supreme Court, for actually believing\u00a0the tenets of their church.\u00a0Harris\u00a0has a troubling record.\u00a0While attorney general of California, Harris\u00a0arranged for an armed\u00a0raid\u00a0on the home of pro-life journalist and activist David Daleiden, who had dared to document\u00a0Planned Parenthood employees'\u00a0engagement in exchanging money for\u00a0aborted infant body parts,\u00a0and she did this after advocating for\u00a0Planned Parenthood as part of her\u00a0Senate campaign.\u00a0Her abortion platform while running for president included\u00a0using the Department of Justice\u00a0against states that attempt to pass pro-life laws.Not a laughing matter:Hey HBO, abortion isn't a jokeLast year,\u00a0Harris introduced\u00a0the\u00a0Do No Harm Act in the U.S. Senate, which would water down\u00a0the federal 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, among other laws designed to protect people of faith. In effect, that change would empower governmental authorities to force people of faith to comply with laws they find morally objectionable, such as pay for or perform abortions in health care if they receive some state or federal funding.This is not a small threat as\u00a0twice the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor\u00a0have been forced to go to the Supreme Court because they did not want to pay for birth control and abortions,\u00a0or provide insurance coverage for contraceptives.Christian case for Biden:Christian conservatives like me should not let abortion and socialism scare us off BidenA common canard thrown at pro-life people is the falsehood that\u00a0we don\u2019t care\u00a0about the baby\u00a0after he or she is born. The\u00a0track record of our movement tells\u00a0the opposite story.\u00a0A pregnant immigrant at the border and a pregnant woman in any city in America holds the same powerful potential for greatness.\u00a0As Catholics, we need to evaluate candidates for their track records on the human rights issue of our day \u2014 abortion \u2014\u00a0and for their ability to respect the beliefs of their fellow Americans who should be free to act as their consciences dictate.For Catholics\u00a0who say they will not vote for President Trump, I challenge you to put aside personalities to focus both on the human rights issue of our day and the anti-Catholic bigotry on clear display in the other presidential ticket. The choice here is not between good and great, but reliable-to-date and disastrous.Kristan Hawkins is president of\u00a0Students for Life Action\u00a0and a board member of\u00a0Catholics for Trump.Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
