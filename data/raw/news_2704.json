The student government had\u00a0said the group\u00a0could create a hostile environment\u00a0and would not be formed in\u00a0\"good faith,\"\u00a0a requirement for student groups to form under UNI policy.Although not all members of the student government agreed, the majority decision of the student Supreme Court wrote that Students for Life's application was \"lacking in evidence of being an equitable, just\u00a0and welcoming student organization for our students and community found on campus of the University of Northern Iowa.\"Students for Life leaders appealed the decision to President Nook last week, and\u00a0Nook weighed in on the matter in a letter to students government leaders and a representative of the Students for Life group\u00a0Sunday, overturning the previous decisions.Nook wrote that the student government overlooked the school's policies protecting free speech\u00a0and\u00a0appeared to make its denial\u00a0\"based on the content of the student organization's viewpoint, speech and assumed potential activities.\"Nook, who became UNI president in February 2017,\u00a0said the decision was the first he's had to make on a First Amendment issue on campus, although he said he has had conversations about free speech in the past with students.It's one of many examples of disputes\u00a0over free speech on college campuses nationwide, which Nook says is a learning experience for the campus and broader community.'We don't have much time': University of Iowa adds another sustainability-focused program 'My mom really represented the home front': Donna Reed's daughter greets Iowa City movie audience University of Iowa student Andrew Dunn becomes first candidate to run for Iowa House District 90 This Thanksgiving, move beyond the basic pumpkin pie. Here's how.\"Universities exist to give students and all members of the university community an opportunity to wrestle with a vast diversity of ideas and opinions, to challenge their perception of their own identity and the beliefs and opinions of others, and to grow in their understanding of natural and social systems,\" Nook wrote. \"These last few weeks provided an incredibly rich learning environment for our students, faculty, staff and many people off-campus.\"There won't be any repercussions for the student government, Nook said Tuesday. The university has a checks and balances system similar to the U.S. government for a reason, he said, where he essentially plays the role of an appeals court.Registration of a student group grants members the ability to reserve rooms on campus and request funds for activities like lectures and publications, among other privileges.\"In short, the university provides an opportunity for a group to organize and to share their opinions and beliefs,\" Nook wrote in his appeal.The student group will be a local chapter of Students for Life of America, a national nonprofit that uses youth activism to advocate against abortion. The organization has openly supported President Donald Trump's executive order on free speech on college campuses, and members have garnered attention for attending an Evangelicals for Trump campaign event.There are more than 1,250 localized chapters of Students for Life\u00a0in all 50 states, mostly on college campuses.\u00a0The University of Iowa and Iowa State University are among them, according to their student organization websites.Still, UNI student government leaders argued that the group could potentially engage in harassment on campus because of its\u00a0ties to the national organization.Nook disagreed, saying that the potential for harassment isn't enough to prohibit a group from forming on campus.In making his decision, Nook said he\u00a0looked back in time to a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court case where Central Connecticut State College denied a student group from forming under the argument that its ties to Students for a Democratic Society, a national organization that\u00a0had been known to engage in protests and, occasionally, violence, could harm campus life.The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately sided with the student group in the case, titled Healy v. James, saying the school's decision to prohibit the group violated the First Amendment.According to the Students for Life student group constitution, its\u00a0mission is to \"work to save lives threatened by induced abortion, euthanasia\u00a0and the destruction of human embryos for research.\"\u00a0Members also pledge to \"seek to promote respect for life at UNI and, on a local, state\u00a0and national level, to educate on life issues, to help those in need so that life is a promising choice, and to work with others who share common goals.\"Students for Life released a statement following the announcement of Nook's decision Monday:\"Viewpoint discrimination is both unconstitutional and undemocratic, as the free marketplace of idea is designed to allow for citizens to share their views,\"\u00a0Students for Life of America\u00a0President Kristan Hawkins said in the statement. \"For the Pro-Life Generation, a conversation on the human rights issue of our day \u2014\u00a0abortion \u2014\u00a0is demanded of all those who care about how our society has devalued life based on location. Whether in the womb, at the border, or in any city in America, preborn life matters and deserves legal protection.\"Cleo Krejci covers education for the Iowa City Press-Citizen.
