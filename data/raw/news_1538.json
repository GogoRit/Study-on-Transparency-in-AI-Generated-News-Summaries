(AP) \u2014 More than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, the issue has at times dominated the discussion among the Republicans seeking their party\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination and is sure to be on display during the first GOP campaign debate Wednesday in Milwaukee.Some of the division among the candidates has come over whether there should be a national ban on the practice \u2014 and after how many weeks \u2014 now that the justices have returned specific debate over abortion legality to the states.A look at how the issue of abortion is playing out among Republican and Democratic candidates:REPUBLICANS DONALD TRUMPThe former president, the current GOP front-runner, has often sidestepped the issue of abortion, even as Republicans across the country have celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.In April, a major anti-abortion group assailed Trump on the issue, saying his contention that abortion restrictions should be left up to individual states, not the federal government, is a \u201cmorally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America group has said it would not support any White House candidate who did not at a minimum support a 15-week federal abortion ban.Trump, who has referred to himself as \u201cthe most pro-life president in American history, has pointed to his successful nomination of three conservatives justices, a move that tilted the court to the conservative majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. Earlier this year, he characterized as \u201ctoo harsh\u201d a measure signed into law by fellow contender Gov. Ron DeSantis that would ban abortions in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    MORE 2024 ELECTION COVERAGE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018No Labels\u2019 movement says it could offer independent presidential ticket in 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould Trump go to jail? The 2024 election could become a referendum on that question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Biden, America\u2019s oldest sitting president, needs young voters to win again. Will his age matter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RON DESANTIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has been governor, Florida passed an abortion ban after six weeks of pregnancy. But DeSantis, who says he is \u201cpro-life,\u201d has suggested that individual states should decide the issue, adding in a recent interview that he is \u201crunning on doing things that I know I can accomplish.\u201d\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, criticized DeSantis for not supporting a national ban on the procedure, calling DeSantis\u2019 position \u201cunacceptable\u201d as he runs for president. MIKE PENCEThe former vice president supports a federal ban on abortion at six weeks, before many women even know they\u2019re pregnant. And he has advocated pulling from the market one of two widely used abortion pills \u2014 a medication with a better safety record than Viagra and penicillin. Sensing that such a position may be viewed as too extreme in a general election, no other major presidential candidate has joined his calls.In a recent Associated Press interview, Pence went even further, saying abortion should be banned, even when a pregnancy is deemed nonviable. Such a standard would force women to carry pregnancies to term even when doctors have determined there is no chance a baby will survive outside the womb.Earlier this month while touring the Iowa State Fair, Pence said he was expecting to use the debate as an opportunity to call out Trump and DeSantis for not insisting on a national abortion ban.\n\n TIM SCOTTThe South Carolina senator has long voiced his opposition to abortion, pledging that as president \u201cI would sign the most conservative pro-life legislation you can bring to my desk.\u201dHe has signaled support for a federal ban on the practice for as early as 12 weeks and also support for a bill sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that would ban abortions nationally after 15 weeks.In 2021, Scott also co-sponsored legislation that would have established a constitutional right to life from \u201cthe moment of fertilization.\u201d NIKKI HALEYHaley, the sole woman in the GOP field, pledged in May that she would sign a federal abortion ban if elected president.But Haley has not specified a time frame for after how many weeks she feels abortion should be outlawed, noting that passing such a measure would be highly unlikely without more Republicans in Congress, and advocating for \u201cconsensus\u201d around the issue. She\u2019s said she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d sign a 15-week federal ban.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said \u201cno one has been honest\u201d about how difficult a ban could be to achieve, in a closely divided federal government.Haley campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said in June that she would \u201csign pro-life legislation that includes exceptions for rape, incest, and for the life of the mother,\u201d suggesting she may be opposed to an exception for non-viable pregnancies \u2014 but declining to clarify.As governor, Haley signed an abortion ban after about 20 weeks. That law is still in effect while a six-week ban, passed by state lawmakers, is held up in the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOhio voters have resoundingly rejected a Republican-backed measure that would have made it more difficult to pass abortion protections. (Aug. 9)\n\n\n\n VIVEK RAMASWAMYThe wealthy biotech entrepreneur and author of \u201cWoke, Inc.\u201d has said he would not support a federal ban on abortion because \u201dthe federal government should stay out of it.\u201d He has voiced support for states that have passed six-week bans.\n\nLike some other hopefuls, he has pushed for more policies that encourage adoption and better child care. CHRIS CHRISTIEThe former two-term New Jersey governor has argued that the issue of abortion should be carried out in the states, not at the federal level. In a CNN town hall, Christie said that \u201cthe federal government should not be involved unless and until there\u2019s a consensus around the country from the 50 states making their own decisions about what it should be.\u201dSeeking local office in the 1990s, Christie identified himself as \u201cpro-choice,\u201d saying he changed his position after hearing his daughter\u2019s heartbeat at 13 weeks.As governor, he vetoed millions in state funding for Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics. Before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that overturned Roe, Christie joined Dannenfelser in meetings other GOP governors to discuss the issue and how it might play out at the state level.  ASA HUTCHINSONThe former two-term Arkansas governor has said the issue of abortion should stay in the states without a Republican supermajority in Congress.As governor in 2021, Hutchinson signed a near-total ban on abortions that did not include rape and incest exceptions. DOUG BURGUMIn April, the two-term North Dakota governor signed one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country. The measure would allow abortions up to six weeks\u2019 gestation in cases of rape or incest, or medical emergencies. After that marker, no exceptions aside from some medical emergencies, such as ectopic pregnancies, are allowed at any stage of pregnancy.Burgum has mostly said the issue of abortion should be left to the states and has indicated he would not support a federal ban. LARRY ELDERThe conservative talk radio host opposes abortion but has said he would not support a federal ban. PERRY JOHNSONThe businessman describes himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d When he ran for Michigan governor in 2022, Johnson told reporters \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d when asked if he would rule out banning abortion in cases of sexual assault. FRANCIS SUAREZThe Miami mayor has said that he would support a national ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions, including rape, incest and the mother\u2019s health. WILL HURDThe former Texas congressman has said he would sign a 15-week federal abortion ban, although he has said that he doesn\u2019t see it as realistic that Congress would pass such a measure.While in the House, Hurd twice voted in favor of a 20-week ban.DEMOCRATS JOE BIDENThe president supports abortion access and has said he would veto a national ban on the practice. As a senator, Biden supported abortion restrictions like the 1976 Hyde Amendment \u2014 which states that Medicaid won\u2019t pay for abortions unless the woman\u2019s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest \u2014 but said during the 2020 campaign he had shifted course.The aftermath of last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling has framed much of Biden\u2019s presidency on abortion. He signed an executive order designed to strengthen and promote access to contraception. Mounting a rallying cry to 2022 midterms voters to seat more Democratic lawmakers who could possibly codify abortion access nationally, Biden has also directed his administration to take steps to protect access to abortion care. This includes making mifepristone \u2014 one of two pills used in medication abortions \u2014 easier to obtain, and ensuring members of the military can access reproductive health care.  ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.The author and environmental lawyer has spoken in favor of \u201cbodily autonomy\u201d and describes himself as \u201cpro-choice.\u201dA nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, he has also said \u201cit\u2019s a woman\u2019s choice, and it\u2019s solely up to the woman\u201d in terms of how a pregnancy should be handled in its first trimester. MARIANNE WILLIAMSONThe self-help author\u2019s campaign website describes her as \u201cone hundred percent pro-choice.\u201d Williamson has also noted that she believes the decision to have an abortion or not \u201clies solely with a pregnant woman, according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding.\u201d___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEG KINNARD\n\n\n                Kinnard covers national politics for The Associated Press.
