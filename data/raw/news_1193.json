The bill has exceptions for rape and incest, but those incidents must be reported to law enforcement. The bill also makes an exception to save the life of the mother.\nREAD MORE: While the nation grapples with post-Roe possibilities, Oklahoma is already living it, advocates say\nThe bill comes weeks after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court outlined the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade, allowing states to decide whether to ban abortion. Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who has pledged to sign all anti-abortion measures, is expected to approve the bill. Once signed, the ban will go into effect immediately.  \nAhead of Thursday\u2019s vote on the measure, Rep. Cyndi Munson, a Democrat from Oklahoma City, argued the bill was going to result in the deaths of women. \n\u201cIf we pass this, women are going to die,\u201d Munson said. \u201cI know my Republican colleagues aren\u2019t going to vote \u2018no\u2019 on an abortion ban, but I recommend you walk and abstain instead of killing constituents or forcing girls to carry their rapist\u2019s child.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Oklahoma lawmakers debated House Bill 4327, which would ban nearly all abortions. The measure passed, in a 73-16 vote, and will now go to the governor\u2019s desk to sign. Video by PBS NewsHour\nRep. Wendi Stearman, a Republican from Collinsville and co-sponsor of the bill, said it\u2019s her hope that the bill will provide more protections for \u201cunborn children\u201d in Oklahoma.\n\u201cWe used to debate on abortion bills whether the fetus is a person,\u201d Stearman said. \u201cNow we\u2019re debating on whether the child will have a hard life. Based on that argument, we should offer services to kill children until they\u2019re 18.\u201d \nEarlier this month, Stitt signed a ban on abortions past six weeks of pregnancy, which left clinics in Oklahoma scrambling to reschedule patients at clinics in other states.\nPOLL: Majority of Americans don\u2019t want Roe overturned\nNancy Northup, president and CEO with the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the group will be fighting this latest ban in state court.\n\u201cPoliticians in Oklahoma have been working towards this moment for decades,\u201d she said in a statement following Thursday\u2019s vote. \n\u201cUnder [House Bill 4327], people will be forced to travel hundreds of miles for an abortion, and those who cannot afford to travel will be forced to give birth against their will or attempt to end their pregnancies on their own. This is the cruel reality that politicians are creating for their own residents.\u201d\nEmily Wales, interim CEO and president for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said the two clinics in Oklahoma that provided abortions have stopped out of fear of potential litigation and are now answering calls from confused patients about what is legal in Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a devastating moment,\u201d Wales said at a news conference after the vote. \u201cPeople are asking if Roe is still the law of the land and it is, but it has never been more in danger.\u201d\nOklahomans \u201cfeel that their decisions about their health care are being criminalized,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A patient care coordinator checks the day's schedule of abortions at Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma City.
