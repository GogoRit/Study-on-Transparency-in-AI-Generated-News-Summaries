Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, hoping it would be a symbol for the pro-life movement.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe had seen a photo in her local newspaper of the tiny feet of a 10-week-old baby on the one-year anniversary of Roe and was haunted by the picture. Modeled after the image, the Precious Feet would become the international pro-life symbol, with tens of millions distributed around the world.\u00a0\n\nSacco photo/SBAList Facebook\n\n\n\u00a0\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nEvers and her husband Ellis, who preceded her in death, were active in pro-life work beginning well before the Roe decision legalized abortion nationwide, with some U.S. states having legalized abortion before the national ruling.\nEvers was the mother of six, grandmother of 28 and great-grandmother of 70. Throughout her life she would come to know and associate with leaders in the pro-life, political and religious arenas.\u00a0\n\nHeritage House\n\nVirginia and Ellis Evers had opened a small shop in 1973 leading up to the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, featuring American-made patriotic items.\nThe shop, Heritage House '76, proceeds from which supported a home for unwed mothers and a local crisis pregnancy service, began distributing the Precious Feet pin. Decades later it is one-of the largest providers of pro-life material in the world, including offering innovative pregnancy center curriculum.\nAfter Evers and her husband retired from Heritage House \u201976 in the early 1990s, their daughter and son-in-law, Dinah and Mike Monahan, took over the company. Mike Monahan died in 2016. His and Dinah\u2019s son Brandon now leads Heritage House \u201976.\nAnother pro-life pioneer, the late Dr. Jack Willke, had said of the Precious Feet lapel pin, \u201cThis remarkable little pin has been responsible for countless people changing their minds on abortion.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cThis remarkable little pin has been responsible for countless people changing their minds on abortion\u201d Jack Willke on the Precious Feet \nPro-life leaders noted Evers\u2019s passing and her legacy.\n\u201cWhat is so striking and compelling about Virginia's legacy is how strongly her family carries it forward,\u201d said Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International. \u201cWhile she sowed a powerful symbol in the Precious Feet, she really gifted anointed, talented, and committed family members that continue to move and shape the pro-life movement today.\u201d\u00a0\nFr. Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life, wrote about Evers\u2019s passing in an Instagram post, including a photo of Evers presenting him with a Precious Feet pin.\u00a0\n\nFr. Frank Pavone Instagram\n\n\u201cMay she rest in peace,\u201d Pavone said.\nJanet Morana, executive director of Priests for Life and co-founder of the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, wrote about Evers for the National Catholic Register, calling Evers, \u201cthe woman whose stamp will be forever imprinted on the pro-life movement.\u201d\nEvers was a patriot and active in the conservative movement. Among the political figures with whom she corresponded was then-actor Ronald Reagan. Evers developed a friendship with him and encouraged to run for office.\nDismayed by the vitriol directed at American soldiers returning from serving in the Vietnam war, Evers and her husband created one of the first Vietnam memorials in their hometown in 1970.\nBrandon Monahan remarked on the impact his grandmother had on her family.\n\u201cVirginia was friends of presidents and popes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she was always grandma to me and grandma-great to my children.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShe was always a joy to be around,\u201d said Brandon Monahan. \u201cAt least once a week she would have, \"the best meal I have ever eaten.\" She would bring gifts of lemonade and cookies to the grand kids, with whom her husband would be sharing the joys of hard work.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShe was sassy and ready with wonderful barbed humor that delighted her grandchildren,\u201d he added.\u00a0\n\nVirginia Evers\n\nBrandon Monahan continued regarding his grandmother\u2019s persona and passion.\n\u201cShe was kind and constantly positive, creative, and a woman that simply would get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom creating the first Vietnam war memorial in the country, to starting a patriotic store in California (Heritage House), she simply did what she knew was right.\u201d\n\u201cShe refused to stop working and wrote letters as she emphatically proclaimed the cause of life into her nineties,\u201d he stated. \u201cIn short, she lived her life well, and made an impact that will be felt for generations.\u201d\nEvers\u2019s daughter Dinah Monahan reflected on her mother\u2019s kind spirit and love of life as well.\n\u201cMom\u2019s smile, warmth and generosity left an impact on everyone she met,\u201d she said. \u201cHer arms were always open wide, and her heart was big enough to offer love to one more grandchild, one more stranger, one more single mother, one more baby.\u201d\n\u201cShe spread the pro-life message until her last breath,\u201d said Dinah Monahan.\u00a0\nTweet This: \u201cShe spread the pro-life message until her last breath,\u201d Dinah Monahan, on her mother Virginia Evers\n\nVirginia Evers\n\n\u201cVirginia lived a full, productive and meaningful life,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo many other lives are changed for the good because they knew her. We celebrate her passing and thank God for the many years she was with us.\u201d\nEvers had written the story of the Precious Feet, recounting testimonies of how they had affected people, encouraging them toward life, and what she considered most important about the impression the Precious Feet had made.\n\u201cThe greatest reward for our labor is the fact that the Precious Feet save babies lives,\u201d she said.\nEditor's note: Dinah Monahan wrote a reflection on her mother's passing, which can be found HERE, along with Virginia Evers's written account of the story of the Precious Feet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nVirginia Evers\nPrecious Feet\nHeritage House '76\nDinah Monahan\nBrandon Monahan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa Bourne\n\nLisa Bourne is Managing Editor of Pregnancy Help News and Content Writer for Heartbeat International.
