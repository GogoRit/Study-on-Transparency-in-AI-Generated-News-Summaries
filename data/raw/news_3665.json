Nichols said he would support a bill to change the state\u2019s abortion laws to include an exception for rape.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Azul Sordo/The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nA leading statewide anti-abortion group suspended its endorsement of state Sen. Robert Nichols this week after the Republican leader from Jacksonville said he\u2019d support a loosening of Texas\u2019 abortion ban.\nNichols, who is up for reelection in November, said Friday during the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival that he\u2019d vote in favor of an exception to Texas\u2019 abortion prohibition in cases of rape.\nIn a Twitter thread on Monday, the Texas Right To Life organization said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the East Texas senator\u2019s comments and that it would not support any politician who \u201cselectively chooses which children should have the Right to Life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow politicians view exceptions reveals whether they have a consistent ethical principal motivating their pro-life views, or if its kind of a surface value,\u201d Texas Right to Life President John Seago said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. \u201cThe comments we heard from Sen. Nichols shows there\u2019s a distinction between us and him.\u201d\n\n\nTexas Right to Life PAC has suspended our endorsement of Texas State Senator Robert Nichols (R-Jacksonville) until further notice. #TXLege (1/5)\u2014 Texas Right to Life (Text ProLife to 40237) (@TXRightToLife) September 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    This tweet may have been deleted or made private.\n  \n\n\n\nSeago added that after Nichols made his comments on Friday, he spoke with the senator to understand his views on abortion.\n\u201cWe had that conversation, and it is evident that we are still not unified on how we address these issues,\u201d Seago said.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n New abortion restrictions are impractical and resource-draining, Texas prosecutors say \n\n\n\n\n        \n        Sept. 24, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nNichols did not clarify over the weekend whether he\u2019d support other changes to the abortion laws, such as an exception for the procedure in cases of incest. And he declined to comment for this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas\u2019 near-total abortion ban went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion this summer. The state\u2019s abortion ban is one of the most stringent in the nation, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The procedure is prohibited in almost all cases, except to save the life of a pregnant person, and performing an illegal abortion is a felony punishable by up to life in prison.\nNichols is one of the longest-serving Republican state senators, and he represents a part of Texas that has historically led the fight against abortion. Nichols has a strong anti-abortion record, and he has kept the support of Texas Right to Life since he first won the Senate seat in 2006.\nLast year, Nichols voted in favor of the Human Life Protection Act \u2014 the legislation that triggered a rollback of abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court decision \u2014 which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott.\nTexas Right to Life bills itself as the oldest and largest \u201cpro-life\u201d organization in Texas. Its views, however, are not consistent with other anti-abortion organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Alliance for Life, an anti-abortion organization based in Austin, has not wavered in its support for Nichols since his comments this weekend.\n\u201cWe valued his support for the Human Life Protection Act when it passed in the last legislative session without the rape and incest exception,\u201d said Amy O\u2019Donnell, the organization\u2019s spokesperson. She said that while Texas Alliance for Life does not favor any weakening of the abortion laws, the organization\u2019s support for Nichols \u201chas not changed.\u201d\nAngelina County Republican Party Chair Bob Flournoy shared a similar sentiment, calling himself a longtime supporter of Nichols. While Flournoy disagrees with the senator about abortion \u2014 Flournoy said he does not support an exception for rape \u2014 he will still support Nichols in the upcoming election.\n\u201cWhether I agree with him or not, I think he deserves our full support,\u201d said Flournoy, an attorney in Lufkin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeago, of Texas Right to Life, said it was \u201cmind-boggling\u201d to hear that other groups that bill themselves as pro-life would continue to support Nichols.\n\u201cIt reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be pro-life,\u201d said Seago. \u201cTo say that you\u2019re going to punish the child for a sin of the father \u2014 that misses the point. That\u2019s pro-life 101.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth. Help us report it.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \n\n\r\n    Independent Texas reporting needs your support.
