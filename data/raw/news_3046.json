Frank Pavone. | American Life League via Flickr CC BY NC 2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Zelda Caldwell, Katie Yoder \n\nWashington D.C., Dec 18, 2022 / 11:29 am\nThe national director of Priests for Life, Frank Pavone, canceled a scheduled livestreamed Mass today, one day after CNA published a report that he was continuing to celebrate Mass after the Vatican had removed him from the priesthood.\nIn a defiant statement addressed to Church leaders and posted on his organization\u2019s website Saturday, Pavone vowed to continue his ministry despite his dismissal from the clerical state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the millions of supporters of the movement I help to lead and will continue to lead,\u201d he wrote, adding that he would respond by taking \u201call appropriate canonical and civil action as well as public communications to the Faithful.\u201d\nIn a Dec. 13 letter to U.S. bishops obtained by CNA and confirmed by multiple sources as authentic, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, wrote that the prefect of the Dicastery for the Clergy issued the decision on Nov. 9, adding that there was \u201cno possibility of appeal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter indicated that Pavone has been dismissed from the clerical state for \u201cblasphemous communications on social media\u201d and \u201cpersistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,\u201d CNA reported yesterday. The communication from Pierre does not specify the actions that led to Pavone\u2019s dismissal or name the bishop he disobeyed.\n\u201cFather Pavone was given ample opportunity to defend himself in the canonical proceedings, and he was also given multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop,\u201d explains a separate statement attached to Pierre\u2019s letter. \u201cIt was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions.\u201d\nThe statement refers to Pavone as \u201cMr. Pavone\u201d and calls him \u201ca lay person,\u201d underscoring the dramatic and immediate nature of the Vatican\u2019s action.\u00a0\nPavone remains defiant, calls himself \u2018Father\u2019\nPavone has continued to celebrate Mass since the Vatican's communication, including a Mass streamed online Saturday. The Priests for Life website states that Pavone \u201cis a Catholic priest in good standing, and exercises his ministry in full communion with the Catholic Church.\u201d\u00a0\nIn an email to CNA on Saturday, Pavone said that he was not aware of the Vatican\u2019s action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow did CNA learn about this before I did?\u201d he asked. In a subsequent email, he added that CNA\u2019s inquiry was \u201cthe very first communication that came to me about this.\u201d\nSaturday evening he posted a defiant statement to his followers, in which he addressed statements to Pope Francis, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, and the U.S. bishops.\u00a0\nThe statement was signed \u201cFr. Frank Pavone\u201d in spite of the Vatican\u2019s announcement that he is no longer a priest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing Pope Francis, Pavone wrote: \u201cYour Holiness, I want to continue serving as a faithful priest and full-time pro-life leader. You can allow me to do so under a supportive bishop, and many of the faithful understand that this is the most reasonable solution.\u201d\nTo Archbishop Pierre, the apostolic nuncio, he wrote: \u201cYour Excellency, your communication to the bishops dated December 13th contains serious errors and omissions. But that has marked this process all along, so there is no surprise there, and those errors will be addressed separately and thoroughly.\n\u201cBut in particular, when you say there is \u2018no possibility of appeal\u2019 to this decision, you speak only in a very narrow legal sense, and completely ignore the appeal that is being made to the People of God themselves. This is not just about me; it\u2019s about the millions of supporters of the movement I help to lead and will continue to lead, and of the work that the People of God have already evaluated and judged worthy of their ongoing support,\u201d Pavone wrote.\nHe then vowed to take legal action and make a direct appeal to his supporters.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa House passes bill to affirm personhood at moment of fertilization\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo those of you who have been part of this travesty publicly or in the shadows, we will be taking all appropriate canonical and civil action as well as public communications to the Faithful,\u201d Pavone wrote.\nIt is not clear in what diocese Pavone, 63, is incardinated as a priest. On the Priests for Life website, it says he received permission from the Vatican in 2019 to transfer from the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, where he was incardinated in 2005, to another, unnamed diocese.\nPavone hosted the show \u201cDefending Life\u201d on EWTN for many years until the bishop of Amarillo, Texas, revoked Pavone\u2019s permission to appear on the network. EWTN is the parent organization of CNA.\nA history of clashes with hierarchy\nOriginally based in Staten Island, New York, Priests for Life is now headquartered in Titusville, Florida, within the Diocese of Orlando. That diocese, also, did not respond to CNA\u2019s request for comment Saturday.\nPavone has served as the pro-life organization\u2019s national director since 1993.\nIn that role he has a long history of conflicts with bishops, beginning more than 20 years ago with the late Cardinal Edward Egan of the Archdiocese of New York. Egan succeeded the late Cardinal John J. O\u2019Connor, who ordained Pavone in 1988 and encouraged his pro-life work.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nIn his email, Pavone directed CNA to a\u00a0document\u00a0posted on his personal website titled \u201cSummary of How Fr. Frank and Priests for Life Have Been Treated by Some in the Hierarchy.\u201d\n\u201cWe all expect that the pro-abortion groups, like Planned Parenthood, will target, harass and try to intimidate us. And they do try,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cBut when such treatment comes from bishops and other Church authorities \u2014 which it increasingly does \u2014 it\u2019s particularly deplorable,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead of supporting and encouraging the pro-life work of the Church, some of these men try to obstruct and hinder it, and abuse their authority to try to intimidate priests and laity who make ending abortion the top priority of our lives.\u201d\nPavone has been at odds with Bishop Patrick J. Zurek in Amarillo since the latter became bishop there in 2008. In 2011, Zurek publicly suspended Pavone, though Pavone later had the suspension overruled by the Vatican. The Amarillo Diocese did not respond to CNA\u2019s requests for comment prior to publication.\nPavone\u2019s political activism played a role in his problems in Amarillo.\nAn outspoken supporter of former president Donald Trump, Pavone served on official Trump campaign outreach positions in 2016 and was originally a co-chair of Trump\u2019s 2020 pro-life coalition as well as an advisory board member of Catholics for Trump. Canon law forbids clerics from having an active role in political parties unless they receive the permission of their bishop.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2016, Pavone filmed a video at the Priests for Life headquarters, urging support for Trump. The video was staged with the body of an aborted baby laid before Pavone on what appeared to be an altar.\u00a0\nZurek said soon after the video\u2019s release that he would open an investigation into the incident, calling it \u201cagainst the dignity of human life\u201d and \u201ca desecration of the altar,\u201d adding that \u201cthe action and presentation of Father Pavone in this video is not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPriests for Life, \nPapal Nuncio, \nFr.
