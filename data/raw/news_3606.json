I\u2019d love to see the sanctity of life restored to the center of American law in all 50 states. But I recognize that may take as long to accomplish in every state in the country as it did to overturn Roe v. Wade\u2026\u201d\nLet\u2019s not forget: Mike Pence is the key architect of a radical policy blueprint that would ban medicated abortion pills including pills used to treat women who are suffering miscarriages.\u00a0\nNew York Times: \u201cFormer Vice President Mike Pence shared his vision for a post-Roe America on Thursday evening, supporting efforts to further limit abortion rights\u2026 and called for the end of abortion pills and \u2018mail-order abortion.\u2019\u201d\nMike Pence is on an extreme crusade to make abortion illegal in all 50 states. That\u2019s the GOP\u2019s closing midterm message.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\n\n\n\nJoin Us\n\n\nEmail address*\n\n\n\nPhone number\n\n\n\nZip code*\n\n\n Sign up to get texts.
