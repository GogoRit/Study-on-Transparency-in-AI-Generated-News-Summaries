up to 20 weeks after the state Supreme Court on Friday declined to lift a block on a six-week ban.\n    \n\n            In a 3-3 decision, the state\u2019s high court could not reach a consensus on whether it should overturn a lower court decision to strike down Iowa\u2019s restrictive \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, which was passed in 2018. The law sought to prevent doctors from performing an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant.\n    \n\n            Calling the case \u201cextraordinary,\u201d Justice Thomas D. Waterman explained in an order that lifting the block would be akin to bypassing the state legislature.\n    \n\n            \u201cWhen the statute was enacted in 2018, it had no chance of taking effect,\u201d Waterman wrote, noting that its supporters anticipated a legal challenge at a time when federal protections for abortion rights remained in effect. \u201cTo put it politely, the legislature was enacting a hypothetical law. Today, such a statute might take effect given the change in the constitutional law landscape. But uncertainty exists about whether a fetal heartbeat bill would be passed today. To begin, a different general assembly is in place than was in place in 2018, with significant turnover of membership in the intervening three election cycles.\u201d\n    \n\n            Ruth Richardson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called the ruling an \u201cenormous win\u201d that \u201cmeans that Iowans will be able to control their bodies and their futures.\u201d\n    \n\n            Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said her office was reviewing legal options.\n    \n\n            \u201cTo say that today\u2019s lack of action by the Iowa Supreme Court is a disappointment is an understatement,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement. \u201cNot only does it disregard Iowa voters who elected representatives willing to stand up for the rights of unborn children, but it has sided with a single judge in a single county who struck down Iowa\u2019s legislation based on principles that now have been flat-out rejected by the US Supreme Court.\u201d\n
