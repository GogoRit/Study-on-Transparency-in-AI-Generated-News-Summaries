These\u00a0activists\u00a0are leveraging the digital world to\u00a0capture\u00a0the intersectionality, diversity, multi-lateral,\u00a0and nuanced\u00a0range of\u00a0feminist agendas. For many, online platforms have become an integral\u00a0and\u00a0evolving space for both activism and feminism\u00a0to come together and manifest. The feminist praxis of inclusivity, voice, empowerment, sisterhood,\u00a0and engagement is at the heart of this\u00a0digital\u00a0generation of feminist human rights activism.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe power of digital activism is profound, providing an avenue for women and girls to come together, connect, expand,\u00a0and share their vision.\u00a0Digital networks allow for\u00a0low cost,\u00a0swift, inclusive,\u00a0and far-reaching campaigns that span the globe. There\u00a0have been a\u00a0whole host of\u00a0digital campaigns\u00a0led by trailblazing feminists,\u00a0leading\u00a0to an array of victories.\u00a0Clearly, one of the most\u00a0influential\u00a0and widespread digital campaigns of the last decade has been the\u00a0#MeToo movement, started\u00a0in 2006 by Tarana Burke,\u00a0an activist from the Bronx\u00a0who wanted to break her silence about sexual assault\u00a0and provide a space where victims could find solidarity and support.\u00a0A decade later\u00a0in October 2017,\u00a0the\u00a0movement grew exponentially\u00a0to expose the widespread allegations against\u00a0Harvey Weinstein.\u00a0The\u00a0campaign\u00a0has proliferated to\u00a0over\u00a085 different countries from the global\u00a0North to the global\u00a0South and has changed\u00a0key discourses on\u00a0sexual harassment and assault. The movement has left a legal\u00a0and advocacy\u00a0footprint that has involved all genders in the debate about sexual harassment and assault as well as consent.\nThese\u00a0activists\u00a0are leveraging the digital world to\u00a0capture\u00a0the intersectionality, diversity, multi-lateral,\u00a0and nuanced\u00a0range of\u00a0feminist agendas.\nWhile the\u00a0#MeToo movement\u00a0illustrates\u00a0digital activism\u00a0that\u00a0galvanised\u00a0change,\u00a0the movement has been disparate in its scope and impact globally.\u00a0Many\u00a0critics\u00a0argue that such campaigns damage the fight for\u00a0more rigorous implementation of the rule of law,\u00a0gender equality,\u00a0and ending gender-based violence. Some also argue that the movement\u00a0lacks\u00a0intersectionality,\u00a0limiting the voice of the young and those from the\u00a0global\u00a0South,\u00a0as well as\u00a0not fully\u00a0understanding the wide range of\u00a0victim\u00a0experiences.\u00a0Whilst such movements demonstrate the power of solidarity and collective digital action,\u00a0they\u00a0also\u00a0reveal\u00a0that feminist activism isn\u2019t a monolithic\u00a0and collective movement with a shared mission.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhilst digital activism has empowered many women globally and created positive change, it has also provided a vehicle for global voyeurism and spectatorship, where digital citizens observe, comment and make judgements\u00a0inciting prejudice, hatred and violence. Just as digital activism has grown, so too has cyber-hatred, trolling and bullying, which have devastating effects on the individuals as well as a campaign. Feminist campaigns bring with them the anti-feminist backlash of vitriolic and pervasive reactions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0important that digital activists do not become absorbed into a virtual vacuum that is disconnected from the physical world of activism. There is\u00a0a\u00a0wonderful world of grassroots activism that is being undertaken by courageous\u00a0individuals across the globe whose stories are never captured.\u00a0Moreover, there are many marginalised and vulnerable people living in abject poverty and conflict that\u00a0don\u2019t have access to a digital world\u00a0to highlight their plight and fight for their rights.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0approximately\u00a041% of the global population\u00a0still\u00a0do not have\u00a0regular\u00a0access to the internet,\u00a0illustrating the limited reach of digital activism in campaigns like #metoo.\u00a0In\u00a0these communities,\u00a0grassroots,\u00a0physical activism is vital in\u00a0fighting for the rights of the most\u00a0vulnerable global citizens\u00a0and\u00a0must not be forgotten.\nWhilst such movements demonstrate the power of solidarity and collective digital action,\u00a0they\u00a0also\u00a0reveal\u00a0that feminist activism isn\u2019t a monolithic\u00a0and collective movement with a shared mission.\u00a0\n\n\nFeminist\u00a0digital activism demonstrates\u00a0the\u00a0powerhouse collective\u00a0of\u00a0bright,\u00a0determined,\u00a0and impassioned\u00a0women\u00a0who aren\u2019t afraid to take up causes.\u00a0However, much more\u00a0is needed\u00a0to\u00a0ensure that\u00a0this form of activism is sustainable and truly promotes an enduring commitment to fighting for rights of women and girls.\u00a0Such digital campaigns must strongly align to grassroots causes, communities and activism. There is power in creating sustainable strategies that sees a dynamic fusion of\u00a0digital and non-digital platforms to champion the many causes of women and girls.\u00a0At its core,\u00a0activism has a social tangible fabric that nurtures its very grow and being, and this must not be lost, but captured by digital activism.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe year\u00a02020\u00a0marks\u00a0the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\u00a0Beijing Platform for Action\u00a0with a focus on the progress towards gender equality.
