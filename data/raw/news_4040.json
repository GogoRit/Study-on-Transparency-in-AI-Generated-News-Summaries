DC.\n\nANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            \u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the resistance,\u201d \u201cFemales are strong as hell\u201d and \u201cWithout Hermione, Harry would\u2019ve died in book 1\u201d are among the thousands of protest signs being held at the fourth annual Women\u2019s March taking place around the country Saturday.\n    \n\n            While the reasons why people are participating vary, President Donald Trump has been a core source of frustration for many, including Rachael Ryan in New York City. Ryan joined roughly 3,000 other people Saturday near Central Park to stand against the President.\n    \n\n            \u201cThese protests are hugely important. We cannot have four more years of Trump. He has done too much damage already,\u201d Ryan told CNN on Twitter.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael Ryan captured this photo of protesters Saturday morning in New York City. \n\ncourtesy Rachael Ryan\n\n\n\n            Ryan spotted a group of protesters in New York holding signs that read: \u201cMy milkshake brings all the girls to the MARCH,\u201d \u201cFeminism: the radical notion that women are people\u201d and \u201cGirls just wanna have fundamental rights.\u201d\n    \n\n            Another common theme seen on protest signs around the US was reproductive rights. Linda Webb saw many signs in that vein in St. Louis.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe will stand up [for] women\u2019s rights and equality!  HUGE crowd. So many young women here who are fighting for their future,\u201d Webb tweeted.\n    \n\n            Webb snapped two photos of women in St. Louis holding signs that read, \u201cMy body my choice,\u201d  \u201cWho run the world\u201d GIRLS\u201d and \u201cNo sign is big enough to list all the reasons I\u2019m here.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinda Webb took this photo at the Woman's March in St. Louis.\n\ncourtesy Linda Webb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will stand up womens rights and equality!  HUGE crowd. So many young women here who are fighting for their future,\" Linda Webb said in St. Louis. \n\ncourtesy Linda Webb\n\n\n\n            The Women\u2019s March began in response to Trump\u2019s election and has since transformed into a nationwide movement. According to the Women\u2019s March website, organizers follow eight \u201cunity principles:\u201d ending violence; protecting reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, worker\u2019s rights, civil rights, disability rights and immigrant rights; and environmental justice.\n    \n\n            The march is intended to \u201d harness the political power of diverse women and their communities to create transformative social change.\u201d\n    \n\n            Maggie Rowe attended the first Women\u2019s March at the Capitol and others around Delaware since. She was in Newark, Delaware, on Saturday and heard Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester speak \u201cabout the increasing number of women in Congress, the most we\u2019ve ever had, yet women still make up less than a quarter of US Representatives,\u201d Rowe said.\n    \n\n            During Blunt Rochester\u2019s remarks, Rowe snapped a photo of a protest sign resting in front of the podium that said, \u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the resistance.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggie Rowe attended the Women's March held in Newark, Delaware.\n\ncourtesy Maggie Rowe\n\n\n\n            In Portland, Maine, Riley Rourke attended the march with roughly 250 others.\n    \n\n            \u201cThese marches are incredibly important now more than ever with Susan Collins up for re-election and the upcoming trial of the President. It shows that women cannot and will not be silenced,\u201d Rourke told CNN on Twitter.\n    \n\n            Collins, a Republican, is a pivotal swing vote in the fight over whether to allow new witnesses during the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial of Trump, including possible new evidence from indicted Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas.\n    \n\n            While at the march in Portland, Rourke spotted the following signs: \u201cMy arms are tired\u2026from holding this sign since the 1970s!!!\u201d and \u201cWe are the granddaughters of the witches you weren\u2019t able to burn.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncourtesy Riley Rourke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncourtesy Riley Rourke\n\n\n\n  CNN\u2019s Alaa Elassar and Dakin Andone contributed to this report.
