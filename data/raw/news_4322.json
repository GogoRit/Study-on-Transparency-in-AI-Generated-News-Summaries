The UN places access to information technology as the third most important issue facing\u00a0women globally, after poverty and violence against women. Gender disparity is already entrenched\u00a0in many sectors with women in a disadvantaged position particularly in developing countries like\u00a0India. A series of factors, including literacy and education, language, time, cost, geographical\u00a0location of facilities, social and cultural norms, and women\u2019s computer and information search\u00a0and dissemination skills constrain women\u2019s access to information technology. As a result, few\u00a0women are producers of information technology, whether as internet content providers,\u00a0programmers, designers, inventors, or fixers of computers. In addition, women are alsoconspicuously absent from decision making structures in information technology in developing\u00a0countries. From the gender perspective therefore, inclusive democratic participation and\u00a0governance, entails issues of women empowerment and gender mainstreaming of public policies,\u00a0including ICT Policies and Programmes. Many people dismiss the concern for gender and IT in\u00a0developing countries on the basis that development should deal with basic needs first. However,\u00a0IT can be an important tool in meeting women\u2019s basic needs and can provide the access to resources\u00a0to lead women out of poverty. While technology is not a panacea for women\u2019s problems in\u00a0developing countries yet it offers new possibilities for women in economic, social and political\u00a0empowerment. In the context of knowledge society and information economy, it is essential that\u00a0the knowledge \u2013 sharing mechanism, recognizes the value of knowledge possessed by women and\u00a0includes their knowledge as valuable addition to the global knowledge pool. Because of their\u00a0biological and social roles, women are likely to be more rooted than men in the environment and\u00a0more aware than men of the social, economic and environmental needs of their own communities. 89.

Why do some people feel concerned for gender and IT in developing countries? (1) Technology is a panacia for women\u2019s problems in developing countries (2) It can offer new possibilities for women in economic, social and political empowerment (3) IT can level gender in-equalities (4) IT can bring independence and prosperity to women Answer: (2) 94.\u00a0Assertion (A):\u00a0Women are more aware that men of the social, economic and environmental\u00a0needs of their own communities. Reason (R):\u00a0Women, being lesser educated than men have little concern for IT jobs and are more interested in the communities for fulfillment of their psychic\u00a0gratification. Code: (1) (A) is correct but (R) is wrong and (R) is not the correct explanation for (A) (2) Both (A) and (R) are correct and (R) is the correct explanation for (A) (3) (A) is wrong but (R) is correct (4) Both (A) and (R) are wrong Answer: (1) Read the passage given below and answer the question numbers 95 to 100: In the context of feminism, concepts like \u2019autonomy\u2019, \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018choice\u2019 can be read only\u00a0within the historical context of their utterance. It is important to recall that the language of selfreliance\u00a0and non-alignment of a pre-liberalised era also, stemmed from a desire for freedom and\u00a0dignity. Issues of class, caste, tribe, poverty and social justice formed an intrinsic part of feminist\u00a0struggles in India, both in colonial and independent India. Autonomous women\u2019s groups which emerged in the 1970s debated with women\u2019s organizations of the left about the centrality of class\u00a0in the latter\u2019s formulation, a matter which tended in their view to obfuscate the specificity of the\u00a0women\u2019s question. Both groups have moved a long way since then. While left groups have played\u00a0a visible role in the women\u2019s movement, autonomous groups have increasingly taken up questions\u00a0of economic deprivation and matters of class. The Dalit women\u2019s movement in turn has expressed\u00a0dissatisfaction with upper-caste women activists in both the left and the autonomous women\u2019s\u00a0movements. But the core concern with social justice and in-equality however defined, has remained\u00a0constant. In contrast, the popular representation of feminism in the media reflects a retreat from\u00a0questions of class, caste and social justice. Quite clearly, feminism is read here as a matter of the\u00a0individual women\u2019s right to choose. The woman concerned is either the corporate woman or the\u00a0high -powered consumer. A deliberate break is saught to be made with the women\u2019s movement,\u00a0but the language used for the construction of her image is often appropriated from the women\u2019s\u00a0movement. One noticeable example is the way International Women\u2019s day is marked in the media.\u00a0If has been traditionally celebrated by women\u2019s organizations and other political forces that aligned\u00a0themselves with democratic and progressive forces. We now have a riot of ads with the specific\u00a0day\u2019s messages appearing on 8th March every year. 95.
