The critique is truly delicious. In essence, the thesis is that we are racist for promoting our \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter\u201d campaign.\n\nFrom the word go, Vice doesn\u2019t like us. That\u2019s definitely worth noting. Like many youth-focused, trendy news outlets, they\u2019re all for abortion. So regardless of what we do, they aren\u2019t going to be on board. That said, this is still a tough critique to sell. We are racist for saying that Black babies matter, too?\nOh, but it\u2019s not simply the message that is driving abortion supporters crazy. It\u2019s the\u00a0timing. See, we aren\u2019t allowed to address current social issues as they relate to our organization\u2019s mission. There are a lot of extra rules that apply to the pro-life movement and no one else. Nevermind that the pro-life movement has been decrying abortion and Planned Parenthood as racist institutions for literal decades. Students for Life\u2019s Michele Hendrickson said it best after our painting event in Washington, D.C.:\n\nMission-based organizations ebb and flow with current issues. When it came out in 2015 that Planned Parenthood was trafficking baby parts, we spent ALL our time working to expose that as well as every other thing we hate about them. When an election rolls around, we spend a lot of time talking about abortion and politics. When the ACLU was trying to remove safety regulations from chemical abortion, we poured tons of energy into spreading the word about how harmful chemical abortion is.\nWhy would it make any sense for us to fully ignore this issue right now while EVERYONE is talking about it?\nMaybe, just maybe, if the pro-life movement had NEVER talked about abortion and the Black community before, the Vice article might have half a point. Only half a point because abortion still disproportionately harms non-white women. But it\u2019s just not the case. Look at someone like Mildred Jefferson. She was born in 1927 and died in 2010. She was the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, and she fully rejected abortion. She is credited with changing Ronald Reagan himself\u2019s mind on the issue, and spent years as a leader in the pro-life movement.\nAnd look at someone like Dr. Dolores Bernadette Grier, who graduated from Fordham University, passed away in 2018, and spent much of her life as a pro-life advocate.\n\nPlus, it is real rich of the abortion movement to accuse\u00a0anyone\u00a0of hijacking an issue. The abortion movement wouldn\u2019t even exist without its parasitic, toxic attachment to feminism that it secured during the Sexual Revolution of the 60s. Author Sue Ellen Browder does an excellent job explaining how abortion hijacked feminism in her book\u00a0Subverted.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re not sorry that this message is uncomfortable for people. And we\u2019re not going to apologize that this completely accurate message is timely with our nation\u2019s current climate. Planned Parenthood kills about 360 Black babies every day, and that should bother Americans.\nIn fact, all of this should deeply bother Americans:\n\nBlack women have the\u00a0highest abortion rate\u00a0by far (nearly\u00a0half\u00a0of pregnancies end in abortion in many places).\nAlmost\u00a080% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion facilities\u00a0are located in minority neighborhoods.\n88% of its new \u201cmega facilities\u201d\u00a0are located within walking distance of minority neighborhoods.\nThe\u00a0abortion ratio\u00a0is 401 abortions per 1,000 live births.\nIn some cities, like New York,\u00a0more black babies are aborted\u00a0than born.\nIn America today, a black child is\u00a0five times more likely\u00a0to be killed in the womb than a white child.\nAbout 13% of American women are Black, but they submit to\u00a0over 38% of the abortions.\nMore African-Americans have died from abortion than from\u00a0AIDS, accidents, violent crimes, cancer, and heart disease\u00a0combined. It\u2019s estimated that\u00a019 million\u00a0Black babies have been killed by abortion since its legalization.\nSince 1973, abortion has reduced the Black population by over 25%.*\n\n*Arrived at by multiplying an estimated population total of 325,719,178 by 13.4%:\u00a0https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217\u00a0\nBut sure. We\u2019re\u00a0the racist ones.\n\n Post Views: 1,503\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
