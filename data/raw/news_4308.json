This is the first major opinion poll\u00a0since the Republic of Ireland voted yes in their referendum on abortion law.\nNorthern Ireland has one of the strictest bans on abortion in the world\u00a0with women in almost every circumstance facing up to life in prison for a termination.\nOur research looks separately at attitudes in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK\u00a0(England, Scotland, Wales)\u00a0separately to compare opinions on both sides of the Irish Sea.\n65% of adults in Northern Ireland agree\u00a0that abortion should not be a crime, with the number rising to a massive 81% in the rest of the UK.\n\nGrainne Teggart, our Northern Ireland Campaign Manager, said:\n\u201cOur research shows landslide support for reform to Northern Ireland\u2019s repressive abortion law. Every part of the UK agrees that abortion should be decriminalised and that Westminster should legislate for change.\n\u201cThis confirms what we\u2019ve long known - that most people in Northern Ireland and across the UK agree that it\u2019s completely wrong for Northern Irish women to be governed by an archaic law that denies them their rights, health and autonomy.\n\nUntil now reform has been put off due to the political climate in Northern Ireland, which currently doesn't have a government. But our poll shows that 66% of Northern Irish adults think that, without their own government, Westminster should act to change the law.\n\nYou can help us fight for change in Northern Ireland today. Almost 50,000 people have signed our petition to the UK government asking them to reform the law. Add your name today to help keep the pressure up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          18 May 2020, 02:38pm\n        \n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related\n\n\nTell UK gov to reform the law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While you\u2019re here\u2026\nLike you, we are horrified by the violence and the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
