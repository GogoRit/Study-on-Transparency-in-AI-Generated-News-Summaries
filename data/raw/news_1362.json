Our Cruel New Abortion Law Has Made My Life Absolute Hell.\"They suggested I should simply carry the fetus to term and watch it die a slow, painful death before burying it in a child-sized coffin.\"By\u00a0Alyssa GonzalesGuest WriterOct 21, 2022, 08:30 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTThe author with her fianc\u00e9 and their son.Courtesy of Alyssa GonzalesOn June 21, 2022 \u2014 just three days before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization came out \u2014 I got the news: I was pregnant.The timing was less than ideal: I had just given birth to a baby boy only three months earlier. My body had barely recovered from the last pregnancy, and my fianc\u00e9 and I simply were not ready to have another child. We were both working hard to keep food on the table for our newborn son, and physically, emotionally, and certainly financially, we were barely staying afloat. We just weren\u2019t sure we could make another baby work right now.Advertisement\n\nBut after talking to each other, to our family, and to God, we eventually came to a decision together: We would keep the baby. We would make it work. Despite my initial nervousness about how we would afford it as two low-wage workers, I couldn\u2019t help but smile, thinking about welcoming another little one into our growing family. With the same excited energy we felt with our firstborn son, we again started thinking about names and dreaming about who they might become.Then, just a few months later, I got news that no mother ever wants to hear: My sweet little baby tested positive for Trisomy 18 \u2014 a severe genetic condition affecting how the baby\u2019s body develops and grows in utero. The follow-up appointments wrenched my heart in two. The ultrasound techs and high-risk pregnancy doctors pored over photos of the fetus I carried inside me \u2014 I was now 16 weeks pregnant \u2014 and ultimately found that its brain was not developing, it had two holes in its heart, and there was no bone in its nose at all. Advertisement\n\n\n\nThe bottom line: There was no way this fetus would ever survive. Almost cruelly, they went ahead and told me what might have otherwise been welcome news: \u201cIt\u2019s a little baby boy.\u201dStill, my doctor told me there was a 9% chance the tests were wrong and that I could have amniocentesis just to confirm. I said yes without hesitation. A chance is a chance, and I so desperately wanted to hold my baby boy in my arms. But it wasn\u2019t meant to be, and further testing merely confirmed what in my heart I knew all along: I would never meet my sweet boy or see the person he would grow up to be.Advertisement\n\nIt turns out, however, the worst was yet to come.Less than a year ago, the next step would have been obvious: We needed to terminate the pregnancy so that the clearly unviable fetus would not cause further complications for my own health. And, frankly, I just needed to close this severely traumatic chapter in my life.But as I would soon learn, this basic and obvious health care decision was no longer mine to make. After the Dobbs decision, Alabama\u2019s trigger law went into effect and banned abortion almost completely \u2014 with only extremely narrow exceptions. Despite language in that trigger law that could possibly be interpreted as allowing an abortion in my specific case, the hospital I was at made it clear to me that it did not view it as an exception. If I wanted an abortion, I would need to travel somewhere else.\u201cThis growing fetus inside me that had once given me so much hope and joy was now a painful, heavy, and cruel reminder of what could have been.\u201dInstead, they suggested I should simply carry the fetus to term and watch it die a slow, painful death before burying it in a child-sized coffin.I was mortified. I just wanted this to be over. This growing fetus inside me that had once given me so much hope and joy was now a painful, heavy, and cruel reminder of what could have been.Advertisement\n\nAnd while I\u2019m sure other women with money could have easily packed up their lives and flown across the country to get the care they needed, that simply wasn\u2019t an option for me. We had no money. I had just stopped working to raise our first child, and my fianc\u00e9 and I certainly couldn\u2019t take time off, drive across the country, stay in some expensive hotel, and book an appointment with an abortion provider that wouldn\u2019t accept my insurance.I had no idea what to do. I was scared. I was traumatized. And I was beginning to get angry that anyone in the greatest country in the world could possibly find themselves in this situation. I wanted it to be over.Until this point, I wasn\u2019t really a political person. I barely kept up with the news. But as I grappled with this chaos, I began to realize no politician seemed to understand what I was going through. Certainly, I thought, this was not about being \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 my baby wasn\u2019t going to survive! Whose life were they supporting here? But neither did this feel like a \u201cchoice,\u201d either. I wanted to give birth to this baby. I wanted to hear his laugh and his cries. I wanted to watch the man he would one day become. But I couldn\u2019t. I did not have a choice. I just needed health care, and doctors in Alabama refused to give it to me.After tear-filled conversations about my situation with family members, someone finally pointed me to a partial solution. In the wake of the Dobbs decision, many abortion funds have popped up to help people like me travel out-of-state to get the care we need.\u201cSouthern women can no longer bear the brunt of Congress\u2019s reluctance to pass nationwide protections for reproductive rights.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nSo after working through some logistics with a fund that focused on helping low-income Southern women get the health care they needed out-of-state, I loaded up my infant son in the car with my fianc\u00e9 and his parents, and we drove eleven hours from rural Alabama to an abortion provider in Washington, D.C.Finally, on the morning of Oct. 6, 2022 \u2014 at 18 weeks, 3 days pregnant and many weeks later than I would have wanted \u2014 I was able to get the care I needed.While I was extremely grateful for an end to this traumatic experience, the clinic there was harrowing in its own way. The waiting room, filled to the brim with dozens of young women \u2014 almost all Black and Latina \u2014 brought me face-to-face with other women enduring horrific conditions and wearing the same tired, scared and pained looks on their face. A look I knew all too well. One Black mother told me through tears that she had traveled hundreds of miles with her daughter to be here, but given how packed this clinic was with out-of-state patients, they couldn\u2019t even guarantee they would be able to honor her appointment that day.At the end of it all, I knew I couldn\u2019t stay silent. Despite an initial shame about what I had been through, I ultimately decided I had to tell my story. Because when I got to that clinic, I knew that I wasn\u2019t alone. Every single day, low-income women \u2014 disproportionately women of color in the South \u2014 wake up to the dreaded realization that they are trapped. In Alabama. In Georgia. In Mississippi. In Tennessee. In conservative states across this country.Something has to change. Southern women can no longer bear the brunt of Congress\u2019s reluctance to pass nationwide protections for reproductive rights. Leaving this issue to the states has already failed to protect us from prying politicians who would force their dystopian morality into our medical decisions. And if Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has his way, the problem could get exponentially worse, as every 15-weeks-pregnant woman in every part of the country would have to leave the country to get the medical care they needed.Advertisement\n\nLooking back, I wouldn\u2019t wish my experience on my worst enemy. And I will do whatever it takes to make sure no young woman ever has to experience what I did ever again.It\u2019s time, once and for all, for Congress to codify Roe v. Wade and protect women like me from the life-long trauma that these abortion laws have inflicted upon us.Alyssa Gonzales is a 23-year-old mother living in Alabama with her fianc\u00e9, Clay, and her baby boy.
