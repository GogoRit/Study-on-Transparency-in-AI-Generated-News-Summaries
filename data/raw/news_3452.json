The anti-abortion movement is likely to be unbound from the limitations of Roe v. Wade soon, and Dickson\u2019s more aggressive arm of the movement \u2014 once dismissed as a radical outlier \u2014 seems primed to take the fight to previously unimaginable places.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nNearly 50 years ago, a high school freshman in Alief was in her sex education class when another student asked the teacher about abortion.\nIt was the first time Kyleen Peloquen, then 14, had heard the word.\nWith the teacher disinclined to provide details, she ran home to ask for an explanation. Her dad, a member of the school board, mumbled his way through a nonanswer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen she finally learned what abortion was, she made up her mind to stop it.\nDecades later, the teenager, now Kyleen Wright, remains one of the state\u2019s most vocal opponents to abortion rights, heading up Texans for Life \u2014 one group in a powerful but fractured movement that has spent the last five decades fighting to overturn the constitutional protection for abortion that is laid out in Roe v. Wade.\nMeanwhile, a new generation of more radical torchbearers has emerged from the marriage of convenience between the religious right and the conservative politicians who rose to power with their help.\nNow, they\u2019re on the precipice of achieving a dream nearly 50 years in the making: A leaked draft Supreme Court opinion indicates a majority of justices may be willing to overturn Roe v. Wade and throw abortion enforcement back to the states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Texas organizations have played an outsized role in bringing the national anti-abortion movement to this critical juncture \u2014 and as the old guard and new leaders debate their next moves, the future of the fight hangs in the balance.\nThe early days of a movement\nWright got involved with the anti-abortion movement at an important moment, just a few years after Roe v. Wade outlawed Texas\u2019 total ban on the procedure in 1973.\nBefore that, abortion had been illegal in Texas for more than 100 years, and the fragmented, unfocused anti-abortion movement was just finding its direction.\nSo when Wright began her anti-abortion activism during high school, doing postcard-writing campaigns and similar grassroots actions, there wasn\u2019t much of a playbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had to create everything from whole cloth,\u201d Wright said.\nJoseph Graham, a Catholic philosophy professor in Houston, and others launched Texas Right to Life around that same time. The group spawned several local chapters that have since become preeminent anti-abortion organizations in their own right.\nOne such chapter was formed in the 1980s by Joe Pojman, who first started an anti-abortion student group when he was in grad school at the University of Texas at Austin in 1986. Friends had told him about negative abortion experiences, including one who had gotten a secret abortion as a teen in Houston.\n\u201cI sensed great regret,\u201d Pojman said. \u201cI felt like it was time to get involved in the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2001, the group had morphed into the independent Texas Alliance for Life, and Pojman had gotten a doctorate in aerospace engineering \u2014 but chose to forgo a career as a rocket scientist in favor of running the group full time.\nAt the time these groups started to form, Democrats controlled the Texas Legislature and statewide offices, and the opposition to abortion was mostly relegated to the churches, the activists and the evangelical grassroots.\nWith little hope of effecting significant legislative action on abortion, the movement focused mostly on what Texas Right to Life legislative director John Seago called \u201cprayerful presence\u201d at abortion clinics and supporting the newly developing network of crisis pregnancy centers.\nBut the political winds were shifting in Texas, thanks in part to the growing influence of these groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new power couple\u00a0\nIn 1994, a candidate for Texas Republican Party chair took the stage at the party\u2019s convention in Fort Worth.\n\u201cThere are those people in this audience that want the Republican Party to be a church,\u201d Dolly Madison McKenna told the crowd at the convention center. \u201cBut the Republican Party is not a church.\u201d\nMcKenna was booed and catcalled, according to a New York Times article from the time, and finished a distant third.\nThat was no accident. In the two decades since Roe v. Wade was decided, the Republican Party, led by Texas strategists like Karl Rove, had harnessed anti-abortion passion to turn apolitical congregants into reliable GOP voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs they slowly gained power in the statehouse, Republican lawmakers returned the favor to their newfound base. They established rights for any baby that survived an abortion or was born prematurely, required abortion facilities to be regulated and banned abortions with limited exceptions in the third trimester.\nBy the late 1990s, the Christian right and the Texas Republicans were a political power couple \u2014 influencing, as a team, everything from redistricting to public education, and injecting social issues like abortion and gay marriage into the heart and soul of Texas politics.\n\u201cThere was a synergism between the growth of the Republican Party and the growth of the pro-life movement,\u201d Pojman said. \u201cAs the pro-life movement grew, it helped the Republican Party grow. As the Republican Party gained, it helped the pro-life movement.\u201d\nPojman remembers the modern anti-abortion movement\u2019s first big win in the Texas Legislature: the 1999 passage of a bill requiring doctors to notify a teenager\u2019s parents before she got an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party that had batted away the abortion opposition for so long fell two elections later, with control of the Legislature and all the statewide offices shifting to Republicans for the first time in 130 years.\nSince 1999, more than 50 laws supported by anti-abortion groups have been passed in the Texas Legislature, including budget provisions that banned state funds to abortion providers while funneling some $200 million to the secretive \u201cAlternatives to Abortion\u201d program.\nAlternatives to Abortion channels money to a far-flung network of nonprofits \u2014 many of them ardently anti-abortion \u2014 to pay for counseling, classes and baby items for pregnant women and mothers of young children.\nA majority \u2014 78% \u2014 of Texans believe abortion should be allowed in some form, according to a recent University of Texas poll. Nationally, attitudes toward abortion have remained fairly steady since the 1970s, with less than a fifth of all Americans believing the procedure should be banned outright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut abortion opponents in Texas haven\u2019t let that stand in their way. While Roe v. Wade stopped them from enacting an outright ban on abortion, the Legislature managed to restrict access in other ways \u2014 and provided other states with a blueprint for similar efforts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re often the ones blazing a new trail,\u201d Seago said.\nAs the movement gathered speed, leading anti-abortion organizations started to splinter on how they should handle their success. Some groups advocated for a more aggressive approach to future goals, while others warned against legislation that could spark expensive and perhaps precedent-setting lawsuits.\nIn 2013, after securing a Republican supermajority in the statehouse, Texas passed an omnibus abortion bill that required clinics to meet hospital-like standards, mandated that abortion providers have admitting privileges at hospitals and banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis famously filibustered for 13 hours to block the bill, which eventually passed anyway. As some groups had feared, abortion providers succeeded in getting much of that law blocked in a landmark decision before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nBut the 20-week ban remained in place, despite being in opposition to Roe v. Wade, which prohibits bans on abortion before fetal viability, usually around 22 to 24 weeks.\n\u201cSo to us, that ended up being a huge pro-life victory,\u201d Seago said.\nTheir opponents who advocated for abortion rights found it impossible to fight back the ever-quickening breakdown of Roe v. Wade in Texas in spite of their occasional legal wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party was in a free-fall in Texas, and the anti-abortion movement had a much easier message to rally the emotional grassroots.\n\u201cOur talking points of defending something and pointing people in the way of righteousness and goodness and good health are really hard to communicate,\u201d said Kae McLaughlin, who often went toe-to-toe with Pojman and Wright as head of the Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. \u201cEspecially when they can just scare the shit out of people with, \u2018Abortion is murder,\u2019\u201d and ignore the consequences of forced birth.\u201d\nNew generation, new strategy\nAnti-abortion activist Mark Lee Dickson was born 13 years after Roe v. Wade was decided, into a family that was already active in trying to reverse the ruling.\nDickson\u2019s grandfather headed Right to Life of East Texas. As a child, Dickson would go visit the group\u2019s booth at the county fair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the table, they had these fetal models \u2026 at different stages of pregnancy,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember holding the 12-week fetal model and saw the eyes and the mouth and the nose and the ears and thinking, \u2018It\u2019s a baby.\u2019\u201d\nHe got more actively involved in the movement after his grandfather died in 2006. The more he learned about what he calls the \u201clittle massacres\u201d happening at abortion clinics every day, the more he started to advocate for more urgent action.\nDickson was originally viewed by many of his peers as a fringe character, particularly when he first started advancing his big idea \u2014 getting cities to pass local ordinances outlawing abortion.\nWhen Waskom \u2014 on the state\u2019s border with Louisiana, with population 1,887 \u2014 became the first so-called \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d in June 2019, it didn\u2019t make significant waves. But these local ordinances, which are now on the books in 49 cities in Texas and other states, would radically change the trajectory of the entire anti-abortion movement.\nWorking with state Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, and former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, Dickson crafted these ordinances to be enforced through private civil lawsuits \u2014 not state action.\nThis clever sidestep of Roe v. Wade became the framework for Texas\u2019s Senate Bill 8, which banned abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. The law divided the abortion opposition \u2014 groups like Texas Right to Life jumped on board, even creating a website where people could report possible violations of the law. But other groups, including Pojman\u2019s Alliance for Life, didn\u2019t endorse the law, citing concerns about legal challenges.\n\u201cI understand that not everyone was on board with this to start, but we were just at a point where we were saying that we\u2019ve got to think outside the box,\u201d Dickson said.\nAbortion providers challenged the law before the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 which allowed the law to stand.\n\u201cThe Texas case showed the Supreme Court that \u2026 one way or another, abortion was going to end in Texas,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting this done, and we did all this with Roe on the books.\u201d\nThe anti-abortion movement is likely to be unbound from the limitations of Roe v. Wade soon, and this more aggressive arm of the movement \u2014 once dismissed as a radical outlier \u2014 seems primed to take the fight to previously unimaginable places.\nThe next frontier\u00a0\nIf the Supreme Court does overturn Roe v. Wade, Texas will automatically ban abortion with exceptions only to save the life of the mother.\nThis culminates a lifetime of work for those who have been on the battle lines over abortion for decades \u2014 and opens a whole new world of potential advocacy.\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting that bumper sticker on my car any time soon, the one that says \u2018I\u2019m going sailing,\u2019 because there will be a tremendous amount to do,\u201d Pojman said.\nWhere lawmakers decide to focus will depend on which part of the movement they listen to.\nThere are some areas of agreement among the anti-abortion groups: They want to tighten enforcement of existing abortion laws and increase regulation of nonimplanted, frozen embryos in IVF treatment, among other goals.\nBut some of the disagreements within the movement are vast.\nFor Pojman and Wright, prosecuting mothers for illegal abortions represents a bright red line.\n\u201cTotally off the table. We just don\u2019t believe in that,\u201d Pojman said of his group, which also opposes restricting access to birth control. \u201cThere was no reported case of a woman prosecuted for abortion in Texas or any other state before 1973 (when Roe came out). So that\u2019s not something we want to pursue at all, and we discourage attempts to do that.\u201d\nBut \u201cfive to 10 years\u201d from now, Dickson said, after all the abortion clinics are shut down and all the loopholes closed, he could see Texas considering legislation that criminalizes the person who got the abortion.\n\u201cIf a human being is a human being from the point of conception, then we\u2019ve got to have equal justice accordingly,\u201d he said, drawing a comparison between \u201cthe mother who drowns her 2-month-old in a bathtub and the mother who intentionally ends the life of her child in the womb.\u201d\nHe also wants to ban access to emergency contraception, known as Plan B. Plan B can be purchased over-the-counter; in 2013, the Food and Drug Administration dropped age requirements.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be on the market, period,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if our nation were to dial things back and say, hey, you have to be 18 to purchase this, I still think it\u2019s a horrible, horrible idea.\u201d\nFor Wright\u2019s group, Texans For Life, where members are of different faiths, there\u2019s no consensus among her supporters on this issue.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say that because she takes the morning-after pill, she\u2019s killed a fertilized egg because we don\u2019t know that,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt can take a week for an egg to be fertilized. There\u2019s too much we don\u2019t know. We try to stay on the things that have broad support from our members.\u201d\nThese will be the questions legislators will have to navigate when they return to the Capitol in January, at which point Roe v. Wade may be a thing of the past. Then, it will be up to those legislators, as well as the advocates who have their ears and the voters they ultimately answer to, to decide how far this movement is willing to go.\n\n\n\n\nShare your story\nThis form requires JavaScript to complete.\nPowered by Screendoor.\n\n\nDisclosure: New York Times and University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
