In the case of pregnant women, he said this will help doctors immediately know which women should not get X-rays or certain medicines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNobody is creating a pregnancy register in Poland,\u201d he told the TVN24 all-news station.But Marta Lempart, the leader of a women\u2019s rights group, Women\u2019s Strike, said she does not trust the government to keep information on women\u2019s pregnancies from the police and prosecutors. She told The Associated Press that police in Poland are already questioning women on how their pregnancies end, tipped off by disgruntled partners.\n\n\u201cBeing pregnant means that police can come to you any time and prosecutors can come to you to ask you questions about your pregnancy,\u201d Lempart said.The new system means many Polish women will now avoid the state medical system during their pregnancies, with wealthier women seeking private treatment or traveling abroad, even for prenatal care. Meanwhile, poorer women in Poland will face an increased risk of medical problems or even death by avoiding prenatal care, Lempart fears.Lempart also worries that information gained by police could be shared with state media to harm people\u2019s reputations. She already knows how that can happen. In 2020, Lempart tested positive for COVID-19, and the information was reported by state television even before she got her results.Poland \u2014 a predominantly Catholic country \u2014 bans abortion in almost all cases, with exceptions only when a woman\u2019s life or health is endangered or if the pregnancy results from rape or incest.For years, abortion was allowed in the case of fetuses with congenital defects. That exception was struck down by the constitutional court in 2020.\n\nIn practice, Polish women seeking to terminate their pregnancies order abortions pills or travel to Germany, the Czech Republic and other countries where the procedure is allowed. While self-administering abortion pills is legal, helping someone else is not.Activist Justyna Wydrzy\u0144ska is facing up to three years in prison for helping a victim of domestic violence access abortion pills. Amnesty International says it is the first such case in Europe. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
