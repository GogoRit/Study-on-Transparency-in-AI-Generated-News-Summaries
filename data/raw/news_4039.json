I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose, to choose when to have my children, and with whom.When I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing as all mothers know that the scales must and will tip towards our children. Now, I know my choices might look different than yours. But thank god, or whomever you pray to, that we live in a country founded on the principle that I am free to live by my faith and you are free to live by yours.So women, 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest. It's what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them. But don't forget, we are the largest voting body in this country. Let's make it look more like us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNBC Entertainment\n@nbc\n\n\nMichelle Williams accepts The Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie. #GoldenGlobes\n\n\n04:20 AM - 06 Jan 2020\n\n\nReply\nRetweet\nFavorite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer speech comes at a time when multiple states have taken action to restrict access to abortion services and pressure from Congress to overturn Roe v.
