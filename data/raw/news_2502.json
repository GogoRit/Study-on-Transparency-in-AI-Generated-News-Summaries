Mike DeWine\u2019s regular public briefings on the coronavirus. But not everyone shared the sentiments of the 132,000-plus in her Facebook fan club: She was harshly criticized for health orders that restricted Ohioans during the pandemic, and gun-toting protesters showed up outside her suburban Columbus home to demand the state reopen immediately.She stepped down as health director June 11, citing pressures of the job as a factor in resigning, but is staying on at the same $236,330 annual salary as DeWine\u2019s health adviser.The claims appeared on LifeNews.com, which \u201cis an independent news agency devoted to reporting news that affects the pro-life community,\u201d per its website.Unpacking the claimsThe Facebook posts contain four basic claims. Let\u2019s take them in order.No. 1: Acton was an \u201cactivist\u201d for the campaign of Barack Obama.In March 2008, Acton (under the name Amy Beech, from a previous marriage) was featured in a Wired.com article about Barack Obama\u2019s then-revolutionary campaign strategy to use social media and other digital tools to recruit volunteers for the Democratic primary battle with Hillary Clinton. Acton and her family were photographed around a laptop computer by former Dispatch photographer Neal Lauron.The Wired story describes how this \u201cpart-time physician has spent the last couple of months building up her network of local Obama supports using an e-mail group she created on my.BarackObama.com called \u2019Bexley, Yes We Can!\u2019 She says the group has between 40 and 50 members. Beech also maintains a separate e-mail list of friends, family and acquaintances with about 150 names.\u201dWhile the Wired account describes Acton as a \u201cvolunteer\u201d for the Obama campaign, \u201cactivist\u201d seems a fair description.However, it apparently didn\u2019t last long. Aaron Pickrell, who ran Obama\u2019s general election effort that year in Ohio, doesn\u2019t recall Acton being involved in the fall campaign against GOP Sen. John McCain.Acton and her husband, Douglas Beech, filed for a dissolution of marriage on Oct. 10, 2008. The request was granted about a month later, on Nov. 12. She married Eric Acton on June 10, 2010.While Acton took a Democratic ballot in the March 4, 2008, primary \u2014 which is how party affiliation is determined in Ohio \u2014 she did not declare a party again until the May 2018 primary, when she again obtained a Democratic ballot. DeWine was on the Republican ballot in that election. Acton also voted in the 2020 primary but only for issues, not declaring a party affiliation.The LifeNews article said Acton\u2019s political background \u201craises questions about the vetting process that DeWine\u2019s office engaged in prior to Acton\u2019s nomination.\u201dDeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said, \u201cWho one supported in the 2008 campaign did not come up in her interview with the governor. It was not relevant.\u201d Acton was the first female health director in Ohio history.No. 2: Acton has \u201cties to abortion charities.\u201dThis claim stems from Acton\u2019s work at the Columbus Foundation, where she was a Community Research and Grants Management officer for about a year and-a-half before DeWine completed his cabinet with her selection in February 2019.\u201cAmong the approximately 1,000 nonprofit organizations for which the Columbus Foundation solicits donations (are) Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and the NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Foundation. These fell under the purvue (sic) of Amy Acton,\u201d the Operation Rescue article asserts.The Columbus Foundation recently completed its \u201cBig Give\u201d campaign, which raised more than $32 million for over 1,100 nonprofits. As in years past, among the potential recipients a donor could select were indeed Planned Parenthood and NARAL. But so were the Pregnancy Decision Health Centers, which has several facilities in the Columbus area that counsel against abortion, and Heartbeat International, whose stated mission is \u201cto make abortion unwanted today and unthinkable for future generations.\u201dColumbus Foundation officials say 96% of its donations are like these, sent to causes specified by the donor. Acton had nothing to do with where that money went.Like other grants officers, she was part of a team primarily evaluating requests for the nondesignated 4% of donations to the foundation. Acton\u2019s specialty was assisting homeless youth. Acton herself says she was homeless for a winter growing up in Youngstown, Ohio.To conclude that her work at a huge foundation that gave money to organizations both advocating for and fighting against abortion shows her \u201cties to abortion charities\u201d is specious at best.No. 3. Acton used \u201ca duplicitous paperwork shuffle\u201c to keep open a suburban Dayton abortion clinic.This claim builds on the supposed bond between Acton and NARAL and Planned Parenthood.\u201cThis connection between Acton and these two abortion organizations raises questions about Acton\u2019s actions in the paperwork shuffle that allowed the Women\u2019s Med Center \u2014 previously deemed \u2019untrustworthy\u2019 by the (Ohio Department of Health) \u2014 to become licensed to conduct abortions after four years of litigation found that its license should be denied.\u201dThe allegation stems from a long-running battle over Women\u2019s Med Center in Dayton, operated by Dr. Martin Haskell \u2014 despised among many abortion rights opponents because he conducted numerous late-term procedures they dubbed \u201cpartial-birth abortions.\u201dMore:Ohio health director Amy Acton unexpectedly resigns amid coronavirus pandemicThen-state Health Director Rick Hodges revoked the clinic\u2019s license in 2016, because it did not meet two requirements of Ohio law: The facility did not have a formal agreement with a nearby hospital to accept patients transferred from the clinic if something went wrong, and the clinic did not have enough backup physicians for emergencies.But the Dayton center remained open even as it lost several court challenges of those regulations, including one at the Ohio Supreme Court in August 2019. A couple of days later, Acton informed the clinic that with the high court\u2019s ruling, its state license was finally revoked for good. Any attempt to reopen would require an application for a new license, she said.In late October, Ohio justices turned down the clinic\u2019s request to reconsider its 4-3 decision. Anti-abortion advocates grew hopeful that Dayton\u2019s last facility finally would be forced to shut down. But well before than happened, the clinic did ask for a new license in late August. For the first time, it named four physicians who would serve as backup doctors. With that state requirement met, the clinic asked for a waiver of the obligation to also have a transfer agreement with a local hospital.More:An 'alarming' exodus: public health officials fighting coronavirus depart amid growing threats, nonstop workActon granted that request on Oct. 25, 2019, and a new one-year license was issued Nov. 5 to what was now called Women\u2019s Med Dayton.Ohio Right to Life, the state\u2019s most prominent anti-abortion rights organization, did not like the decision but did not question its legality.Ohio has a precedent for waiving the requirement for a transfer agreement when four doctors agree to provide the required backup care. That\u2019s what happened in May 2016, when Hodges gave a license to a Cincinnati clinic run by Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio.But to Operation Rescue, Acton\u2019s action was the \u201cduplicitous paperwork shuffle.\u201d And that dubious claim was the basis for its leader to assert, \u201cIt is obvious that there was coordination between Acton and Haskell to pull a fast one on the people of Ohio and the attorney general\u2019s office, which spent untold time and resources over four years to successfully enforce the original licensing denial order.\u201dWhat he failed to mention was that the Ohio attorney general \u2014 supposed victim of the \u201cfast one\u201d \u2014 was DeWine for all but 10 months of the four-year period.During a press conference after being hired by DeWine in February 2019, Acton said she does not have a position on abortion, but that she would enforce Ohio law.No. 4. The Dayton abortion clinic is allowed \u201dto abort babies up to birth\u201cA 2011 Ohio law states: \u201cNo person shall purposely perform or induce or attempt to perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman when the unborn child is viable.\u201c Exceptions are made for non-viable fetuses or if the woman would otherwise sustain \u201dthe substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201cFact check: COVID-19 can cause worse lung damage than smoking Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine has been nearly 20 years in the making Fact check: Not likely that COVID-19 vaccine was cause of Hank Aaron's death Fact check: What's true about COVID-19, its vaccine, face masks and seasonal flu?In 2017, another state law took effect barring abortions beyond 20 weeks past gestation, with the same general exceptions.Thus no state license can be granted \u201cto abort babies up to birth.\u201dOur ruling: Partly\u00a0falseThe Operation Rescue and LifeNews articles by Cheryl Sullenger \u2014 who served two years in federal prison in the late 1980s for conspiring to bomb a San Diego abortion clinic \u2014 contain an impressive amount of documentation, from court records to filings by the Ohio Department of Health. It\u2019s in the interpretation of those legitimate sources of information where this train runs off its rails.The only verifiable portion of the claims examined is that Acton is indeed a \u201cformer Obama activist,\u201d at least for the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. This claim is TRUE.Her \u201cties to abortion charities\u201d shown by her work at the Columbus Foundation are so thin and speculative as to be nonexistent, so we regard that claim as FALSE.The \u201cduplicitous paperwork shuffle\u201c and supposed conspiracy with abortion clinic operators to keep a Dayton facility open are allegations without support. The relicensing of the clinic in 2019 surely frustrated if not incensed abortion rights opponents. But Acton was following the law as well as a precedent from her immediate predecessor. This claim is FALSE.Ohio law does not allow anyone \u201dto abort babies up to birth,\u201c with rare exceptions. So Acton could not have granted a permit that allowed such a practice. This claim also is FALSE.Overall, based on our research, we rate these claims as PARTLY FALSE.Our fact-check sources:Lifenews.com - Ohio Health Dept Director Who Allowed Clinic to Abort Babies Up to Birth is Former Obama ActivistOperation Rescue - New Ohio Department of Health Director with Ties to Abortion Charities Keeps Discredited Abortion Facility OpenLifenews.com - AboutOperation Rescue - About us/Who we areFacebook - Dr. Amy Acton Fan ClubThe Columbus Dispatch, June 12, 2020 - Dr. Amy Acton resigns as state health director; Democrats cite criticism from GOP lawmakersWired.com, March 2008 - Inside Obama's Surging Net-Roots CampaignFranklin County clerk of courts - Dissolution of marriageFranklin County Probate Court - Marriage license case namesThe Columbus Dispatch, Feb. 26, 2019 - Physician Amy Acton will lead Ohio Department of HealthColumbus Foundation - The Big GiveColumbus Foundation Big Give - Planned ParenthoodColumbus Foundation Big Give - NARALColumbus Foundation Big Give - Pregnancy Decision Health CentersPregnancy Decision Health Centers - About PDHCColumbus Foundation Big Give - Heartbeat InternationalHeartbeat International - Our mission and visionThe Columbus Dispatch, Aug. 24, 2019 - Ohio Supreme Court won\u2019t hear appeal by Dayton-area abortion clinic fighting to stay openThe Columbus Dispatch, Oct. 29, 2019 - Ohio Supreme Court again refuses to hear appeal of abortion-clinic closure orderThe Columbus Dispatch, Nov. 13, 2019 - Dayton\u2019s last abortion clinic back in businessThe Associated Press, 5-28-16 (as published in the Akron Beacon Journal) - State grants variance request for Cincinnati abortion clinicOhio Revised Code 2919.17 - Terminating or attempting to terminate human pregnancy after viabilityOhio Revised Code 2919.201- Abortion after gestational age of 20 weeksKansas City Star - Operation Rescue adviser helped Tiller suspect track doctor's court datesDispatch researcher Julie Fulton contributed information about Acton\u2019s voting history to this story.Email drowland@dispatch.com. @darreldrowlandThank you for supporting our journalism.
