Jim Justice stood in the House of Delegates chamber last week delivering the annual State of the State address, he jumped from topic to topic, highlighting his greatest hits. When he came to the state\u2019s abortion ban, the assembled lawmakers rose in a standing ovation.\u00a0\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m your governor, I will stand with life, period,\u201d Justice said. \u201cAdditionally, I\u2019m proposing that we take care of the moms.\u201d\nJustice\u2019s proposal was simple: dedicate $1 million to centers that encourage people to give birth regardless of their circumstances. Less than 24 hours later, the House Health and Human Resources Committee met to pass a bill to make the plan a reality.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the bill that supports moms that are deciding to keep their pregnancy,\u201d said committee chair Delegate Amy Summers, R-Taylor, after the meeting.\nBut the bill does little to support parents after they give birth. And in recent years, lawmakers have moved in the opposite direction, working to make it harder for many West Virginians to access two key family services: child care and WV WORKS.\u00a0\nNow that the state can expect over 1,000 people a year who would have otherwise sought abortion carry to full term, the stakes are even higher.\n \n\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter.

But while the abortion ban was codified, lawmakers did not finish work on its companion.\n\n\n\n\nrelated stories\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn MLK Day, a call for policies to reduce West Virginia\u2019s disparities \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2018Watch and see\u2019: The whirlwind 24 hours when West Virginia Republicans banned abortion \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn a rush to ban abortion, West Virginia lawmakers almost killed a tax credit for parents adopting foster kids \n\n\n\nThe latest replacement, HB 2002, has elements of last year\u2019s bill. But the tax credit for non-family adoptions has been reduced from $8,000 to $5,000; that\u2019s still an increase over the current $4,000 tax credit, though experts at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last year noted that the average cost of adoption is around $45,000.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the requirement that insurance used in the state covers sterilization is gone. So is the provision making hormonal birth control available to all without a prescription. Replacing them is a program set up to fund anti-abortion centers, which would not be required to comply with federal privacy policies or have their employees go through background checks.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned when we\u2019re creating a system to spend public funds, taxpayer money on unregulated, unlicensed health centers,\u201d said Delegate Mike Puskin, D-Kanawha, the Democratic Party state chair.\nSummers affirmed that this bill is intended to help pregnant West Virginians. She does not expect the House to move any other legislation that would create easier access to birth control pills this session.\n\u201cThis is the one,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nOther members of the Legislature are concerned that the bill doesn\u2019t do what Justice has committed himself to doing: supporting West Virginia\u2019s mothers as they raise children.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s apples and oranges,\u201d said Delegate Kayla Young, D-Kanawha. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the same thing.\u201d\nChild care costs rise as subsidies dry up\nAfter children are born, researchers have found affordable child care is a major burden \u2014 both in West Virginia and around the country.\n\u201cParents are paying an astronomical amount,\u201d said Tiffany Gale, the owner and director of Miss Tiffany\u2019s Early Childhood Education House in Weirton, noting that the average cost of one West Virginia kid\u2019s child care is over $700 a month.\u00a0\nSome parents got a reprieve during the first few years of the COVID-19 emergency, when the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources used federal pandemic funds to help cover child care costs for essential workers. For child care providers, the agency changed how they compensated employers: centers that accepted kids using government assistance programs were still paid even if a student missed a session, a practice recommended by national policy groups.\u00a0\nThose shifts are now in the process of reverting back to the pre-pandemic status quo. Last November, DHHR restricted the essential worker subsidies to families that make under 85% of West Virginia\u2019s median income, a change that is expected to take financial assistance away from 6,500 children. And in September, the agency is set to change their subsidy payment model from enrollment back to attendance.\nWest Virginia legislators had the opportunity to address those problems last year. Instead, they passed a bill to incentivize organizations to set up child care facilities for employees, legislation that health analysts say does not make child care more available for working class families.\n\u201cThe state of West Virginia keeps saying \u2018we\u2019re helping child care\u2026look at this bill,\u2019\u201d Gale said. \u201cNo. That bill does not help child care. That bill helps large corporations.\u201d\nWV Works funds have become harder to access\nFor Krista Antis, a St. Albans resident and South Charleston High School English teacher, qualifying for cash assistance through WV WORKS would have helped her family stay afloat as she raised her son Davis as a single mother.\n\u201cWe were so broke when he was young,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was picking which bills to pay.\u201d\nBut despite not being able to afford basic necessities, she always made just too much money to qualify for the state\u2019s iteration of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.\u00a0\nIn recent years, WV WORKS has stockpiled more than 100 million unspent federal dollars. But instead of making these unused funds easier to get, state lawmakers have made access harder. In 2021, after piloting a program that added mandatory drug tests before West Virginians could receive WV WORKS payments, the Republican-led state Legislature made those tests permanent requirements.\u00a0\nAccording to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, that program wastes state money, limits who can get the funds, deters people from applying to the program and degrades poor West Virginians.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve further restricted TANF, which is like basically the only cash benefit available to very low income families,\u201d said Kelly Allen, the Center\u2019s executive director. \u201cPeople who rely on TANF are no more likely to use drugs than anyone else. It\u2019s very stigmatizing.\u201d\nDespite the past, a few health lobbyists are optimistic that they\u2019ll be able to leverage the abortion ban to push some of these policies to help families. Already in the session, Senator Charles Trump, R-Morgan, has sponsored a bill that pilots a 12-week paid parental leave program for state employees.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a group of us who are coming together saying, \u2018You support maternal and child health. That was clear that that was part of your rationale for restricting abortion rights in our state,\u2019\u201d said Kat Stoll, the policy director for West Virginians for Affordable Health Care. \u201cNow let\u2019s see if [they] can invest in some of the services that women and children will need.\u201d\n\n\nREAD MORE\n\nFederal judges ask West Virginia Supreme Court to weigh in on opioids caseMarch 18th, 2024\nWest Virginia regulators agree to consider whether Corridor H could \u2018go north,\u2019 amid push from community groupsMarch 15th, 2024\nThe federal government gave West Virginia $525,000 to prevent gun deaths.
