Gretchen Whitmer (D) won reelection and the state passed a ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in the state Constitution, which will prevent the state\u2019s abortion ban from before Roe v. Wade was decided from going back into effect and future restrictions from being enacted.\n\n\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) and Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) won reelection and the GOP failed to secure a supermajority in the state legislature, meaning the governor will be able to veto any abortion bans that lawmakers pass and the state will continue not to enforce its pre-Roe abortion ban, which Kaul is challenging in court.\n\n\n\nAbortion ballot measures protecting reproductive rights have so far also passed in California and Vermont, enshrining those rights in the states\u2019 constitutions, while an abortion initiative in Kentucky that would have explicitly stated its constitution doesn\u2019t protect abortion rights was shot down\u2014meaning the state\u2019s abortion ban could be struck down in court.\n\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans failed to garner a supermajority in the state legislature by one vote, which means the state\u2019s Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will be able to veto any abortion bans they pass and keep the procedure legal in the state\u2014one of the few remaining states in the South where abortion hasn\u2019t yet been largely outlawed.\n\n\nRepublican incumbent governors held on to their seats in Florida and Georgia, which means those states\u2019 GOP-controlled legislatures could still move forward with stricter abortion bans, and Arizona still has several races in play that will shape the state\u2019s abortion policies, including the gubernatorial race, attorney general race and battle for which party controls the state legislature.\n\n\n\n\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cFor everyone who said abortion was a losing issue; for everyone who said abortion is controversial; for everyone who said abortion is a fringe concern and not the meat-and-potatoes kitchen table problem Michiganders care about: you\u2019re wrong, and the YES votes prove it,\u201d NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement responding to Michigan\u2019s abortion rights ballot measure passing. \u201cPro-choice voters ARE the majority, and we are just getting started.\u201d\nWhat To Watch For\nWhat will happen in Congress. It\u2019s still too early to tell which party will gain control of the House or Senate, though current forecasts suggest the House is likely to go to the GOP while Democrats may keep control of the Senate. That means it\u2019s probably unlikely either party will be able to do much on abortion: President Joe Biden had vowed to make enshrining abortion rights in federal law a priority if Democrats kept control of Congress\u2014and had enough senators in favor of killing the filibuster\u2014while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has introduced a federal 15-week abortion ban that Republicans could push if they had full control.\n\nKey Background\nAbortion has become a major issue in the midterm elections since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, resulting in a wave of state-level abortion bans and sparking outrage among abortion rights advocates that Democratic strategists had hoped would boost voter turnout. With abortion now largely banned in more than a dozen states\u2014and bans blocked in court in some others\u2014advocates have been fearing which states will be the next to enact restrictions, and Tuesday\u2019s midterms were viewed as a major indicator of where policies could be heading. It was unclear how the midterms would shape up for abortion: While voter enthusiasm was high in the more immediate wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, resulting in Kansas voters roundly defeating an August ballot measure that would have paved the way to an abortion ban, more recent polling had suggested abortion was slipping from voters\u2019 minds as Republicans\u2019 chances increased. Ultimately, election results that have come out so far suggest the \u201cred wave\u201d of GOP victories that was predicted prior to Tuesday night did not come to pass to the extent that Republicans had hoped, though the party still appears poised to make inroads at both the state and federal levels.\n\nFurther Reading\nKentucky Rejects Anti-Abortion Amendment \u2014Here\u2019s How Abortion Ballot Measures Fared In The Midterms (Forbes)\nHere\u2019s Where Abortion Rights Are On The Ballot In The Midterms (Forbes)\n\nTracking results where abortion access hangs in the balance (Washington Post)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Alison DurkeeEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
