Wade: Fight continues for reproductive justice\n\n\n\n47 years after Roe v. Wade: Fight continues for reproductive justice \nBy Sue Davis posted on January 28, 2020 \n\nThe 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized women\u2019s right to choose abortion, was Jan. 22. While religious anti-abortion forces have been trying to overturn it ever since, the threat has never been greater \u2014\u00a0 especially with woman-hater, racist, anti-LGBTQ2+ Trump in control of the state.\u00a0\nWomen Strike for Equality Day, Aug. 26, 1970, New York City. Women of Youth Against War and Fascism, including Sue Davis, were in the march.\nTrump took a bold step on Jan. 24 by being the first acting president to address the so-called \u201cMarch for Life\u201d in Washington, D.C. The reactionary, white supremacist march has been organized by the Catholic Church-backed, misnamed \u201cRight to Life\u201d for the last 46 years and since 2017 reinforced by white evangelicals.\n\u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,\u201d Trump stated. Too true. Contrast that with his administration\u2019s plan to reduce funding for food stamps, which means free school meals for nearly a million poor children are in jeopardy and up to 5.3 million people, including thousands of children, could be cut from the program. (cbsnews.com, Dec. 10) Other government services which assist low-income children are at risk.\nIn his attack, Trump made the preposterously false claim that Democrats support infanticide and bragged that he will withhold federal money from California if it does not drop a requirement within 30 days that private insurers cover abortions.\u00a0\nBoth the Guardian and the New York Times called Trump\u2019s appearance an election appeal \u2014 which ironically coincided with the final formal argument in the Senate for his removal from office. The Guardian, calling it \u201ca sign of desperation,\u201d stated: \u201cTrump is well aware, of course, that evangelicals don\u2019t seem to give a damn about moral deficiencies \u2014 just as long as he cracks down on women\u2019s reproductive rights they\u2019ll continue to support him. So that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d The Times reported that 80 percent of white evangelical voters helped crown King Trump in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\nRefuting Trump, Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a counterstatement: \u201c[W]e\u2019ll be standing with the nearly 80 percent of Americans who support abortion access. We\u2019ll never stop fighting for all the people in this country who need access to sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.\u201d\n\nProtest outside misogynist Supreme Court, May 21 2019.\nRight-wing attacks\nMeanwhile, there are at least four ways the blatantly patriarchal Trump administration is using state power to attack women and other gender-oppressed people.\u00a0\nOn March 4, the legal case, June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, comes before the Supreme Court. The case is identical to one plank of a Texas law the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in 2016, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. The disputed Louisiana law, Act 620, would prevent doctors from providing abortion care in the state unless they have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The goal of the law is to limit the number of abortion clinics (as happened in Texas) and restrict access to surgical abortions.\u00a0\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights is arguing against the Louisiana law\u00a0 \u2014 backed by dozens of medical, legal and other organizations promoting rights for women, LGBTQ2+, various nationalities and people with disabilities. It seems the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals flouted the Supreme Court when it upheld the Louisiana restriction. Should the court overturn its own decision \u2014 thanks to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 the case could be used by anti-abortion state legislators to limit access to surgical abortion across the country.\u00a0\nAnti-abortion state legislators introduced a record number of near-total abortion bans, so-called \u201creversal laws\u201d and other restrictive legislation in 2019. Undoubtedly emboldened by Trump\u2019s braggadocio, they are continuing to introduce bans this year even in states like New Hampshire where there is a strong pro-choice majority.\u00a0\nAnother legislative anti-woman ploy is passage of \u201cabortion reversal\u201d laws based on the pseudoscience that medication-induced abortions can be reversed and the myth that people who have abortions often regret their decision. New research, published the week of Jan. 13 by the journal Social Science & Medicine on emotional responses post-abortion, shows that 99 percent of women don\u2019t regret their abortions after five years. The Guttmacher Institute, which conducts in-depth research on reproductive needs, corroborated that no evidence shows abortion is responsible for mental health problems. (rewirenews.com, Jan. 15)\u00a0\nBut what cannot be quantified are the effects of Trump\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, stacked with anti-abortion, misogynist bigots who issue and promote anti-reproductive health care rulings like \u201cconscience clauses\u201d and the \u201cdomestic gag rule.\u201d The latter was designed to reduce access to reproductive health care, particularly abortion, by exercising state power over some of the most in-need, vulnerable people in this country: the 4 million low-income women and gender-oppressed people enrolled in Title X.\u00a0\nBy significantly adulterating Title X of the Public Heath Services Act, passed in 1970 during the Nixon era, the revamped regulations do not allow Title X providers, as of Aug. 19, to conduct abortions alongside other services or offer patients referrals for abortions. All Title X recipients are poor people of color, youth, rural residents, im/migrants, people with disabilities and survivors of domestic violence. (For background, see WW article, \u201cWhile rate of abortion declines/Title X gag rule will only increase need for abortion.,\u201d Oct. 4)\nThe primary target of these changes was Planned Parenthood, the largest private provider of comprehensive reproductive health services, serving about 40 percent of more than 1.5 million women and gender-oppressed people who need contraception, testing for cancers, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and abortions. Planned Parenthood stood up to the Trump-Pence assault by opting out of Title X on Aug. 19.\u00a0\nThe most important question is: How is the gag rule affecting Title X patients? The Guttmacher Institute cannot provide such data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to get DHHS authorization to survey all 4 million Title X patients and clinics that opted in.\nHow many clinics have been forced out of Title X, denying convenient, timely, affordable access to abortion and other medical services? How many patients are unable to find licensed health centers that address their needs, excluding abortion? How many patients can\u2019t afford to travel for reproductive care? How many need an abortion but can\u2019t afford to travel? (That can cost hundreds of dollars on top of surgical fees.)\u00a0\nReproductive justice now!\nWhile anti-abortion politicians and activists cite blatant misinformation and outright lies that also stigmatize and slut-shame to promote their views, Guttmacher supplies facts to refute them: (1) Safe, legal abortion is common and at its lowest rate since Roe in 1973. (2) State restrictions are not driving the recent decline in abortion. The decrease is due to long-lasting, more effective contraception.\u00a0\nMany pro-choice groups, promoting medical, legal and civil rights for women and gender-oppressed people, issued statements on Jan. 22 recognizing Roe:\nDestiny Lopez, co-director of All* Above All denounced the Dec. 20\u00a0 DHHS ruling mandating separate billing for abortion care. That ruling and Roe \u201cremind us abortion rights in theory are not enough. We must also fight [for] equitable access to \u2026\u00a0 safe, healthy and autonomous decisions about our lives, bodies and futures [which are part of] the fight for dignity and equity.\u201d She added: \u201c[R]esearch has shown that someone who wants an abortion but is denied \u2026\u00a0 leads to a significant increase in household poverty. Health insurance that respects our decisions and upholds our health must cover abortion.\u201d\nThe struggle for reproductive rights in the early 1970s.\nAndrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health: \u201c[W]e\u2019re writing a new playbook for abortion access by focusing on passing proactive laws to protect and expand access to abortion at the state level. \u2026 In 2019 alone, more states passed proactive protections for abortion rights and expanded access than in any previous year.\u201d\nVoto Latino spokeswoman Sandra S\u00e1nchez wrote in defense of abortion rights for people of color, low-income folks and the LGBTQ2+ community: \u201c[W]e\u2019re\u00a0 . . . fighting to ensure that all Latinxs have access to abortion. \u2026 Research shows 73 % of Latinx voters want to see SCOTUS uphold the right to abortion, and 87 % say they would support a loved one who received one \u2014 because that\u2019s what our community does, we support each other. \u2026 No politician should be able to take that away.\u201d\nYamani Hernandez, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds: \u201c[H]elp end abortion stigma by sharing loving and bold messages about abortion. It\u2019s up to us to break cycles of shaming and oppression. When we envelop people having abortions in the fierce love and power that\u2019s built in community care, we bring the world one step closer to ending the harmful stigma that isolates us from each other \u2014 and our collective power.\u201d\u00a0\nKimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of youth-focused and -led Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, was quoted in Truthout: \u201cMcGuire expressed a frustration heard and repeated over and over by activists, advocates and social-justice minded legislators and academics. In real life, the \u2018promise of Roe\u2019 never reached those who needed it most: the poor, youth, people of color, LGBTQIA people and rural populations.\u201d\nFollowup article will discuss increase in medication abortions. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\u2190 Previous article\n\nNext article \u2192\n\n\n\nStay connected \n\n\n\n\nGet Workers World FREE in your Inbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human: Donate to Workers World! \nDefend workers\u2019 rights, build Workers World!>>>\n\nJoin Us!This week\u2019s PDF  March 7, 2024 issue\nPast issues\n\nSearch by month Search by month\n\nSelect Month\n March 2024 \n February 2024 \n January 2024 \n December 2023 \n November 2023 \n October 2023 \n September 2023 \n August 2023 \n July 2023 \n June 2023 \n May 2023 \n April 2023 \n March 2023 \n February 2023 \n January 2023 \n December 2022 \n November 2022 \n October 2022 \n September 2022 \n August 2022 \n July 2022 \n June 2022 \n May 2022 \n April 2022 \n March 2022 \n February 2022 \n January 2022 \n December 2021 \n November 2021 \n October 2021 \n September 2021 \n August 2021 \n July 2021 \n June 2021 \n May 2021 \n April 2021 \n March 2021 \n February 2021 \n January 2021 \n December 2020 \n November 2020 \n October 2020 \n September 2020 \n August 2020 \n July 2020 \n June 2020 \n May 2020 \n April 2020 \n March 2020 \n February 2020 \n January 2020 \n December 2019 \n November 2019 \n October 2019 \n September 2019 \n August 2019 \n July 2019 \n June 2019 \n May 2019 \n April 2019 \n March 2019 \n February 2019 \n January 2019 \n December 2018 \n November 2018 \n October 2018 \n September 2018 \n August 2018 \n July 2018 \n June 2018 \n May 2018 \n April 2018 \n March 2018 \n February 2018 \n January 2018 \n December 2017 \n November 2017 \n October 2017 \n September 2017 \n August 2017 \n July 2017 \n June 2017 \n May 2017 \n April 2017 \n March 2017 \n February 2017 \n January 2017 \n December 2016 \n November 2016 \n October 2016 \n September 2016 \n August 2016 \n July 2016 \n June 2016 \n May 2016 \n April 2016 \n March 2016 \n February 2016 \n January 2016 \n December 2015 \n November 2015 \n October 2015 \n September 2015 \n August 2015 \n July 2015 \n June 2015 \n May 2015 \n April 2015 \n March 2015 \n February 2015 \n January 2015 \n December 2014 \n November 2014 \n October 2014 \n September 2014 \n August 2014 \n July 2014 \n June 2014 \n May 2014 \n April 2014 \n March 2014 \n February 2014 \n January 2014 \n December 2013 \n November 2013 \n October 2013 \n September 2013 \n August 2013 \n July 2013 \n June 2013 \n May 2013 \n April 2013 \n March 2013 \n February 2013 \n January 2013 \n December 2012 \n November 2012 \n October 2012 \n September 2012 \n August 2012 \n July 2012 \n\n\nSearch by keywords\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nAfrica\n\nAsia & the Pacific\n\nClimate and Environmental Crisis\n\nDisability rights\n\nEditorials\n\nEurope\n\nGlobal\n\nHealth Care\n\nHuman needs before profits\n\nIm/migrants and Refugees\n\nLatin America & the Caribbean\n\nLGBTQ2S+ liberation\n\nMiddle East\n\nMundo Obrero\n\nPrisons: tear them down\n\nRacism and Self-Determination\n\nRevolutionary Theory and Practice\n\nSports, Arts and Culture\n\nStop imperialist war and occupation\n\nTop\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nWomen and oppressed genders\n\nWorkers unite!\n\nWorkers World Party\n\nYouth and Students\n\n\nWW books  On the DMZ \n\n\n\n\nWorkers World Party  \n\n\nPDF of March 14 issue\n\n \n\n\nPDF of March 7 issue\n\n \n\n\nPDF of February 29 issue\n\n \n\n\nPDF of February 22 print issue\n\n \n\n\nPDF of February 15 issue\n\n  \n\nEmail and print subscriptionsA FREE subscription to Workers World News is available online, with new articles posted five days a week.
