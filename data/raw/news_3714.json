Senator Rubio\u2019s office emailed 55 different reporters from 40 major news outlets\u2014including the largest newspapers in Florida and 20 largest in the nation\u2014to find out if they or their colleagues had ever asked federally elected Democrats real questions about abortion.\u00a0\nOnly three outlets responded.\u00a0\n\nOne reporter responded to the survey within minutes, writing, \u201cI have asked those questions.\u201d When asked for links to include in the report, the same reporter went silent.\nAnother reporter asked, \u201cWhy does a public official think it\u2019s ok to ask questions to news organizations on this issue?\u201d and proceeded to exchange multiple emails without answering any questions.\nBusiness Insider went so far as to write a 370-word article about the \u201ccombative\u201d inquiry but steadfastly refused to address any of the questions.\u00a0\n\nRubio\u2019s response. \u201cThis highlights two major problems we have in this country,\u201d Rubio explained.\n\u201cFirst, reporters believe no one is allowed to ask them questions. They take offense at the idea that you, me, or anyone else should dare to question the sanctity of their reporting,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cThat arrogant, dismissive attitude is exactly why there is a crisis of confidence in our nation\u2019s news outlets. They truly think they are better than everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cSecond, Democrats get away with murder, literally. They are never pushed to answer specific questions about where they stand on the taking of human life,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe truth is that every single Democrat supports taxpayer funded abortion without any restrictions up until the moment a child is born. That is the truth, but Democrats never have to explain their radical position, because the press is all too willing to cover for them.\u201d\nBackground. Many reporters point to the House-passed Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (H.R. 3755) as evidence Democrats are on record supporting restrictions. For example, in response to the inquiry, a Business Insider reporter tweeted, \u201cDems answered that question already in their attempts to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops explained the WHPA contains no \u201cmeaningful limitations\u201d on the termination of a pregnancy.\n\u201cIt wipes 500 state laws off the books. It expands abortion,\u201d Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) observed. \nNational Review called it \u201ca barbaric abortion bill that would enshrine in federal law a virtually unlimited right to abortion through all nine months of pregnancy in all 50 states.\u201d\n\nSenator Rubio\u2019s office asked those 55 different reporters whether they, or anyone at their organizations, had ever asked federally elected Democrats to clarify the following points:\u00a0\n\nWhat, if any, restrictions they support on abortion?\u00a0\n\n\nWhen is an unborn child considered viable?\u00a0\n\n\nWhether abortion providers like Planned Parenthood can provide a \u201cgood-faith\u201d medical judgment that \u201ccontinuation of pregnancy\u201d would pose \u201ca risk\u201d to the pregnant woman\u2019s \u201clife or health\u201d after viability?\u00a0\n\nEvery reporter was informed that non-answers would be treated as an acknowledgement that their publication had not asked those types of questions to any federally elected Democrat.\u00a0\nNot a single outlet bothered to provide documentation it had asked Democrats a single tough question on abortion.\u00a0\nThe outlets included: ABC News, Axios, Bloomberg, CBS News, Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, CNBC, CNN, Dallas Morning News, Florida Politics, Honolulu Star-Advertiser,\u00a0Insider, Los Angeles Times, NBC News, New York Post, Newsday, NPR, Orlando Sentinel, Punchbowl, Reuters, Roll Call, San Francisco Chronicle, South Florida Sun Sentinel, Star Tribune, Tampa Bay Times, Associated Press, Arizona Republic, Boston Globe, Denver Post, The Hill, Houston Chronicle, Miami Herald, New York Times, Palm Beach Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, Politico, Seattle Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and USA Today.\u00a0\nThe takeaway. \u201cThese reporters and editors know that no one on the right trusts them, so they don\u2019t even bother being fair. There is no benefit to asking Democrats tough questions because their readers\u2014the people that pay their salaries\u2014don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d Rubio explained. \u201cBesides, they agree with the Democrats anyway.\u201d\nFor his part, Rubio doesn\u2019t shy away from questions. Last week, he responded to over 40 questions from more than a dozen different reporters in the Capitol and held a bilingual press conference outside of The White House.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nPriorities\nServices\nContact\nAbout\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
