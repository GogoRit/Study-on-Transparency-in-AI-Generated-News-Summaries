The boy, named Bruno, thinks the camp is merely a farm and asks his father why the farmers \u201cwear pajamas\u201d (which are actually inmate uniforms). Bruno\u2019s father begins his answer, ominously:\n\u201cThe thing is Bruno, those people . . . well you see they\u2019re not really people at all.\u201d\nGenocide is only possible once the perpetrators have depersonalized the victims. The Jews of Nazi Germany were called \u201cparasites\u201d and the Tutsi victims of the 1994 Rwandan genocide were likewise called \u201ccockroaches.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that some defenders of abortion sneeringly refer to the unborn as \u201cjust fetuses,\u201d \u201cclumps of cells\u201d and \u201cparasites.\u201d When pressed to defend their slurs these advocates say, \u201cEven if a fetus is human, it\u2019s not a person so abortion isn\u2019t wrong.\u201d\nHow do we avoid this \u201cproblem of personhood?\u201d\nSome pro-lifers say we should just abandon the concept of personhood. They say \u201cperson\u201d is a term that confuses the issue and so we should just stick to the argument that it is wrong to kill innocent human beings and since the unborn are innocent human beings it follows that it is wrong to kill them.\nBut abortion defenders can undermine this approach by appealing to the common intuitions we have about \u201cpersons\u201d that are separate from our intuitions regarding of human beings. For example, in her 1973 article \u201cOn the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion\u201d philosopher Mary Anne Warren asks us to consider this example:\nImage a space traveler who lands on an unknown planet and encounters a race of beings utterly unlike any he has ever seen or heard of. If he wants to be sure of behaving morally toward these beings, he has to somehow decide whether they are people, and hence have full moral rights, or whether they are the sort of thing which he need not feel guilty about treating as, for example, a source of food. How should he go about making this decision?\nWarren goes on to say our space traveler would probably look for at least one of the following five criteria: Consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, communication about an indefinite number of topics, and self-awareness. I agree with Warren that if Superman or Yoda really existed then they would be persons and we\u2019d know that because they exhibit these criteria. This shows that the terms \u201cperson\u201d and \u201chuman being\u201d are not synonymous but that human beings are a kind of person.\nSome pro-life advocates may object: Superman, Yoda, or any \u201cextraterrestrial person\u201d are just the stuff of fiction \u2013 we have no reason to believe there are any other persons besides human beings, so there\u2019s no reason to entertain the personhood concept when we are debating abortion. But the Christian pro-life advocate can\u2019t accept this reasoning because he knows of at least one kind of non-human person: angels.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \u201cThe existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that sacred Scripture usually calls \u2018angels\u2019 is a truth of faith. The witness of Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition\u201d (328). Angels are intellects (or what we might call \u201cpersons\u201d) that do not have physical bodies (330). The Trinity would be another example of non-human persons (253).\nRegardless, most pro-lifers would have to agree with Warren that \u201cperson\u201d is a class to which human beings belong, which then opens the door for her and other pro-choice advocates to argue that maybe only some humans belong to that class. She concludes, \u201cAll we need to claim, to demonstrate that a fetus is not a person, is that any being which satisfies none of [the previous criteria] is certainly not a person.\u201d\nWarren\u2019s argument fails, however, because it would exclude many born people from being considered persons.\nFor example, animals like rats have rudimentary consciousness, but a human being in a reversible coma meets none of Warren\u2019s criteria, yet most people would agree that such a patient would only have lost the ability to function as a person, not personhood itself. In addition, if the criteria are specified to exclude the minimal consciousness of animals like rats and only required the rationality unique to human beings, then infants would not be persons.\nIn fact, nearly ten years after its initial publication Warren added a post-script to her article saying, \u201cOne of the most troubling objections to the argument presented in this article is that it may appear to justify not only abortion but infanticide as well . . . There are many reasons why infanticide is much more difficult to justify than abortion, even though if my argument is correct neither constitutes the killing of a person.\u201d\nWarren goes on to say that infanticide is only wrong because of practical reasons, like because we as a society value infants and \u201cso long as most people feel this way, and so long as our society can afford to provide care for infants which are unwanted or which have special needs that preclude home care, it is wrong to destroy any infant which has a chance of living a reasonably satisfactory life.\u201d\nContemporary bioethicist Jacob Appel echoes Warren\u2019s acceptance of infanticide when he says there\u2019s no practical way to implement a strict cut off date for infanticide in the same way you can draw the line for permitting abortion at birth. He says \u201cfor a practical, realistic way of running the world, we couldn\u2019t live in a world where we euthanized them\u201d (which leaves open the chilling possibility of a future where technology makes such barbarism quite practical).\nWe can now circle back to the historical examples of genocide I cited earlier as exhibit A for why it is dangerous to ground people\u2019s rights and values merely in how society currently values them. Instead, we should identify persons not as individuals who currently have certain valuable abilities (which can be gained and lost over time), but as members of kinds whose nature is to develop those valuable abilities. We can summarize it this way: a person is an individual member of a rational kind.\nThis definition includes all biological human beings, angels, and extra-terrestrials like Superman and Yoda. It also includes all kinds of infants, be they human, kryptonian, or even a \u201cBaby Yoda.\u201d There\u2019s also no good reason to reject this criteria for personhood especially since it explains many people\u2019s intuitions about why it\u2019s wrong to kill an infant but not wrong to kill a rat even if the rat is, in a particular moment, cognitively superior to the infant: the former belongs to a kind whose members are persons, but the latter does not.\nFinally, the prominent bioethicist Jeff McMahan points out that if our intrinsic value comes from our rational abilities, and this property comes in degrees so that some humans have more rational abilities than others, then we can\u2019t have equal intrinsic value since the property that gives us this value isn\u2019t distributed equally among human beings.\nIt seems virtually unthinkable to abandon our egalitarian commitments, or even to accept that they might be justified only in some indirect way\u2014for example, because it is for the best, all things considered, to treat all people as equals and to inculcate the belief that all are indeed one another\u2019s moral equals, even though in reality they are not.\nAll of this shows that modern accounts of personhood fail because they do not explain deep-seated moral intuitions almost everyone has about the way the world works: All human beings, including infants and young children, have the same basic rights and dignity. While the modern view leads to what McMahan calls \u201cdistressingly insecure foundations,\u201d the classical view of human dignity and the nature of personhood (which logically entails the pro-life position) is our best chance at securing the equal rights and dignity for all members of the human community.\nDid you like this content?
