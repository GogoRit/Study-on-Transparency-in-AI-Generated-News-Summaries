How did you decide to take up this challenge with your friends on social networks, from various places in the world, cultures and languages?Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui: I believe that even without speaking the same language, we can create unity: we understand each other because we pray. It\u2019s a form of reconciliation of the world across the borders, cultures and languages of different nations. We\u2019re a family and we complement each other.The pandemic has caused us to lock ourselves up in our homes. It was very difficult for me because I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. I was accustomed to traveling continuously, and [the lockdown] meant that someone had clipped my wings. That\u2019s how I felt during the first two weeks. I thought about the fact that my parents were at our family home elsewhere, my siblings were in the United States, and I was at my home. In the end I realized I had to thank God for having a place to live and having the means to live, and that was beautiful.fot. archiwum prywatneHowever, I couldn\u2019t think only about myself, but also about other people, who\u2014like me\u2014are also locked up in their homes, but have no financial means or credit cards. There are poor families, mainly big ones, who live from day to day. They don\u2019t have the internet or access to social networks, so I thought I had to do something to help these families that are in such a difficult situation. So, through a movement called Viva M\u00e9xico, I contacted Caritas to join forces with them and help [these people].\u00a0We created a movement called Dona Despensas (\u201cDonate Food Baskets\u201d). In this movement, we make food baskets for the poor, and we\u2019ve already managed to prepare 60,000 packages for the neediest families. However, this wasn\u2019t enough for me. I felt I had to do more. I\u2019d made a daily schedule for myself during the pandemic: hours of work, study, and physical exercise, and also time for prayer. But I was home alone all day. I know that man is never alone and I\u2019m aware that God is always with me, but humanly speaking, I was alone.Therefore, I thought that I could use social networks to pray together. Why not? I didn\u2019t want to pray alone anymore. I wanted to connect with people. It was before Sunday, March 22, that I spontaneously wrote that we could pray together for life. I thought that possibly some people would be interested, maybe a hundred, or that maybe I would pray alone on the internet. But it was a great surprise to see that 10,000 people joined me in my initiative for this prayer.\u00a0I was pleasantly surprised, because the Rosary is a long prayer and when transmitted on the internet it lasts almost an hour. I told everyone: \u201cWell, if we\u2019ve done this on a Sunday, let\u2019s also pray on Monday.\u201d And so it was on Monday, Tuesday, and continued every day. As May 13 approached, I told them that we had a new challenge, which was to pray exceptionally on this day. I thought that there would be about 50,000 people joining us. It turned out that there were over 200,000 people praying. It was the \u201cRosary of Fatima!\u201dFor me, it was a miracle that there were so many people. The next day, after May 13, I was so moved that I said on the social networks that we should prepare for a new challenge: one million people by May 31, at the celebration of Pentecost.We\u2019re celebrating the centenary of the birth of St. John Paul all year long. Did you have the opportunity to meet him?Yes, and I thank God very much for that. The meeting was beautiful: that was where I began my new way of life in which I discovered my new mission. I can say that my life changed when I met John Paul II: I received a rosary from his hands and I asked for his blessing. I told the pope that I make films in defense of life and the Holy Father listened to me, blessed me and made a cross on my forehead. A few months later he died. The meeting took place in the Paul VI Hall in November 2004 and he died in April 2005.For me, he is not only a saint, but also a man who had his passions. There was a time when he was an actor like me, so I appreciate him more and feel more attached to him. He used art to show true values and to fight against evil\u2014communism, for example. I believe that art, such as cinema, influences society a great deal, and therefore can become a tool for spiritual combat. Art in this sense can also help transform the world.fot. archiwum prywatneThe life and example of John Paul II continues to be a great inspiration to me. He dedicated part of his life to helping and saving his country, Poland; I also want to fight spiritually for my country, Mexico. I want to inspire others to love more, to live life with love and faith, and thus to change the world. John Paul II\u2014as a priest, and later as a bishop and pope\u2014had a great impact on society. He left his mark on our history. Through his encounters with young people, as at World Youth Days, he changed the world. I must also admit that I admire how he lived his old age, when he was already very weak and sick; despite these difficulties, he had extraordinary spiritual strength and intellect. He is an example for me to follow.What are your family and relatives\u2019 memories of John Paul II\u2019s first historic pilgrimage to Mexico?Not only my family, but everyone remembers this pilgrimage. John Paul II wasn\u2019t only a pope whom the whole world admired; here in Mexico we received him as someone very close\u2014we Mexicans treated him as just another Mexican. During his pilgrimages, the Pope said that Mexico is always faithful. The Holy Father had a special devotion and love for the Mother of God of Guadalupe. It was he who, more than 500 years after the apparitions, canonized Juan Diego, whose indigenous name means messenger eagle. That\u2019s why St. John Paul II is very much loved and recognized as a friend in Mexico. I\u2019m convinced that now, as a saint from heaven, he\u2019s interceding for us and joins us all when we pray the Rosary.You recently composed a song called \u201cQuiero vivir\u201d (\u201cI Want to Live\u201d). What inspired you to write it?I imagined how children in the womb would sing to their mother if they had a voice.\u00a0 What would these children talk to their parents about? Thinking about that, this song \u201cQuiero vivir\u201d arose: we put our skills, our voices in the mouths of these children who cannot sing yet. I also believe that it\u2019s a mission that God has entrusted to me: to use my talents and my abilities to fight in defense of life, especially that of the unborn, those little unborn and defenseless children, because they have no voice and cannot defend themselves, but they have a right to life.Being pro-life encompasses more; it also means defending children who have no food, as well as those who are kidnapped, sold and sexually abused. Human trafficking is a big problem, and we must do everything possible to stop this crime. It\u2019s hard to believe, but millions of children are abused and sold. Being pro-life means protecting the life and dignity of every child. Pro-life also means supporting young people who need help because they\u2019re addicted to drugs or alcohol. We have to do something for them: for me, all of this is part of being pro-life.\u00a0[It means] defending those who are unjustly condemned or imprisoned and don\u2019t have the economic means to defend themselves, to hire a lawyer. Being pro-life is also about helping the elderly. There are several programs that put young people in touch with the elderly. In retirement homes, there are many lonely, abandoned people who don\u2019t receive any visits, even from anyone in their family. We create programs for young people to be with older people. All these activities are also pro-life. Pro-life means protecting life from conception to natural death. This is a beautiful and unique mission for me.If every mother had a womb like glass so that she could see her child before birth, none of them would have an abortion. Everything I\u2019ve mentioned is very important to me; that\u2019s why my film Bella and the short films I make talk about this. The film Unplanned managed to bring together various kinds of people involved in pro-life activities\u2014artists, politicians, etc.\u2014to defend life. Last year we advertised the film Unplanned for months. We traveled around the 32 states of Mexico with this film. That\u2019s when the idea of the song \u201cQuiero vivir\u201d came up.You\u2019re an actor, musician and film director. Do you feel like a \u201cwarrior\u201d fighting for a good cause you believe in?If God gives you the possibility and the perspective of supernatural life, after a time during which you wasted many years of life, when you realize it, you want to give everything for Jesus and entrust your life to Him. Now I feel like a child of God who does everything to change this world for the better, and I want to live like that. I hope that in this way I can reach the holiness to which God calls us all. That\u2019s how I want to live, overcoming all difficulties.Thank you very much for the interview.Note: Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui will be leading the praying of the Rosary (in Spanish) for the intentions of respect for life and an end to violence in the United States of America, on Sunday, June 7, at 1 p.m. (Central Daylight Time, the time zone of cities including Chicago and Mexico City).
