Ron DeSantis to sign an abortion banning bill, activist groups are organizing in retaliation, hosting protests and holding abortion information sessions.\nThis bill bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy and has raised alarm among people with reproductive capabilities. The ban would allow for exceptions involving \u201cserious risk\u201d to the pregnant person and fetal abnormality with no exceptions for rape or incest.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the closest place for Floridians to access abortion after 15 weeks is North Carolina.\nJianna D\u2019Addario, president of UF Planned Parenthood Generation Action, organized an event at the Civic Media Center to provide abortion information in Florida Wednesday.\u00a0\n\u201cWe had that event to connect folks with resources so that we can all kind of have each other\u2019s back as we try to navigate life under such restrictive policies,\u201d D\u2019Addario said.\u00a0\nAbout 15 people gathered at the Generation Action presentation, which advised people with pregnancy capabilities to take pregnancy tests frequently and directed them toward local abortion providers like Bread & Roses and All Women\u2019s Health Center.\u00a0\nD\u2019Addario assured attendees the abortion ban isn\u2019t based on medically accurate information.\u00a0\n\u201cAll it does is put pregnant people on a really strict timeline for when they can be able to make these decisions and when they can start accessing care,\u201d they said. \u201cFor a lot of folks that\u2019s already difficult, for communities of color, for queer communities \u2026 those communities already are receiving discriminatory health care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNilufer Akalin, UF Center for Gender, Sexualities, and Women\u2019s Studies Research lecturer, said the last several decades saw safe, legal abortion become more accessible to women globally. However, in the US, it seems legal frameworks are increasingly limiting access to abortion.\nAn abortion ban could also lead to clinic closures, which increases the travel distance to get an abortion, Akalin said. Those without financial capabilities or access to transportation for travel would struggle to access abortion care.\u00a0\n\u201cThere has been all this work and also a feminist movement that liberalized access to abortion,\u201d Akalin said. \u201cWhat we are seeing in the US is a reversed direction.\u201d\nTexas, Arizona and Virginia implemented six-week abortion bans and Mississippi has a 15-week ban.\n\n\n Enjoy what you're reading?

Each year, 4.7% to 13.2% of maternal deaths are because of unsafe abortion.\nThe WHO site lists unsafe abortion health risks such as haemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation and damage to the genital tract and internal organs.\nHaving a kid is a life changing event, Dr. Akalin said. People should be able to decide whether they are ready for this change.\nThe ban will impact working people, non-English speakers and those without the funds to get to North Carolina, D\u2019Addario said. These barriers reinforce hierarchies of power within our society.\nNational Women\u2019s Liberation, a feminist organization working for more freedom, opposes not only the Florida bill but all abortion bans. The organization is open to women and trans people who do not benefit from the patriarchy.\u00a0\nStephanie Kollgaard, chair of the NWL New York City chapter, said the group demands access to abortions and birth control without restrictions or coercion.\n\u201cThis ban is beyond concerning,\u201d Kollgaard said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating for people in Florida who need abortions.\u201d\nThe bill, she said, is less about protecting fetal personhood or reducing infant mortality and more about controlling peoples\u2019 reproductive lives.\nThis organization partnered with others like Planned Parenthood and Floridians For Reproductive Freedom to host speak outs and rallies against the abortion ban.\u00a0\nAs Floridians wait for DeSantis to sign the bill, NWL will flood his office with phone calls pressuring him to veto it, Kollgaard said.\nThe organization launched a pledge to aid and abet abortion in Florida. The pledge received the support of local groups like Alachua County Labor Coalition, which shared it in a newsletter. NWL is working to get signatures to send the pledge to the governor before the bill is signed.\n\u201cJust as an additional way of saying: \u2018Hell no, we\u2019re not going to stand for that,\u2019\u201d Kollgaard said.\u00a0\nContact Lucille Lannigan llannigan@alligator.org.
