Mike DeWine\u2019s desk. Though the bill initially passed through the Senate with a unanimous vote, subsequent votes have been divided along party lines with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition.So, supporters of the FORUM Act are left to wonder, where is the Democrat Party of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s? Where is the liberated left that rallied behind all the flag burning, \"f**k the draft\"\u00a0jacket-wearing individuals filing some of the biggest First Amendment cases to ever grace the Supremes?Some believe this jurisprudence has not been adequately spelled out in Ohio\u2019s current statutes, resulting in suppression of speech for students on Ohio campuses. If signed into law by DeWine, FORUM Act supporters and proponents are hopeful this will clarify and prevent further alleged infringements of First Amendment free speech rights for students at public universities.Unlike Democrats of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, FORUM Act opponent, Ohio Representative Catherine Ingram of\u00a0Cincinnati\u00a0has issued official statements that the FORUM Act is \"purely political\"\u00a0and \"completely unnecessary.\"\u00a0She goes on to say that the FORUM Act \"...could make our campuses less safe by blocking a university\u2019s ability to regulate speech and that could potentially incite violence\"\u00a0and encourage hate speech.I realize that emergent cultural concepts of microagressions and speech/silence as violence may be blurring the lines between the hate crime sentencing enhancement;\u00a0the colloquialism, \"hate speech;\"\u00a0and\u00a0the legal jargon \"incitement to imminent lawless action.\"So let\u2019s legally re-delineate them.First, the Supreme Court of the United States has not defined \"hate speech\"\u00a0nor deemed it constitutional for the government to prohibit it. The Czars of Facebook might define and prohibit \"hate speech,\"\u00a0but the government cannot.In criminal law, however, racial slurs may serve as evidence of motivation in order to add on a hate crime sentencing enhancement to a criminal conviction.The Supreme Court does allow government to regulate \"incitement to imminent lawless action,\"\u00a0or, speech that the speaker intends to result in immediate illegal measures that are likely to occur and cause \"imminent disorder.\"\u00a0And this sounds a bit like what Rep. Ingram was attempting to describe. But it also sounds a lot like what\u2019s already happening right now on Ohio\u2019s campuses without SB 40.This past October, Miami University\u2019s Students for Life\u00a0chapter received materials on loan from Leadership Institute in order to create a pro-life display on campus.Shortly after the display was finished, a fellow Miami student posted on SnapChat, asking, \"Anyone wanna walk to the seal and 'adjust'\u00a0the f***king prolife installation that someone put in??? If we accidentally remove it or throw the flags in the trash that would be ok.\"When the display was destroyed, Students for Life\u00a0reported the incident to campus administrators and the campus police.Ultimately, Leadership Institute (LI) decided to move forward with efforts to identify the vandal and press charges since the vandalized memorial materials were on loan. Miami Campus Police claimed to initiate investigation, only to eventually respond with \"\u2026[we] did not have enough evidence for the prosecutor to move forward\u2026 I know this repeated vandalism has been very frustrating for you and your group and I wish you better luck next year.\"Miami University did not respond to my request for comment on the incident.The University of Cincinnati\u2019s Students for Life\u00a0has also experienced vandalism of donated materials. In October 2019, over 200 fliers were printed and donated by a company that wished to remain anonymous. UC Students for Life hung these posters on campus in order to inform students of their upcoming screening of \"Unplanned.\" This kind of on-campus event required extensive planning and purchasing of screening rights.Once UC Students for Life\u00a0began putting up posters, the official Twitter account for UC\u2019s Young Democratic Socialists of America\u00a0chapter tweeted, \"\u2026these messages are harmful, racist, classist, and in all significant metrics akin to fascism. Show solidarity with our friends and community members who are directly affected by these lies, and take the posters down wherever you see them. Being an ally means taking action!\"The Young Democratic Socialists of America account also retweeted another user\u2019s picture of the disposed posters and caption.UC Students for Life went through all proper channels of policy and procedure to inform UC administrators. UC Students for Life President\u00a0Ashley Willicut said, \"The response from the Student Activities Board was that there are no guidelines in place against removing posters\u00a0and, eventually, SAB offered to host a mediation between UC SFL and UC YDSA. But there were no emails sent out about the vandalism.\"The University of Cincinnati also did not respond to my request for comment.Rather than isolated events, this seems to be the trend across Ohio campuses. I also spoke to members and leadership for Students for Life\u00a0chapters at public University of Akron\u00a0 and private college Xavier University. The shared frustration, targeting\u00a0and vandalism has chilled interest in leadership positions among Students for Life members, as well as contributing to a growing consensus that reporting vandalism to administrators is a futile effort.Similar to the response I received from the University of Akron, administrators often cop out, saying, \"there is no policy in place,\"\u00a0despite repeat targeting and vandalism. In the words of University of Akron SFL President Ann Redle, \"We didn\u2019t even report [the vandalism], because it feels like tolerance doesn\u2019t go both ways on campus. And reporting to administrators wouldn\u2019t really change anything.\"The potential passage of the FORUM Act may encourage campus administration to step up and\u00a0protect the freedom of speech, but these experiences shared by SFL chapters across Ohio shows campus policies have a long way to go in preventing speech suppression. At this point, the issues align more with criminal forms of the suppression of speech rather than constitutional concerns.This isn\u2019t a First Amendment protest or rally \u2013 this is the deliberate and unlawful destruction of property.Rep. Ingram has suggested that the FORUM Act was only created because sponsors and proponents of the bill believe that \"campuses are too liberal and therefore [they] need more conservative speech.\"Whether or not campuses \"need\"\u00a0more conservative speech is a question reserved for the properly-functioning open marketplace of ideas.It\u2019s time for Ohio public university administrators to step up and protect all students from the literal and figurative vandals of free speech. The FORUM Act just might be the impetus we need.Rachel Citak is an attorney and lives in Anderson Township. She is a member of the Enquirer Board of Contributors.
