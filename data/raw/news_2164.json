James Martin prayed at yesterday\u2019s final day of the Democratic National Convention and included a call to \u201copen our hearts\u201d to \u201cthe unborn child in the womb.\u201d\nThe Jesuit priest and America Magazine editor-at-large is known for stirring controversy regarding Catholic Church teaching on homosexuality.\nHe announced plans to lead a DNC convention prayer on Aug. 16. Due to the Democratic party\u2019s position on abortion, contraception, and other moral issues, the priest received mixed responses from pro-life Catholics. However, some Catholics applauded the priest for including the unborn in his prayer.\nHere\u2019s his prayer below:\n\n@JamesMartinSJ, Twitter\n\nHere\u2019s the text of the prayer:\nLoving God,\nOpen our hearts to those most in need:\nThe unemployed parent worried about feeding his or her children.\nThe woman who is underpaid, harassed or abused.\nThe Black man or woman who fear for their lives.\nThe immigrant at the border, longing for safety.\nThe homeless person looking for a meal.\nThe LGBT teen who is bullied.\nThe unborn child in the womb.\nThe inmate on death row.\nHelp us to be a nation where\nevery life is sacred,\nall people are loved,\nand all are welcome.\nAmen.\nHere\u2019s a video of Fr. Martin\u2019s prayer:\n\nDear friends: Here is the Benediction I prayed last night at the @DemConvention: a prayer for a nation where every life is sacred, all people are loved and all are welcome.\nMore here: https://t.co/lKxH89SZNu#DemocraticConvention #DNC2020 pic.twitter.com/JbjwxVw8ku\n\u2014 James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) August 21, 2020\n\nClick here if you cannot see the video above.\nPrinceton University professor Robert P. George and Live Action founder Lila Rose both posted reactions to Fr. Martin\u2019s prayer on Twitter. George commended Fr. Martin\u2019s courage to include the unborn in the prayer, while Rose called on Fr. Martin to give the unborn greater priority.\nHere\u2019s Robert P. George\u2019s reaction:\n\n@McCormickProf, Twitter\n\nGeorge\u2019s first tweet reads, \u201cMy friend Fr. James Martin and I differ on important issues. But I was proud of him for standing before a party that\u2019s deeply committed to abortion and praying for protection for the child in the womb. Calling out one\u2019s own tribe (even implicitly) on its injustices takes courage.\u201d\n\n@McCormickProf, Twitter\n\nGeorge\u2019s second tweet reads, \u201cRemember, the Democrats are as radically opposed to any meaningful legal protection for the unborn [and] against the lethal violence of abortion as any political party in the world. Even the \u2018safe, legal, and rare\u2019 rhetoric was removed from the platform in the Obama years. No limits.\u201d\nHere\u2019s Lila Rose\u2019s reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the text a Rose\u2019s Twitter thread:\n\u201cAn open thread to @JamesMartinSJ regarding abortion:\n\u201cDear Fr. Martin,\n\u201cAccording to your America Magazine op-ed in January, 2019, you hold that abortion is one issue in a spectrum of issues that people of good will should take steps to address.\u201d\n\u201cYou say these include immigration, LGBTQ acceptance, access to healthcare [and] refugee crises. As a Catholic human rights activist, I appreciate your encouragement of respect for the lives of ALL human persons. This is absolutely essential to the work of ending human rights abuses.\n\u201cWhere we diverge in our thinking, Fr. Martin, is in considering the moral priority of ending abortion. Abortion is, without question, the most pressing and egregious human rights violation in our day.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t conceive of the wholesale slaughter of millions of innocent children each year as falling randomly in the spectrum of life issues you enumerate.\n\u201cWhy?\n\u201cNo other violation destroys anywhere near the number of victims; Murder is the most egregious violation of human life.\n\u201cAbp. Chaput wisely counseled:\n\u201c\u2018The deliberate killing of innocent life is a uniquely wicked act. No amount of contextualizing or deflecting our attention to other issues can obscure that.\u2019\n\u201cAbortion is a human rights atrocity targeting an entire people group (children in the womb) which is sanctioned by our laws. Americans are even forced to fund it.\n\u201cIn the face of this government sanction, Church leaders like yourself have a serious duty to call for action.\n\u201c[Martin Luther King] was an activist whom I\u2019m sure you admire as much as I do. King succeeded against the most urgent issue of his day through his FOCUS.\n\u201cThe ravaging of millions of pre-born children deserves unapologetic focus \u2014 not to be lost in a spectrum of important but less-urgent causes.\n\u201cYou acknowledge that many find the pro-life position offensive. Often, this is because they are post-abortive.\n\u201cBut, rather than teaching your friends Catholic theology of human life, which is rooted in love, you seem to throw your hands up in the face of the faithful\u2019s confusion\n\u201cOur Church and world desperately need leaders like you who can elucidate the reasons why our faith is incompatible with the murder of innocent children.\n\u201cWe are living in a culture that gaslights post-abortive men [and] women, telling them that their grief and guilt are unfounded.\n\u201cYou seek compassion. But treating abortion as just one in a series of injustices when it has torn us apart isn\u2019t compassion. It\u2019s not compassionate to the child in the womb OR to the culture wounded by the deaths of our countless children, siblings, [and] neighbors in abortion.\n\u201cI challenge you to ask yourself how you would respond \u2014 and to what standards you would hold political leaders \u2014 if 2,363 LGBT individuals were being dismembered and beheaded every day in the US alone.\n\u201cWould you be doing more for those victims than you are for the 2,363 children who are being dismembered and beheaded in abortion business every day?\n\u201cWould anything be more important to address until the slaughter were ended?\n\u201cAnd if not, why not?\u201d\nCatholic Church teaching on abortion\n\u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2013 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\u201d (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2270)\n\u201cSince the first century, the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law\u2026\u201d (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2271)\nOur Lady of Guadalupe, please pray for and protect the unborn!\n[See also: Biden Says Catholic Faith Drives His Moral Convictions in New Video, Despite Pro-Abortion Stance]\n[See also: Statue of Our Lady Remains Perfectly Intact After Devastating Explosion in Beirut]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this post\n\n\n\n\n\nThe link has been copied!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLet's Walk Down Memory Lane: Things Kids Who Grew Up Catholic Will Remember\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe 5 Sacramentals Every Catholic Needs to Live a Holy Life\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Distributes Free \"Plan B\" Pills at Concert - Social Media Erupts in Disgust\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n10 Marian Titles to Know & Cherish During Women's History Month\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDominican Friars Receive Habit in Beautiful Viral Video of Young Men Entering Religious Life\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow Almsgiving Benefits the Soul, According to the Saints\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy our stories?
