That\u2019s the kind of movement I want to build.Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit Roe v. Wade, speaks up as she joins other anti-abortion demonstrators inside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office on Capitol Hill in Washington. ((2009 File Photo / Associated Press))By Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa1:32 AM on May 21, 2020 CDTLISTENIn the summer of 2008, I met Norma McCorvey, better known as Jane Roe, of Roe v. Wade notoriety.We were at a ritzy hotel downtown for a luncheon full of Dallas elites who paid to see her speak as a fundraiser for an activist organization.AdvertisementI remember pulling up to the opulent hotel and deciding to forgo the valet, but I soon realized I could barely afford the parking garage fees. I prayed I wouldn\u2019t feel too out of place in my hand-me-down maternity dress. I believed in the cause and desperately wanted to be there, so in lieu of purchasing a ticket, I offered to volunteer at the luncheon.AdvertisementI remember someone coming and collecting me for a group picture before it began. They pushed me to the front, right next to McCorvey, I assume wanting my prominent 7-month pregnant belly to be the focal point of the shot. I still have that picture somewhere, she and I standing side-by-side, smiling.The author, Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, right, poses with Norma McCorvey at a fundraising event in 2008.(via Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa)She gave a brief talk. She told the enraptured room how the lawyers in the case bought her beer and pizza in return for her testimony. She claimed she didn\u2019t even realize she was a part of this culture-shifting Supreme Court case until she saw it on the front page of the paper some time later. She ended up giving birth to her daughter and placing her for adoption. She recounted how she still remembered feeling taken advantage of by those lawyers. Our hearts collectively broke for her, and the pocketbooks began clicking open.After she left the stage, McCorvey sat at a table near the back of the room where I was helping out. The woman running the fundraiser informed us that McCorvey would be signing copies of her book, which were $20 apiece. I remember seeing McCorvey scan the room of wealthy Dallasites and correcting the woman: \u201cUh, no, 25.\u201dOpinionGet smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy PolicyI registered this exchange as a bit odd, but I also recognized her hustle. She wasn\u2019t dressed in high fashion with pearls adorning her neck, and the situation  felt very real and very human to me. Perhaps she was the person in the room with whom I had the most in common.Years later, my husband and I attended a rally where McCorvey spoke. As she was introduced, she walked up to the stage, threw down her cigarette and coughed into the mic. He turned to me and said, \u201cWhy do they keep doing this to that poor woman?\u201d I felt the same way. She had such a tough life. Just let her rest already.AdvertisementMcCorvey died back in 2017 and since then the movement has found new, more polished converts to take her spot. Sadly, I feel many have been treated the same way. They aren\u2019t allowed time to process their past lives or heal before they\u2019re thrown into the spotlight for everyone to see. All their pain. All their brokenness. But their stories of unplanned pregnancies are compelling, so we pay big bucks to hear them speak. They motivate us to love other women better, but how well are we loving them?A few months ago, a friend texted me a photo of a billboard in Los Angeles announcing the documentary AKA Jane Roe, that would be released May 22 on FX. My stomach sank. Call me jaded, but seldom does Hollywood release a movie encouraging pro-life ethics. I braced myself for a bombshell. According to articles written about the documentary, McCorvey renounced her pro-life conversion just before she died. She said it was all a lie. She was paid by a fringe anti-abortion group to publicly change her stance, but it was disingenuous.AdvertisementWhile this saddened me, it didn\u2019t surprise me. And my sadness wasn\u2019t provoked by her deathbed declaration. My sadness came from a much deeper place about how we as a movement let this woman down.AdvertisementRelated:Too many evangelical Christians fall for conspiracy theories online, and gullibility is not a virtueWhat if we had loved her well? Like, really well? What if we\u2019d stopped dragging her out to marches like a show pony simply because she was desperate for the money? What if instead, that support was given to her freely? What if we loved her even without a conversion that we could fundraise off of? Maybe then something genuine would\u2019ve happened in her heart.These ideas may seem radical to some, but the type of whole life movement I want to help build is one based on the human dignity of every single person, those we agree with and those we disagree with. Because if we want others to see the humanity of the unborn child, we need to see the humanity of every woman, too.AdvertisementWe shouldn\u2019t just want women to survive. We should want them to heal from trauma. We should want them to succeed. We should want them to thrive. Just as children aren\u2019t objects to be possessed or discarded, neither are women.Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa is a writer in Richardson and the founder of New Wave Feminists.
