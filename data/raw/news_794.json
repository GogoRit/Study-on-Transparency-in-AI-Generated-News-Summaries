Slaton Courthouse in Atlanta. Stone was one of the attorneys who presented arguments Monday in a case that could put a hold on Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\n\n\n\n\n\nA Fulton County judge could soon decide whether to once again temporarily block Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban, which a federal appeals court allowed to take effect last month.\n\u201cI understand that this is something that needs immediate attention, and I will give it that,\u201d said Judge Robert C.I. McBurney following a Monday hearing in a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia on behalf of health care providers and advocates.\n\u201cI need to do some thinking based on all the good arguments that have been made on both sides,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I reach the point where I think I need more input, we\u2019ll schedule part two of this hearing, and I trust that it will be a priority for both sides. Because it won\u2019t be the kind of thing where I would want to hear, \u2018Well, how about we get back together in three weeks?\u2019\u201d\nGeorgia\u2019s anti-abortion law had been ruled unconstitutional in 2020, but it took effect for the first time nearly three weeks ago after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals let it take effect immediately, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\nThe hearing did not address the supposed harms or benefits that may be caused by the law but focused narrowly on whether the plaintiffs have the authority to sue the state, and whether the law is invalid because it violated the U.S. Constitution when Gov. Brian Kemp signed it in 2019.\nThe hearing, which was open to the public in-person and online, was interrupted several times by people who logged in to the Zoom call to shout expletives and insults. McBurney paused the hearing for about ten minutes while the court set up a new virtual conference. The troublemakers did not appear to be aligned with either side of the case.\nState solicitor general Stephen Petrany told the judge that people aggrieved by the law can sue the state for a final decision, but if they are seeking immediate emergency relief as the ACLU is, they must file against the people threatening the supposed harm \u2013 in this case, the law enforcement departments tasked with enforcing the law.\n\u201cIt would make much more sense to sue individuals that are threatening to enforce whatever the unconstitutional thing is, and enjoining them as opposed to the entire state,\u201d Petrany said.\nMcBurney seemed to question that interpretation of the law, raising a hypothetical situation in which the Legislature passed a law tasking local sheriffs with destroying every odd-numbered house in the state.\n\u201cAll we can do is wait until we get a declaratory judgment saying it\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, house after house after house could be knocked down, unless you go to all 100-and-something counties and sue each sheriff, which seems less efficient.\u201d\nIn her arguments on behalf of the ACLU, attorney Julia Stone said Georgia women are being harmed by the bill right now and need a way to shut it down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just for issues that attract media attention, it\u2019s for all laws that are unconstitutional, and there needs to be a provision to enjoin their enforcement while the case gets decided, before final judgment,\u201d she said.\nThe other big legal question revolves around the legal term void ab initio, or void from the start.\nThe ACLU\u2019s attorneys argued that because the state\u2019s anti-abortion law was unconstitutional when it was signed in 2019, it should be considered void.\n\u201cThe past cannot be erased by a new judicial declaration,\u201d said ACLU attorney Julia Kaye. \u201cThe reality is that for 50 years, there was a right to abortion up to the point of viability. That was enforced time and time again, uniformly by all of the federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, which reaffirmed it repeatedly.\u201d\nPetrany characterized that as wishful thinking. He argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs means the protections provided by Roe v. Wade were granted in error and should not be considered.\n\u201cThey have not identified any court that has ever held that even though this prevailing interpretation of the time has been overruled, we\u2019re still going to let \u2014 they refer to zombies, we\u2019re going to let this dead case, like a zombie, rise from the grave and still take your validly passed statutes with it. They cannot point to a single time that has ever happened. And it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOr has it not happened before?\u201d McBurney asked, referencing a rejoinder filed by the plaintiffs indicating the unprecedented nature of the case. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court doesn\u2019t routinely throw away 50 years of constitutional protection. They often expand it, after 50 years of saying you\u2019ve got no rights, you do have rights. It seems exceedingly less frequent that the U.S. Supreme Court says, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019ve had these rights, now you\u2019ve lost them, or they never existed.\u2019\u201d\nPetrany said he objected to the judge\u2019s framing of the decision as stripping away rights.\n\u201cTo say that it\u2019s pulling back on rights already frames the case a certain way,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, yes, it\u2019s saying there\u2019s no right to abortion. And on the other hand, it\u2019s saying there is a right for legislators to protect unborn life. So I don\u2019t think that kind of characterization is particularly helpful.\u201d\nGeorgia\u2019s abortion law passed by one vote at a time lawmakers understood it would not immediately go into effect, but if lawmakers want to impose an abortion ban in Georgia, they should have to pass a new measure now, Kaye said.\n\u201cThe legislature should now have to reenact the law, which for the first time, based on a new constitutional interpretation, for the first time has teeth,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should have to readapt it in a contemporaneous political environment. That makes much more sense from a policy perspective than empowering the General Assembly to enact whatever kind of, at the time, blatantly unconstitutional law it wants, score the political points, and then years or maybe decades later, that law automatically springs back to life long after the legislators have left elected office.\u201d\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courthouse following the hearing, representatives of the plaintiffs said they are hoping for a quick resolution.\n\u201cA six-week abortion ban means they don\u2019t even necessarily know they\u2019re pregnant before they cannot even get their abortion,\u201d said Susan Lambiase, an attorney with Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd it means they either have to forcibly remain pregnant, or they have to figure out a way to get out of state to go to some state that provides more access, take time off from work and childcare, get on a plane, pay for an abortion, get a hotel and all of that. Time is of the essence. It\u2019s really important for patients right now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXGeorgia\u2019s anti-abortion law could again be temporarily blocked\nby Ross Williams, Georgia Recorder August 8, 2022\nGeorgia\u2019s anti-abortion law could again be temporarily blocked\nby Ross Williams, Georgia Recorder August 8, 2022\n A Fulton County judge could soon decide whether to once again temporarily block Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban, which a federal appeals court allowed to take effect last month.\n\u201cI understand that this is something that needs immediate attention, and I will give it that,\u201d said Judge Robert C.I.
