It has sparked concern from experts that the United States seeks to unilaterally rewrite agreed-upon human rights obligations and create a hierarchy of rights.\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, Human Rights Watch, the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, and other organizations and activists from around the world said that the Commission should prioritize everyone\u2019s rights to health and well-being, without discrimination, and recognize that reproductive rights are clearly established under international law. These rights are essential to people\u2019s dignity and well-being and should not be treated as less worthy of protection than other human rights.\n\u201cThe Trump administration has routinely employed freedom of religion as a tool of discrimination against women, girls, and LGBTQ people,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise Girard, president of the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition (IWHC). \u201cThe Commission on Unalienable Rights is a callous attempt to create a hierarchy of rights and deny the world\u2019s most marginalized their fundamental rights. This politicization of international human rights sets a dangerous precedent and empowers regressive governments worldwide to pick-and-choose human rights obligations based on political ideology \u2013 a development with severe consequences for women and girls.\u201d\nThe Commission serves, in Secretary Pompeo\u2019s own words, to distinguish between \u201cunalienable\u201d rights and so-called ad hoc rights \u2013 \u00a0a worrying sign of the Commission\u2019s intent. These fears are supported by the appointment of commissioners with extensive records opposing access to sexual and reproductive health services, women\u2019s human rights, and rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. The Commission\u2019s public hearings have not allayed concerns as commissioners have repeatedly alluded to the primacy of freedom of religion over other rights.\n\u201cThe Commission was improperly established as yet another shameful attempt by this administration to erase protections in international human rights law for sexual and reproductive rights,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cReproductive rights are human rights. These attempts by the US State Department, through the Commission, to pick and choose which rights the United States will recognize and prioritize threatens to erode protections for women, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized and vulnerable communities around the world.\u201d\nHuman rights instruments and mechanisms, many ratified by the US, clearly lay out fundamental rights that are universal, interrelated, and indivisible. By casting doubt on decades of international human rights law, the Trump administration gives cover to those who seek to roll back essential protections for women, girls, LGBTQ people, and minority groups worldwide, the letter said, urging the United States to uphold all human rights, not only those that fit a narrow political ideology.\nFreedom of religion \u2013 while a fundamental human right \u2013 has increasingly been misused as an excuse to discriminate, with particularly severe consequences for women, girls, and LGBTQ people. For example, health care providers worldwide routinely refuse to provide critical health services \u2013 including abortion care, contraception, and gender-affirming services \u2013 arguing that it goes against their personal beliefs. To this end, the Trump administration has championed the right to freedom of religion at the United Nations and World Health Organization in an attempt to further restrict sexual and reproductive rights.\n\u201cThe Trump administration has a record of curtailing women\u2019s human rights at every opportunity, and this Commission attempts to provide cover to insidious discrimination against women and girls around the world who seek to fulfill their human rights and access the health services they need,\u201d said Amanda Klasing, acting women\u2019s rights co-director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cRedefining some rights, and by extension some people, as \u2018less equal\u2019 only increases inequality, insecurity, and injustice.\u201d\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States US Foreign Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\n          Letter\n        \n\n\nGroups Express Grave Concern about the Commission on Unalienable Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 10, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: \u2018Unalienable Rights\u2019 Commission Risks Rights Protections  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAccess Denied\n\n\nHow Florida Judges Obstruct Young People\u2019s Ability to Obtain Abortion Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2022\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWe Need Access\u201d\n\n\nEnding Preventable Deaths from Cervical Cancer in Rural Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\n          Letter\n        \n\n\nGroups Express Grave Concern about the Commission on Unalienable Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 10, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: \u2018Unalienable Rights\u2019 Commission Risks Rights Protections  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
