Ron DeSantis holds up a 15-week abortion ban law after signing it, Thursday, April 14, 2022, in Kissimmee, Fla. \n\nJohn Raoux/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Thursday a Mississippi-style anti-abortion measure that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. \n    \n\n            The bill, which goes into effect July 1, does allow exemptions in cases where a pregnancy is \u201cserious risk\u201d to the mother or a fatal fetal abnormality is detected if two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing.\n    \n\n            The bill makes Florida the latest Republican-led state to advance a 15-week abortion ban bill this session. Additionally, the Kentucky legislature on Wednesday overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s veto of a broad abortion bill that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. And in Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill into law that makes performing an abortion illegal in the state, with an exception only in the case of a medical emergency.\n    \n\n            The US Supreme Court appears poised to uphold the Mississippi law that bars abortion after 15 weeks. The fate of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, also hangs in the balance, and anti-abortion activists are hopeful that the court\u2019s conservative majority will strike it down. \n    \n\n            Previously, Florida had allowed abortion through the second trimester of a pregnancy, making it one of the most permissive states for abortion in the southeast. Abortion advocates said many women from neighboring states often traveled to Florida for the procedure, meaning changes to Florida\u2019s law could be felt all throughout the region.\n    \n\n            According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Florida reported 71,914 abortions in 2019, or 18.5 per 1,000 women, the third highest rate in the country. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe are here today to defend those who can\u2019t defend themselves,\u201d DeSantis said Thursday on a stage surrounded by several female lawmakers, anti-abortion advocates and children. \u201cThis will represent the most significant protections for life that we have seen in a generation.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA group of Abolish Abortion protesters stand outside the House of Representatives chamber where Oklahoma Gov.

State Sen. Lauren Book, a Plantation Democrat and the leader of the minority party, told colleagues she was a victim of rape and implored lawmakers to include an exemption for women who become pregnant as a result of sexual violence. \n    \n\n            Book broke down into tears after the proposed amendment was rejected by Republicans, who have a majority in the chamber. \n    \n\n            President Joe Biden, in a March tweet, called Florida\u2019s new abortion restriction \u201ca dangerous bill that will severely restrict women\u2019s access to reproductive health care.\u201d\n
