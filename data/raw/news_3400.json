If born, the child would likely die within hours. If among the very few to survive the first day, they would have severe deformities, require constant care at bankrupting costs, and potentially endure lifelong discomfort or pain. As my cousin and her husband walked through a shadow of private anguish, prayer circle emails were forwarded through my family. Updates cascaded by telephone from aunts and uncles. Our family, dominated by vocally anti-abortion Reagan enthusiasts, frowned sympathies while speculating in hushed tones about how my cousin and her husband, an evangelical pastor, might resolve their moral crisis. For some time, she did not know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest Newsletter\nA\u00a0daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\n\n        Thanks for signing up!

Because many women do not know they are pregnant before the government\u2019s six-week deadline, and getting an abortion is fraught with government-imposed obstacles, the law leaves a de jure skeleton of the constitutional right while making that right de facto impossible to access. It makes no exception for the health of the unborn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWill he suffer more if I allow him to be born?\u201d my cousin asked. \u201cIf he breathes and then gasps and gasps for breath? I was fixated on: I don\u2019t want him to suffer, I don\u2019t want him to suffer. It was up to me.\u201d After gut-wrenching introspection, my cousin chose to carry her pregnancy until her own degrading health compelled doctors to induce. She delivered the child, named him, and held him for 87 minutes until his death. It has become lore in my family that this was as beautiful and healing as it was painful. When I wrote to ask my cousin to tell her story, she wrote back immediately, \u201cI love to talk about him. <3 He would be thirteen this summer.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ask anyone in my family, including my cousin herself, what made her story healing rather than soul-breaking, or how she pulled beauty from the depths of catastrophe, you will hear us say that she chose the path of her values. You will hear us say that her choice was in alignment with her deeply held convictions, sacred texts, and her understanding of her God\u2019s will. Yet, we cannot tell her story without using the word choice. When even the most dedicated pro-life advocate tells her story, choose and decide are the action verbs that unlock the words courageous, brave, convicted, and her values.\nWithout that choice, my cousin\u2019s story is a forced-birth, authoritarian nightmare. Another woman may see the risk that her baby could experience pain as intolerable, or weigh differently the risk of death by childbirth or bequeathing the lifelong weight of caretaking to siblings. Another woman may view the child\u2019s quality of life as vastly more important than his time alive, or read Genesis 2:7 to say that life starts not until first breath. Any of these women\u2014with no less conviction than my cousin\u2014might see the fetus\u2019s earliest-possible termination as more conscionable than the child\u2019s latest-possible death. By taking away the right to choose, Senate Bill 8 disregards a critical truth: how we value suffering, life, love, death, and when life is worth living is inextricable from our spiritual, religious, and metaphysical convictions, which cannot be legislated. The case against legislating these decisions becomes more damning when we understand that pregnancies have infinitely complex individual circumstances that legislators cannot anticipate and that pregnant women are singularly positioned to navigate.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIt matters deeply whether our laws allow a woman to arrive at the right decision for herself and her family, but the process of how that decision gets made also determines who we are in relation to our government. My cousin told me, \u201cI reached depths that were important to me by wrestling with this and I am thankful for that.\u201d Without the chance to wrestle with the question of when and whether to bring forth a child, a woman lacks the agency to answer fundamental metaphysical and moral questions about her child\u2019s life, and about herself. Without that agency, she becomes a fertility vessel, a regulated host for a ward of the state.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nComplicated pregnancies bring these moral questions into high relief for nonpregnant people to understand, but the same unanswerable questions of life and death, love and suffering, risk and reward, quality and quantity of life, are in balance in every pregnancy. Every pregnancy presents fundamentally spiritual questions about the trade-off between the arc of a woman\u2019s life and her offspring.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nSix weeks after fertilization, the embryo is smaller than a blueberry. It is not yet a fetus. Obstetricians can identify electrical activity in the cluster of cells that will develop to function as its heart\u2019s pacemaker, but the mitral and tricuspid valves that would flap to make a heartbeat have not yet differentiated from the surrounding tissues. Nevertheless, Texas legislators euphemized Senate Bill 8 as the \u201cTexas Heartbeat Act\u201d to underscore the myth that the embryo has a thumping organ. The mythology of a silenced heart is a form of virtue signaling. The raw political potency of its imagery should make us suspicious of what the politicians advancing these bills seek to gain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we be intellectually honest in calling a position \u201cpro-life\u201d when the solitary life-or-death question it proposes to regulate is the question that biology endows only to women? We give judges the power to order executions. We allow a single head of state virtually unrestricted power to launch missile strikes. We give ordinary people the \u201cstand your ground\u201d right to kill. In each of these scenarios, the pro-life lobby is either silent or vocally in favor of an unencumbered right to kill. Why is life inviolable only when its fate is trusted to the moral calculus of a woman?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nI think the answer is found by observing just how dogmatically politicians will push abortion laws that lead to horrific outcomes. Senate Bill 8 makes no exceptions for rape, incest, or dangerous birth defects that could result in pain, death, or debilitation of the child or mother. Its sole concession to the infinite complexity of abortion\u2019s moral question is the medical emergency, meaning that even a mother carrying a pregnancy with mortal risks must delay the procedure until her life faces immediate danger. Why? Laws limiting women\u2019s reproductive rights are predicated on the assumption that women, given freedom, cannot be trusted to make important decisions. Carving out turf where moral authority is sovereign to a woman would enshrine a place where men assume an optional, advisory role.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\nThis past winter, after a routine 18-week ultrasound, one of my oldest friends learned that the fetus in her womb carried a rare and terminal heart condition. Like my cousin, my friend desperately wanted another child. She found herself midway through pregnancy devastated by loss of what could have been.\nThose who oppose a woman\u2019s right to an abortion often suggest that women who terminate pregnancies do so for convenience and are indifferent to the moral questions their pregnancies pose. But those who support a woman\u2019s full and unencumbered reproductive rights fully recognize the moral questions. We believe those questions are simply best answered by an empowered woman, reflecting her own views of life and bearing her own risks and consequences, rather than the views of powerful politicians, who would force her hand through the machinations of police, bureaucracy, religion, and money, while bearing none of the consequences.\nMy dear friend lost her baby last month. I don\u2019t know whether she considered, let alone used, her constitutional right to choose what happened to her unborn child in the weeks after that ultrasound. For what is perhaps a transient moment in this democratic experiment, the power to choose rested only with her.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Pregnancy\n            \n\n\n              Reproductive Rights\n            \n\n\n              Supreme Court\n            \n\n\n              Texas\n            \n\n\n              Women\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
