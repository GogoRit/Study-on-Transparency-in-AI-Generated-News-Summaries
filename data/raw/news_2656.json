Lindsey Graham said women are welcome anywhere in the country \u2014 provided that they're anti-abortion.The Republican senator took the stage at a campaign event in Conway, South Carolina, his home state, and praised Amy Coney Barrett, the newly appointed Supreme Court justice.\u00a0\"You know what I like about Judge Barrett? She's got everything,\" Graham said. \"She's not just wicked smart, she's incredibly good. She embraces her faith.\"\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n                            subscribers.\u0014\n                            Become an Insider\n                            and start reading now.\nHave an account?

But in the past, Barrett's actions have signaled she is against Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision granting abortion.\u00a0\n\n\n                              Related stories\n                            \n\n\nBarrett, for example, publicly backed an anti-abortion ad appearing in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper in 2006. Additionally, more than 1,500 alums from Barrett's alma mater, Rhodes College, signed a letter in October that argued Barrett would \"seriously curtail\" Roe v. Wade if nominated.\u00a0Women and LGBT activists are slamming his remarks, characterizing the parameters he listed as sexist and anti-LGBT.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Charlotte Clymer \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08  (@cmclymer) November 1, 2020Graham's remarks come weeks after the senator made limiting characterizations about Black people.\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\nOn October 9, Graham said Black people are free to go and live in any part of the state, as long as they're not liberal.\"I care about everybody,\" Graham said, speaking at a forum for South Carolina Senate candidates. \"If you're a young African American, an immigrant, you can go anywhere in this state. You just need to be conservative, not liberal.\"Graham is fighting to keep his Senate seat against\u00a0Jaime Harrison, a Black former state legislator who spoke at the forum just before him. For weeks, polls have shown either the two tied or one just slightly ahead of the other.Graham has a marginal lead of 3 percentage points over Harrison, according to a poll conducted last week and posted on Real Clear Politics. Harrison, with 46% of support, trails Graham's 49%.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe South Carolina senator did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on his Saturday remarks about women.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Read next\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: What's at stake with Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation as the newest Supreme Court justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCongress\nSupreme Court\nWomen\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nClose icon\nTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.
