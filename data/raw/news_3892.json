Annnovera\nComedian, writer and producer, Whitney Cummings, is encouraging women to just say vagina when it comes to their health. Cummings often jokes about female health and hygiene in her work but the comedian is very serious about the matter of calling our female parts by their scientific name. The mission behind Cummings Just Say Vagina campaign with Annovera aims to empower women to have candid, direct and honest conversations about their reproductive health and contraceptive needs.\n\n\n\u201cGrowing up I was sort of depriving myself of basic health care because I was so embarrassed to talk about it. You know, I would go into the gynecologist and needed to be on birth control or if it hurt when I had sex, I wouldn't even be able to ask a doctor about it because I was too embarrassed to say Vagina or even ask what do I do?,\u201d shared Cummings. \u201cI used to apologize a lot. But now I\u2019m encouraging all women to channel their inner superpower and ditch the V-word. I\u2019ve learned that when you use euphemisms, it makes it harder to say what you mean and to ask for what you need. It\u2019s not cha cha. It\u2019s not hoo-hah. Just say it. Vagina.\u201d\nAnnovera ring.Annovera\n\nAfter two decades on hormonal birth control, Cummings and her gynecologist recently made the switch to Annovera. Annovera is a new type of birth control developed by. a team of mostly women at The Population Council. Annovera is the first annual, comfortable, and procedure-free birth control. Instead of a pill, it's a soft and squishy ring that a woman inserts into her vagina. When squeezed, the ring is about the same size as a tampon. The ring is inserted for 21 days and then removed for seven days each cycle, for one year (13 cycles). The ring releases an average continuous daily dose of 150 mcg/day of a novel non-androgenic progestin, segesterone acetate, and 13 mcg/day of estrogen (Ethinyl estradiol), making it one of the lowest dose combination hormonal contraceptives on the market. The Annovera app helps women track their cycles by informing them went to take out and insert the ring.\n\nThe birth control industry has had little innovation in giving women the control to manage their menstruation and fertility. \u201cWhile effectiveness is a very common priority, it is not the only priority. The industry hasn\u2019t done much to find a middle ground birth control in between the form of a pill and an IUD,\u201d said Carolyn Westhoff, MD, MSc, Columbia University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \u201cWomen have found Annovera to be\u00a0convenient while still being able to have control.\u201d\n\nMORE FOR YOU 300 Billion Crypto Price Crash Suddenly Accelerates As Bitcoin  Ethereum And XRP Traders Brace For A Fed ShockApple\u2019s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like SamsungNew Gmail Security Rules You Have 14 Days To Comply  Google Says\n\n\nAlthough birth control might not be for everyone, Cummings wants women to remember that they are the experts of their bodies. \u201cWe don't listen to our bodies enough. We kind of are so disconnected. We think the brain and body are separate things which make us mean to our bodies, you know? You are the expert of your own body. Treat your body, like your baby. You would know everything about your own baby so you should know everything about your own body.\u201d\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0some of my other work\u00a0here.\u00a0Yola RobertEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
