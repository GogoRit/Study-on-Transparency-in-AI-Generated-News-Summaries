On 7 November, voters will have the chance to decide whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. If the Ohio supreme court rules to reinstate the state\u2019s six-week ban, which is currently paused, it could throw the election \u2013 and abortion providers across the midwest \u2013 into chaos.Ohio abortion rights activists suffer blow in suit over referendum languageRead moreFirst passed in 2019, before the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and abolished the national right to abortion, the six-week ban was put on hold. But once Roe fell last year, the ban snapped into place.In court documents, Ohio abortion providers spoke of encountering patients who could not get cancer treatments while pregnant, people who threatened suicide if they could not get abortions, and women whose pregnancies had fetal anomalies so serious that they would never result in healthy babies.As the ban does not have exceptions for rape or incest, multiple children also had to flee the state for abortions after being raped, according to court records. One 10-year-old rape victim\u2019s case continues to make national headlines.Then, last fall, a lower court in Ohio agreed to freeze the six-week ban. Now, the state\u2019s supreme court will take up the case, with a focus on procedural questions about the limits of the Ohio government and the abortion providers\u2019 legal authority.Ohio is one of a handful of midwestern states that still allows abortion. If its abortion clinics are forced to go dark, the already overwhelmed abortion providers in the region and on the coasts of the US will likely see a wave of patients fleeing Ohio.The Ohio supreme court handed anti-abortion activists a major victory this month. In late August, supporters of the referendum to add abortion rights to Ohio\u2019s constitution sued the state\u2019s ballot board, accusing it of adding misleading language to voters\u2019 ballots to sway them against abortion rights.Last week, the Ohio supreme court ruled that, although the ballot board had to rewrite a small part of the ballots, most of it could stand \u2013 including language that called a fetus an \u201cunborn child\u201d.Explore more on these topicsAbortionOhioLaw (US)Reproductive rightsRoe v WadeHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
