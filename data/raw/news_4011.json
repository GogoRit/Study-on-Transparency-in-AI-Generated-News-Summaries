But you're also acknowledging the choices they make as a person: the education they pursued, the training they sought, the hours they put in. I'm grateful for the acknowledgement of the choices I've made, and I'm also grateful to have lived at a moment in our society where choice exists. Because, as women and as girls, things can happen to our bodies that are not our choice.\u201d\nShe added, \"I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making \u2014 and not just a series of events that happened to me. But one that I could stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over. Sometimes messy and scrawling, sometimes careful and precise. But one that I had carved with my own hand. And I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose.\u201d\nWilliams delivered these remarks while pregnant. She is expecting a child with Thomas Kail, who directed her in \u201cFosse/Verdon\u201d and directed the hit Broadway musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d\nFrom there, the award-winning actress pivoted to a call to action, urging women watching the Golden Globes to vote in the upcoming 2020 elections.\n\u201cWomen, 18 to 118, it is time to vote,\u201d Williams told the Golden Globes audience. \u201cPlease do so in your own self-interest. It\u2019s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them. Don\u2019t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let\u2019s make it look more like us.\u201d\nWilliams was not alone among celebrities at the Golden Globes to discuss political issues. Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe took on global warming, while Patricia Arquette drew attention to a seemingly impending American war with Iran. They did so despite host Ricky Gervais joking that Hollywood celebrities should not discuss politics in their acceptance speeches, because many of them work for companies which do business with China.\n\u201cIf ISIS started a streaming service, you\u2019d call your agent,\u201d Gervais joked.\n\u00a0You can watch William's full acceptance speech below via YouTube:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Matthew Rozsa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Rozsa is a staff writer at Salon.
