It is a sad state of our education system when students cannot truly think critically and have to resort to baseless attacks\u2019,\u00a0said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America.\n\nCLEVELAND, OH and FREDERICKSBURG, VA (4-30-2020)\u2013\n\n\nPro-choice students at\u00a0Case\u00a0Western\u00a0Reserve University in Ohio are upset that the Undergraduate Student Government is approving the Students for Life group on campus.\u00a0In a petition, the students sound off on why they want to try to get Students for Life kicked off campus, organizing a referendum on the group. In their petition, the group calls Students for Life \u201cterrorists\u201d,\u00a0 and the pro-life movement by extension.\n\n\nReacting to the news, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America stated, \u201cIt is unbelievable that pro-choice students would call peaceful pro-lifers \u2018terrorists\u2019 because we pray and sidewalk counsel outside of abortion facilities. The pro-life generation and the pro-life movement is one of peace; we, after all, work every day to end the violence of abortion. It is the incendiary language from pro-choicers that leads to violence and hatred against pro-lifers. Clearly these students need to take a few more classes on Constitutional law, as abortion is jerry-rigged into law through Roe v. Wade\u00a0and\u00a0Doe v. Bolton, not the 14th Amendment, which legal experts argue actually offers protections to lives, born and preborn, if correctly applied.\u00a0 \u201d\n\n\nThe document, obtained by Students for Life, attacks us because \u201cStudents for Life operates with the goal to completely abolish abortion: a right provided by the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States and a human right recognized by the United Nations.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nCommenting on the controversy, Lily Hutkowski, the Indiana/Ohio Regional Coordinator for Students for Life added, \u201cIronically, these students seek to shut off debate and the sharing of information in the name of \u2018protecting women.\u2019 Free speech rights must be protected on campus. We look forward to confronting the astounding ignorance and hatred that the pro-abortion students are promoting on campus.\u201d\n\n\nDespite the opposing students\u2019 best efforts to silence pro-life beliefs, the Case Western Students for Life group is set to continue operating, as both the student government and the administration have appeared sympathetic and supportive of the Students for Life group.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can read a map of incidents of vandalism and violence against pro-lifers\u00a0here.\n\n\nTo read more about the 9 common violations of student free speech in a Wall Street Journal op-ed from Hawkins,\u00a0click here.\nFor interviews, please contact Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].\n\u201330\u2014\nStudents for Life of America is the nation\u2019s largest pro-life student organization with over 1,225 student groups on high school and college campuses across the country, with 63 Students for Life groups in Ohio.\n\n\n Post Views: 1,571\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
