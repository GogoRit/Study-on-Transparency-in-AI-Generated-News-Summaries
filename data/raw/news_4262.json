That\u2019s misleading. Abortion isn\u2019t about reproduction. It can\u2019t be about reproduction. The word \u201creproduction\u201d is formed from the combination of \u201cre\u201d (again) + \u201cproduce\u201d (to make). It means to produce again, make a copy, or\u2014in our context\u2014simply to create another human being.\nAbortion, however, refers to just the opposite, even if you grant the euphemistic definition usually offered: \u201cthe termination of a pregnancy.\u201d To terminate is almost opposite of producing something. That\u2019s one reason why it doesn\u2019t make sense to classify abortion as a reproductive right.\nIn every elective abortion, a couple already has made a body. Two human beings have produced another human being by re-producing. Though a couple does have a reproductive right, it is only during the time that precedes the act of reproduction. Any action taken upon the product of reproduction is no longer about reproduction.\nAccording to the law of biogenesis, living things reproduce other living things. Specifically, species reproduce their own kind at the moment of conception. Dogs beget dogs, birds beget birds, and humans beget humans. It is scientifically impossible for two humans to reproduce something that is not a human but then later becomes one. The immediate product of human reproduction is another human being, even by the admission of abortion-choice advocates.\nAbortion, then, is not a reproductive right since reproduction has already taken place. The couple has produced a new human being. Reproduction is complete. They still have a reproductive right, but only as it pertains to producing an additional human being, if they choose. That right doesn\u2019t refer to their newly produced human being.\nAn important transition occurs at the moment of conception. One right ends and two rights begin. The couple\u2019s right to reproduce (or not reproduce) ends because they\u2019ve exercised that right. Two new rights begin: parental rights and human rights. Now that the couple has reproduced another human, they are parents. Parents, by definition, have parental rights as well as parental responsibilities. In addition, the new child\u2014unmistakably a human being\u2014has human rights.\nTherefore, abortion is not a reproductive right. Abortion is an action taken by one or more parents on their offspring. To refer to the parents\u2019 action on their existing child as a reproductive right is incorrect based on what we know about reproduction. Any action taken towards their existing child is a parental action, not a reproductive one. Abortion, then, is a parental act, and its effect is on the existing child, not a potential child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWANT TO BE A STRONGER AMBASSADOR FOR CHRIST?\n\t\t  Let us equip you through our signature publications, videos, articles, and other mentoring tools.
