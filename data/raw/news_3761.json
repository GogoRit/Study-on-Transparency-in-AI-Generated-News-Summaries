The figures take into account the anticipated high levels of under-reported cases.Researchers expect 15m additional cases of domestic violence for every three months that lockdown is extended. They also estimate that the disruption to violence prevention programmes because of the pandemic and the diversion of resources elsewhere could mean a third fewer cases of violence are averted by 2030.Researchers also project that up to 44 million women in 114 low and middle-income countries will be unable to access contraceptives if lockdown and Covid-19 related restrictions continue for three months and cause major disruption to services. This would result in an estimated 1 million unintended pregnancies.The International Planned Parenthood Federation has reported that more than 5,000 clinics have closed in 64 countries and Marie Stopes International predicts that Covid-19 restrictions on its services could mean 3 million additional unintended pregnancies, 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11,000 pregnancy-related deaths.The pandemic is also expected to derail efforts to end FGM. Researchers had expected the scaling up of FGM prevention programmes over the next 10 years would mean 5.3 million fewer girls being cut. This figure is projected to be reduced by a third.Meanwhile the disruption to programmes to prevent child marriage will result in an additional 13 million children being married over the next decade.World leaders have pledged to eliminate violence against women and girls, FGM and child marriage, as well as ensure universal access to family planning by 2030, under the sustainable development goals.The magnitude of the problem is absolutely enormous and that should motivate and mobilise us to take action nowTraci Baird, EngenderHealth\u201cIt\u2019s a calamity. Totally calamitous,\u201d said Kanem. \u201cIt is so clear that Covid-19 is compounding the no longer subterranean disparities that affect millions of women and girls.\u201dShe said the pandemic \u201cthreatened the gains carefully eked out\u201d over recent years. \u201cWe are very worried indeed.\u201dShe said UNFPA teams in the Arab states and east and southern Africa had reported that \u201cpeople were rushing to marry their daughters\u201d already, while deaths in childbirth in one east African country had tripled this year.Wendo Aszed, the founder of Dandelion Africa, which runs economic empowerment programmes in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley, said it had been forced to reduce its mobile family planning services by 40% because of coronavirus restrictions.Many women in the region have up to eight children and live on about $1.50 (\u00a31.20) a day.\u201cOn a bad day we will have 300 people [attend mobile clinics]. Some days we get up to 700 people showing up,\u201d said Aszed. \u201cThat has been really impacted. We cannot treat women in these places.\u201dShe said that from mid-March to mid-April, more than 40 cases of violence have been reported to her organisation, more than the total number it dealt with last year.\u201cA lot more women are a lot more aware that they can report and can leave marriages,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are fed up and they are seeing opportunities. With Covid things could get a lot worse so they need to deal with this problem and then can deal with Covid.\u201dTraci Baird, president of EngenderHealth, said UNFPA had \u201cput numbers to things that we have been discussing for weeks\u201d.\u201cThe magnitude of the problem is absolutely enormous and that should motivate and mobilise us to take action now and be prepared to manage and support countries, and partners and families, in catching up after.\u201cWe know what works, we have best practices that have impact,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to do things better and faster and smarter. We don\u2019t have time to do learnings and ramp up phases, or workshops and meetings. We have to get back to work.\u201dExplore more on these topicsReproductive rightsInfectious diseasesContraception and family planningWomen's rights and gender equalityDomestic violenceHealthCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMove to overturn FGM ban in the Gambia postponed22h agoWoman who handed over British girl, 3, for FGM in Kenya given seven years16 Feb 2024Woman convicted of taking British girl, three, for female genital mutilation in Kenya26 Oct 2023Number of new FGM cases referred to NHS in England down by a quarter25 Feb 2021Huge FGM rise recorded in Somalia during coronavirus lockdown18 May 2020Sudan to outlaw female genital mutilation1 May 2020True numbers of FGM victims could be far higher as countries fail to record cases17 Mar 2020We\u00a0won\u2019t eradicate FGM if we keep misunderstanding its history9 Mar 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
