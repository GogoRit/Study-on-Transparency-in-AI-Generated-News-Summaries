When it takes place outside abortion clinics, thus upsetting patients and medical staff, according to Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. The presence of hard-praying anti-abortionists from 40 Days for Life, a group based in Texas, outside Scottish hospitals and clinics has prompted Ms Sturgeon to back legislation that would allow no-go \u201cbuffer zones\u201d around abortion providers.

The latest began on September 28th. Though the group says it discourages volunteers (most of whom are locals) from using graphic images of aborted fetuses and yelling, it has attracted some protesters who do. Shawn Carney, its co-founder and chief executive, says that doesn\u2019t worry him. \u201cOur main concern is the bigotry of the government,\u201d he says. \u201cSturgeon\u2026doesn\u2019t like us, so she wants to get rid of us.\u201d If the buffer law is passed, he says: \u201cWe will sue.\u201dMr Carney\u2019s group is one of several American pro-life organisations that are stepping up their activities in Britain. CBR UK, an affiliate of the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform, a Californian anti-abortion outfit that disseminates particularly gruesome images, says its British network of \u201cvolunteer educators\u201d, who set up street displays, has grown from 50 a decade ago to 500. Dave Brennan, head of the group\u2019s church ministry, says it wants to double that within a year. The group is currently focusing on universities. Stanton Health Care, from Idaho, which operates \u201cclinics\u201d that try to dissuade women from terminating pregnancies, opened in Belfast in 2015 and will do so in Edinburgh this year. British pro-lifers hope that they can learn from the long and successful campaign to overturn Roe v Wade, the American Supreme Court ruling of 1973 that enshrined the right to an abortion. American pro-lifers have also played prominent roles in campaigns to keep children on life support alive against the wishes of their doctors and the courts.Such activists are often supported in their efforts by ADF UK, the British chapter of Alliance Defending Freedom, an American conservative legal-advocacy group, which opened in 2015. With Christian Concern, a British association of similarly crusading lawyers, it set up the Wilberforce Academy, which trains young people for \u201cChrist-centred leadership\u201d. Freedom of speech and of religious expression\u2014issues that have been more prominent in America than Britain\u2014are at the heart of ADF UK\u2019s battles. Its lawyers represented a midwifery student at Nottingham University who faced an investigation over her public opposition to abortion. In 2020 the university apologised and settled. The following year ADF UK helped a Catholic priest from Glasgow successfully challenge the government\u2019s attempt to close churches during lockdown.Future campaigns seem likely to focus on the push to introduce abortion buffer zones. In America ADF sued to strike down a law allowing such zones in Massachusetts and won. Though the British Pregnancy Advisory Service says protests outside clinics are becoming more common, a policy on buffer zones across England and Wales seems unlikely soon. (In 2018 Sajid Javid, then the home secretary, said there was little need for one.) Yet several councils have established their own zones or are considering doing so. The Supreme Court has been asked to consider whether a prospective law allowing buffer zones in Northern Ireland would disproportionately affect the right to protest.Claims that buffer zones criminalise free speech have begun to influence anti-abortionists\u2019 arguments more widely, according to Lucy Grieve, co-founder of Back Off Scotland. She set up the group in 2020 to oppose protests in Edinburgh, where she is a student. She has noticed a shift, she says, away from moral objections to abortion to talk about free speech. That is good news for Mr Carney of 40 Days for Life. Even pro-choice Britons agree with him about its importance, he says. \u201cFreedom of speech is being butchered in Scotland. They can ban us\u2026but they can\u2019t do that and call themselves a free democracy.\u201d \u25a0This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline \"Over here\"Britain October 15th 2022Britain\u2019s government is yet to deal with a mess of its own makingAmerican pro-life activists make their presence felt in BritainA trial of e-scooters in Britain has encouraging resultsThe BBC marks its 100th birthdayA thaw in Britain\u2019s frozen unionFrom the October 15th 2022 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contentsExplore the editionShareReuse this contentDiscover moreNext, Britain\u2019s retail superstarYou might yawn at its clothing but not at its resultsWithout realising it, Britain has become a nation of immigrantsAnother surprise: it\u2019s very good at assimilating peopleThe government wants investors to buy BritishBut protectionism is not the answer to years of underwhelming returnsSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentHelp and contact usKeep updatedLinkedInFacebookXInstagramThreadsTikTokYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in \u201ca severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.\u201d The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist Impact EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesExecutive JobsTo enhance your experience and ensure our website runs smoothly, we use\n        cookies and similar technologies.Manage CookiesTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Data RightsCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.
