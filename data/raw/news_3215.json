Wade in the U.S. raises concerns for women\u2019s reproductive safety and rights, as abortion bans make the procedure illegal in more states\nThe 24th of June 2022 saw the US Supreme Court make its final ruling on abortion access, with 5 of the 9 judges voting in favour of overturning Roe v. Wade, subsequently creating a complete abortion ban in seven states, and 17 other states soon to follow.\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade shows not only a disregard for women\u2019s choices and human rights but also represents a wider assault on reproductive rights for all who can get pregnant.\nWhat the overturning demonstrates is a disregard for all except those who identify as, and are biologically male.\nAccess to safe abortions is now at risk for millions of people in the U.S, as abortion bans have made the procedure illegal in some states, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade \u2013 the case that established women\u2019s constitutional right to abortion in 1973.\nAbortion is a medical procedure that terminates a pregnancy, which millions of women, girls and people with wombs use every year. Around 1 in 4 pregnancies end in an abortion every year, according to Amnesty International.\nAccording to the UNFPA\u2019s\u00a02022 State of World Population report, almost half of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended, and over 60% of these may end in abortion. If abortion is not made a legal procedure, it will still occur \u2013 but unsafely.\nWhile pro-life arguments insist that life begins at conception, and all pregnancies should be carried out, researchers and women alike raise concerns about the health and economic consequences this could induce. It has been pointed out that those arguing for the \u2018protection of life\u2019 (indicating that a baby is being killed when aborted as an embryo) are overlooking the serious consequences pregnancy can have on both a mother and their child.\nSome of the frequent complications women can develop during their pregnancy include:\n\nDeep vein thrombosis in pregnancy\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nItching and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy\nAnxiety and depression\nHigh blood pressure\nGestational diabetes\nInfections such as UTIs\nPreeclampsia\nPreterm labour\nMiscarriages\nStillbirth\nSevere, persistent nausea and vomiting\nIron-deficiency anaemia\nEctopic pregnancy\nPlacental complications\nAmniotic fluid complications\nObesity and Weight Gain\nVaginal bleeding\nConvulsions/fits\nSevere vomiting\n\nThere are few other experiences which are as physically and psychologically draining as pregnancy. Pregnancy is a serious experience which can leave people disabled or mentally ill, with the process frequently resulting in injury and even death. Forcing an individual to undergo this process against their consent when safer alternatives exist can be considered barbaric and backwards.\n\n\u2018Pro-life\u2019 until the child is born\nWhile consenting to sex does not equate to consenting to pregnancy, abortion exists in numerous countries as a safety net for women who are mentally, financially, or physically unready to bear a child.\nThe average cost of giving birth in the U.S is between $4,000 to $15,000, and childcare costs average at $14117 yearly. If the pro-life cause was just about protecting children, there surely must be more regulations in place for new parents to better raise, afford and protect their children.\nThe average cost of giving birth in the U.S is $4,000 to $15,000, and childcare costs average at $14117 yearly.\nHealthcare in the U.S is the most expensive out of every nation in the world, with some of the shortest maternity leaves and no mandatory maternal pay, concerns for the already staggering cost of food, resources, education, and overall standard of living are warranted.\nCurrently, around 45% of all abortions around the world are unsafe, meaning they are not done by a professional (commonly due to lack of legality), making the procedure a leading cause of maternal death on a global scale.\nBanning abortion and a woman\u2019s right to choose has the potential to increase poverty in the USA, as well as create an influx of maternal health issues which most parents,\u00a0especially those below the poverty line will be unable to pay for. As these maternal health issues increase, certain demographics will be hit harder than others with maternal mortality being two to three times higher for Black women than white women.\nIn cases of rape and incest, which are some of the most argued cases for advocates of abortion rights, there exists a danger of not having safe access to abortion for those who are unwillingly impregnated by an abuser.\nIf a girl can become pregnant after the beginning of her period, girls as young as 10 years old are at risk of becoming non-consenting mothers \u2013 posing a danger to their bodies and minds. This is a disturbing reality for young girls who are already legally allowed to be forced into child marriages in 44 U.S states.\nGirls as young as 10 years old are at risk of becoming non-consenting mothers\nAlong with this, babies born of incest have a higher likelihood of developing birth deformities, and children conceived through rape and abuse are at a higher chance of also being abused, too.\nAbortion access isn\u2019t just about the safety and rights of women, and those who become pregnant, it is also about the safety of children potentially being born into impoverished, abusive, or unwilling families.\nAs the U.S is the country with the highest amount of school shootings\u00a0globally, the U.S has done little to protect children\u2019s lives post-birth. The system does not protect children once they are born, so\u00a0banning a woman\u2019s right to choose to have a child is dangerous in this regard.\nOver the next few years following the overturning of Roe v. Wade the U.S can expect to see a considerable increase in population, however, as of now both homelessness and the number of children being placed in foster care are still on the increase. Currently, 30% of all homeless people in the country consist of families with young children and there are over 400,000 children in the foster system across the country. Children in these scenarios are at increased risk of abuse, neglect and experiencing health problems \u2013 and it is apparent these numbers are only going to increase following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\u00a0The adoption and foster care system cannot afford or manage to take in more children.\nA shortage of breast milk formula occurred in the US in May 2022\nU.S Republicans have traditionally held more conservative points of view regarding progressive legislation like Roe v. Wade and same-sex marriage. Whilst holding these pro-life and anti-abortion stances, numerous Republicans have continued to reject the idea of\u00a0universal access to healthcare and barely vote for increasing access to the basic material needs of children with food, clothing, shelter, and childcare, and now, baby formula too. In just May of 2022, 192 Republicans voted against a $28 million aid boost for baby formula, one month before upturning Roe v. Wade.\nAlong with this, U.S conservatives have frequently opposed reproductive education, including defunding and demonising Planned Parenthood \u2013 an institution which promotes healthy reproduction, sexual health information, abortion rights and more. Additionally, the constant fuelling of money between the NRA and politicians, where guns are easily, and legally accessible by young people, drives the upsurge of school shootings yearly. Politicians who vote for abortion bans do not correspondingly support the population to have more children.\nAs the country with the second-highest amount of unfair inequality in the world, the U.S is currently in no state to host more children for families who cannot afford them. Combined with a lack of universal healthcare and a scarily high death rate for mothers, an abortion ban will only increase existing poverty and health crises nationally, creating a pregnancy poverty trap for women.\nControlling women with \u201cforced motherhood\u201d\nHaving a child (with no paid maternity leave and no government payout) takes a huge toll on women\u2019s average expenses, and worsens job outcomes. Women\u2019s paychecks on average decrease after having their first child \u2013 but the drop in salary does not apply to the fathers.\nWhat is clear is that along with stripping back the reproductive rights of those with wombs and removing the body autonomy of millions, abortion bans will increase the numbers falling into the poverty trap, disrupt education, careers, and life plans, and worsen the circumstances of women unable to leave an abusive partner.\u00a0Many women die during pregnancy due to abuse and domestic homicide (particularly Black women \u2013 which is currently at one in seven).\nOne study highlighted how\u00a08.4% of reported maternal mortality deaths were murders \u2013 with Black women being seven times more likely to die this way than white women. Most of these cases occurred at the hands of a domestic partner.\nIn the pro-life sentiment, if all life matters \u2013 why does this same sympathy not apply to a struggling mother or parent? Why has the pregnant parent\u2019s life and autonomy come second to their pregnancy?\nIn cases of miscarriage and sexual assault\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade may also result in cases of miscarriage being called into question, mothers are at risk of being imprisoned simply for having a body which is unable to carry a child, often through no fault of their own.\nIn 2020, a 21-year-old Native American woman from Oklahoma was arrested for manslaughter after having a miscarriage. \u00a0In October of 2021, she was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison for the first-degree manslaughter of her unborn son. Miscarriage happens in 1 in 4 pregnancies, and for many reasons \u2013 it is not a choice. Adding to this, she lost the right to vote for these four years \u2013 as voting is prohibited for many felons while incarcerated and for some time after depending on the state.\n\nI\u2019ve said it once, and I\u2019ll say it a thousand times: The treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, a septic uterus, or a miscarriage that your body won\u2019t release is abortion. If you can\u2019t get those abortions, you die. You. Die.\n\u2014 Andrea Junker (@Strandjunker) June 24, 2022\n\nCriminalising abortion is a form of discrimination, which further fuels stigma, and will inevitably worsen the demographics of women being incarcerated. The U.S has already got a high incarceration rate for Black and Hispanic women \u2013 and making abortion a crime will only\u00a0increase this staggering incarceration rate for these communities who already struggle.\nEssentially, legislation passed banning women from bodily autonomy generates a culture of women used as birthing vessels, with fewer rights than the baby they carry. As of today, there are no laws which dictate or punish men for unwanted pregnancies, even though a significant percentage of national pregnancies are due to sexual assault and the refusal to cooperate with birth control.\nIn some states, like Idaho and Texas, rapists\u2019 families are becoming legally allowed to sue the woman they impregnate if she chooses to have an abortion but doesn\u2019t inform the police she has been raped. If the woman fails to report the rape to the police and their physician before an abortion, a rapist\u2019s family members could sue and collect damages of $20,000 per family member, according to the bill and its legislative sponsor. This legislation demonstrates how mothers are still not in control of their bodies even when they are victims of serious harm.\nMothers are still not in control of their bodies even when they are victims of serious harm\nTo further display how much so this ruling is against women rather than against the death of an unborn child, we can recall that dead bodies possess more bodily autonomy rights than women. One cannot take an organ from a non-consenting person who has passed, but women will be routinely forced \u2013 and arrested if they fail \u2013 to carry out a pregnancy.\nID\u00a0250229288\u00a0\u00a9\u00a0David Andrade\u00a0|\u00a0Dreamstime.com\nThis legislation could be undoing decades of gender equality initiatives harnessed and fought for by women since gaining the right to vote.\nEven with child support from a non-custodial parent, carrying, raising, and supporting a child would become a mother\u2019s main responsibility \u2013 which is undeniably difficult, in many cases dangerous, and increasingly expensive in modern-day America.\nIt seems the real argument in the U.S is not surrounding whether foetuses should live, it is about whether the government can control women and people with wombs and strip constitutional rights from American citizens.\nThe lack of separation between Church and State in American politics and culture has undeniably stripped women of a core right with this Supreme Court ruling: the human right to choose.\n\nAbortion is a human right.For everyone. Everywhere.We will never stop fighting.\n\u2014 Amnesty International USA (@amnestyusa) June 24, 2022\n\nPlease note: This is an opinion piece written by an editor.
