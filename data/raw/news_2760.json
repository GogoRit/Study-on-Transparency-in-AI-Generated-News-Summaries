As an old meme might say\u2026 \u201cThe number of pro-lifers rationalizing voting for a pro-abortion candidate is too damn high!\u201d SFLA President Kristan Hawkins has been working to put it in perspective on Instagram over the past few weeks leading up to election.\nA Vote is Not a Valentine\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMy thoughts exactly. Continuing the why you need to #voteprolifefirst posts because this election matters. Don\u2019t let anyone fool you into thinking it doesn\u2019t.\nA post shared by  Kristan Hawkins (@kristanmercerhawkins) on Oct 26, 2020 at 4:38am PDT\n\n\n\nAmericans seem to think that casting a vote on November 3rd is akin to sending a grade school valentine to your crush. Here\u2019s a secret: you don\u2019t have to be head over heels for your pick. None of us know Trump personally, but it stands to reason that not all of us would like to be BFFs with him. But that\u2019s not what matters here.\u00a0If you\u2019re passionately pro-life, you\u2019ve decided that abortion breaks your heart the most in this world.\n\nBeing a Single-Issue Voter Isn\u2019t Crazy\n\u201cSingle-issue voter\u201d has a lot of stigma. The argument against the concept is much like the critique of being \u201cpro-life.\u201d\nBut don\u2019t you care about ________!?\nYes. Everyone on Earth cares about more than one thing. But it\u2019s not that radical to assess all the issues, see that one of them kills 1 million innocent people in your country every year, and cast your vote based on that. It\u2019s not the first time in history that a single-issue voter was the most logical thing you could be.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis is what I think every time someone tries to tell me that there are many issues besides the violence of abortion that should be considered when voting\u2026#voteprolifefirst\nA post shared by  Kristan Hawkins (@kristanmercerhawkins) on Oct 25, 2020 at 5:25am PDT\n\n\n\n\u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Isn\u2019t Quite Right\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this argument as a self-justification for casting a pro-life vote. But it\u2019s a fairly pessimistic way of looking at things. During President Trump\u2019s 2016-2020 tenure:\n\n\nHe\u2019s asked the FDA to keep health & safety standards for abortion pills (even though the abortion industry is trying to remove them)\n\n\nHe made Title X reforms that caused Planned Parenthood to walk away from $60 million dollars (and those same reforms allowed life-affirming centers access to that money)\n\nWas the first sitting president to speak at the March for Life\nSigned an executive order attempting to protect babies born alive after failed abortions\nHe has protected conscience rights and religious freedom on multiple occasions, which often affects abortion\nEnsured access to ACA policies without mandated abortion coverage\nMade Medicaid less pro-abortion\nAdvocated for life in front of the U.N.\nAddressed the funding of unethical research on aborted fetal tissue\nAnd much more. Read about it here.\u00a0\n\nOn the contrary, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign goals include:\n\nRamming through the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment), which would effectively put abortion in the Constitution\nStrengthen Obamacare, which forces Americans to fund abortion & contraception through insurance\nRemove state rights to regulate abortion\nGive more tax money to Planned Parenthood\nRescind the Mexico City Policy which limits international funding of abortion\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis is what I will use my voice and vote for.
