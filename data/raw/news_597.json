THby Tim HumeNZby Nina ZabickaJanuary 29, 2021, 6:27pmShareTweetSnapA demonstrator holds up a cloth hanger as she takes part in a pro-choice demonstration in front of the constitutional court in Warsaw, Poland, on January 28, 2021.\u00a0Photo: WOJTEK RADWANSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesPolish pro-choice protesters said they were fired up for a long fight against a new, near-total ban on abortion and uncowed by a government crackdown, as they prepared for another night of nationwide demonstrations Friday.\u201cWhat does this verdict mean for me? Firstly, even more pissed off, [with] the desire to go out on the streets every day,\u201d said Patrycja Tomaszewska, a 26-year-old teacher who was on the frontlines of protests in Warsaw Wednesday night.\u00a0Advertisement\u201cWe do not agree with such a brutal violation of our rights,\u201d she told VICE World News. \u201cAnd we will fight for our own.\u201d NewsThousands Take to the Streets as Poland Enforces Abortion BanDipo Faloyin01.28.21Poland\u2019s \u201cWomen\u2019s Strike\u201d protest movement has been reignited by the conservative government\u2019s sudden move Wednesday to implement a court ruling greatly restricting access to legal termination in Poland, whose abortion laws were already among the strictest in Europe.The new law bans the termination of pregnancies with severe foetal defects, removing the most common of the few previous grounds for legal abortion in the predominantly Catholic country. As a result, legal terminations will only be available in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother\u2019s health is in jeopardy. The controversial ruling was made on the 22nd of October last year by Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal \u2014 whose bench is dominated by appointees of the ruling conservative Law and Justice party. Such rulings are usually enacted into law by being published in the official gazette within a matter of days. News\u2018We Are Governed By Morons': Poland's Leading Pro-Choice ActivistPawe\u0142 M\u0105czewski01.25.21But the abortion ruling inspired hundreds of thousands of Poles to rise up in a wave of mass, women-led demonstrations on a scale not seen in decades, prompting the government to hold off on enacting the judgment. Some lawmakers even floated the idea of softening the ruling.AdvertisementIt was only shelved temporarily, it turns out. This week, the government unexpectedly enacted the ruling after the Tribunal issued a justification of its judgment, and Poland erupted once more.Aga, a 36-year-old from Warsaw who did not want her surname used, was another who joined the protests this week to oppose \u201canother stage of taking away our basic rights to decide for ourselves and our bodies.\u201dShe told VICE World News that the new law was \u201ca shock, in the sense that it\u2019s hard to believe that such things are happening in the EU, in the 21st century.\u201dThe impacts of the new law have been immediate. Thousands of protesters have mobilised in the streets of Polish cities and towns, meeting a brutal crackdown from police. Among those detained Thursday night was writer and activist Klementyna Suchanow, a co-founder of the Women\u2019s Strike protest movement.At a press conference Friday, Marta Lempart, a fellow co-founder of the movement, said her organisation viewed Suchanow\u2019s arrest as an act of harassment by the government, \u201cthat treats her as a person who is an enemy of the state, not as a regular citizen.\u201d NewsPoland\u2019s Abortion Ban Is Already Having a Chilling EffectTim Hume11.19.20She said she expected further sweeping arrests by the state in a bid to deter protesters from mobilising against the law \u2014 an act she anticipated could have a radicalising effect on many young people.Advertisement\u201cThese young people went from being European citizens with broad horizons and confidence in the future, straight to being victims of unlawful police brutality,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, family planning groups said they were receiving dozens of panicked calls from women who have had terminations scheduled, as the implementation of the law threw essential medical procedures into disarray. Rights groups warned that the new law would only damage women\u2019s health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to travel overseas for terminations. News'No More Compromise' \u2013 Pro-Choice Protesters in Poland Vow to Fight On Tim Hume11.02.20For Tomaszewska, who took to the frontlines of protests in Warsaw this week, the fight isn\u2019t only about the new, draconian law, but for the future of a country in which many women, liberals, LGBTQ and other groups feel increasingly alienated by their conservative, traditionalist government.\u201cWhat will happen next? Bearing children from rape? A ban on contraception and an outright ban on sex education?\u201d she said. \u201cThese questions are related to what the ruling means to me \u2014 one big, bloody uncertainty that after some time, I will wake up in a country from which I will have to flee in order to live.\u201dTagged:worldnewsabortionreproductive rightsLaw and Justicewomen's strikeGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
