Ron DeSantis in his criticism of how the Republican party has handled the issue, calling Florida\u2019s six-week ban \u201ca terrible thing and a terrible mistake.\u201d \n    \n\n            DeSantis\u2019 camp hit back on Sunday, taking aim at the former president for saying he\u2019d be willing to work with both parties on abortion.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the disastrous results of Donald Trump compromising with Democrats: over $7 trillion in new debt, an unfinished border wall, and the jailbreak First Step Act letting violent criminals back on to the streets. Republicans across the country know that Ron DeSantis will never back down,\u201d tweeted spokesperson Andrew Romeo.\n    \n\n            Trump also warned Republicans that the party would lose voters by advancing abortion restrictions without exceptions for cases of rape, incest or risks to the mother\u2019s life.\n    \n\n            \u201cOther than certain parts of the country, you can\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re not going to win on this issue,\u201d he said. \n    \n\n            Trump\u2019s comments made plain the challenge for 2024 Republican presidential primary contenders: trying to balance the priorities of their conservative base, for whom the Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade was a victory decades in the making, and those of the general electorate, which has consistently supported abortion rights \u2013 most recently in the 2022 midterms and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this spring.\n    \n\n            Abortion could also be a pivotal issue this fall in Virginia\u2019s state legislative elections, which are widely viewed as a barometer of the electorate\u2019s mood in the lead-up to next year\u2019s presidential election.\n    \n\n            Trump\u2019s appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices paved the way to the reversal of the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights across the United States through the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. \n    \n\n            That reversal left abortion rights up to the states, which has led to a patchwork of laws \u2013 including bans on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy in Florida and Iowa, the first state to vote in the GOP presidential nominating process.\n    \n\n    Defining campaign issue\n\n\n            Abortion rights have been a major fault line in the 2024 Republican primary. Trump\u2019s former vice president, Mike Pence, has advocated a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks. DeSantis, Trump\u2019s top-polling rival, has touted the six-week ban he signed into law. However, other contenders, including Nikki Haley, have taken more moderate approaches, warning of the political backlash Republicans could face among the broader electorate by pursuing strict abortion restrictions. \n    \n\n            Trump would not commit to a specific policy preference in the interview. He deflected questions about whether he would support a federal ban \u2013 and if so, after how many weeks \u2013 or would rather the issue be left to statehouses.\n    \n\n            \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is you\u2019re going to come up with a number of weeks or months, you\u2019re going to come up with a number that\u2019s going to make people happy,\u201d Trump said.\n    \n\n            Trump said he believed it was \u201cprobably better\u201d to leave abortion restrictions up to the states instead of trying to pass federal legislation on the issue. \n    \n\n            \u201cFrom a pure standpoint, from a legal standpoint, I think it\u2019s probably better. But I can live with it either way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt could be state or could it federal, I don\u2019t frankly care.\u201d \n    \n\n            The intra-GOP debate over abortion took center stage at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering, attended by many of the state\u2019s leading conservative evangelical activists. \n    \n\n            Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the most vocal Trump critics among the GOP contenders, told reporters Saturday in Iowa that Trump has \u201ctaken evangelical voters for granted\u201d and is \u201cwaffling on important issues.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cI think he is looking at the abortion question as not whether it\u2019s going to win evangelical support, but what that\u2019s going to look like down the road, and as he said he wants everybody to like him,\u201d Hutchinson said. \n    \n\n            Asked about federal legislation on abortion, DeSantis continued not to engage on the topic of a national ban, instead pointing to new restrictions in states such as Iowa and Florida.\n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ve been a pro-life governor. I\u2019ll be a pro-life president,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cClearly, a state like Iowa has been able to move the ball with pro-life protections. Florida has been able to move the ball.\u201d\n    \n\n            Pence reiterated his support for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy as a minimum, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s an idea whose time has come.\u201d He said Trump and other GOP candidates want to relegate the abortion issue to the states, \u201cbut I won\u2019t have it.\u201d \n    \n\n    \u2018Personal for every woman and every man\u2019\n\n\n            However, other contenders more focused on the general electorate, including Haley \u2013 the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations \u2013 have sought to thread the same needle as Trump. \n    \n\n            Haley on Saturday told attendees at the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Iowa that her beliefs are the \u201chard truth.\u201d She said pursuing a federal 15-week abortion ban would have \u201ceverybody running from us.\u201d \n    \n\n            While Haley opposes abortion, she has emphasized she believes Republicans and Democrats need find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n    \n\n            \u201cThis issue is personal for every woman and every man. And we need to treat it that way. I don\u2019t judge anyone for being pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life,\u201d she said. \n    \n\n            Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on CNN last week that he would be open to signing a federal abortion ban \u201cif it represented consensus,\u201d while admitting the current setbacks to reaching that consensus within the US Senate and across states.\n    \n\n            \u201cI want all of the 50 states to be able to weigh in if they want to, and what their state laws should be, and then let\u2019s see if it\u2019s a consensus,\u201d he said. \n    \n\n            Democrats, meanwhile, are eyeing abortion as one of the most important issues in the 2024 presidential election. \n    \n\n            CNN previously reported that President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign earlier this month made a digital advertising buy highlighting the positions of Trump and other GOP 2024 contenders on the issue. \n    \n\n            \u201cAs Donald Trump visits states where women are suffering the consequences of his extreme, anti-abortion agenda, this ad reminds voters in states that have passed some of the most extreme abortion bans of Trump\u2019s key role in appointing conservative justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement to CNN.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Sunday.\n\n\nCNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan,
