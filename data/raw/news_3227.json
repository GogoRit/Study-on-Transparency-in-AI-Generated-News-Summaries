They won\u2019t strongly condemn the violence and threats pregnancy centers are facing.In June alone, there were more than 30 attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers. Here are just a few:This Florida pregnancy care center was vandalized with graffiti of threatening phrases like, \u201cYour time is up,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re coming for U\u201d and \u201cJane\u2019s revenge.\u201dLifeChoice Pregnancy Center in Winter Haven.

One of the centers had multiple windows broken and graffiti of the phrase, \u201cIf abortion isn\u2019t safe neither are you!\u201dThe Lennon Pregnancy Center in Dearborn.

Multiple windows and the front door were also broken.Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center in Lynchburg.

Photo courtesy of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for LifeAttacking these centers doesn\u2019t celebrate the value and potential of human life or support women in a vulnerable position. These attacks do the opposite \u2013 signaling that a parent who has chosen life is unworthy of love and support.President Biden and the Left MUST condemn the violence and threats toward pro-life pregnancy centers. This is just the beginning of a new era to define the human rights issue of our generation.As Leader Rodgers said, \u201cThis Supreme Court decision marks a chance for us to restore hope and healing for every family \u2014 for moms and their children at every stage of life. May it begin with each one of us doing our part to protect and celebrate all life in the greatest experiment in self-governance the world has ever known.\u201dLet's come together as a nation to affirm every life is worth living by providing care, hope, and support for moms and their children at every stage of life.\u00a0CLICK HEREto read more on the Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act.CLICK HERE to watch Cassie and Serena share their stories with the Human Coalition.CLICK HERE to meet Chloe.
