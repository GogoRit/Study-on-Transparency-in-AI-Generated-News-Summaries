Newsroom, Sep 27, 2022 / 19:00 pm\nTwenty-two members of Congress are demanding an explanation from the Department of Justice after the arrest of a Catholic pro-life leader in front of his wife and children at the family\u2019s home in Pennsylvania last week.\u00a0\nMark Houck, 48, was charged with two counts of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or the FACE Act, and entered a not guilty plea at his arraignment in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\nThe FACE act \u201cprohibits violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain or provide reproductive health services,\u201d according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\u00a0\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s treatment of pro-life leader Mark Houck is chilling,\u201d Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said in a press release that accompanied the Sept. 27 letter. \u201cInstead of allowing for a local resolution of the dispute, the FBI nationalized the matter by using excessive force with an early morning raid at gunpoint in front of young children. The American people deserve answers.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter requests, by Sept. 30, \u201can explanation for the excessive level of force used by the FBI in this case, and why the power of federal law enforcement was once again used against an American citizen in what should be a state and local matter.\u201d\n\u201cAttorney General Merrick Garland oversees an increasingly politicized FBI that seems hell-bent on making examples of average American citizens who don\u2019t align politically with the administration,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in the press release.\u00a0\n\u201cGiven what we know about it thus far that is what the case of the raid on Mark Houck\u2019s home appears to be,\u201d Roy added. \u201cAnd the FBI should immediately answer for its apparent use of a 25- to 30-person SWAT team with guns drawn to target Mark Houck, a pro-life father of seven, for allegedly shoving a guy in front of an abortion clinic (while he maintains he was defending his 12-year-old son).\u201d\nHouck\u2019s arrest gained national attention after his wife publicly offered her account about details of the resources and tactics used by the FBI to arrest the pro-life leader and family man.\n\u201cA SWAT team of about 25 came to my house with about 15 vehicles and started pounding on our door,\u201d Houck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie Houck, told CNA the day of the arrest.\n\u201cThey said they were going to break in if he didn\u2019t open it. And then they had about five guns pointed at my husband, myself, and basically at my kids,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FBI disputed Ryan-Marie Houck\u2019s account of the arrest in a statement on Monday, calling the claims \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\u201cNo SWAT Team or SWAT operators were involved. FBI agents knocked on Mr. Houck\u2019s front door, identified themselves as FBI agents, and asked him to exit the residence. He did so and was taken into custody without incident pursuant to an indictment,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cExtensive planning takes place prior to the service of any federal warrant. The FBI then employs the personnel and tactics deemed necessary to effect a safe arrest or search,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s the FBI\u2019s standard practice not to discuss such operational specifics, we can say that the number of personnel and vehicles widely reported as being on scene Friday is an overstatement, and the tactics used by FBI personnel were professional, in line with standard practices, and intended to ensure the safety of everyone present in and outside the residence,\u201d the statement concluded.\nAn FBI spokesman declined to answer CNA\u2019s questions about the number of law enforcement personnel at the scene and whether any drew their weapons and pointed them at the family.\nThe charges\nHouck was indicted by a federal grand jury Sept. 22 after a Planned Parenthood clinic escort alleged that Houck pushed him twice, causing him to fall to the ground both times.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal indictment says that Houck twice assaulted the 72-year-old man, identified in the indictment by the initials B.L., who was at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia on Oct. 13, 2021.\nAccording to the indictment, Houck shoved the man to the ground as he was attempting to escort two patients. The indictment also says that Houck \u201cverbally confronted\u201d and \u201cforcefully shoved\u201d him to the ground in front of Planned Parenthood the same day. The indictment says the man was injured and needed medical attention.\nHouck regularly prays the rosary, hands out literature, and \u201cdoes some sidewalk counseling\u201d outside the clinic, his wife told CNA the day of the arrest.\nBrian Middleton, who acted as Houck\u2019s family spokesperson, told CNA Monday that Mark Houck maintains that he pushed the clinic escort in an effort to protect his then 12-year-old son from the man\u2019s verbal harassment of the boy.\nMiddleton said that the man fell down but was not seriously hurt and required only \u201ca Band-Aid on his finger.\u201d\nHouck faces the possibility of 11 years in prison if convicted under the new federal charges.\u00a0\nThe congressional letter addressed the dropped state charges.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is much to learn about the extent of the FBI\u2019s operations in this case, especially since state-level assault charges were apparently dismissed by local authorities in Philadelphia,\u201d the congressional letter says.\n\u201cSurely, the FBI must have an extraordinary reason for showing up at the home of an American family, allegedly with roughly 25 heavily armed federal agents, and arresting a father in front of his seven children. At the moment, it appears to be an extraordinary overreach for political ends.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nDepartment of Justice, \nFACE Act, \nFreedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Bukuras is a journalist at the Catholic News Agency.\u00a0 Joe has prior experience working in state and federal government, in non-profits, and Catholic education.
