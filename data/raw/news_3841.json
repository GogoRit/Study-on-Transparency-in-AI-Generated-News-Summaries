It is a Bill against the Constitution, against the right to life and against the protection of children and of the family,\u201d Catholic Bishops in Kenya said in their June 23 statement.\u00a0\nIn July, members of KCCB reached out to \u201cChristians and people of goodwill to stand up and defend the family unity, the dignity of our children, the religious and positive cultural values of our people and our identity as Kenyans.\u201d\u00a0\nRepresentatives of different pro-life groups in Kenya say, in their August 17 statement, that the Bill is advocating for \u201cillegalities and practices that are not acceptable in our country as it will make legal abortion on demand in the country contrary to the spirit of our Constitution of 2010 and the Penal Code.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe bill is sponsored and championed by foreign NGOs that have continuously pushed for it online, through media and also through holding workshops with a number of legislators,\u201d they say and continue, \u201cThe outspoken agenda by these non-governmental organizations has been to make abortion legal in the entire of Africa, Kenya being their number one target.\u201d\n\nMore in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop in Nigeria Decries \u201cblatant misuse of public resources\u201d, Says Perpetrator \u201crationalize sin\u201d\nRead the article\n\n\n\n\n On the controversial Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE), the pro-life groups say that the proposed law \u201cis aimed at legalizing CSE in the name of adolescent-friendly education.\u201d\nThey note that the Bill is \u201cpushing for surrogacy without offering a clear framework on how this can be practiced and without taking into account the negative effects which the practice has, including harm to the best interests of the Child and the spirit of Article 45 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\u201cThe bill leaves loopholes for same sex unions and related practices, which are currently illegal in the country and are not for the good of the entire society,\u201d they add, expressing their readiness \u201cto help in championing and steering an all stakeholders forum that will come up with a bill that is acceptable by all.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nKenya, \nPro-life, \nReproductive Health Care Bill, \nKCCB, \nCitizenGo, \nKCPF, \nCSE, \nACI Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagdalene Kahiu is a Kenyan journalist with passion in Church communication.
