Kristi Noem on Sunday defended her state\u2019s abortion ban, which includes an exception when the pregnant person\u2019s life is at risk but not in cases involving incest or rape.\n    \n\n            When asked by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d whether children similar to a 10-year-old child abuse victim who traveled from Ohio to Indiana to receive an abortion should be forced to give birth, Noem said, \u201cThis tragedy is horrific. I can\u2019t even imagine. I have never had anybody in my family or myself gone through anything like this. \u2026 But, in South Dakota, the law today is that the abortions are illegal, except to save the life of the mother.\u201d\n    \n\n            Noem told Bash she would not be in favor of amending the current law \u2013 a so-called trigger law that took effect following the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2013 to add an exception for similar situations, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a tragic situation should be perpetuated by another tragedy.\u201d\n    \n\n            But Noem did signal that a 10-year-old in the described situation may qualify for the state exception for life-threatening medical emergencies. \n    \n\n            \u201cI think that\u2019s something that \u2013 yeah, that situation, the doctor, the family, the individuals closest to that will make the decisions there for that family,\u201d she told Bash.\n    \n\n            \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about the time we live in right now,\u201d Noem added. \u201cEvery state will have different laws on the books. The decisions will be made by the legislators that are closest to the people. That\u2019s appropriate. It\u2019s the way our Constitution intended.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Nacion/Cover Images/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThese are the states where abortion rights are still protected after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\n\n\n\n\n            The US Supreme Court\u2019s recent majority ruling that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion has led more states to implement their own abortion policies. The ruling has already resulted in a patchwork system \u2013 as was anticipated \u2013 in which access to the procedure is, for many people, determined largely by whether a state is controlled by Republicans or Democrats. \n    \n\n            Along with South Dakota, trigger abortion laws have been implemented in at least three states: Arkansas, Missouri and Wisconsin. A Mississippi trigger law is set to take effect on July 7.\n    \n\n            Wyoming, North Dakota, Idaho, and Tennessee are awaiting state action, and legal fights over abortion restrictions are underway in more than a dozen states. \n    \n\n            Noem was also asked Sunday about supporting paid family leave or greater financial access to child care.\n    \n\n            \u201cThat\u2019s a discussion we\u2019re going to have. I think it\u2019s important that we back up exactly what I have been saying since I\u2019m governor, that we want stronger families,\u201d she told Bash. \u201cMany times, it\u2019s the financial cost, the medical cost and the leave policy that many people have a tough time supporting. But I think, in South Dakota, that the time is right.\u201d\n    \n\n            Noem, however, said she does not back expanding Medicaid, which is on the state\u2019s ballot in November. The measure would cover low-income women without health insurance in South Dakota during and after pregnancy. \n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Devan Cole and Tierney Sneed contributed to this
