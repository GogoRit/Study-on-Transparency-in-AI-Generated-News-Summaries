Doug Burgum signed legislation banning the procedure throughout pregnancy, with slim exceptions up to six weeks\u2019 gestation.\nIn those early weeks, abortions would only be allowed in cases of rape or incest, or in medical emergencies. After six weeks, rape and incest victims cannot get abortions. Abortions to treat some medical emergencies, such as ectopic pregnancies, are allowed at any stage of pregnancy.\n\u201cThis bill clarifies and refines existing state law \u2026 and reaffirms North Dakota as a pro-life state,\u201d Burgum said in a statement.\nLast year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide has triggered multiple state laws banning or restricting the procedure. Many were met with legal challenges. Currently, bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy are in place\u00a0in at least 13 states\u00a0and on hold in others because of court injunctions.\nOn the other side, Democratic governors in\u00a0at least 20 states\u00a0this year launched a network intended to strengthen abortion access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that eliminated women\u2019s constitutional right to end a pregnancy and shifted regulatory powers over the procedure to state governments.\nWATCH: Tracking and combating the rise of false online information about abortion\nThe North Dakota\u00a0law is designed\u00a0to take effect immediately, but\u00a0last month the state Supreme Court ruled\u00a0a previous ban is to remain blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds. Last week, lawmakers said they intended to pass the latest bill as\u00a0a message\u00a0to the state\u2019s high court signaling that the people of North Dakota want to restrict abortion.\nSupporters have said\u00a0the measure signed Monday protects all human life, while opponents contend it will have dire consequences for women and girls.\nNorth Dakota no longer has any abortion clinics. Last summer, the state\u2019s only facility, the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic, shut its doors in Fargo and moved operations a short distance across the border\u00a0to Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion remains legal. The clinic\u2019s owner is still pursuing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of North Dakota\u2019s previous abortion ban.\nIt\u2019s expected that this new ban will also be the subject of legal challenges.\nRepublican Sen. Janne Myrdal, of Edinburg, sponsored the latest state legislation.\n\u201cNorth Dakota has always been pro-life and believed in valuing the moms and children both,\u201d Myrdal said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty happy and grateful that the governor stands with that value.\u201d\nDemocratic Rep. Liz Conmy voted against the bill and said she had hoped Burgum would not sign it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think women in North Dakota are going to accept this, and there will be action in the future to get our rights back,\u201d Conmy said. \u201cOur Legislature is overwhelmingly pro-pregnancy, but I think women in the state would like to make their own decisions.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to make clear that abortion to treat some medical emergencies, including an ectopic pregnancy, is allowed at any stage of pregnancy, not just up to six weeks\u2019 gestation under the state\u2019s new law.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Debbie Jeffreys of Metairie, Louisiana, holds a sign during nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v.
