Our team at Students for Life pitched in our favorite shows that explore the abortion issue, the dignity of life, the politics or faith that play into it, and everything in between.\n\nWithout further ado\u2026 here are our favorite pro-life podcasts! In no particular order, of course.\n\n\nExplicitly Pro-Life\n\nOkay. We\u2019re a little biased on this one. Explicitly Pro-Life is hosted by SFLA President, Kristan Hawkins. It is both explicitly\u00a0and\u00a0exclusively pro-life, exploring every possible facet of this issue with hard-hitting truths, visits from outstanding guests, and plenty of sass.\n\n40 Days for Life\n40 Days for Life is a pro-life prayer ministry that organizes a bi-annual presence outside of abortion facilities \u2013 as well as a great podcast! The 40 Days Podcast explores everything from pro-life stories and baby saves to current events and analysis.\n\nEqual Rights Institute\nEqual Rights Institute is a pro-life apologetics organization whose mission is to teach pro-life people to dialogue effectively. ERI posts an audio blog every Monday that addresses the tough pro-life issues and how to talk about them.\n\nLife Chat\nThis pro-life podcast, put on by Illinois Right to Life, is another nice listening option for the well-rounded pro-lifer. Plus, check out the episode where they interview our own Northern Regional Coordinator, Tori Peterson, who was conceived in rape and lived in 12 foster homes.\n\nCatholic Answers, Pro-Life Open Forum\n\nCatholic Answers is a hugely popular religious podcast that addresses the faith at large. But on this little corner of Catholic Answers, pro-life advocates can find content specifically related to abortion.\u00a0\n\n\nRelatable with Allie Stuckey\n\n\u201cUpbeat and in-depth, Relatable with Allie Beth Stuckey breaks down the latest in culture, news, theology & politics from a Christian, conservative perspective.\u201d This is not specifically a pro-life podcast, but Allie does plenty of pro-life episodes!\u00a0\n\n\nThe Charlie Kirk Show\nCharlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point U.S.A. and the host of another podcast that is not exclusively focused on life issues. But this political podcast does provide analysis of current events that pertain to life, and his experience with college students will definitely resonate with Students for Life listeners.\n\nUnaborted with Seth Gruber\n\nSeth\u2019s stated goal is \u201cto examine the abortion wars from a cultural, philosophical, and theological perspective and provide both moral and spiritual clarity for my listeners.\u201d Currently a weekly show, Seth analyzes abortion-related events, news, and messages from politics, media, education, entertainment, and more!\n\nEnd Abortion Podcast\nThis podcast is produced by Priests for Life and brings you interviews with pro-life experts, audio from real pro-life rallies & prayer vigils, live Q&As, and more.\n\n\u00a0Care Net\u2019s CareCast\u2122\nSince 2016, Care Net\u2019s CareCast podcast has provided subscribers with insightful commentary on issues faced by the pro-life movement. Care Net\u2019s President and CEO Roland C. Warren and Chief Outreach Officer Vincent DiCaro tackle breaking news stories and enable listeners to discover what they can do to\u00a0turn their pro-life passion into Pro Abundant Life action!\n\nBONUS: Up and Coming Pro-Life Podcasts\nReclaiming Social Justice with Danny Rauda\nMany believe that religion is antithetical to achieving social justice (originally a Catholic term). But across history, faith communities have been at the forefront of social change; and thus hold lessons about building a more equitable world. This podcast is a return to faith-based activism. Are you a person of faith that wants to learn how to put it into action? Are you an activist/ally/accomplice questioning contemporary social justice dogma/approaches and exploring alternative paths? Then this podcast is for you. Tune in to learn how faith inspires and informs true social justice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe views & opinions expressed in each individual podcast do not necessarily reflect the views of Students for Life of America.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,841\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
