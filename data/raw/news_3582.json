By Leah J. TeichholtzBy Vivi E. Lu and Leah J. Teichholtz, Crimson Staff WritersHarvard Right to Life, a campus organization against abortion, hosted a speaker event with Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins Thursday evening.Around 50 people attended the event and a subsequent Q&A session, which was hosted in Harvard Hall as part of Hawkins\u2019 2022 campus speaking tour, called \u201cMake Abortion Illegal Again.\u201d The two-month tour spans eight campuses, including Ohio State University, Clemson University, and Yale.Protesters in support of abortion rights did not attend the event. Hawkins said in an interview after her talk that she increased her security due to social media posts suggesting student protest. She said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the lack of attendance from those opposed to her views.\u201cThat\u2019s where you actually get a lot of change at that point, when you start having folks who have different opinions, learn what each other actually believes, and stop talking over each other or shouting,\u201d Hawkins said.Ava K. Pallotta \u201925 \u2014 who organized a rally in support of abortion rights in May following the leaked Roe opinion \u2014 said she did not know about the Right to Life event and would have planned a protest otherwise.\u201cI would have wanted to counter protest to try to make sure that people who are pro-choice on this campus felt seen and supported,\u201d Pallotta said. \u201cThere is a group on campus that does not support Kristan Hawkins and Harvard Right to Life and their beliefs.\u201dDuring the event, Hawkins discussed her anti-abortion beliefs and described the procedure as the \u201cdirect and intentional killing of a pre-born child.\u201d\u201cWhen I say \u2018make abortion illegal again,\u2019 I\u2019m speaking out of a place of true concern. Concern for the pre-born child who was violently killed in a direct abortion, as well as for her mother or his mother, who is paternalistically told that her empowerment and future success relies upon her willingness to subjugate another human being,\u201d Hawkins said.Hawkins\u2019 tour comes in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, which eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion. Less than four months after the decision, 13 states have banned most abortions.AdvertisementEven so, Hawkins said striking down Roe \u201cwasn\u2019t a total victory\u201d for the movement against abortion because the Supreme Court only returned the issue to the states.\u201cWe would like to see the Supreme Court uphold laws that outlaw abortion. We can\u2019t wait to get to a point where we have a federal protection measure in place, a \u2018Life at Conception Act\u2019, then moving on to a federal amendment to our Constitution,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s been our mission from the beginning.\u201dMeanwhile, Pallotta said she hopes pro-abortion rights activism goes beyond merely reacting to the anti-abortion movement.\u201cFor me, it feels much more about, \u2018What can I do to help make people feel seen and help protect abortion access?\u2019 and less about, \u2018What are pro-lifers doing and how can I counter that?\u2019\u201d she said.\u2014Staff writer Vivi E.
