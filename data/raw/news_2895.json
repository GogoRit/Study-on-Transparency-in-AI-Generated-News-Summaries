There was such a cohesiveness throughout the group, and a willingness to be there with an open heart to what God had in store for us,\u201d said Buelvas. \u201cWe had no expectations for what we (would accomplish), just an open heart.\u201d\nBuelvas and members of the large group stood throughout the campaign outside the Women\u2019s Care Clinic on Lawrence Avenue holding signs with different messages such as \u201cPray to end abortion,\u201d \u201cHere to help\u201d and \u201cAsk me about healing after abortion.\u201d\nAt the fast\u2019s conclusion on Palm Sunday, Buelvas said she directly connected with six mothers who chose life over abortion. When she spoke with The Catholic Register on Holy Thursday, that number had grown to nine. The pre-fast mobilization efforts were so noticeable, said Buelvas, that a pregnant woman reached out looking for assistance before the campaign began.\nThis pro-life community also encountered a 27-year-old who sought an abortion after a relationship breakup, but changed her mind on seeing the \u201cWe will help you\u201d sign. Another woman wandered the streets looking for a providential signal to determine if she should terminate her pregnancy. She said the clear message she sought was a poster reading, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this today.\u201d\n\u201cThere was consolation after consolation that gave us strength to keep fasting,\u201d said Buelvas. \u201c(In previous years) we dealt with attacks (from) the pro-choice side, and other people saying horrible things about this campaign. The worst we got this year was \u2018the finger.\u2019 Compared to other campaigns that was nothing.\u201d\nMothers seeking help were connected with Toronto\u2019s Sisters of Life religious community, a Catholic sisterhood that assists vulnerable pregnant women throughout the GTA.\nBuelvas envisions a next step of St. James parishioners establishing a formalized pro-life group to assist the Sisters of Life in their ministry. The Sisters of Life told her April 13 that many more lives were touched by the campaign beyond women with whom she had direct contact.\n\u201cRight now, the Sisters of Life are just overflowing,\u201d said Buelvas. \u201cI was told \u2018since you guys started the campaign, more than 100 women have been calling to us in crisis and we are walking with them. We can\u2019t keep up. It is really busy.\u2019 \u201d\nJeff Gunnarson, national president of the Campaign Life Coalition, expressed his admiration for what the 40-day fast accomplished.\n\u201cThis inspiring story shows that for pro-life activism to be truly fruitful, it must be backed by prayer and real sacrifice. These individuals added God\u2019s life-saving power to their efforts. This is a profound lesson for us all,\u201d Gunnarson said.\nBuelvas was originally asked in 2019 by her parish priest, Fr. Gustavo Campo, to lead the parish\u2019s pro-life advocacy. She took time to consider as she was \u201cvery reluctant\u201d and unsure what she specifically could bring. Ultimately, she answered the call of her pastor in 2020 and \u201cexperienced God\u2019s providence.\u201d\nLeading up to this year\u2019s 40 Days for Life, Buelvas said she desired a sign from God directly telling her she is meant to assume the leadership mantle doubt-free.\n\u201cI said, \u2018God, I know you can do everything. Can you give me a sign so I can go ahead and do this campaign because you really want me to?\u2019 \u201d\nHer sons, Daniel, eight, and Andre, seven, told their mother they knew \u201cshe was struggling with something\u201d and should go to her room to pray.\nLater that day, her husband Elber arrived home with a package. It contained letters from the 40 Days for Life organization in the U. S. thanking her for her leadership. Buelvas felt her prayer was answered.\nNow, after a successful 40 days of sacrificial fasting for the pre-born, Buelvas said her faith has burst.\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid anymore to tell anybody to take a leap of faith. To jump in and let God fully take control. I was very reluctant, but now I have no doubt at all.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under:\n\nNews\n40 Days for Life\nprolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\nAna Rivera drives Hamilton\u2019s 40 Days for Life\n\n\nCare, not killing enshrined in March for Life\n\n\nItaly's prime minister takes case of baby on life support to highest levels of diplomacy\n\n\nMiracles happen, says 40 Days for Life activist\n\n\n\u2018Religious women\u2019 have more kids, study shows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this category:\n\n\t\t\t\u00ab Tastes of Heaven goes virtual again\t\t\n\n\t\t\tShareLife seeks to challenge all-time haul \u00bb\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease support The Catholic Register\nUnlike many media companies,\u00a0The Catholic Register\u00a0has never charged readers for access to the news and information on our website.
