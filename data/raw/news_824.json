(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPEKA \u2014 Kansas Republicans haven\u2019t discussed new abortion legislation yet, but they do plan to address the subject when the legislative session starts in January.\nDuring Monday\u2019s GOP caucus meeting to nominate new House of Representatives leadership, House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins said he hadn\u2019t had any discussions about a potential 15-week abortion ban that some anti-abortion activist groups have been advocating ahead of the legislative session.\u00a0\nThe newly nominated leadership has shifted further to the right, and Hawkins said he anticipates more conservative proposals than usual this session.\u00a0\nHawkins said that he knew groups like Kansans For Life were pushing for legislation similar to the \u201cBorn Alive\u201d bill, a which has been rejected in other states for being too restrictive. The legislation essentially requires medical providers to attempt to save any children born prematurely or born alive after an attempted abortion. Critics have called this bill unnecessary and potentially harmful for medical providers.\u00a0\n\u201cI have talked with, certainly with KFL. And the coalition that really worked on Value Them Both, they certainly would like to see the \u2018Born Alive\u2019 bill attempted, bring that out. To say that there\u2019s not going to be any other abortion bills is wrong. Everybody\u2019s free to bring whatever they want when it comes to bills. So we\u2019ll see those,\u201d Hawkins said.\nHawkins said legislation involving funding crisis pregnancy centers might also come up.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly something that we will probably look at. Certainly, you know, you want to prevent unwanted pregnancies versus abortion. So that\u2019s certainly someplace we can look at,\u201d Hawkins said.\u00a0\nRep. Vic Miller, D-Topeka, said he didn\u2019t know what anti-abortion legislation Republicans were planning to introduce in the upcoming legislative session, but said he was prepared to fight it.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the people spoke very clearly in August about what they wanted to do on that subject, and it was not a ban. It was an absolute vote rejecting a ban,\u201d Miller said.\u00a0\nRep. Valdenia Winn, D-Kansas City, said she expected to see anti-abortion legislation such as a 15-week abortion ban or restrictions on physician licenses. Winn plans on working with her community to fight restrictive abortion measures.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWe work through our constituents and those communities that voted down that amendment,\u201d Winn said.\u00a0\nDebate about abortion has been constant since the August amendment was shot down by Kansas voters, but discussions have ramped up as the legislative session approaches. Outside the House of Representatives during the Tuesday caucus meeting, anti-abortion advocates stood holding signs and made appearances with their children on the balcony inside the House.\u00a0\n  Anti-abortion advocate Kaitlin Keeling said she was there to ask legislators to push for a complete ban on abortion. (Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector)\nOne of the anti-abortion advocates, Kaitlin Keeling, said she was there to ask legislators to support a total ban on abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re letting people know that abortion is unconstitutional, that all people have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Right now the pre-born in Kansas are being slaughtered and they\u2019re not given equal protection under the law and the Constitution, which they rightfully have,\u201d Keeling said.\u00a0\nA Kansas judge has blocked a 2011 law preventing women from accessing abortion medication via telemedicine, in a move abortion providers called a step in the right direction. The state still has many other abortion restrictions in place.\u00a0\nKansas abortion laws have been criticized by abortion-rights advocates as unnecessarily restrictive. State law requires patients to undergo an ultrasound before the abortion procedure, with the provider instructed to offer to show the image to the patient.\u00a0\nAmong other restrictions, abortions are illegal 22 weeks after gestation, except when a mother\u2019s health is excessively compromised. Minors need parental consent to have an abortion, and private health insurance policies \u2014 along with public employee insurance and Medicaid \u2014 don\u2019t cover abortion services unless the patient\u2019s life is in danger.\nJudge Teresa Watson reinstated a temporary injunction to prohibit enforcement of the 2011 law on Nov. 23.\nBefore the ruling, using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication was prohibited by a law that required women seeking abortions to have an in-person visit with a doctor. The ruling was a result of a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of Trust Women, an organization dedicated to providing abortion care to underserved communities.\u00a0\nThe decision allows Kansas clinics to provide telemedicine abortion services, though the legal battle will likely continue.\u00a0\n\u00a0With Kansas\u2019 overall workforce shortage and a lack of medical workers across the state, abortion-rights organizations said the law was an obstacle for women living in rural areas, where medical care has been especially strained. Zack Gingrich-Gaylord, communications director for Trust Women, said providing telemedicine visits would help address the shortage of in-person medical care.\u00a0\n\u201cWe very much view the telehealth ruling as the right thing to do. And it brings Kansas back in line with national best practices, with scientific standards, medical standards, and so we feel that that\u2019s a step in the right direction. And we will definitely be moving forward thoughtfully and deliberately with any kind of programming around telehealth that we do,\u201d Gingrich-Gaylord said.\u00a0\nThe anti-abortion group Kansans For Life condemned the telemedicine visits, saying that doctors would not be able to determine how old the fetus was. Jeanne Gawdun, the organization\u2019s director of government relations, said she was concerned women would be able to skirt the legal abortion limits with the visits.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course the abortionist has to be able to date the pregnancy to make sure that the woman is not further along than the 10 weeks recommendation that these chemical abortion pills are supposed to be used. So how do they do that when they\u2019re not actually in the same room with the woman and being able to verify how far along she is?\u201d Gawdun said.\u00a0\nGingrich-Gaylord said telemedicine prescription of abortion pills was safe, effective and long supported by medical professionals and research. Gingrich-Gaylord said anti-abortion activists didn\u2019t have the same knowledge as people working in the field.\u00a0\n\u201cI would just say don\u2019t believe them. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d Gingrich-Gaylord said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAhead of the Kansas legislative session, abortion rights once again under discussion\nby Rachel Mipro, Kansas Reflector December 5, 2022\nAhead of the Kansas legislative session, abortion rights once again under discussion\nby Rachel Mipro, Kansas Reflector December 5, 2022\n TOPEKA \u2014 Kansas Republicans haven\u2019t discussed new abortion legislation yet, but they do plan to address the subject when the legislative session starts in January.\nDuring Monday\u2019s GOP caucus meeting to nominate new House of Representatives leadership, House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins said he hadn\u2019t had any discussions about a potential 15-week abortion ban that some anti-abortion activist groups have been advocating ahead of the legislative session.\u00a0\nThe newly nominated leadership has shifted further to the right, and Hawkins said he anticipates more conservative proposals than usual this session.\u00a0\nHawkins said that he knew groups like Kansans For Life were pushing for legislation similar to the \u201cBorn Alive\u201d bill, a which has been rejected in other states for being too restrictive.
