From the moment life begins at conception is when we have a responsibility as human beings to do everything we can to protect that baby\u2019s life and the life of the mother. That is what I believe and that is what the majority of Oklahomans believe. If other states want to pass different laws, that is their right, but in Oklahoma we will always stand up for life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Modified on\n      May 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Back to Top\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  Back to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Governor J.
