In July, Mexico ratified ILO 189, which sets minimum labor standards for domestic workers. Of the country\u2019s 2.4 million domestic workers, fewer than 1% have social security, according to NosotrxsMX, an NGO. Few have access to formal credit\u200a\u2014\u200aand amid COVID-19 are especially vulnerable.\n\u201cThey have two choices: give up their jobs, or run the risk of being infected,\u201d Aparicio said in a message for the UN, where she\u2019s a goodwill ambassador. \u201c(We need to) ensure domestic workers\u2019 right to stay healthy without falling further into poverty.\u201d\nAparicio\u2019s latest project is a YouTube channel that mixes personal stories with serious discussion of issues facing Mexico. In one video, Aparicio talks about indigenous women she admires, including Y\u00e1snaya Elena Aguilar, a Mixe linguist, and Nancy Garc\u00eda, Aparicio\u2019s co-star in Roma who now runs a program promoting gender equality in sports.\n\u201cI\u2019m not alone,\u201d Aparicio said in the video. \u201cThere are so many others\u200a\u2014\u200awe just need to make sure we get to know them.\u201d\nABOUT THE AUTHORBenjamin Russell is a writer based in Los Angeles and Mexico City, and a former editor of AQ.\n\n\nTags:  Gender,  Indigenous Rights,  Social inclusion\nLike what you've read?
