These rights currently are protected by the Constitution\u2019s right to privacy, including the right to be sexual with and maybe even marry a person of your choosing; to use contraception, have an abortion, or use in vitro fertilization technologies; to make medical decisions, including end-of-life care; and more.\nBarrett refused to answer even the simplest of questions and demurred on her opinion of\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u2014not even divulging her beliefs about contraceptive access or in vitro fertilization. Nonetheless, her deep opposition to abortion is well documented and her opposition to birth control and LGBTQ rights not hard to discern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\n\n        Thanks for signing up!

Wade\u00a0while purporting to preserve abortion rights. The more relaxed standard that first female Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and her two colleagues launched in\u00a0Casey\u00a0allows abortion restrictions so long as they do not rise to the level of being an \u201cundue burden.\u201d\u00a0For almost 20 years since, abortion restrictions have gushed forth as conservative justices have interpreted it to allow a range of abortion restrictions, all of which fall unevenly and inequitably on women of color and many of which put abortion out of reach for many women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nLive in a rural state? You may have to travel to a clinic hundreds of miles away, listen to your doctor recite state-mandated anti-abortion drivel, and then return again a few days later for your procedure. Is your health insurance provided by Medicaid?\u00a0Chances are there\u2019s no coverage unless you choose to give birth.\u00a0Are you under 18 and pregnant? You can have a cesarean section and give a baby up for adoption without your parents knowing, but you\u2019ll likely need your parent\u2019s consent for an abortion. Are you all of the above?\u00a0Best of luck to you.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, make no mistake, Barrett as the sixth vote on an already conservatively skewed Supreme Court welcomes these blockages\u2014and more.\u00a0During her debut White House superspreader event earlier this month, she announced fealty to her mentor Justice Antonin Scalia\u2014\u201chis judicial philosophy is mine\u201d\u2014but then proclaimed her independence during Senate hearings.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Scalia, Barrett is a textualist, meaning she will interpret statutes solely on the language within them, rather than the context in which they were passed.\u00a0On matters of constitutional law, she is an originalist, and thus will look only to what the Framers meant as they drafted our Constitution way back in 1787 or at the time of adopting its amendments.\u00a0Doubtful\u00a0that the Founding Fathers thought much about the birth control pill, the morning-after pill, or medication abortion, none of which had been invented yet.\nScalia also was explicit in his view that the liberty clause found in the 14th Amendment only affords procedural protections, like the right to a hearing, and not substantive rights, like the right to privacy.\u00a0These substantive rights, however, are the foundation of constitutional protections for many of the rights that Americans have relied upon over the last several decades.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Recently in\n        \n          Jurisprudence\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Mexico Is Flooded With American Guns. So the Country\u2019s Suing Companies Like Glock and Smith & Wesson.\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Can the Government Collaborate With Big Tech to Protect Elections?\n          \n\n\n\nCombine this rejection of substantive rights with Barrett\u2019s belief that the court\u2019s precedent is malleable, add a dash of her dismissiveness toward\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0as \u201csuperprecedents,\u201d and it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u00a0With Barrett on board, five ultraconservative justices could easily opt to revisit and flamb\u00e9 not just\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey, but seminal precedent such as\u00a0Griswold v. Connecticut,\u00a0which legalized contraception;\u00a0Lawrence v. Texas,\u00a0which decriminalized homosexuality; and\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges,\u00a0which legalized same-sex marriage. All could be toast.\u00a0\u00a0During her hearing, Barrett artfully dodged answering whether the right to use contraception is a superprecedent, claiming that the issue will not likely come before the court.\u00a0Yet she must know that several state legislatures, in their zeal to ban abortions, already have introduced legislation that could ban the birth control pill and the IUD, methods that abortion opponents intentionally misconstrue as being abortifacients.\nIt has been obvious for some time now\u00a0that those who care about reproductive freedom can no longer depend on the federal courts to preserve our vital liberties. \u00a0Rather,\u00a0voters will need to fill Congress, state legislatures, and state courts with people who will prioritize gender and racial equity for all.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Constitution\n            \n\n\n              Contraception\n            \n\n\n              Reproductive Rights\n            \n\n\n              Supreme Court\n            \n\n\n              Antonin Scalia\n            \n\n\n              Marriage Equality\n            \n\n\n              Amy Coney Barrett\n            \n\n\n              LGBTQ+\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
