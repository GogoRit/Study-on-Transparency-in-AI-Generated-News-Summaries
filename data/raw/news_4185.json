For the first time, it allows them to describe trends in demand/use of modern contraceptives alongside social and economic indicators. \nThe data is published in The Lancet Global Health and is authored by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the World Health Organization.\nIt shows that, over time, women are more likely to have their demand for modern contraception met in countries where gender equality and their educational opportunities improve.\nGender equality and education increases access to modern contraception\n\nTrends in sexual activity and demand for use and use of modern contraceptive methods in 74 countries: a retrospective analysis of nationally representative surveys\u00a0finds that met need for modern contraception is strongly correlated with positive shifts in social structures.\nFor every 0.1-point increase in a country\u2019s gender development index, it found a 6.7% rise in women who were sexually active and did not want to conceive. Of those women, an additional 13.5% used modern methods to prevent a pregnancy.\n\nExpectations of every girl\u2019s right to education also made a difference. Each extra year in schooling is linked to an increase of 2.3% in demand, and a 4.7% increase in use of modern contraceptive methods.\n\u201cThis study shows how every woman must negotiate her reproductive autonomy within the social framework in which she lives, responding to barriers and opportunities as they emerge,\u201d says Dr Lale Say, one of the authors of the study and Unit Head at WHO and HRP.\n\u201cGender equality is both a precondition and a driving force for securing women\u2019s reproductive health and rights \u2013 as well as the sustainable development targets, which are our best chance for delivering health and well-being for all.\u201d\nGlobal trends reveal new challenges in family planning\nOverall, the data reinforce global trends: more time spent sexually-active and single, postponement of parenthood, and the near-universal desire for smaller families.\nThe study also highlights where action is needed at country-level to avoid family planning services falling behind demand.\nOut of the 74 countries analyzed, 42 showed an increase in demand for contraception. Only 37 countries show an increase in use of a modern method to prevent pregnancy.\nAlthough unmet need for contraception declined in 34 countries, it increased in 14 countries. Significantly more progress is needed, and faster, to ensure each girl and woman is able to access the sexual and reproductive health services she needs.\nBarriers and solutions to reproductive health and rights\nGender equality can affect contraceptive use in many ways. From the personal and political degree to which women are free to choose their sexual activity, to accessing family planning services it can also shape any power imbalances within personal relationships.\u00a0This study supports recent efforts by WHO to adopt a broader, integrated concept of sexual and reproductive health \u2013 and to translate it into a framework for policy and practice.\nThe authors argue that family planning targets in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will not be met without a profound shift: from focus on \u2018access to contraception\u2019, to broader aspects of sexual health and social context. \nSince reproductive health and women\u2019s empowerment are intertwined, trends in contraceptive use can also reveal progress towards another global target: progress towards gender equality. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN special programme for research on sexual and reproductive health celebrates 50 years\n25 April 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiding with science and SRHR: Civil Society Organizations (CSO) Dialogue on SRHR with Dr Tedros\n24 April 2023\n\n\n\n\nFact sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent pregnancy\n2 June 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency contraception\n9 November 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights\n1 December 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion\n25 November 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n10 July 2023\n\n\n\n\nFeature stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow self-care interventions are having an impact in Timor-Leste\n4 July 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nigeria, self-administered contraception is helping women to access their sexual and reproductive health rights\n7 December 2022\n\n\n\n\nDocuments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSRHR in Nepal Leaflet-Dec-13-2022 Updated\n(7327 KB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\nEastern Mediterranean\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\nWestern Pacific\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\nCyber security\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nPermissions and licensing\n\n\nPreventing sexual exploitation\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nReport misconduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\nPrivacy policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\u00a9\n\n2024\n\nWHO\n\n                       \n"
