She saw blood running down her legs. She was five months pregnant. \n\nSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador\u2014Alba Lorena Santos had just returned home from running errands when her headache began. She saw blood running down her legs. She was five months pregnant.\nSantos told her daughter to call their neighbor, a relative by marriage, for help. She fainted shortly after. When she woke up, she remembers the neighbor telling her the baby\u2014a boy\u2014had died.\n \n\n\n\n\nThe next day the neighbor returned and said the police were there to ask some questions. Still sick and feverish, Santos said she was put into a police car and asked: \u201cWhy did you kill him? Not even dogs do that.\u201d\nIt was only later in court that Santos said she was able to piece together what took place over those two December days in 2009.\n\u201cThe neighbor reported me,\u201d Santos said. \u201cShe accused me of killing him.\u201d\nAbigail Cortez, a lawyer with the Citizens Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion in El Salvador, said Santos actually had an obstetric emergency, not an abortion, and should have received medical help. Instead, Santos was convicted for aggravated homicide and sentenced to 30 years. The neighbor\u2019s testimony was a key part of the prosecution\u2019s narrative that the baby had been killed, rather than dying as the result of a medical emergency.\nTwenty-five years ago this April, El Salvador passed a total ban on abortions\u2014no exceptions for rape, incest, or the health or life of the mother\u2014transforming society in this Central American nation. Now, the ban might finally be overturned.\nThe Inter-American Court of Human Rights has begun hearing Beatriz v. El Salvador, investigating the case of a woman who was seriously ill from lupus, arthritis, and renal failure but denied an abortion even though the fetus would not survive outside the uterus. The woman died not long after. With this case, the court will rule for the first time on whether the absolute prohibition of abortion violates a woman\u2019s right to life and health.\n \n\n\nA couple sits outside the National Maternity Hospital where a woman known as \"Beatriz\" is hospitalized during her pregnancy with an anencephalic baby.

Beatriz died after she was denied an abortion. The baby also did not survive. Jose CABEZAS/AFP via Getty Images\nThe court\u2019s verdict could have a far-reaching impact across the Latin American nations that have accepted the jurisdiction of the court by ratifying the American Convention on Human Rights, and set an important precedent for a region that\u2019s one of the most restrictive in the world for abortion. In particular, it could spell the end of total abortion bans in five countries that recognize the court\u2019s jurisdiction: Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, and El Salvador.\nWith over 50 women incarcerated since the ban was passed, El Salvador is one of the most widely documented examples of a country imprisoning women for abortion. The Fuller Project and Foreign Policy have reviewed court documents or pardon requests related to 25 cases from 1999 to 2018 of pregnant women accused of aggravated homicide, attempted aggravated homicide, and abortion. They reveal how the country\u2019s abortion ban made neighbors, doctors, police, and judges\u2014the very people meant to help these women\u2014turn against them instead.\n\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t seek the truth. It seeks to blame these women,\u201d Cortez said.\nBut translating a favorable ruling into political change could still prove difficult. The court\u2019s ruling is technically legally binding, but a lack of enforcement mechanism means countries don\u2019t always follow through on implementing their directives. The ban continues to be popular, particularly as anti-abortion evangelical churches with strong connections to the United States have gained influence here, and advocates in El Salvador warn the United States could be heading down its path.\n\u201cEl Salvador shows us the cruelty of the total criminalization of abortion,\u201d said Cristina Rosero, senior legal advisor for Latin America and the Caribbean for the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cThose who face greater barriers to reach the health system are precisely the most persecuted for the crime.\u201d\nSantos lived five hours away from the nearest hospital when she lost her child.\n\u201cMy pregnancy was the result of rape,\u201d Santos said. \u201cDespite this, I\u2019ve always said, if I wanted to abort, I would have done it in the first weeks.\u201d\nIt would be years before she would see her two daughters again.\n\u201cMy family abandoned me,\u201d Santos said. \u201cMy brothers told me that I was a perra [dog]. One told me that I was a murderer.\u201d\nEventually, Santos came to know other women in prison who were in the same situation as her. She and 16 others formed a group known as \u201cLas 17,\u201d and their lawyers were successful in mobilizing an international campaign for their release. In 2019, after a decade in prison, Santos was finally released, her sentence commuted after the Salvadoran Supreme Court found her rights were violated during her trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRape victim Evelyn Hernandez celebrates with her lawyers after being cleared of murder after giving birth to a stillborn baby at home.

Vasquez was found guilty of \u201caggravated homicide\u201d for a stillbirth in her ninth month of pregnancy. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey put us between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Juan Jos\u00e9 Guzm\u00e1n, president of the Salvadoran Association of Gynecologists and Obstetricians. \u201cThe doctor almost turns into a judge.\u201d\n\nGuzm\u00e1n has seen it all: hammocks slung on a pole to form a makeshift stretcher for women in labor in rural areas, a woman giving birth in the bed of a pickup truck, others arriving with babies in their arms because the hospital was so far away that they already gave birth.\nHe recalled that, around the mid-2000s, doctors in the public hospitals in El Salvador were told they had to report any suspected abortions to authorities. If they failed to do so, they could risk prosecution themselves.\nInstead of worrying about patients\u2019 care, doctors became worried about the legal repercussions of their actions, he said. Obstetric emergencies posed multiple quandaries: Should I notify the public prosecutor\u2019s office? Should I call the police? Should I examine the patient, or would that contaminate the crime scene? Should I wait for forensic medicine, even though it could take hours? In emergencies, there\u2019s no time to delay. Every second counts.\n\u201cThese situations are so difficult,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said.\nIn 2019, Cortez and her colleagues successfully sued the Salvadoran state at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on behalf of Manuela, a woman who they said had arrived at the hospital with postpartum preeclampsia, was refused an abortion, and died soon after from lymphatic cancer while in prison.\nThe court found that the state had violated Manuela\u2019s rights to life and health and ruled that health care staff should no longer report patients to authorities for suspected abortions. This November, the Salvadoran government finally complied with the ruling and issued a new pre- and postnatal protocol saying doctors should not report patients to authorities and would not be punished for failing to report.\nForensic pathologists, whose autopsies on fetuses play a central role in the cases against these women, also became controversial figures in the medical community.\nJose Miguel Fort\u00edn Maga\u00f1a, the director of El Salvador\u2019s Forensic Medicine Institute from 2010 to 2015, became a highly polarizing figure in the country when he \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0said in 2014 that \u201cLas 17\u201d were in prison for infanticide, not abortion, as documented by his institution\u2019s autopsies. In other words, he was claiming their babies were killed after being born alive.\nFort\u00edn Maga\u00f1a said that he recognized deep-seated machismo existed in Salvadoran society, but said he did not believe it could influence autopsies.\n\u201cAutopsies don\u2019t have a political affiliation,\u201d he said recently in his office in San Salvador. \u201cThey simply spoke of what had been the cause of death of these children.\u201d\n\u201cDoctors give hard facts. You can like it or not, but it\u2019s just a hard fact.\u201d\nBut lawyers for the women have cast doubt on a key scientific test used in these autopsies. The floating lung test, called the docimasia, had been used to prove in court that babies had air in their lungs and were therefore alive outside their mother\u2019s womb at some point before they died.\nIn the test\u2019s simplest form, the lungs are placed in water: If they float, they are believed to have been filled with air, meaning the baby had taken in breaths of outside air. In El Salvador, this test is often used to elevate the women\u2019s crime to homicide rather than abortion.\nGregory J. Davis, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Kentucky, called the test \u201cinvalid in unattended births\u201d and said that the test has been considered unreliable for more than 100 years in an analysis provided to defense lawyers in 2014.\nSome form of this test was used on at least 10 of the cases reviewed by the Fuller Project and Foreign Policy. Fort\u00edn Maga\u00f1a defended its use. It has evolved, he said, adding more scientific forms of the examination, such as analysis of lung tissue.\n\u201cFrom a medical perspective, there was evidence of the birth of these children,\u201d Fort\u00edn Maga\u00f1a said.\nThe role played by doctors in these situations is fraught in other ways as well. Hospitals have direct contact with public prosecutors\u2019 offices to report potential cases of gender violence. However, this often leads to investigations into possible abortions, according to Guzm\u00e1n and two police sources.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele gestures during his speech at the closing ceremony of the Latin American Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference at Mizata Beach, El Salvador, on Nov. 20, 2021.\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele gestures during his speech at the closing ceremony of the Latin American Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference at Mizata Beach, El Salvador, on Nov. 20, 2021.\n\n\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Scramble for a Bailout\n\n\nWith top officials beset by U.S. sanctions, the country\u2019s IMF negotiations are bound to get complicated.\n\n\n\n        Latin America Brief    \n|\n\n\n    Catherine Osborn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo collage illustration shows candidates for global elections in 2024 including: India's Narendra Modi; Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum; Russia's Vladimir Putin; Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro; South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa; Bangladesh's Sheikh Hasina; the United Kingdom's Rishi Sunak; Taiwan's Lai Ching-te; El Salvador's Nayib Bukele; and Tunisia's Kais Said.\n\nA photo collage illustration shows candidates for global elections in 2024 including: India's Narendra Modi; Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum; Russia's Vladimir Putin; Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro; South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa; Bangladesh's Sheikh Hasina; the United Kingdom's Rishi Sunak; Taiwan's Lai Ching-te; El Salvador's Nayib Bukele; and Tunisia's Kais Said.\n\n\n\nElections to Follow in 2024\n\n\nDozens of countries will vote this year.

This means any abortion case should be investigated as a potential homicide. Miguel arrives on the scene keeping this in mind.\n\u201cYour [the woman\u2019s] objective was to abort and that everything went well and you didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital,\u201d he said, explaining how he approaches these cases. \u201cBut since the abortion was incomplete, you have a part [of the baby] in your body that can cause your death. So you arrive at the hospital and you [start to] prepare your story.\u201d\n\u201cAs an investigator, I have to go while you are developing your story and you see that it has holes, so if I take too long, you fill the holes.\u201d\nOmar Flores, a lawyer who has worked on these cases, said the ban has created an \u201cattitude of trying to obtain convictions.\u201d For a case to qualify as a homicide, there must be a motive. In suspected abortion cases, Miguel said this could be a failed relationship, rape, or even the mother\u2019s young age or her lack of resources to take care of the baby.\nCortez and her colleagues at the Citizens Group said the police consistently breach protocols in place that are meant to ensure they act with sensitivity toward the women. The Fuller Project and Foreign Policy documented seven abortion-related cases that show the police failing to follow these rules, including one case where an 18-year-old was arrested in the emergency room while being treated for tearing during childbirth. The officer told the court the arrest was justified: \u201cShe was conscious,\u201d the officer explained.\n \n\n\nA monument to the goddess Minerva, located at the University of El Salvador, is photographed wearing a green handkerchief in support of abortion rights .\nA monument to the goddess Minerva, located at the University of El Salvador, is photographed wearing a green handkerchief in support of abortion rights in San Salvador on March 22. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images \nMiguel has attended workshops on gender violence and said it has changed how he approaches investigations, especially when dealing with victims who have experienced traumatic events.\nDespite these workshops, several lawyers told the Fuller Project and Foreign Policy that machismo still prevails and can be seen in phrases and expressions used in court.\nFor instance, in one trial the judge defined perinatal asphyxia as \u201cthe aggression produced against the newborn baby near the moment of birth because of lack of oxygen,\u201d a definition that assumes culpability and does not have a scientific basis.\nMeanwhile, El Salvador has a strikingly low conviction rate for rape and sexual violence.\n\u201cI was the victim, and I was considered guilty,\u201d Santos said. \u201cMy rapist, who was responsible for everything that was happening to me? He was all fine, outside with his kids and his family.\u201d\nThe overall landscape remains precarious. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele once supported loosening abortion restrictions as the mayor of San Salvador for the left-wing FMLN party but has since backtracked after aligning with right-wing politicians to secure the presidency. Women\u2019s rights advocates say the government already dragged its feet in implementing the Inter-American Court\u2019s Manuela ruling on doctors no longer referring women to police for suspected abortions.\nMeanwhile, women are still being tried for abortion in El Salvador\u2014eight have ongoing trials. Santos looks forward to the day when women will no longer face this kind of prosecutorial environment.\n\u201cI hope more women don\u2019t experience the same situation. When you go through these moments, you feel cornered on all sides,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna-Catherine Brigida is a freelance journalist based in San Salvador covering immigration, human rights and security in Central America.
