The handwritten flyer threatened to \u201cshoot up\u201d the Pro-Life Generation if Students for Life of America\u2019s (SFLA) Campaign for Abortion Free Cities initiative succeeded in shutting down late-term abortion facilities in the state. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\u00a0\u00a0\nOn Saturday, December 3, 2022, SFLAction scheduled a Political Workshop in Omaha, Nebraska to gather pro-life activists from across the state to strategize about how to use the Campaign for Abortion Free Cities to shut down the late-term abortion facility in the state. The facility is operated by the infamous Dr. Leroy Carhart, who has made a career out of killing preborn children and traumatically harming their mothers in the process. He currently has a lawsuit filed against him after a woman who woke up from her anesthesia, crying out as her uterus was perforated, only to find parts of her baby were still left inside of her.\u00a0\n\nGun threat taped to the building\nSFLAction has been persistent in working against his horrific facilities, but apparently local abortion radicals are so accepting of such violence that they have now promised their own \u2014 using guns this time, instead of scalpels and suctions. The SFLAction team showed up to the St. John Paul II Newman Center, the site for their training this morning, and found the following note taped to one of the doors:\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cDear [name removed],\u00a0\nIf our rights to abortion in Bellevue is taken away due to the attempts to pass an abortion ban and it gets passed, we will shoot up your Newman Center with our new AR-14 rifles. Sincerely, Jane\u2019s Revenge.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf all the other incidents of pro-abortion threats and violence haven\u2019t convinced you of this yet, let this threat of a shooting sink in: when we as a society accept violence in the womb, it won\u2019t stop there. If pro-abortion radicals are A-Okay with killing preborn babies, what\u2019s the difference between killing someone who\u2019s born already? Nothing; the morality behind both is the same because it comes from the idea that human life isn\u2019t valuable and doesn\u2019t need to be respected. That\u2019s why these abortion supporters are saying they\u2019ll kill us if we don\u2019t let them kill others in the womb.\u00a0\u00a0\nSFLAction has called the police in order to properly investigate the matter, as we take the security of the Pro-Life Generation seriously.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tweet thread, SFLAction President Kristan Hawkins commented on the situation, calling for continual prayer for the Pro-Life Generation and real action from our nation\u2019s law enforcement agencies. She stated:\u00a0\n\nPolice on the scene where the gun threat was found\n\u201cWe are headed towards tragedy if AG Merrick Garland continues to refuse to act to protect peaceful pro-lifers from pro-abortion terrorist groups. Sadly, the incendiary comments of leaders like Hillary Clinton yesterday comparing pro-lifers to the Taliban is case in point the poisoned political climate being deliberately fostered by corporate abortion and their allies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe Biden Administration is laying the groundwork for deadly violence against pro-lifers while they support violence against those in the womb. They must act.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nMedia reports show that the FBI is being unresponsive about this attack. \nClick HERE to read SFLAction\u2019s press release on the incident, and stay tuned to the blog for further updates.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Another Downside of Chemical Abortion Pills: The Potential for Hidden, Disastrous Abuse\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 3,346\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
