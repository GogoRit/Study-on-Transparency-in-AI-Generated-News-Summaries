But what kind of morality does this entail and what does it mean for women?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n19 February 2020, 6:00am\nby Raisa Galea \n\n\n 9 min read\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the ban does not prevent hundreds of abortions per annum from taking place elsewhere, the major goal of lobbying in favour of the current legislation is to keep abortion away from Malta in particular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TWEET\n\n\n SHARE\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApart from Vatican City, Malta is the only country in Europe which criminalises abortion under any circumstances. The provisions within the Criminal Code of Malta have practically remained untouched since their enactment in 1854.\nYet, it is a fact that local women travel abroad to access abortion. As the law recognises induced miscarriage as a criminal offence punishable by up to three and four years of imprisonment \u2013 for a pregnant woman and a medical practitioner respectively \u2013\u00a0 there are no official statistics on the number of women seeking the procedure abroad.\nThe pro-choice coalition Voice For Choice-L-g\u0127a\u017cla Tag\u0127ha estimates it at around 300 a year. Although this number is significantly below the European average (183 abortions per 1000 live births, as reported by WHO Europe), even a possibly underestimated figure indicates that women in Malta are no exception and undergo the procedure despite the blanket ban.\nCelebrated by pro-life groups and challenged by the pro-choice lobby, the special status of Malta in relation to abortion is acknowledged by both sides of the divide. And just as was the case with the divorce and spring hunting referenda, the abortion debate transcends the limits of a practical, if controversial, matter, and enters the domain of identity politics and ideology.\nSince the ban does not prevent hundreds of abortions per annum from taking place elsewhere, the major goal of lobbying in favour of the current legislation is to keep abortion away from Malta in particular. In a nutshell, a key argument against the decriminalisation of abortion is to preserve Maltese national identity as rooted in conservative politics, Catholic morality and family values.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro choice activists in Valletta announce their position on abortion in 2019,\n\n\n\nFamily values and superior national morality\nAnyone following the debate is familiar with the dualistic narrative.\nWhile the pro-choice perspective argues in favour of recognising a woman\u2019s right to bodily autonomy and to ending an unwanted pregnancy, the pro-life camp insists that life begins at conception and equates terminating a pregnancy with murder. The pro-choice campaign is treated with much hostility by various segments of the Maltese population. Activists are verbally assaulted; their arguments dismissed.\nDelving into the reasons for such vehement opposition to abortion in Malta, anthropologist Rachael Scicluna suggests that in societies where family ties are strong and conservative views on gender roles prevail, the concept of embryo is intrinsically linked to the concept of family. Thus, at a subconscious level, abortion gets perceived as a threat to the very foundations of Maltese kin society and, consequently, objecting to its introduction is a way of defending family values and the status quo.\nWhile this hypothesis offers an insight into the pro-lifers\u2019 social insecurities, there seems to be another narrative fueling hostility to abortion: a fear of outsiders\u2019 intentions to dismantle core Maltese values.\nIn response to my request for a comment on the cases of Maltese women accessing abortion abroad, Malta Unborn Child Platform refuted the estimate: \u201cWe know, for example that around 55 women of Maltese nationality undergo abortion in the UK, but we do not know how many of those women travel from Malta or actually reside in the UK. There may be also foreign women, residing in Malta, who go for an abortion in the UK.\u201d\nBluntly put, the organisation implies that having an abortion is incompatible with being a Maltese woman living in Malta.\nA conspiracy of a sinister foreign plan to force abortions upon the Maltese is making the rounds in some people\u2019s heads and on social media.\nThis is evident in personal attacks hurled at the prominent feminists Andrea Dibben and Lara Dimitrijevic, both of whom are Maltese albeit with foreign-sounding surnames. \u201cGo do Satan\u2019s work in your own country!!!\u201d and \u201cgo back home and kill your babies\u201d are common responses to their pledges. This conspiracy is also propagated by Gift of Life Malta: according to the organisation, having \u201cpolitical allies within and outside of Malta\u201d is part of the pro-choice camp\u2019s strategy.\nAsserting that a woman must not be forced to gestate against her will stirs mass outrage. Female pro-choice activists are advised to watch over their own sexuality and assume responsibility for the pregnancy, even if it resulted from rape. One of the comments to the LovinMalta article that reported such verbal abuse read: \u201cHow many rapes [do] we have in Malta? Very rare / Even so a woman that got raped is always free to go abroad to kill the unwanted baby in case she got pregnant from rape.\u201d Although this argument is based on a poorly informed perception of the infrequency of rape in Malta \u2013 sexual assault often goes unreported due to a victim-blaming stigma \u2013 it nevertheless demonstrates that it is possible to oppose decriminalisation of abortion in Malta and condone \u2018murder\u2019, as long as it happens elsewhere.\nAnother proof of the abortion ban being perceived as part of a national identity in need of protecting comes from the Church. By stating that \u201cour work in favour of life at all stages underlines our identity as Maltese\u201d, Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Galea Curmi implied that the country\u2019s devotion to Catholic faith is rivalled by the Vatican alone \u2013 the only other state in Europe which criminalises abortion.\nPresident George Vella, too, spoke in favour of the current legislation at a recent event organised by the Malta Unborn Child Platform. His presence at the manifestation clearly signalled state support for the anti-choice cause \u2013 a national mission that is \u201con the right side of history.\u201d\nFurthermore, the President expressed doubt about the moral authority of the European Court of Justice where \u201cyou\u2019re frowned upon if you do not accept abortion.\u201d Considering that Malta\u2019s political crisis and high-profile corruption remain a subject of international scrutiny, Vella\u2019s statement is indeed politically loaded. Outsiders \u2013 immoral \u2018baby-killers\u2019 \u2013 are in no position to criticise the only remaining bastion of Christian values in Europe. In other words, upholding Malta\u2019s abortion ban is a way of asserting national moral superiority.\nAnd it could be the authorities\u2019 effective means of diminishing international criticism, undermining verdicts of the European Court of Human Rights, and by extension \u2013 possibly brushing off the demands of constitutional reforms altogether.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pro life rally in Valletta\n\n\n\nBetween \u2018progress\u2019 and \u2018tradition\u2019\nAs Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, director of Men against Violence, pointedly observed, the official demands to reform laws against abortion by the Council of Europe\u2019s Human Rights Commissioner receive little support from the rule of law advocates in Malta. Civil society groups, striving to bring Maltese legislation in line with the rest of \u2018normal\u2019 European countries, usually so attentive to international assessment, turn a deaf ear to the calls for abolishing the abortion ban. What could be the reason for such a selective commitment to human rights as defined by international legal bodies?\nContemporary politics in Malta has been a trade-off between \u2018progress\u2019 and \u2018tradition\u2019. For the past few decades, the young independent republic sought to establish itself as a modern European state while, at the same time, remaining under the tight grip of the Catholic Church. An ambiguous compromise between embracing progress and preserving traditions has been reached on the basis of two criteria: profit-making and national pride.\n\u2018Progress\u2019 came in a financially lucrative form: free market economics, construction boom, luxury mega-developments, and \u2018blockchain island\u2019 fantasies. Corinthia chairman and founder Alfred Pisani pompously encouraged his compatriots to \u201calways accept progress\u201d \u2013 unless, it seems, this progress is unprofitable and undermines the authority of the Church, the guardian of conservative traditions.\nA progressive stance on reproductive rights, thus, barely enjoys a fraction of the state\u2019s enthusiasm for \u2018progressive\u2019 elite property developments.\nWhat about Malta\u2019s LGBTIQ legislation? Some may argue that by becoming the first country in Europe to ban gay conversion therapy in 2016 \u2013 and by legalising same-sex marriage a year later \u2013 the Maltese state has declared its commitment to progressive social policy. Seen from a different perspective, however, this was rather a win for national pride. The reform gave even conservative locals a reason to savor the international recognition and be proud of Malta leaping ahead of the curve in something, compared to the rest of Europe.\nIn the case of abortion, it is precisely the blanket ban that makes Malta \u2018special\u2019 in the eyes of its citizens \u2013 distinct from other formally secular European states. Defending the country\u2019s role as a citadel of superior morality, besieged by \u2018baby-killers\u2019, could be a seductively heroic narrative. Also, the abortion ban as an untouchable \u2018tradition\u2019 may function as an apparent compensation for the loss of natural and architectural heritage, sacrificed on the altar of economic \u2018progress\u2019.\nInstitutionalised stigmatisation of women \n\u201cDoes our President consider his citizens who have had an abortion, murderers?\u201d Voice For Choice-L-g\u0127a\u017cla Tag\u0127ha asked in response to George Vella\u2019s pro-life endorsement. This is certainly one of the most pertinent questions of the debate. Another question: if abortion is murder, why does the punishment for induced miscarriage range from eighteen months to three and four years of imprisonment? Isn\u2019t this too mild a punishment for murderers?\nAs noted by former Labour deputy mayor Desir\u00e9e Attard in her doctoral thesis, the Criminal Code itself implies that \u201ca woman\u2019s life is more valuable than that of the foetus.\u201d As per Article 242, the punishment for performing an abortion that results in the death of the woman is that of life imprisonment. This disparity in punishment \u2013 four years versus a life sentence \u2013 \u201cmeans that the law recognises that a foetus is not a person\u201d, unlike a woman.\nThus, if the legislators did not equate abortion with wilful homicide in 1854, what makes this an acceptable argument in 2020? Such contradictions further reveal the deeply ideological basis of the pro-life argument, whose goal is to preserve the conservative status quo by denying women an established human right and exerting control over their bodies.\nApart from being legally incorrect, equating abortion with murder means regarding women who have undergone the procedure as murderers. This is no less than a means of institutional oppression and ostracisation of women. Both the endorsement of the anti-choice perspective by the President and the common perception that links it to Maltese identity and national morality celebrate Malta as a conservative patriarchal state.\nSociety and the state force Maltese women into shame for accessing a healthcare service available to women in the absolute majority of countries worldwide. Such marginalisation, reinforced stigma and cultivation of guilt are detrimental to women\u2019s psychological and social well-being; they cause loss of self-esteem and induce fear of abandonment. With a blessing of both the state and society, the \u2018pro-life\u2019 camp turns fellow women citizens into outcasts who must suffer in silence.\nIs stigmatising compatriots a sound basis for moral righteousness? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaisa Galea is editor of Isles of the Left and a researcher at the University of Malta.
