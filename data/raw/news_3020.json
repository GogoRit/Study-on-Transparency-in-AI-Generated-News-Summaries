Our group hosted a successful event on campus with Students for Life of America (SFLA) President Kristan Hawkins, recruited new members, and had so many opportunities to watch hearts and minds change on abortion.\u202fI\u2019m happy to say that we\u2019ve made breakthroughs in creating a campus culture of life; here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been up to this semester:\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen I started Tigers for Life during my freshman year, I had no idea it would grow into a student organization of 70 plus students who are passionate about making a difference on our campus. Even when facing pro-abortion suppression and hate, Tigers for Life has never backed down from working to accomplish our goal of loving all life \u2014 born and preborn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThrough tabling on campus, my group has had the opportunity to be a voice of hope and healing to students who have had abortions. We have connected post-abortive women with local resources to help them find healing from the trauma of abortion. No woman should live in silent pain and have their hurt dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast month, Tigers for Life was also thrilled to have the opportunity to host Hawkins on her Make Abortion Illegal Again campus speaking tour. During the weeks leading up to the event, we faced extreme amounts of hate and pushback. However, we hosted a successful event anyways with more than 400 people in attendance. SFLA posted a blog regarding what I and other members of Tigers for Life faced leading up to the event \u2014 it was rough, to say the least. You can read the full story HERE.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the event, Tigers for Life members spoke to several students leaving the event who shared that their mind had been changed on abortion. We recruited new students to join Tigers for Life and connected with several people in our community who want to partner and help us on our mission.\u00a0\nTigers for Life also hosted several educational meetings for members, tabling, outreach events on campus, and wrapped Christmas gifts for children connected with our local pregnancy resource center.\u202fIt was a joy to create Christmas joy for others.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the end of this semester, we have seen Tigers for Life grow into a coordinated, nationally recognized student organization with many active members who share the same goal: to use our voices to speak up for those whose voices will never be heard. One third of our generation is missing from this world directly because of abortion, and many women have been wounded by the abortion industry as well. For each and every one of these lives, we exist on campus and work to make abortion unthinkable and unavailable.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nToday, society wants nothing more than to trick people into believing that the pro-life movement is just a bunch of old, white men who want to control women\u2019s bodies. To set the record straight, there\u2019s nothing wrong with old, white men, but in reality, we are the face of the pro-life movement. We are equipped and strong students that are passionate about protecting women and their children. We do not stand alone, either.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe stand alongside an entire movement of men and women who are equipped with endless material and financial resources to ensure no woman ever stands alone. We are here. We are ready \u2014 and we will stop at nothing to bring an end to abortion in our lifetime. See you next semester, and stay tuned to hear about how we are cultivating a culture of life in the new year.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: The 2022 Pro-Abortion Dictionary: Crazy Terms, No-No Words & Definition Changes\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 973\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
